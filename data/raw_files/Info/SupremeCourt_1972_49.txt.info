UNION OF INDIA & ORS V. N.K. PRIVATE LIMITED & ANR [1972] INSC 49; AIR 1972 SC 915; 1972 (3) SCR 437 (11 February 1972)

 Article 311 affords reasonable opportunity to defend against threatened punishment to those already in a Government service. Rule 5 provides a method of recruitment or entry into a new service of persons who, even though they may have been serving the Government, had no right to enter the newly constituted' service before going through the procedure prescribed by the Rule. If the petitioner had already been appointed a permanent Government servant, there may have been some justification for 458 contending that Rule 5 could not be so applied as to deprive him of a Permanent Post without complying with Article 311 as such deprivation would have been per se a punishment.
 The mere possibility of misuse of Rule 5 could not involve either its conflict with or attract the application of Art.
 311. The fields ,of operation of Rule 5 and Art. 311 of the Constitution are quite different and distinct so that the two do not collide with each other.
 The learned Counsel for the Appellant then contended that ;each person placed in the category of Departmental candidates by Rule 2 had to be treated alike, but Rule 5 enables the Selection Committee to treat them differently by assigning different grades to them. In other words, the contention was that Rule 5 gives too wide a power of selection to the Selection Committee. It was also submitted, though not quite so clearly, that Rule 5 must itself be so interpreted as to operate automatically and place all persons falling within the definition of Departmental candidate" in a single class if Rule 5 is to be upheld as valid. It was urged that the interpretation placed on Rule 5 by the Division Bench involved not merely its conflict with the definition of a "departmental candidate" in Rule 2(b) but also with Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution, as it meant that those treated equally by Rule 2(b) could be treated unequally by the Selection Committee. This argument rests on a misconstruction of Rule 2(b).
 The definition of a Departmental candidate given by Rule 8 (b) is :
 2 (b) "departmental candidate" means- (i) a person in the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting or any of its attached and subordinate offices who was holding or would have held, but for his absence on deputation, a duty post, on the 1st November, 1957, and who is holding, or has a lien on a duty post in a substantive capacity at the commencement of these rules; or who has been declared quasi-permanent in a duty post, on, or prior to, the 1st July 1957;
 or who was eligible to be declared quasi- permanent in a duty post, on, or on any date prior to, the 1st July 1957; or who was appointed to a duty post on the basis of selection by the Commission or whose appointment thereto was approved by the Commission, before the commencement of these rules;
 459 (ii) any other person in the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting or any of its attached and subordinate offices whom the Government may declare as such on the basis of his qualification and experience";
 It is clear that this definition of a "departmental candidate" is meant only as an aid in interpreting Rule 5 and was not intended to operate as a fetter on the functions and powers of the. Selection Committee. We may add that the validity of Rule 5 does not appear to us to have been assailed in arguments before the High Court. And, in any case, the attack on it must fail on merits.
 Fifthly and lastly, it was urged that the action against the Petitioner was visited by mala fides. We find no such ground taken either in the Writ Petition or argued at any stage in the High Court or mentioned in the grounds of appeal taken in the application for certifying the case as fit for appeal to this Court. It was, however, a ground taken by the Petitioner Appellant in his Rejoinder affidavit in attempting to reply to the affidavit filed in, opposition to the Writ Petition.
 It had been stated in the affidavit filed on behalf of the Union of India that the Appellant's work was not found to be up to the mark even during the period of his probation which had to be extended thrice by two months on each occasion before the probationary period was at last terminated. It had also been pointed out that the Appellant had been given a warning that he should improve his work. Furthermore, it was stated that all the facts of the Appellant's case were carefully examined, from the point of view of his merit, by the Selection Committee. Ile case of the Union of India was that the post actually held by the Appellant before his selection for appointment to the newly constituted service did not automatically or wholly determine the position of a departmental candidate who offered himself to the process of appraisement of his merits by the Selection Committee to be made on the totality of relevant facts. That Committee had to be presided over either by the Chairman or a Member of the Union Public Service Commission and had officials of the Department on it who must have been in a position to correctly evaluate the petitioner's merit and to know the.
 weight to be, attached to such entries as the Appellant's confidential records contained.
 In reply to the case of the Union of India, that the Appel- lant's merits were duly considered by the Selection Committee, the Appellant had characterized what had happened as an 'attempt to create prejudice against the Petitioner and to justify its .RM60 460 mala fide reduction of rank of the Petitioner". He also said that ,this amounted to "raking up the past" which had no relevance to "the admitted case of the Appellant" that he was holding the temporary substantive rank of Editor when he was reduced to the rank of an Assistant Editor. This assertion was incorrect if it implied, as it seemed to, that it was admitted that the petitioner was being punished. The Appellant had also referred to assertions made by him, in his representation dated 5-4-57 (Annexure 'B' to the, Rejoinder) to the Minister of Information land Broadcasting against the termination of his service by notice ,-dated 23- 3-57, and also to those contained in another representation dated 11-3-1960 (Annexure 'E' to the Rejoinder Affidavit) against the impugned order. In these representations, the petitioner had complained that he was a victim of the prejudice and machinations of an Officer in the Transport Ministry (not named by him) whose mistakes, in the publications of the Transport Ministry, had been pointed out by the Appellant. He had also referred to a number of his own publications. Thus, the Appellant's case on mala fides rests on allegations which had been examined by the Department and may also have been considered by the Selection Committee. The petitioner had assumed that there were some malicious reports against him which, according to him, he had no chance to meet and on which he thinks that the recommendations of the Selection Committee about him were based. The reply of the Union of India to this case of mala fides was that it was an after thought and that the assessment of the Selection Committee was based on the results of the interview given to the Appellant and a total assessment of all the facts concerning the Appellant which were before the Selection Committee.
 Even if we were to assume that the Appellant had thus taken up a case of action vitiated by mala fides at its foundations and had Supported it with necessary particulars and averments, it is evident that such a case could not be properly tried upon the materials on the record before us, without even impleading the ,official who was alleged to, be the architect of his misfortunes. it could not, as it has been, argued seriously for the first time before us.
 The fatal weakness in the Appellant's case arises from the fact that he was holding only a temporary post so that he could have no right to continue in it after it had ceased to exist. We think that the necessary effect of setting up of the Central Information Service, together with the determination of its classes and grades and their strengths was that the temporary posts in the Department which were not shown to have been continued, automatically came to an end. The Appellant was offered a new 461 Post altogether after going through the process of selection in accordance with Rule 5 to which he subjected himself.
 Indeed, the Appellant had no option, if he wanted to continue in the service of the Department, except to go through the procedure provided by the rules. We are unable to hold that the procedure contemplated by Rule 5 either automatically fixed the Appellant in any particular grade or post or could be held to be void for any reason whatsoever.
 Therefore, if the Appellant was selected for a particular post, by a process which, for the purposes of the case before us, must be assumed to have been fair, honest, and legal, he cannot complain that he was entitled to a. better one.
 We, therefore, dismiss this appeal. But, in the circumstances of the case, we leave the parties to bear their own costs throughout.
 V.P.S. Appeal dismissed.
