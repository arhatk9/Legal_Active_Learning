CITATION: 1976 AIR 1125 1976 SCR (2) 876 1976 SCC (2) 911 
ACT:
 Mineral Concession Rules (Central) 1960-The Madhya Pradesh Mineral Rules, 1961, made under section 15 of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, (Central Act 67) 1957-Section 3(a) and 3(e)-Power to grant a quarry lease for limestone as a minor mineral under the 1961 Rules or a mining lease for limestone as a minor mineral under the Central Rules 1961 with the State Government- Notifications under section 3(e) of the Act by Central Government, one dated 1-6-1958 declaring "limestone used for lime burning and another" dated 20-9-1961 amending it, substituting the words "limestone used in kilns for manufacture of lime used as building material"-Totality of facts given in the application for a quarry lease describing "limestone for burning purposes" and "minor minerals" decides whether the application is for "major mineral" or "minor minerals"-Treating such an application as "for a major mineral" is wrong when two applications are there, one for "quarry lease" and another for "mining lease" in respect of one and the same area, the grant of lease depends on the quality of limestone available and after considering such applications together.
