ACT:
 National Security Act, 1980-order of detention under section 3(2) of-Challenged.
 % The appellant was in jail on October 10, 1986, as an under-trial prisoner, when an order of detention issued in respect of him by the District Magistrate, respondent No. 2, under section 3(2) of the National Security Act, 1980 was clamped on him, and on the same day, the grounds of detention were served on him. The appellant made a representation against the grounds of detention before the authorities concerned, but the same was rejected and the order of detention, confirmed. He then challenged the order of detention, as illegal and bad by a Habeas Corpus Writ Petition before the High Court on various grounds, including the ground that the grounds of detention were absolutely vague and there was complete non-application of mind by the detaining authority in coming to the subjective satisfaction, and that the order of detention passed on him while he was in custody was wholly arbitrary and unwarranted. The High Court dismissed the Writ Petition, holding that the order of detention passed while the appellant was in jail could not be held to be illegal. The appellant moved this Court by special leave for relief against the judgment and order of the High Court.
 Allowing the Appeal, the Court,
