ACT:
 Motor Vehicles Act, 1939-Scheme No. 50-M reserving notified routes for exclusive operation by the Madhya Pradesh Road Transport Corporation-Certain operators' permits only were curtailed and they were prohibited from operating their stage carriages on a portion of their routes which were overlapping with the notified route leaving 19 others untouched, through oversight-Whether such an action amounts to hostile discrimination.
