ACT:
 Practice and Procedure-Interference by the Supreme Court against interlocutory orders is permissible under Art.
 136 of the Constitution only when ends of justice dominate and if public interest so dictates-Company Law Board inducting additional Directors under s. 408(1) of the Companies Act-High Court cannot stay the orders at the interlocutory stage unless there are good grounds to STRIKE down the order. Benefit of reasonable doubt belongs to the specialised body.
