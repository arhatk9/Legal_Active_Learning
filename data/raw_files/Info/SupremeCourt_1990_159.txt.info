CITATION: 1990 AIR 1340 1990 SCR (2) 638 1990 SCC (3) 338 JT 1990 (2) 186 1990 SCALE (1)788 
ACT:
 Arbitration: Award--Error on the face of the award--Clause in the contract open to two equally plausible interpretations--Legitimate for Arbitrators to accept one or the other of the available interpretations and even if the court may think that the other view is preferable, the court will not and should not interfere.
 Award--Error on the face of award Annexure setting out the award as against various items of claim--Mere fact that statement of claim refers to various items in the schedule to the contract does not result in the contract itself being incorporated in the award--No error can be found in the award.
 Pendente Lite Interest: Power of Arbitrator--Not enti- tled to grant pendente lite interest unless reference is made in the course of a suit--Same powers to grant interest pendente lite as the courts when matter is referred by the Court.
