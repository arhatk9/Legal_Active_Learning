ACT:
 Seniority, inter-se of direct recruits and promotees prior to the merger of PMS I and PMS II as per order 18-12- 68-Validity of the seniority list dt. 31-12-71 pursuant to the order fixing the principles Dt 18-12-71 -Pradeshik Medical Services, 1964-Whether the order is inconsistent with Rule 18 of the U.P. Medical Services Rules 1945.
 In the State of U.P. there were two Medical Services consisting of doctors serving in the State. The senior service was called the Provincial Medical Service (P.M.S.) This service was a gazetted service carrying a higher scale of pay than the other service which was known as P.S.M.S.
 (Provincial Subordinate Medical Service). So far as the P.M.S. was concerned, the incumbents of the posts in the service were appointed by the Governor, whereas in the case of the P.S.M.S., the employees were appointed by the Director, Health Services. On June 14, 1945, the Government of U.P. framed rules known as the "United Province Medical Services (Men's Branch) Rules, 1945" which were applicable to P.M.S. Only. Rule 3(b), (f), and (h) defined "Direct Recruitment", "Member of the Service" and "Subordinate Medical Service", respectively. Rule 5 provided for two modes of recruitment. Rule 12 provided that selection of candidate for direct recruitment shall be made in consultation with the Public Service Commission Rule 13 prescribed the mode of interview. Rule 15 laid down modes of recruitment by promotions. Rule 17 specified the "appointing authority" and the manner in which the vacancies should be filled in. Under Rule 18, seniority in the service shall be determined by the date of order of appointment in a substantive vacancy. Rule 19 required that all persons whether recruited directly or by promotion be placed on probation, while Rule 20 laid down the circumstances under which a person appointed to a post in the Service on probation may be confirmed.
 On 14-3-1946, two Medical Services were constituted, namely (i) Provincial Medical Service Grade I (popularly known as P.M.S. I ) and (ii) Provincial Medical Service Grade II (known as P.M.S. II). It was decided that existing members of PMS II were to be absorbed in PMS I and further recruitment of medical graduates should be made to PMS II in order to replace the PSMS, By an order dated July 24, 1951, the Government laid down that 50 per cent of the vacancies in PMS I were to be filled in by direct recruitment and 51 per cent by promotion. The principle for determination of inter se seniority between direct recruits and the promotees in PMS I was not laid down at the time when the Government order was made. In spite of the quota fixed by the order dated 24-7-1951, no promotion from PMS II to PMS I could be made between the years 1952 to 1963, except on an ad hoc basis. On July 14, 1962 by virtue of an advertisement, the Public Service commission invited applications for recruitments to 56 gazetted posts out of which 9 posts were permanent and the rest were temporary but were likely to continue. In pur- 255 suance of this advertisement, the appellants applied for direct recruitment to PMS I and they were ultimately appointed on a temporary basis some time in June 1963, but before the merger of the two services (PMS I and PMS II) which came into existence on November 1, 1964. This merger was brought about through an order of Government dt. 2-11- 
64. By this order the Pradeshik Medical Service (Men/Women) was constituted which had two grades; namely-ordinary grade which included all the existing posts of PMS I, and PMS II and Selection Grade to consist of 71/2% of the total number of permanent posts in the ordinary grade. By para 2 it was specified that "the permanent and temporary posts in PMS I and PMS II grades shall continue to remain as such on their merger until the temporary posts are made permanent subsequently". By para 4, the Government proposed to issue a further order regarding the fixation of the inter-se seniority while the right to fix inter-se seniority of the members of the two services was reserved, no provision was made in the order which either applies or continues the Rules of 1945 even ,3 in respect of inter-se seniority of members of each merging service. Thereafter another order was passed on 20-2-1965 by which the U.P. Medical Service (Men's Branch) Rules 1945 were made applicable provisionally to the new PMS with the words "unless otherwise ordered".
 Ultimately, a final order laying down the principles on the basis of which the inter-se seniority of the members of the two services was to be determined in the new service was made on 18-12-68. In consonance with the directions contained in this order, the Government fixed the seniority of appellants 1 to 7 and petitioners 1 to 12. The appellants fell within the ambit of direction (b) of the order dt. 18- 12-68 which provided for officers appointed to PMS either on a permanent or temporary basis prior to the merger in a regular manner in consultation with The Lok Sewa Ayog (Public Service Commission) in order of their seniority. By a Notification dated July 3, 1970 issued under Art. 309 of the Constitution, the Governor made certain amendments to Rule 25 of the 1945 Rules, which dealt with promotion to the post of Civil Surgeon. The Government Thereafter directed through its order dt. 18-12-71 certain principles to be followed regarding fixation of seniority. As per this order the Government by its order dt. 31-12-71 fixed the inter-se seniority of the members of the new service, placing the appellants above the petitioners/respondents and awarding to them the selection grade prior to the petitioners.
