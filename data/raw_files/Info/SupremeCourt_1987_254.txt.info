 % The respondent no. 1 was awarded a contract by the petitioner Corporation for construction of staff quarters, which was later rescinded on the ground that he could not complete the work as per the schedule. A Single Judge of the High Court referred the dispute to an arbitrator.

He further found that there was provision in the agreement for extension of time for completion of the contract as well as for levy of compensation for delay, that subsequent to the expiry of the stipulated period of completion the petitioner-Corporation did not make time the essence of contract by directing the claimant to complete the work within a specified period but instead rescinded the contract. He, therefore, held that the decision of rescission of the contract was bad, wrongful, and hence the claim of the respondent for Rs.23,820 was just. He also allowed interest on the sum from the date of rescission of the contract. Certain counter claims of the petitioner- Corporation were also allowed by giving cogent }.1 reasons.

 In the special leave petition to this Court on the question: Whether reasonableness of the reasons in the speaking award was justiciable under Article 136 of the Constitution.
