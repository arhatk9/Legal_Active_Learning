 R 1987 SC 831 (9) 
ACT:
 Representation of the People Act 1951-S. 27 (1)- Recrimination petition-What is the effect of omission to make recrimination petition by returned candidate-In absence of recrimination petition Election Tribunal has no jurisdiction to go into the question whether any wrong votes were counted in favour of election petitioner-Parties must conform strictly to the letter of the law in regard to the procedure laid down under the Act and the Rules.
 Representation of the People Act, 1951-Election petition-Powers of the Election Tribunal (High Court) to decide election petition-Powers are wholly the creature of statute-Election petition is not an action at law or a suit in equity-Election of successful candidate not to be lightly interfered with Purity of election process must be safeguarded. Reliefs as are available according to law can only be granted Representation of People Act 1951-S. 97-A rule of procedure-Must be so construed that it serves wishes of the voters.
 Interpretation of statute-Court must construe procedural provision of law in such a manner that procedure does not defeat purpose or object of law-Where plain and literal interpretation of a statutory provision produces a manifestly absurd and unjust result Court may modify language used or even do some violence to it so as to achieve the obvious intention of the legislature and produce a rational construction and just result.
