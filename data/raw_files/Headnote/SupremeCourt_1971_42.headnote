 The construction of the Hirakud Dam was entrusted by the State of Orissa to the Central Water Irrigation and Navigation Commission as their agent. The Commission for this purpose employed a large number of persons in the worked-charged establishment of scales of, remuneration at the rate paid by the Central Public Works Department. Their service conditions were to be governed by the Central Public Works Department Code of 1929. After completion of the first stage of the Hirakud project the State Government took it over from the aforesaid Commission. The employees of the work charged establishment were given an option to work for the State on the scales of remuneration and the conditions of service in the Code. However, since there was wide disparity between these employees and the work charged employees of the State's own Public Works Department, the services of the former were terminated Such of them who accepted reemployment were employed by the State on the terms and conditions of service of the State Public Works Department. They were given compensation for termination of service and one month's salary in lieu of notice.
 Subsequently they raised a dispute contesting the termination of their services by the State. The Industrial Tribunal held that under paragraph 11 of the Central Public Works Department Code which applied to them at the relevant time the employees were entitled to remain in service till the completion of the Project. The High Court in petitions under Art. 226 and 227 of the Constitution by the State held the termination justified under paragraph It of the Code because it provided inter alia that the members of the work charmed establishment were entitled if dismissed otherwise than for serious misconduct before the completion of the work in which they were engaged, to a month's notice or a month's pay in lieu of notice. Paragraph 11 also provided that the workers could resign after a month's notice or forfeiture of pay in lieu of one month's notice. In appeal by the employees against the High Court's judgment it was contended before this Court that 'dismissal' within the meaning of paragraph 11 was to be understood only as dis- missal for serious misconduct and not dismissal simpliciter.
 Support for this contention was sought from the fact that the word 'dismissal' as used in 'the Government of India Act, 1935, and in Art. 311 of the Constitution as well as the Service. Rules had been interpreted by the Courts to mean only dismissal by way of punishment.
 
HELD : The word 'dismissal' used in the Government of India Act, 1935 as also in Art. 311 of the Constitution and the Service Rules has no doubt been interpreted to mean termination of a person's services by way of punishment.
 But there is clear indication in paragraph 11 of the Code that the word 'dismissal' has not been used to denote the termination of the services of an employee only as and by way of punishment. [654 F] 6 4 7 Having made provisions for the automatic termination of the services of an employee when the work comes to an end it is but natural that provisions should be made to terminate the services of an employee even when the work has not been completed If the employee wants to give up the job then under paragraph 1 1 he has to give a month's notice, tailing which he forfeits a month's pay in lieu or such notice..
 Having provided for the voluntary resignation by an employee even when the work has not been completed., it will be odd to hold that a similar right has not been given to the employer to terminate the services of a workman, even though the work has not finished. It will again be incongruous to hold that when a person is dismissed, though not for a serious misconduct, the workman will be entitled to a month's notice or a month's pay in lieu of notice, if otherwise there can be dismissal for a minor misconduct as and by way of punishment. No decision has laid down that even in case of dismissal a workman will be entitled to a months notice or a month's pay. The fact that paragraph 11 provides for giving a month's notice or a month's pay when a workman is dismissed otherwise than for serious misconduct indicates that the work 'dismissed' has not been used in the sense of termination of service by way of punishment alone but it covers also other cases of termination of the services of an employee even before the completion of the work. [654 H-655 G] The word 'dismissed' according to its dictionary meaning is 'to send away, to discard, to remove from 'Office or employment.......... The dictionary meaning makes it clear that in substance the word means 'termination of service'.
 The High Court was therefore right in holding that the expression 'dismissed' in paragraph 11 of the Code, has been used to take in the, termination of the services of the employees mentioned therein both as a measure of punishment for serious. misconduct as well as termination simpliciter of the services of an employee in which contingency one month's notice or a month's pay in lieu of notice is obli- gatory.[656 B; 658 D] Dr. Bool Chand v.
