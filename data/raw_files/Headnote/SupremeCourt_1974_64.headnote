 The Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970, requires contractors to take out licenses. The Act also imposes certain duties and liabilities on the contractor, in respect of the workmen employed by the contractors. The Contractor is defined as a person who undertakes to produce a given result for the establishment through contract labour or who supplied contract labour for any work of the establishment and includes a sub-contractor. It was contended that the application of the Act is in respect of pending work of construction amounts to unreasonable restriction on the right of the contractors violating article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. It was further contented that the fees prescribed for registration, licences, or renewal of licences amount to a tax and are, therefore, beyond the rule-making powers of the Central and State Government. It was further contended that the provisions of the Act are unconstitutional and unreasonable because of impracticability of implementation. Provisions in regard to canteens, rest rooms, latrines and urinals as contemplated by sections 16 and 17 of the Act read with.
 Central Rules 40 to 56 and rule 25(2) (vi) are incapable of implementation and enormously expensive as to amount to unreasonable restrictions within the meaning of Article 19(1)(g). The provisions contain in Central Rule 25(2)(v)(b) were challenged as unreasonable. Rule 25 (2)(v)(a) provides that wages and other conditions of service of workmen who do same or similar kind of work as the workmen employed directly in the principal employer's establishment shall be the same. In case of disagreement it is provided that the same shall be decided by the Chief Labour Commissioner whose decision shall be final.
 Rule25(2)(b)states that in other cases the wage rates holidays and conditions of service of the workmen of the contractor would be such as may be specified by the Chief Labour Commissioner. There is no provision for appeal.
 It was also contended that the provisions in section 14 with regard to forfeiture of security are unconstitutional. The validity of rule 24 which requires deposit of Rs. 30/- per workmen is challenged as void under Articles 14 and 19(1)(f) both on the ground that the same is arbitrary and also because there is no obligation on the Government to pay to the workmen or to utilise for the workmen any part of the security deposit so forfeited. It was also contended that section 34 of the Act which empowers the Central Government to make any provision not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act for removal of difficulty is unconstitutional on the ground of excessive delegation. The intervener challenged section 28 of the Act conferring power on the Government to appoint Inspectors as conferring arbitrary and unguided power.
 It was also contended that the petitioners were not contractors within the meaning of the Act since the work of the petitioner is not any part of the work of the principal employer nor was the work normally done in the premises of the establishment of the principal employer.
 
HELD : (1) The contention that the application of the Act to the pending work of construction amounts to unreasonable restriction was negatived on the ground that the bill was introduced in 1967 and it was passed in 1970. The subject matter of the legislation is not contract; it is contract labour. There is no unreasonableness in its application to pending contracts. The pendency of contract is not a relevant consideration. There is no retrospective operation. There is no material to show that the petitioner would suffer. The contractors have not shown the contract to show the rates of work. It is also not known whether the petitioners have clauses in the contract to ask for increase of rates in changed circumstances. [671F] (2) The fees prescribedfor registration, licences and renewal of licenses do not amount to a levy of taxes. The Government gives service in regard to the licences and registration. [671H] 666 (3) There is no arbitrary power or excessive delegation of legislative authority in regard to-grant of licences. The Act and the Rules provide ample guidelines as to the grant and the terms and conditions of licence. Section 15 of the Act confers a right of appeal on any person who is aggrieved by any order refusing a licence or if there is a revocation or suspension of a licence. [672A-B] (4) The conditions of contract labour has been engaging the attention of various Committees for a long time. The benefits conferred by the Act and the Rules are social legislative measures. The various measures which are challenged as unreasonable, namely, the provisions for canteens, rest rooms, facilities for supply of drinking water, latrines, urinals, first aid facilities are amenities for the dignity of human labour. The measure is in the interest of the public. There is a rational relation between the impugned Act and the object to be-achieved and the provisions are not in excess of that object. The classification is not arbitrary. There is no violation of Article 14. It is an unproved allegation as to whether it is impracticable to provide a canteen. On the face of it there is no impossibility. Possibility is presumed unless impossibility is proved. It is not an unreasonable provision to require a rest room, if the labourers are required to halt at night at the place of work. [672D-E;
 673A] (5) Rule 25(2)(v)(b) contains an explanation which lays down that while determining the wages and conditions of service the Chief Labour Commissioner shall have regard to wages and conditions of service in similar employments. This is reasonable. It will be question from statute to statute from fact to fact as to whether absence of a provision for appeal makes the statute bad. The Commissioner of Labour has special knowledge. It is not difficult to determine and decide the questions under rule 25(2)(v)(b). Absence of a provision for appeal is not unreasonable in the context of the provisions in this statute. The provisions for forfeiture of security without provisions for spending the amount on workers is constitutionally valid because forfeiture amounts to departmental penalty. The rate of Rs.
 30/- per workman does not offend Article 14. Further, orders for forfeiture are appealable and forfeiture itself is after giving the party reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed. [674A-C; 676A] (6) Section 34 of the Act does not amount to excessive delegation.[676G] (7) The Act was passed to prevent the exploitation of contract labour and also to introduce better conditions of work. The underlying policy of the Act is to abolish contract labour wherever possible and practicable and where it cannot be abolished altogether the policy of the Act is that the working conditions of the contract labour should be so regulated as to ensure payment of wages and provision of essential amenities. Section 10 of the Act deals with abolition while the rest of the Act deals mainly with the regulation. [669G-A] Since the validity of section 28 was challenged by an Intervener and not by the petitioners, the intervener was not permitted to challenge since an intervener cannot raise points which are not canvassed by the Petitioners in the pleadings. [677A] (8) The contention of the petitioners that they are not contractors within the meaning of the Act is unsound.
 Establishment is understood as including the work site. The construction work which the contractor undertakes is the work of the establishment. [669F]
