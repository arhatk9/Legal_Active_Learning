 The appellant was appointed a Munsiff and-promoted as a Subordinate Judge. He was later appointed as Additional District Magistrate (Judicial) and then as a`r Additional District Judge by the Governor of the State. As a result or an enquiry into certain charges he was reduced in rank as Additional District Magistrate (Judicial) by the High Court.
 After such reduction, he did not join duty. A fresh disciplinary proceeding was, therefore, started against him, and after enquiry, the Hi h Court dismissed him. On the same day, the High Court passed another order of dismissal on the ground that he was convicted on a charge of criminal contempt by a judgment of the High Court which was confirmed by this Court. The appeals against the orders of dismissal were dismissal and by the Governor. A writ petition filed by the appellant in the High Court for quashing the orders was dismissed.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, ^ 
 HELD: (1) The control vested in the High Court under Art. 235 over district courts and courts subordinate thereto includes disciplinary control over district Judges and Judges inferior to the post of District Judges. If as a result of any disciplinary proceeding any punishment is to be imposed on any District Judge that has to be in accordance with the conditions of service. The conditions of service in the Civil Service (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules. 1962, framed under Art. 309 provide in r.
 14(4) that the appointing authority alone can impose the penalties specified in cls. (vi) to (ix) of r. 13. Clause (vi) refers to the penalty of reduction in rank and cl. (ix) to dismissal from service. Therefore, under the conditions of service, the High Court cannot reduce in rank or dismiss a District Judge, who has been appointed by the Governor.
 The High Court, within the power and control vested under Art. 235, would hold disciplinary proceedings against the District Judge and recommend the imposition of a punishment of reduction in rank on him. But the actual power of imposition of one of the major punishment, namely reduction in rank, is exercisable only by the Governor who is the appointing authority. In exercising such special powers, the Governor will always have regard to the opinion of the High Court in the matter. Therefore, in the present case, the order passed by the High Court reducing the appellant in rank is unconstitutional. [576E-578C. E-Hl (2)(a) The two orders of dismissal based on the order of reduction in rank cannot have legal effect because the substratum of the orders of dismissal is an unconstitutional order. If the reduction of the appellant is without jurisdiction then the appellant is deemed to continue as a District Judge and the High Court could not dismiss him.[578C-D] (b) There is no question of merger of the orders of the High Court in the orders passed by the Governor. If the order of the initial authority is void an order of the appellate authority cannot make it valid. The confirmation by the Governor in appeal cannot have any legal effect because it is only that which is valid that can be confirmed and not that which is void.
