 The respondent manufactures, as part of iron and steel products, ingot moulds and bottom stools from pig iron for use in steel melting shops. Under item 25 and 26 and the first Schedule to the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944, the respondent paid excise duty leviable on "pig iron and steel ingots" respectively.
 In terms of Rule 8(1) of the Central Excise Rules, 1944, by a notification No. 30/60, the Central Government granted exemption to steel ingots falling under item 26 of the First Schedule if produced out of scraps obtained from duty-paid pig irons. Since unserviceable ingot moulds and bottom stools are also scrapped into pieces and remedied in an admixture with other non-duty paid scraps and hot metal in the manufacture of steel ingots, the respondent claimed a set off of duty to the extent of duty paid on pig iron being the remelted scrap used in the manufacture of steel ingots which was rejected by the Assistant Collector of Central Excise. The appeal before the Collector of Central Excise and the revision before the Ministry of Finance were dismissed, interpreting the Notification No. 30/60 as not applicable when duty-paid pig iron is mixed with other non- duty materials.
 When the orders of the Revenue Authority were challenged in the High Court, the High Court quashed them holding that (i) the Revenue Authorities fell into the error of interpreting Notification No. 30/60 by confining exemption to steel ingots in which "entirely" "exclusively or only" duty-paid pig iron is used since on such words were used in the Notification; and (ii) the Notification would have to be interpreted in a manner that the statute would not cast a burden twice over the payment of tax unless the language of the statute is so compellingly certain to that effect.
 Dismissing the appeal by certificate and negativing the contentions of the appellant that the exemption is given for virgin pig iron and if pig iron was used and thereafter reduced to scrap, there could be no exemption in respect of that scrap being different from pig iron and consequential refund of the duty-paid on pig iron, the Court.

 HELD : (1) The only question is whether duty-paid pig iron is used along with non-duty-paid materials. Pig iron is made out of iron ore plus limestone plus coke. Pig iron is melted and processed into ingot moulds and bottom stools.
 Nothing is added to pig iron. When ingot moulds and bottom stools become unserviceable they are broken. This becomes scrap and is melted and used in the manufacture of steel ingots. All the time it is duty-paid pig iron which is processed into ingot moulds and bottom stools and again broken into scrap and melted in the making of steel ingots.
 [1048 E-F] (2) There cannot be double taxation on the same article. The analogy of the Revenue of the example of excise duty on motor cars, in spite of the fact that there was duty on tyres and duty on metal sheets was misplaced. [1048 G] (3) Notification No. 30/60 granting exemption to duty- paid pig iron does not say that exemption is granted only when duty-paid pig iron is used and that 1045 the exemption would not be available if duty-paid pig iron is mixed with other non-duty-paid materials. [1048 H, 1049 A] (4) The object of the Notification was to grant relief by exempting duty-paid pig iron. If the intention of the Government were to exclude the exemption to duty-paid pig iron when mixed with other materials, then the Notification would have used the expression "only" or "exclusively" or "entirely" in regard to duty-paid pig iron.
