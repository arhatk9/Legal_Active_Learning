 The settlor in the instant case settled upon trust certain immovable properties and lease-hold lands by an indenture dated 15-7-1938. Under that deed the settlor, his wife and their eldest son (the respondent) were appointed trustees.
 Under the terms of the trust deed. the settlor was entitled to the net income of the trust properties during his lifetime. After his death, the income of those properties was to be divided into three equal shares; 1/3rd of the income was to be appropriated by the wife during her lifetime. Out of the remaining 2/3rd, I /3rd was to be paid to the respondent and the remaining I /3rd was to be entrusted to the respondent for being utilised for the maintenance of the two wives and the children of the settlor's youngest son. who had died before the trust deed was executed. On the death of settlor's wife, the trustees were to divide the trust properties into two equal shares of which one share would go to the respondent.
 The settlor's wife died on 6-10-1955. The value of the estate left by her was determined by the Assistant Controller at Rs. 4,15,0001- on the basis that the estate consisted of two items. (a) her individual properties and (b) 1/3rd of the trust properties. He overruled the objection of the respondent, the accountable person to the inclusion of the value of the 1/3rd share in the trust properties in the computation of the value of the estate that "passed" on the death of the wife. On appeal, the Appellate Controller considered the entire trust property as the property that "passed" on the death of deceased and con- sequently enhanced the valuation made by the Assistant Controller. The Tribunal set aside the order of the Appellate Controller and restored that of the Assistant Controller holding that only 1/3rd of the trust estate "passed" on the death of the deceased. At the instance of the appellant, the Tribunal referred to the High Court for its opinion the question as to whether the whole of the trust estate was to be included in the assessment or only a portion thereof and if so what portion. The High Court answered that question in favour of the respondent assessee holding that under s. 5 of the Act only the beneficial interest of the deceased in the trust estate "passed" on her death and the passing of the legal title to the estate from the trustees to the beneficiaries after the. death of the deceased was not a material circumstance.
 On appeal by certificate to this Court, the appellant contended that : (i) the title to the trust properties vested in the trustees till the death of the deceased; (ii) that title "passed" to the beneficiaries immediately the deceased died; (iii) the title that "passed on the death of the deceased was the title in respect of the entire trust property and therefore it must be held that the entire trust property "passed" on the death of the deceased and (iv) hence, the value of the entire trust property should be taken into consideration in computing the value of the estate that massed on the death of the deceased. The respondent contended that : (i) the deceased had only 1/3rd interest in the trust property and that alone passed" on her death : and (ii) the deceased's position as trustee, which came to an end on her death be considered as property passing on her death.
 Dismissing the appeal, 123 
HELD : (i) Ever since the death of the settlor, beneficial interest in 2/3rd of the income of the trust property Vested in persons other than the deceased. The deceased was entitled to only 1/3rd share in the income of the trust pro- perty. In substance, only 1/3rd interest in the trust property passed on her death. It is true that after the death of the deceased, the respondent as well as the other heirs of the settlor who had only a beneficial interest in the income of trust property became the legal owners of the trust property. This change in the nature of the rights possessed by some of the beneficiaries under the trust deed does not enlarge either the extent or value of the property that passed" on the death of the deceased. [127C] (ii) The expression "property passing on death (as found in Ss. 5(1) and, 2(16) of the Act) is not a technical expression. In other words, it is not a term of law. The word "passed" means "changes hands". To ascertain whether property has passed, a comparison must be made between the persons beneficially interested at the moment before the death and the persons so interested after the death. [126E] What is relevant in determining the scope of the expression "property passing on the death of the deceased" is the change in the beneficial interest and not title. In determining whether a particular property "passed" on the death of a deceased what has to be seen is whether that deceased had any beneficial interest in that property and whether that interest "passed" to someone on his death.

 (iii) The deceased's wife had only 1/3rd share in the income of the trust 'property. That interest undoubtedly passed on her death., In the remaining 2/3rd income, she had no interest and the same did not pass on her death. Her title to the property as a trustee was purely a personal right.. It had no value in terms of money. It conferred no right on her. It only imposed some, duties. Such a right cannot be considered as "property". [129E]
