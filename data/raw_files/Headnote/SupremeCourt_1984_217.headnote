 The respondent-landlord through an instrument inter vivos , filed seven petitions for ejectment under section 10 (3) (i) and (iii) of the Tamil Nadu Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act, 1960 (Tamil Nadu Act XVIII of 1960 as amended by Act I of 1980) against seven different tenants. Four out of these occupied shop premises on the ground floor while the other three occupied residential premises on the first floor of a building situated at Door No. 14, Pursuawalkam High Road, Madras. The plea of bona fide personal requirement was accepted by the trial Judge who decreed all the petitioner and passed orders of eviction against every one of the seven tenants. One of these, who occupied a so-called shop measuring 4' x 4' under a stairway, and another tenant in the residential portion on the first floor acquiesced in the decree of eviction passed against them. Five out of the seven tenants filed appeals against the orders of their eviction. The Appellate Authority dismissed all the three appeals of the tenants of the shop premises on the ground floor, but allowed the appeals filed by the two tenants of the residential premises on the first floor. Thus the respondent succeeded in obtaining decrees for possession against all the four tenants on the ground floor and one tenant on the first floor. Against the said orders of the Appellate Court, the appellant alone preferred a Civil Revision Petition (CRP. 122 of 1979) before the High Court. The High Court dismissed the petition. Hence the tenant's appeal by special leave of the Court.
 Allowing the appeal, the Court ^ 
 HELD: 1.1 The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to grant special leave to appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution has to be exercised sparingly. Concurrence of three Courts, as in this case that the respondent has proved that he requires the suit premises bona fide for his personal need, UNDOUBTEDLY has relevance on the question whether the Supreme Court should 103 exercise its jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution to review a particular decision of the Courts below. But, that cannot possibly mean that injustice must be perpetuated because it has been done three times in a case. [105-H] 
 1. 2 In the instant case, by drawing a priori conclusions the Courts have denied justice to the appellant.
 The trial court deluded itself into believing as proved, what remained to be proved by the production of evidence which could have been produced but was not only not produced but was suppressed. The first appellate court decided the question of landlord's bonafide requirement by the application of formula which confuses 'requirement' or 'need' with 'desire'. And, the High Court refused to apply its mind to a question which, if examined, could have altered the course of justice. [106E-F] 
 1. 3 The burden of showing that a concurrent decision of two or more Courts or Tribunals is manifestly unjust Iies on the appellant. But once that a burden is discharged, it is not only the right but the duty of the Supreme Court to remedy the injustice. [IIIA-B] 
 1. 4 The argument that such an interference by the Supreme Court may lead and in practice, does lead to different standards being applied by different courts to find out whether a concurrent decision is patently illegal or unjust is inevitable in the present dispensation.
 Quantatively, the Supreme Court has a vast jurisdiction which extends over matters as far apart as Excise to Elections and Constitution to Crimes. The Court sits in Benches and not en banc, as the American Supreme Court does. Indeed, even if the entire Court were to sit to hear every one of the matters which have been filed during any year a certain amount of individuality in the response to injustice cannot be avoided. It is a well-known fact of constitutional history, even in countries where the whole court sits to hear every case, that the composition of majorities is not static. It changes from subject to subject though, perhaps, not from case to case. Personal responses to injustice are not esotenic. Indeed, they furnish refreshing assurance of close and careful attention which the Judges give to the cases which come before them The litigating public will not prefer a computerised system of administration of justice: only, that the Chancellor's foot must treadwarily. [lO6A-D] 
 1. S In appropriate cases the Court must have regard to events as they present themselves at the time when it is hearing the proceeding before it and mould the relief in the light of those events.[lIIE] Hasmat Rai v. Raghunarh Prasad [1981] INSC 103; [1981] 3 SCR 605 followed OBSERVATlON: [It is quite disparaging to describe a tenant's attempt to resist eviction by lawful means as a "hue and cry". And, it is inequitous in the extreme that any court of law, and least of all a Rent Act tribunal which has to deal with a human problem of great magnitude, should regard it as a matter of no moment that an order of eviction will throw the tenant on the street. A judge does not have to wear a shoe in order to know where it pinches. Therefore, he does not have to face the prospect of being driven to the street in order 104 to realise what it means. His training legal equipment and experience of life are his tools of education and social awareness. This does not mean that a decree of eviction can never be passed against a tenant but, whether the provisions of a law specifically require it or not the court has to have regard for all the aspects of the matter before it and the foreseeable consequences of the order which it proposes to pass].
