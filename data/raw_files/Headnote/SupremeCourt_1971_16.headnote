 The assessee owned a distillery and a refinery. In 1945, it obtained on lease the sugar factory belonging to another company, and during the period from January to April 1946, it purchased about 41,000 shares of the lessor company, and in April 1947, sold the entire block of shares. The transaction resulted in a loss. After setting off the loss against the other income for the assessment year 1948-49, the unabsorbed loss was carried forward under s. 24(2) of the Income-tax Act, 1922, to the assessment year 1949-50.
 But the assessee's claim to set off the loss pertaining to the share business against the profits in the sugar business was negatived by the Department, the Appellate Tribunal and the High Court.
 In appeal to this Court, this Court reframed the question referred to the High Court as 'whether the business of dealing in shares and the business of manufacturing sugar etc. constituted the same business within the meaning of s.
 24(2) of the Act,' and directed the Tribunal to submit a supplementary statement of case. The Tribunal submitted that the two businesses had a single trading and profit and loss account, that they had been dealt with by a common Organisation, that the transaction relating to shares was treated as part and parcel of the business of the assessee company, that a common fund was utilized for both businesses and that they were carried on in the same place of business.
 
HELD : In determining whether two lines of business constitute the ',came business' within the meaning of s.
 24(2), the income-tax authorities must consider the inter- connection, inter-lacing interdependence and unity furnished by the existence of common management, common business Organisation, common administration, common fund and a common place of business. Applying those tests the share transaction as well as the other business of the assessee should be considered as the 'same business.' [380 F-G] C.I.T., Madras v. Prithvi Insurance Co.
