 In 1953, an open piece of land in the city of Bombay belonging to Sir Sapurji Bhairucha Mills Co. Ltd., was purchased by Bharat Insurance Co. Ltd. In 1947, the said piece of land was leased to Allenberry & Co. on a monthly rent of Rs. 1800/-. In 1950, the appellant Company was in- corporated for the specific purpose of taking over the business of Allenberry & Co. In 1954, the appellant Company occupied the said leased land as tenant together with certain vehicles belonging to the said Allenberry & Co. at an agreed rent of Rs. 1800/- per mensem. A document of lease was executed by the parties for ten years. The document was not, however, registered with the result that it could not be tendered in evidence as one creating a lease.
 On January 20, 1960, the Bharat Insurance Co. served a notice upon the appellant Company terminating the tenancy and called upon the Company to hand over quiet and vacant possession of the said land or part of it. Later, a suit was filed in the Court of Small Causes at Bombay, and after nationalisation, the L.I.C. was substituted for that of the Bharat Insurance Co. as the plaintiff in the said suit. It was contended by the appellant that since the tenancy was for manufacturing purposes, one month's notice terminating the tenancy was an invalid notice under s. 106 of the Transfer of Property Act. All the three Courts below, however, concurrently held that the tenancy was not satisfactorily proved to be for manufacturing purposes as alleged by the appellant company and in the absence of any proof as to the terms for which it was made, the notice terminating the tenancy, although it was a month's notice, was a valid notice and on that footing, decreed the suit.
 Two questions were raised before this Court: (1) That the tenancy being for manufacturing purposes, the presumption laid down in S. 106, Transfer of Property Act under which such tenancy has to be regarded as a tenancy from year to year, terminable 'by a six months' notice and not by a month's notice, must apply. (2) The second question was that in any event, the lease was for manufacturing purposes, and therefore, the said notice was not valid. Dismissing the appeal.
 
HELD : (1) The expression "manufacturing purposes" in S. 106 of the Transfer of Property Act is used in its popular and dictionary meaning. The burden of proving that the lease was for manufacturing purposes lie on the appellant company who claim,-, it to be so. That burden is to establish that the exclusive or the dominant purpose of the lease was the manufacturing purpose. [261D] C. Mackertich v. Sturt & Co. Ltd., A.I.R. 1970 S.C. 889, referred to.
 (ii)The word 'manufacturer, according to the dictionary meaning, is the making of articles or material by physical labour or mechanical power. "Manufacture" implies a change, but every change is not manu- 18-L348Sup.Cf./73 258 facture and every change in an article is the result of treatment, labour and manipulation. But something more is necessary and there must be transformation a new and different article must emerge having a distinctive name, character and use. [261F] R. v. Wheeler, 2 R. ALD. 349 referred to.
 (iii)The disputed premises were used mostly for storing the sal vehicles together with spare parts etc., acquired along with them or purchased from the market for repairing and reconditioning and making the said vehicle fit for resale. There is no evidence except the bare word of' one witness that parts such as chassis and bodies etc.. were actually manufacture and replaced for the old. No books of account or log books showing the work carried on the premises or other documents were produced which would throw light on the activities carried on the premises. Even if the evidence of the said witness were accepted, in toto, and it is held that some spare parts were being manufactured for repairing or reconditioning the vehicles, the dominant purpose of the lease would still have to be regarded as one 'for storage and resale ,of the vehicles and not for manufacturing purpose. Manufacturing of spare parts would then be merely incidental to the main purpose of disposal of these vehicles. Therefore, the appellants have failed to establish that the dominant purpose of the lease was manufacturing purpose and therefore, the appellants could not have challenged the legality of the notice. That being the position, it is not necessary to go into the question whether S. 107 has ail impact on S. 106 of the Transfer of Property Act. [265 D]
