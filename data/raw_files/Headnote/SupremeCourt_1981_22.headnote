 The petitioner filed a Special Leave Petition impugning the order of the Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act impugned the order of his detention on the grounds that the materials relied upon in the order of detention were not supplied to him and that two of the documents referred to in the order of detention were not supplied to him because the Secretary of the Department thought that they were not relevant.
 After examining the file and relevant documents the High Court held that failure to supply them did not vitiate the order of detention.
 The petitioner filed a Special Leave Petition impugning the order of the High Court and also a petition under article 32 urging certain additional grounds that the endorsement by the Secretary showed that it was he who decided the relevancy of the documents to be supplied and not the Minister who was the detaining authority and his representation was rejected by the Secretary acting on behalf of the Minister instead of the Minister himself.
 A preliminary objection was raised on behalf of the State that the points not raised in the High Court by the detenu could not be agitated in a writ petition under Article 32 because that is barred by the principle of constructive res judicata.
 Allowing the petition, ^ 
 HELD : The well established position in law is that so far as petitions for habeas corpus are concerned the doctrine of constructive res judicata could not apply.
 Secondly even successive petitions for habeas corpus under article 32 would be maintainable in this Court provided the points raised in the subsequent petitions are additional points not covered or agitated in the previous petitions.
 Thus if the principles of res judicata could not apply to successive writ petitions in this Court, much less could they be attracted to cases where points were not agitated before the High Court but were raised for the first time in this Court in a writ petition under Article 32.

 Ghulam Sarwar v. Union of India & Ors. [1967] 2 S.C.R.
 271, held inapplicable.
 719 The doctrine of finality of judgment or principles of res judicata are founded on the basic principle that where a Court of competent jurisdiction has decided an issue, the same ought not to be allowed to be agitated again and again.
 Such a doctrine would be wholly inapplicable to cases where the two forums have separate and independent jurisdictions.
 [723F] The jurisdiction under Article 226 is a discretionary jurisdiction whereas the jurisdiction to grant relief in a petition under Article 32 is guaranteed by the Constitution.
 Once the Court finds that there has been a violation of Article 22(5) of the Constitution it has no discretion in the matter but is bound to grant the relief to the detenu.
 The doctrine of res judicata or the principles of finality of judgment cannot be allowed to whittle down or override the express constitutional mandate to the Supreme Court enshrined in Article 32 of the Constitution. [723G-H] The concept of liberty has now been widened by Maneka Gandhi's case [1978] 2 S.C.R. 621 where Article 21 as construed by this Court has added new dimensions to the various features and concepts of liberty as enshrined in Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution. [724B] Smt. Santosh Anand v. Union of India & Ors., W.P. No.
 1097/79 (decided on 31-10-1979) referred to.
 It was not open to the High Court to have waded through the confidential file of the Government in order to fish out a point against the detenu. Secondly, the question of relevance was not to be decided by the Court but by the detaining authority which alone had to consider the representation of the detenu on merits and then come to the conclusion whether it should be accepted or rejected. As the reasoning of the High Court was legally erroneous the order of the High Court cannot be allowed to stand. [724D-E] Before the grounds were served on the petitioner, the documents were placed before the detaining authority and were, therefore, referred to in the grounds of detention.
 Manifestly the subjective satisfaction could only be ascertained from or reflected in the grounds of the order of detention passed against the detetnu; otherwise without giving the grounds the mere subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority would make the order of detention incomplete and ineffective. Once the documents are referred to in the grounds of detention it becomes the bounden duty of the detaining authority to supply the same to the detenu as part of the grounds or pari passu the grounds of detention. There is no particular charm in the expressions 'relied on', 'referred to' or 'based on' because ultimately all these expressions signify one thing, namely, that the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority has been arrived at on the documents mentioned in the grounds of detention. The question whether the grounds have been "referred to", "relied on" or "based on" is merely a matter of describing the nature of the grounds. [725A-C] 720 Ram Chandra A. Kamat v. Union of India & Ors. [1980] 2 S.C.C. 271 applied.
 Shri Tushar Thakkar v. Union of India & Ors. [1980] 4 S.C.C. 499 referred to.
 Whether the documents concerned are "referred to", "relied upon" or "taken into consideration", by the detaining authority they have to be supplied to the detenu to make an effective representation immediately on receiving the grounds of detention. [725G-H] In the present case this not having been done the continued detention of the petitioner must be held to be void.
 There was no decision by the detaining authority that the documents were irrelevant. The documents concerned were examined not by the detaining authority but by the Secretary. There is nothing to show that the opinion or endorsement of the Secretary was placed and approved by the detaining authority. [724G] The petitioner's representation had been rejected by an authority which had no jurisdiction at all to consider or pass any orders on the representation of the detenu. This renders the continued detention of the petitioner void.
