 An agreement with regard to a forest was entered into between B the appellant and 0 and A the respondents. Apart from 0 and A another person was also interested in the said forest. The said agreement mentioned other earlier agree- ments entered into with, regard to the said forest. The operative part of the agreement was in these terms:-- Should there be a dispute between the parties in connection with this agreement or in connection with the agreements dated 22.10.1948 and 5.5. 1952 or regarding Khan Babadur Divakar's money or the jungle cutting or export or in 'any other way, the same should be got decided in accordance with the current 'law by appointing arbitrators and through them." Disputes arose between B the appellant and respondents 0 and A. The respondents filed an application under s. 20 of the Arbitration Act for reliefs including accounts and appointment of receiver.
 The application was opposed by B the appellant on the grounds inter alia that as one of the person who bad an interest in the forest was not party to the application there could be no reference to. the arbitration, as the whole dispute, as to the forest would not be before the arbitrator and further, as there were allegations of fraud that was a ground for not referring the dispute to arbitration.
 Held, that where parties entered into an arbitration agreement, knowing fully well that there was another person who was interested, but leaving, him out, then the court should send the parties to the forum chosen by them, even if the other person who might be interested, and whose share was not in dispute, could not be made party before the arbitrator.
 Where the share of a person, not a party before the arbitrator, was not in dispute, there could not be any bar to referring the dispute to arbitration on the ground that the whole dispute was not before the arbitrator. The arbitrator would decide the dispute between the parties before him and 703 give an award leaving out the share of the person who was not a party before him.
 Held, further, that when serious allegations of fraud were made against a party and the party who was charged with fraud desired that the matter should be tried in open court, that would be a sufficient cause for the court not to order an arbitration agreement to be filed and not to make a reference. But it was not every allegation imputing some kind of dishonesty particularly in matters of accounts alleging that they were not correct or certain items were exaggerated or allegations tending to suggest or imply moral dishonesty or moral misconduct in the matter of keeping accounts that would amount to such serious allegations of fraud as would impel a court to refuse to order the arbitration agreement to be filed and refuse to make a reference and to take the matter out of the forum which the parties themselves had chosen.
 In the present case, it cannot be said that the reference desired was piecemeal and split up the cause of action. The dispute raised was covered by the arbitration clause, and there was no such serious allegation of fraud as would be sufficient for the court to say that there was sufficient cause for not referring the dispute to arbitration.
 Obiter. The pleadings in Mufassil courts could not be considered too strictly.
