 The appellants' land within the municipality was acquired for a development scheme of the Improvement Trust. A notification was issued under s. 36 of Punjab Town Improvement Act. 1922. Aggrieved by the award of the Land Acquisition Collector of the Improvement Trust and the decision of the Tribunal constituted under the Improvement Act the appellants challenged the order of the Tribunal in a writ petition, which was dismissed by the High Court.
 On appeal to this Court it was contended (i) that s. 59(a) of the Punjab Town Improvement Act, 1922 was ultra vires Art. 14 of the Constitution and (ii) that the Tribunal took an absolutely wrong principle into consideration in determining the compensation of the lands acquired.
 Dismissing the appeals, 
HELD : (1) (a) Acquisition of land under the Improvement Act admits of a reasonable basis of classification and s. 59(a) is not violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution. There can be no complaint that there is no guideline in he Improvement Act in determining the, compensation since referentially the Principles under the Acquisition Act had been adopted and such other principles ire also added as may be appropriate in the nature of things. The object of the lmprovement Act being improvement of the towns covers a specific, though wide, field. Under' the Improvement Act there is a statutory obligation upon the Trusts to frame appropriate schemes in which case, the matter is likely to take air and the public as well as the land owners may benefit materially from knowledge of acquisition prior to the actual notification under s. 36 as against a preliminary notification under s. 4 of the Land Acquisition Act which appears in the gazette all of a sudden. Although acquisition under the Acquisition Act is also generally for public purpose the character of the acquisition under the Improvement Act is different and the difference has a definite and intimate nexus with the principal object of the Act, namely. improvement of towns. No valid exception can be taken to the adoption of the Acquisition Act with modifications to suit the requirements of the Improvement Act, and in particular, to the deletion of the provisions of appeal under s. 54 of the Acquisition Adt. [1011 C; 1010 E-H] (b) Denial of the right of appeal available under the Acquisition Act does not make s. 59(a) ultra vires Art. 14 of the Constitution. The legislature, by making the order of the Tribunal final under s. 59(d) seeks to avoid delay in the course of litigation to defeat the purpose of the scheme,, framed under the Act. Right of appeal is a creature of the statute and mere denial or taking away of such a right under the law cannot be considered as an infringement of a person's fundamental right. [1011 D] (2)The Tribunal has not adopted any unreasonable principles in ignoring the sales that have taken place after the date of notification under s. 36. The notification under s. 36 being of September 16, 1960. that is the material date which should be reckoned for purposes of determining compensation.
 The sale that takes place after the date of notification under s. 36, as distinct from one under s. 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, cannot be taken as a reasonable guide for determination of compensation under s. 23 of the Acquisition Act as amended by the Improvement Act. [ 1012 B-C] 10 08
