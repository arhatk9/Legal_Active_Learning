 The appellant was convicted and sentenced for an offence under s. 124 of the Bombay Police Act, 1951 for being in possession of 20 brand new wrist watches of Sandoz manufacture. The Presidency Magistrate found that the wrist watches were either stolen property or property fraudulently obtained. On appeal a single Judge of the High Court held that the writ watches were smuggled property and hence fraudulently obtained and confirmed the conviction and sentences. On reference, a Division bench held that if the property in the possession of the accused was capable of being described as 'stolen property or property fraudulently obtained' by whomsoever it might have been stolen or fraudulently obtained,- that would be sufficient to comply with the requirements of the section and that the section did not speak of the accused obtaining possession of the property fraudulently but property "fraudulently obtained." Section 124 of the Bombay Police Act enacts "whoever has in his possession or conveys in any manner, or offers for sale or pawn, anything which there is reason to believe is stolen property or property fraudulently obtained, shall, if he fails to account for such possession or to act to the satisfaction of the Magistrate" be punishable on conviction.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD:(1) When anything is imported into the country clandestinely in violation of import or customs regulations it is fraudulently obtained, that is obtained by committing a fraud on the regulations. Smuggled goods are clearly goods fraudulently obtained. [587F] (2)The plain language of the section stops short at describing the property as 'stolen property' orproperty fraudulently obtained' and does not go on to add the words 'by him. If the property were stolen or fraudulently ob- tained by the accused, that would be a distinct and independent offence under the Indian Penal Code or other laws and it would not be necessary to make it an offence over again under s. 124 of the Bombay Police Act. If the property is capable of being 'described as 'stolen property' or 'property fraudulently obtained' by whomsoever it might have been stolen or fraudulently obtained. that would be sufficient to comply with the requirements of the section.
 It is the possession by the accused of property which bears the attribute or characteristic of 'stolen property' or 'property fraudulently obtained', that is made penal. [587G- 588C] (3)The explanation given by the appellant for his possession of the wrist watches was unsatisfactory and the High Court was right in taking the view that the appellant had failed to account for the possession of wrist watches.
