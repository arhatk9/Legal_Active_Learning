 The appellants paid certain amounts to the government as excise duty and education cess for the years 1951-52 to 1965-66 in one case and from 1951-52 to 1961-62 in the other. The High Court struck down the provisions of the re- levant Acts as unconstitutional. In writ petitions before the High Court claiming refund, the appellants contended that the payments in question were made by then under mistake of law; that the mistake was discovered when the High Court struck down the provisions as unconstitutional and that the petitions were therefore in time. But the High Court dismissed them on the ground of inordinate delay.
 Dismissing the appeals, 
HELD : Where a suit will lie to recover moneys paid under a mistake of law, filim writ petition for refund of tax within the period of limitation would lie. For filing a writ petition to recover the money paid under a mistake of law the starting point of limitation is from the date of which the judgment declaring as void the particular law under which the tax was paid was rendered. Even in cases where it is filed within three years, the court has a discretion.
 have in regard to the facts and circumstances of each case not to entertain the application. [513H; 514A-B] State of Madhya Pradesh v. Bhailal Bhal and Others [1964] INSC 7; [1964] 6 S.C.R. 261 relied on, State of Kerala v. Aluminium Industries Ltd. (1965) 16 S.T.C. 689, referred to and Trilok Chand Motichand and Others v. H. B. Munshi, Commissioner of Sales Tax, Bombay (1970) 25 S.T.C. 289 held inapplicable.
 In the instant case having regard to the conduct of the appellants in not claiming the amounts in the earlier Writ petitions without any justification, there is no justification in interfering with discretion exercised by the High Court in dismissing the writ petitions. The appellants did not pray for refund of the amounts paid by way of cess for the years 1951-52 to 1965-66 and they gave no reasons before the High Court in these petitions why they did not make the prayer for refund of the amounts paid during the years in question. Avoiding multiplicity of unnecessary legal proceedings should be the aim of all courts. The appellants should not be allowed to split up their claim for refund and file writ petitions in a piece- meal fashion. If the appellants could have, but did not, without any legal justification claim refund of the amounts, paid during the years in question in the earlier writ petitions there is no reason why they should be allowed to claim the amounts by filing writ petitions again. [517B-C] In the second batch of appeals the reason why this Court did not go into the question of the validity of the Act was that relevant materials were not placed before the court by the appellant for successfully challenging its validity and they were therefor to blame themselves.
