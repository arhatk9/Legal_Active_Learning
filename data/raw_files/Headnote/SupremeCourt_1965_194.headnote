 In execution of an order to:- restitution of money, the respondent Union of India-applied for attachment and sale of certain immovable ,properties as belonging to the person from whom the. money was claimed. The properties were ordered to be attached, and the appellant claiming ownership of the properties, objected to the attachment under O. 21, r. 58 .of the Civil Procedure Code. 1908. The objection was over-ruled and his application was dismissed. Therefore, he filed ;I Suit tinder O. 21, r. 63 and before filing the suit gave notice to the respondentt under s. 80 of the Code. If s. 80 applied to the suit and the period covered by the notice could be taken into account the suit was within time but if s. 80 did not apply and the period of notice could not be taken into account, the suit would be barred by time.
 -Die trial court and High ,Court answered the question against the appellant and dismissed the suit .its barred by time.
 In appeal to this Court.
 
HELD : The view that suits tinder O. 21, r. 63 did not attract the provisions of s. 80 is inconsistent with the plain, categorical .1nd unambiguous words used by it. [1993 F] The material words used in s, 80 are wide and unambiguous;
 they .,ire "express, explicit and mandatory" and it would be difficult to except front their operation any proceeding which can be regarded as a suit against the government. The proceedings which the aggrieved party ,commences by virtue of O. 21, r. 63 are intended to be a suit. They are commenced by the presentation of a plaint as required by s.
 26 of the Code, and art. 11 of the Limitition Act, 1908, under which the plea of limitation was raised in the present, case, shows that the proceeding was a suit. Such a proceeding under O. 21, r. 63 cannot he regarded as either a continuation of the objection proceedings under r. 58, or as a form of ,in appeal against the order passed in them, because the scope of the suit is different from and wider than that of the investigation under r. 58. In fact, it is the order made in the investigation under O. 21, r. 58 that is the cause of action of the suit under r. 63. The object or main purpose of the notice is to give previous intimation to the government about the nature of the claim which a party wants to make against it. 'But that does not affect the interpretation of the plain words of s. 80 [989 E, G;
