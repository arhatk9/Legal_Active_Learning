 The appellant runs a sweetmeat shop in a village in Punjab.
 The food inspector took a sample of 'Elachi Dana, kept for sale by the appellant and it was found from the report of the Public Analyst that the sample was infested with insects' to the extent of 9.7 per cent and the volatile oil content thereof was 0.5 per cent instead of 1 per cent.
 On these facts, tile appellant was convicted by the Magistrate under s. 16(1)(a)(i) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act 1954. On appeal, the sessions court confirmed the conviction and sentence and the High Court summarily dismissed the appeal therefrom.
 In this Court, the following points were urged : (i) On the date when the Food Inspector took the sample, neither the Act nor the Rules thereunder had prescribed any standard for the purity of 'Elachi Dana' and therefore, deficiency in the volatile oil content could not attract penal consequences.
 (ii) One of the prosecution witnesses admitted in his evidence that the stock of 'Elachi Dana' from which the sample was taken was not insect infested and therefore, it follows that the infestation must have supervened between the date on which the sample was taken and the date of the analysis.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) On the relevant date, Rule A-05-09 of the Rules then in force provided that the seed of 'Badi Elachil shall not contain less than 1 per cent of volatile essential oil.
 The new Rule No. A 05.04.01 prescribes the same requirement with the difference that the article is now described as 'Badi Elachi seeds' 'instead of 'Badi Elachi'. This is a distinction with a difference because the substance of the matter is that 'Badi Elachil (which must include the 'Badi Elachi seeds' Ought to contain 1 per cent volatile oil. The Badi Elachi fruit contains the Elachi seeds. and the kernel has no edible value apart from the seeds contained in the fruit. [702E] (ii) The sample, in the present case was analysed 12 days after it was taken During' this short period of 12 days, the sample could not get infested to the extent of 9.7 per cent.
 To the naked eye the insects may not be noticeable and that was why the prosecution witness inferred that the stock of 'Elachi dana' was not insect-infested. Obviously, what he meant was that it did not appear to be infested with insects and therefore, the inference said to arise from the evidence of the prosecution witness is impossible to accept.
