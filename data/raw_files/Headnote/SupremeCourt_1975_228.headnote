 There was a Bank account in which a huge sum was seen as lying in deposit. The assessing authority proceeded on the footing that the amount represented the Income of one Madan Lal, in whose name the Bank account stood. He contested his ownership and urged that really this sum belonged to his uncle who is the respondent in this appeal.
 His contention was over-ruled by the Income-tax Officer, but, in appeal, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner set aside the order and directed that the Income-tax officer do determine the real ownership of the bank deposit. This order was made in September 1970. The respondent went up in litigation in High Court. He succeeded in the High Court, but there was no investigation into the basic question raised before the High Court by the respondent that the Income-tax Officer had no jurisdiction to start proceedings under Section 148 on the score that he had no 'reasonable belief', which is the sine qua non for the initiation of such proceedings.
 Allowing the appeal by special leave, ^ 
 HELD : Either the uncle or nephew must pay the tax under normal circumstances and they cannot play off one against another to defeat the claims of the Revenue. In as much as the High Court has disposed of this case of certain assumptions and representations, the foundational fact of reasonable belief has not been decided. Therefore, the judgement of the High Court has to be set aside and remanded to the High Court for a fresh hearing on this the foundational fact. But the Income-tax Officer must determine the ownership of the bank deposits within six months. [1015 E-H]
