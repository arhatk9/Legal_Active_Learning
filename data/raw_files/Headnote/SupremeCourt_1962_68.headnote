 The appellant is a lessee from the owner of the land and his lease comprises a large area of land including the land of which the respondent is the tenant. The appellant applied to the Assistant Collector under s. 14A (1) read with s.9 ( 1) of the Punjab Security of Land Tenures Act for the ejectment of the respondent on the ground that the appellant was a land owner and he required the land for his own cultivation. The application was allowed. The respondent thereupon appealed to the Colletor alleging as the main ground that only a landowner could dispossess a tenant-at- will and that since the appellant was not a landowner within the meaning of s. 2 (1) of the Act was not entitled to ask for ejectment under s. 14A (1). the Collector accepted this contention and allowed the appeal. Thereafter the appellant appealed to the Commissioner who allowed the appeal on the ground that a lessee being like a mortgagee with possession was a landowner for all purposes. On revision the Financial Commissioner held that the appellant was not a landowner and therefore not entitled to ejectment. The appellant appealed to this Court by special leave. The only contention that was urged in the appeal was that appellant was a landowner within the meaning of s. 2(1).
 Held, as a lessee the appellant holds land under another person namely the owner of the land from whom he has taken the lease and is liable to pay rent. The appellant therefore being a tenant within s.4 (5) of the Punjab Tenancy Act cannot be a landowner under s.312) of the Punjab Land Revenue Act or a landowner within the meaning of s. 2 (1) of the Punjab Security of Land Tenures Act. Hence he is not entitled to eject the respondent.
