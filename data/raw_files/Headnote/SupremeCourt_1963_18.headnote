 Respondent No. 1 in both the appeals was the proprietor and lambardar of two Mouzas. He executed perpetual pattas in favour of the other respondents. With regard to one of the Mouzas in the subsequent annual papers the Mouza was recorded as occupancy Tenancy Holding of respondents 2 and 4 to 6. Similar recordings were made with regard to t he other Mouza in the names of respondents 2 to 6. Thereafter the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Rights (Estates, Mahals, Alienated Lands) Act, 1950, came into force and under s. 3 of the Act the estate of respondent I was notified. The Deputy Commissioner Land Reforms acting under s. 40 of the Act recognised respondent as the pattadar and settled the assessment payable by him in respect of the first of the Mouzas. Subsequently the Nistar Officer started proceedings for correction of old annual papers with a view to reopen the earlier order made under s. 40.
 Respondent No. 1 raised an objection that he had no jurisdiction to do so which objection was rejected. The appeal filed by the respondent before the Revenue Board was also rejected. With regard to the other Mouza the Nistar Officer made an order that the transfers made by respondent I was bogus and that the landlord was not cultivating the land. The respondents then filed writ petitions in the High Court against the said two orders of the Nistar Officer.
 The High Court held that the Nistar Officer had no power either under s. 15 (3) of the Act or under s. 47 (1) 794 of the Central Provinces Land Revenue Act, 1917. The present appeals are by way of special leave.
 It was contended before this Court that (1) under s. 47 (1) of the Land Revenue Act the Nistar Officer bad jurisdiction to correct entries made for earlier years in a subsequent year on the ground of mistake and (2) the said officer has also jurisdiction to review under s. 15 (3) of the Act the order made by him under s. 40 thereof.
 Held, that neither s. 13 nor s. 15 (3) has any relevance in the context of an order made by the Deputy Commissioner under s. 40 thereof.
 Section 47 (1) of the Central Provinces Land Revenue Act does not cover a case of correction of the entries on the ground of mistake.
 Mangloo v. Board of Revenue, 1. L. R. 1954 Nag. 143, approved.
 Nistar Officer has no jurisdiction to correct the entries with a view to reopen the matter already closed under s. 40 of the Act.
