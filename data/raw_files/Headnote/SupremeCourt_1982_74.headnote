 Detenu Biru Mahato was arrested on January 13, 1982 on the allegation that he was involved in two incidents which occurred, first at 5 p.m. and the second at 5.30 p.m. on January 12, 1982. In the first occurrence detenu and his associates were alleged to have committed offences under sections 341, 323 and 506 of Indian Penal Code, as per the F.I.R. 25(1)/82 at Bagmara Police Station. In the second case, F.I.R. 24(1)/82 registered at the same police station, they were said to have committed offences under sections 307 and 323 I.P.C. After his arrest the detenu was confined in prison. In respect of the first occurrence bail application was accepted, but in respect of the second occurrence the bail application was rejected by the District & Session Judge, Dhanbad on February 5, 1982, on the ground that in exercise of powers conferred by sub section (2) read with sub section (3) of Section 3 of the National Security Act, 1980, the detenu is detained by the order of the District Magistrate so as to prevent him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order and the bail application has become infructuous. On February 10, 1982, grounds of detention were served on the detenu in jail where he was already detained. The grounds of detention referred to the two incidents occurred on January 12, 1982. The detenu made a representation on February 15, 1982 which was rejected by the State Government on February 16, 1982. The case of the detenu was referred to the Advisory Board and after receipt of its report the State Government confirmed the order of detention.
 Detenu preferred a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the High Court at Patna which was dismissed in limine by a Division Bench of the High Court. Hence the appeal by special leave and the writ petition.
 Allowing the appeal and the petition, the Court ^ 
 HELD: 1.1 A preventive action postulates that if preventive step is not taken the person sought to be prevented may indulge into an activity prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. In other words, unless the activity is interdicted by a preventive detention order the activity which is being indulged 585 into is likely to be repeated, This is the postulate of section 3 of the National Security Act. And this indubitably transpires from the language employed in sub section (2) which says that the detention order can be made with a view to preventing the person [sought to be detained from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. If, it is shown that the man sought to be prevented by a preventive order is already effectively prevented, the power under sub section (2) of Section 3, if exercised, would imply that one who is already prevented is sought to be further prevented, which is not the mandate of the section, and would appear tautologous. [588 C-E] 1.2. The detaining authority before exercising the power of preventive detention would take into consideration the past conduct or antecedent history of the person and as a matter of fact it is largely from the prior events showing the tendencies or inclinations of a man that an inference could be drawn whether he is likely even in the future to act in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. If the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority leads to this conclusion it can put an end to the activity by making a preventive detention order. If the man is already detained a detaining authority cannot be said to have subjectively satisfied himself that a preventive detention order need be made. [588 E-H] Ujagar Singh v. State of Punjab; Jagir Singh v. State of Punjab, [1951] INSC 11; [1952] SCR 756; Rameshwar Shaw v. District Magistrate, Burdwan and another[1963] INSC 190; , [1964] 4 SCR 921; referred to.
 1.3. The subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority must comprehend the very fact that the person sought to be detained is in jail or under detention and yet a preventive detention order is a compelling necessity. If the subjective satisfaction is reached without awareness of this very relevant fact, the detention order is likely to be vitiated. But, it will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. [590 B-C] Vijay Kumar v. State of J & K and others[1982] INSC 39; , AIR 1982 SC 1023 applied.
 2.1. Conceding that in a given case a preventive detention order is required to be made even against a person who is already in jail or under detention and that the detaining authority shows its awareness of the fact situation and yet passes the detention order, the detention order must show on the face of it that the detaining authority was aware of the situation. Otherwise the detention order would suffer from vice of non-application of mind.
 [590 H, 591 A-B] 2.2. The awareness must be of the fact that the person against whom the detention order is being made is already under detention or in jail in respect of some offence. This would show that such a person is not a free person to indulge into a prejudicial activity which is required to be prevented by a deten- 586 tion order. And this awareness must find its place either in the detention order or in the affidavit justifying the detention order when challenged. In the absence of it, it would appear that the detaining authority was not even aware of this vital fact and mechanically proceeded to pass the order which would unmistakably indicate that there was no application of mind to the relevant facts and any order of such serious consequence when mechanically passed without application of mind is liable to be set aside as invalid.
 [591 B-D] 2.3. A person may be holder of office of District Magistrate. But when the subjective satisfaction of holder of office who actually passed the detention order is put in issue, the mere occupant of office cannot arrogate to substitute the subjective satisfaction of the holder of the post who actually passed the detention order. The subsequent occupant can speak from the record. But the subsequent holder of office has made an affidavit as if he was subsequently satisfied a fact in connection with record.
 Here, the affidavit of Mr. Brara the subsequent holder of office of Distt. Magistrate has to be ignored and one must reach the conclusion that the averments made by the detenu have remained un-controverted. [592 B-D]
