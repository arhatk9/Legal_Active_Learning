 The respondent was assessed to tax by the Assistant Commissioner of Sales-tax under the C.P. and Berar Sales-tax Act, 1947 on the turnover ,of his business and he paid the tax. After the order of assessment the Board ,of Revenue gave a ruling that dyeing charges were not taxable under the Act. The respondent applied to the Assistant Commissioner, under s. 13 before its amendment in 1953 for refund, on the plea that the amount ,claimed represented dyeing charges included in his turnover. The Assistant Commissioner rejected the application, but the Board of Revenue ordered the case to be returned to the Commissioner for examination of the claim for refund on merits. At the instance of the State, the Board referred to the High Court, the question whether there was any bar to the examination on merits of claims for refund under s. 13 as originally ,enacted. The High Court held that there was no bar.In appeal to this Court, 
HELD:The application for refund of tax was not 'maintainable under the section as originally framed.
 The Assistant Commissioner is, within the limits of his jurisdiction and authority, competent to decide all questions which arise before him; his orders are liable to be set aside in appeal or modified in revision. But under the Act, the Assistant Commissioner-who exercises the powers of the Commissioner-has no power to review his decision, and so long as his order is not set aside or modified,, a dealer cannot call upon him to ignore the previous order and grant refund contrary to the plain direction of his order. [857 C, H] Commissioner of Income-tax v. Tribune Trust L.R. 74 I.A. 306 applied.
