 The appellant was convicted for the offence of murder.
 P.W. 1, brother of the deceased, was the sole eye-witness of the crime and his statement was recorded by the Magistrate under s. 164, Code of Criminal Procedure, during investigation.
 The trial Court found certain discrepancies in the evidence of P.W. 1, regarding the range of shooting and about the second gun shot, but observed that, because he tried to embellish his statement, it could not be said that he was an unreliable witness. The Court accepted his evidence since it found corroboration in the evidence of P.W. 5 who said that he saw the appellant running with a gun about the time of occurrence. P.W. 5 was, however, not mentioned in the First Information Report.
 The High Court, however, took the view that the evidence of P.W. 1 was reliable. It also believed the corroborative evidence of P.W. 5 and upheld the conviction and sentence of the appellant and felt assured by the statements of persons to whom P.W. 1 reported immediately after the occurrence that, in his presence, the accused fired at the deceased.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD : (1). The fact that the statement of the witness (P.W. 1) was recorded by the Magistrate under s. 164, Cr.P.C. is not a ground for rejecting the evidence. There cannot be any hard and fast rule of law for treating a witness as suspect from the mere fact of his statement being recorded under s. 164 Cr.P.C. If the Court finds that the evidence of a witness has been consistent throughout and there was no reason whatsoever for the Police to have taken steps for his statement being recorded under s. 164, Cr.P.C., the fact of such recording would be of no moment in appraising the testimony of such a witness. [343 F-G] (2) However, P.W. 1 cannot be said to be an absolutely reliable witness and both the trial Court and the High Court proceeded on the view that his evidence required corroboration. [344 E] (a) It is not possible to accept evidence of P.W. 5 as corroborating the evidence of P.W. 1. His evidence stands untested by cross-examination on material points, namely, whether he went to the scene of the occurrence and whether he had informed anybody at the place of the occurrence as to his having seen the accused escaping with a gun. The trial Court had committed a serious error in disallowing the defence counsel to cross-examine him on the ground that they were mere omissions not amounting to contradictions. The questions were clearly admissible under s. 162, Cr.P.C. read with s. 145 of the Evidence Act. The High Court failed to notice this aspect while accepting the evidence of P.W. 5.
 [343 A-B] (b) Even the prompt lodging of the First Information Report showing P.W. 1 as an eye-witness and mention of gun fire in the First Information Report Would not be the requisite corroboration needed for the purpose of accepting his testimony. If the witness himself is not absolutely reliable, his repeating name of the accused to several persons, after the occurrence, would not add to the quality of his evidence. [345 B] 340 (c) In the instant case, there is a discrepancy in P.W.
 1's statement, as recorded in the First Information Report, that he was with the deceased at the time of firing, and his evidence in the Court that he saw from the by-lane on the opposite side entirely the accused firing with his gun. This appeared in the view of the site plan, to be a serious discrepancy in the evidence of an only eye-witness which throws grave doubt about his presence at the time of shooting. There is also a contradiction between the evidence of the witness who gave the First Information Report and the statement in the F.I.R. regarding what P.W. 1 told him immediately after the occurrence. Therefore, it is not possible to agree with the High Court that the F.I.R. would also lend assurance to the credibility of P.W. 1. [345 F-G] (3) If P.W. 5 mentioned, at the place of occurrence, that he had seen the accused running away with a gun, omission to mention his name in the F.I.R. could not be dismissed as inconsequential. [343 C] (4) Since, under the Evidence Act, no particular number of witnesses are required for the proof of any fact, it is a sound and well-established rule of law that quality and not quantity of evidence matters. In each ease the Court has also to consider whether it could be reasonably satisfied so as to act even upon the testimony of a single witnes for the purpose of convicting a person. If a witness who is the only witness against the accused to prove a serious charge of murder can modulate his evidence to suit a particular prosecution theory for the purpose of securing a conviction, such a witness cannot be considered as a reliable person and no conviction could be based on his sole testimony.
