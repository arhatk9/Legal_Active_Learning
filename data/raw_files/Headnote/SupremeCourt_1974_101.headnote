 The River Steam Navigation Co. Ltd., used to employ about 9000 workmen. The Company had been incurring heavy losses for several years and, therefore, retrenchment was undertaken on a large scale. Thereafter, a settlement was arrived at on 25-8-1965 between the Company and its workmen, inter alia, providing that there would be no retrenchment for a period of 5 years. Under a scheme of arrangement and compromise sanctioned by the High Court the appellant, Corporation took over the said Company. The Corporation issued fresh letters of appointment in favour of about 5173 out of 9000 employees. The employees who were not taken over by the appellant Corporation moved the State Government and the State Government made a reference on 27th October, 1969 to the Second Labour Court.
 The Corporation. thereupon, challenged this reference by a Writ Petition under Article 226 of the Constitution for setting it aside on the ground that the questions referred to the Labour Court did not fall within the jurisdiction of the Labour Court , under section 33(C)(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act. The learned single Judge, Ghose, J. struck down issue no. 4 as not entertainable by the Labour Court, but as regards the other 3 issues he was of the view that the Labour Court had jurisdiction. The Union did not file an appeal against the order by which issue no. 4 was struck down. But the Corporation went in appeal against the order of the learned Judge in so far as he had held that the Labour Court had jurisdiction to adjudicate upon issues 1, 2 and 3. The Division Bench by its order dated December 14, 1972 dismissed the appeal. it was contended before this Court that the Labour Court had no jurisdiction to adjudicate on the issues referred to it under section 33(C)(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act.
 
HELD : A proceeding under section 3 3 (C) (2) is a proceeding in the nature of an execution proceeding wherein the Labour Court calculates the amount of money due to a workman from his employer or if the workman is entitled to any benefit which is capable of being computed in terms of money the Labour Court proceeds to compute the benefit in terms of money. Since a proceeding under section 33(C)(2) is in the nature of an execution proceeding, it would appear that an investigation of the nature mentioned in the reference in question is outside its scope. The Labour Court cannot arrogate to itself The functions of an Industrial Tribunal which alone is entitled to make an adjudication on a question such as the one referred to the Labour Court. The workers in the present case virtually claimed reemployment or at least some benefits on the basis of their alleged right to be reemployed. The problems raised in the above reference in effect involve a major industrial dispute, investigation into which is quite outside the scope of section 33(C)(2). Only on a detailed examination it would be possible to determine whether the workmen bad any right to a benefit and if so whether the appellant was liable to satisfy the same. The other question which would be necessary to decide is whether the appellant is a successor of the defunct Company. Problems raised are appropriate for determination in an Industrial Dispute on a reference under section 10 of the Act and cannot be regarded as merely incidental to the computation under section 33(C) (2).
