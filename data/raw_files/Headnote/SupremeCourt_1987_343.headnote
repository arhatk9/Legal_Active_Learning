 % The assessee-respondent was sought to be reassessed to sales tax, in respect of supply of cement to the Punjab State Electricity Board in the years 1964-65 and 1965-66 on the basis of the certificates issued by the Board to the effect that it was required for use in the generation or distribution of electrical energy, on the ground of nonuser of the goods for the said purpose. The Tribunal dismissed the appeal of the assessee.
 On a reference the High Court came to the conclusion that the assessee who made sales to the Board on the basis of the certificates was not required to prove further that the cement was actually so used.
 Dismissing the State's appeal by Special leave, ^ 
 HELD: The assessee-respondent is entitled to exemption under s. 5(2)(a)(iv) of the Punjab General Sales Tax Act, 1948. [4G] The mere fact that some of the cement supplied was, in fact used by the Punjab State Electricity Board for activities not directly connected with the generation or distribution of electrical energy, cannot make any difference regarding the availability of the exemption. [4D- E] 2 In order to get exemption it need not be shown that the goods in question were actually used in the generation or distribution of electrical energy. On a plain reading of Cl.
 (a)(iv) of sub-s. (2) of s. 5 of the Act it is clear that the expression "for use" therein must mean "intended for use". If the intention of the legislature was to limit the exemption only to such goods sold as were actually used by the untertaking in the generation and distribution of electrical energy, the phraseology used in the exemption clause would have been different, as, for example, "goods actually used" or "good used". [4H; 5A-B] In the instant case, the certificates issued by the Board clearly showed that the intention of the Board was that the cement should be used for a purpose directly connected with the generation or distribution of electrical energy. There is no material to show that the certificates were false certificates given by the Board, having another use in mind, or that they were fraudulently obtained by the assessee in collusion with the Board.
