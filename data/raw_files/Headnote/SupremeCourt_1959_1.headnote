 On December 13, 1940, in the afternoon, a cargo ship, N, left Madras harbour bound for Calcutta heading for the open sea. She was being navigated in a swept channel outside the 980 harbour our and was on her proper, namely the starboard side of the channel. At that time a patrol ship, K, was on an opposite course making for Madras harbour and entered the channel at about 6-25 p. m. At 6-30 p. m. N decided to overtake K by going port on an erroneous assumption that K was going in the same direction as N and was not an on- coming ship. By about 6-45 P.m. when K sighted N on the port bow the two ships were opposite each other near about the mid-line of the channel, the distance between the two being then a little more than a mile. N continued her port course and went over the mid-line into the wrong side of the channel and at about 6-48 P. m. the distance between the two ships was less than a mile. K noticed at that moment that N was converging on her and accordingly in order to avoid a collision K turned to hard port and gave a signal to that effect. N, however, took starboard action to get back to the right side of the channel and get out of the way of K.
 At about 6-49 P. m. finding that a collision was imminent the commander of N ordered full speed astern, but it was too late and a collision took place at about 6-5I P. m.
 The appellant, the owner of N, instituted a suit for damages against the respondent, who was one of the officers in charge of and responsible for the navigation of K, on the plea that the collision was caused by the negligent navigation of K. The trial judge who had been assisted by nautical advisers, held that K wrongly altered her course at the moment when she did, and if any step had to be taken she should have altered not to port but to starboard, and if any other action was necessary, she should have put her engines full speed astern. On appeal, the High Court, which also had the assistance of two assessors, reversed the findings of the trial court and dismissed the suit. On appeal to the Supreme Court, the appellant contended that K should have anticipated that sooner or later N would correct her mistake and go to the starboard side of the channel and, therefore, as the " standing on" vessel, K should have kept her course and speed as required by Art. 21 Of the Regulations of 1910, made under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, and that if she had done so, there would have been no collision. As in the lower courts, this Court also had the assistance of two assessors.
 Held, that K was justified in taking port action at 6-48 p.
 m. when a collision seemed imminent, in view of Arts. 27 and 29 of the Regulations under which when a vessel finds herself so close to another vessel that a collision cannot be avoided by the action of the "giving way" vessel alone, she must also take such action as will best aid to avert collision.
 Held, further, that it was an act of negligence on the part of N to take hard starboard action, instead of following the provisions of Art. 23, as the " giving way " vessel, by slackening the speed of or reversing N between 6-45 p. m.
 and 6-48 p. m.
 "The Tioga ", (1945) 78 LI. L. Rep. 1 and " The Empire Brent ", (1948) 81 LI. L. Rep. 306, distinguished.
 981 The function of nautical assessors is to advise the court upon nautical matters but the decision of the court rests entirely with the court and even in purely nautical matters the court is I not bound to follow the advice of the assessors, but on questions of nautical science and skill great attention must be paid to the opinion of the assessors since they are the only source of information on these points and some reason must be given for disregarding them.
 The assessors in an appeal court are not substituted for those consulted in the trial court ; they are additional to them; and if one adviser or two advisers are to be preferred, it is because in the judgment of the court the advice given is such as, in itself, is the more acceptable.
 The relevant articles of the Regulations of 1910, made under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, are set out in the judgment.
