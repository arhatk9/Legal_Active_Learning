 On a request from the Executive Engineer of the petitioner Housing Board, the State Government issued a notification under Sections 4(1) and 17(1) of the Land Acqui-sition Act and a declaration under Section 6 of the Act for the acquisition of 2.298 hectares of land in the village mentioned in the Schedule to the Notification under Section 4(1), for the purpose of construction of buildings and shops under self financing scheme.
 The respondent filed a Writ Petition before the High Court challenging the validity of the notification as also the declaration, on various grounds, including that the notification under Section 4(1) of the Act was vague and invalid for non-compliance with the mandatory requirements of the Act and that recourse to the urgency provisions under Section 17(1) of the Act could not be had since the land was not "waste or arable", which was sine qua non for exercising powers under Section 17(1) of the Act.
 Allowing the Writ Petition, the High Court quashed the acquisition proceedings. Hence the appellant, the Madhya Pradesh Housing Board filed Special Leave Petition before this Court. On behalf of the appellant Board, it was contended that since the acquisition of land had been made at the request of the Housing Board of a large extent of land, absence of providing detailed particulars of the land or the locality where it was situate, could not vitiate the notification, more so, when sufficient particulars had been provided in the declaration issued under Section 6(1) of the Act wherein it had also been indicated that the site plan of the land was available in the office of the Collector; that the "public purpose" 658 mentioned in the schedule to the notification issued under Section 4(1) and 17(1) of the Act, as also in the notificaiton issued under Section 6(1) of the Act, was sufficiently clear and the finding of the High Court that the notifications were vague on that account was incorrect and that absence of a finalised housing scheme could not vitiate the acquisition proceedings and that the High Court was in error in holing that recourse could not be had to the urgency provisions under Section 17 of the Act.
 Dismissing the Special Leave Petitions, this Court 
 HELD : 1. The High Court was right in holding that the notification in question was vitated on account of being vague and for non-compliance with the mandatory requirements of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.
 [667C] 2.1. The process of acquisition has to start with a notification issued under Section 4 of the Act, which is mandatory, and even in cases of urgency, the issuance of notification under Section 4 is a condition precedent to the exercise of any further powers under the Act. Any notification which is aimed at depriving a man of his property, issued under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act has to be strictly construed and any serious lapse on the part of the acquiring authority would vitiate the proceedings and cannot be ignored by the courts. [662H;
 663A-B] 2.2. The object of issuing a notification under Section 4 of the Act is two-fold. First, it is a public announcement by the Government and a public notice by the Collector to the effect that the land, as specified therein, is needed or is likely to be needed by the Government for the "public purpose" mentioned therein; and secondly, it authorises the departmental officers or officers of the local authority, as the case may be to do all such acts as are mentioned in Section 4(2) of the Act. The notification has to be published in the locality and particularly persons likely to be affected by the proposal have to be put on notice that such an activity is afoot. The notification is, thus, required to give with sufficient clarity not only the "public purpose" for which the acquisition proceedings are being commenced but also the "locality" where the land is situate with as full a description as possible of the land proposed to be acquired to enable the "interested" persons to know as to which land is being acquired and for what purpose and to take further steps under the Act by filing objections etc., since it is open to such persons to canvass the non- 659 suitability of the land for the alleged "public purpose" also. If a notification under Section 4(1) of the Act is defective and does not comply with the requirements of the Act, it not only vitiates the notification, but also renders all subsequent proceedings connected with the acquisition bad.
 [663B-E] Narendrajit Singh and Anr. v. State of U.P. & Anr., [1969] INSC 329; [1970] 3 SCR 278 and Munshi Singh & Others etc. etc. v.
 Union of India etc. etc.[1972] INSC 179; , [1973] 1 SCR 973, referred to.
 2.3. In the instant case, the description of the land in the notification issued under Section 4(1) and 17(1), is very cryptic. Not only no khasra numbers have been given, even the precise "locality" has not been indicated. Mere mention of the name of the village, which is spread over an area of 25 sq. kms. and is divided into various municipal wards, against the "locality" is wholly insufficient description and the respondent or anyone else could not have come to know from that description whether 2.298 hectares of land which was required for acquistion included the land belonging to him or not. The non-disclosure of the "locality" with precision, invalidates the notification and renders the publication of notice a meaningless formality.
 [664C-D] 2.4. Apart from this, even the "public purpose" which has been mentioned in the schedule to the notification as "residential" is hopelessly vague and conveys no idea about the purpose of acquisition rendering the notification as invalid in law. There is no indication as to what type of residential accommodation was proposed or for whom or any other details. [665C-D] 2.5. The State cannot acquire the land of a citizen for building some residence for another, unless the same is in "public interest" or for the benefit of the "public" or an identifiable section thereof. In the absence of the details about the alleged "public purpose" for which the land was sought to be acquired no one could comprehend as to why the land was being acquired and therefore was prevented from taking any further steps in the matter. [665D-E] 2.6. Besides, there is also non-application of mind by the authorities concerned and rather casual manner in dealing with the property of the citizen vitiating the acquisition proceedings. Whereas the letter of the 660 Executive Engineer of the Housing Board to the Collector had indicated that the Chairman of the Board had found the land suitable for "construction of buildings and shops under the self-financing scheme", the notification issued under Section 4(1) makes no mention thereof and instead declares the public purpose to be `residential. Again in the declaration under Section 6(1) "public purpose" has been stated to be "housing scheme of Housing Board" and not "construction of buildings and shops under the self financing scheme". Admittedly, apart from this letter there was no other material with the State Government and, therefore, it is not understandable on what material, did the State Government state the "public purpose" in different terms in the notifications issued under Sections 4 and 6(1).
 These factors go to expose non-application of mind by the authorities while issuing the notification in question and it appears that they were not even sure about the "public purpose" for which the land was sought to be acquired.
