 The respondent took over the appellant's Undertaking, in May 19591, but as the parties were at variance on the true market value to ',- paid to the appellant, the matter was referred to arbitration. As the arbitrators were unable to agree on the question whether the appellant was entitled to compensation for the 'service lines which were laid with the help of contributions made by consumers, they referred the question to the umpire. The umpire framed an issue and gave a finding that the appellant was not entitled to claim from the respondent the value of the portion of the service lines which were laid at the cost of the consumers, for the sole reason that they were, laid at the cost of the consumers.
 The appellant filed an application under s. 30 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, challenging the validity of the award on the question. The lower court and High Court hold against the appellant.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) The appellant's application for setting aside the award could succeed only if there was an error of law on the face of the award. The other conditions of s. 30 have no bearing on the, case.
 (2)The umpire had made a speaking award and there was no question of the construction of any document incorporated in or appended to the award. If it is transparent from the award that a leggal proposition which forms its basis is erroneous, the award is liable to be set aside.[111 D] Unionof India Y. Bugo Steel Furniture P. Ltd., [1966] INSC 165; [1967] (1) S.C.R. 324, M/S. Allen Berry and Co. P., Ltd. v. The Union of India, [1971] INSC 1; A.I.R. 1971 S.C. 696, followed.
 (3)The conditions of licence, the provisions of the Act namely, ss. 2(f), (1) and (n), 3(f), 7(1) as it stood at the time of taking over, Section 8 of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910, Paragraph VI of, the Schedule to the Act, and the legal position, all point only in one direction that the appellant is entitled to receive compensation for the service lines laid at the cost of the consumers. The umpire, however, in his calculations, had expressly excluded the value of the portion of service lines installed at the cost of consumers. In making the exclusion, the umpire had therefore mis-conducted himself in law rendering his award erroneous on its face. [113G] 108 Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation v. Commissioner of Wealth-tax, West Bengal, 82 I.T.R. 154 referred to.
 (4)The reference to the arbitrations in the present case was on the broad question of the fair market value of the appellant's undertaking, and the parties did not refer any specific question of law for the decision of the arbitrators. Therefore, the decision in Durga Prasad Chamria and Anr. v. Sewkishendas Bhatter, A.I.R. 1949 P.C.
 334 has no application. [115B] (5)The part of the award, which is invalid, being severable from that which is valid, there is no justification for setting aside the entire award. [115D] (6)This Court should itself amend the award instead of remitting it in the interests of justice and to avoid undue delay in a dispute pending since 1959. [115E] (7)The consumers' contribution for laying the service line were made from April 1, 1958 to March 31, 1959. The, taking over of the undertaking by the respondent being in May 1959, the consumers' contribution would roughly represent the market value of the service lines, even if, as required by the first proviso to s. 7(1) as it then stood, due regard was to be had to the nature and condition of the 'works', to the circumstance that they ate in such a Position as to be ready for immediate working, and to their suitability for the purposes of the undertaking. Therefore, the sum representing the consumers' contributions should be taken into account in arriving at the price to be paid to the appellant. [115G],
