 Section 11 of the Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions and Prevention of Unfair Practices Act, 1971 envisages that any Union which has for the whole of the period of six calendar months immediately preceding the calendar month in which it so applies under this section a membership of not less than thirty percent of the total number of employees employed in any undertaking may apply in the prescribed form to the Industrial Court for being registered as a recognised union of such undertaking.
 Section 3(ii) of the Act defines the term "member" Section 19 of the Act obligates that the rules of the Constitution of a union seeking recognition under the Act shall provide for the following matters and the provision thereof shall be duly observed by the Union, namely, (i) the membership subscription shall be not less than fifty paise per month;
 (ii) the Executive Committee shall meet at intervals of not more than three months; (iii) all resolutions passed, whether by the Executive Committee or the General Body of the union, shall be recorded in a Minute Book kept for the purpose; and (iv) an Auditor appointed by the State Government may audit its account at least once in each financial year.
 The appellant union moved an application before the Industrial Court under section 11 of the Act for recognition 1009 Of its union as a recognised union in respect of the first respondent company Bennet, Coleman & Company Ltd. and filed its subscription Receipt Books, Membership Register, Bank Pass Book, Ledger and Minute Book Copy of its Constitution etc. to prove that the persons claimed by the appellant as its members (totalling 67 per cent of the total working force) are in fact its members. In the said application, the appellant impleaded respondent No. 2, the Times of India and Allied Publications Employees Union operating in the Respondent No. 1 company and having some membership amongst the workmen employed therein. The second respondent filed written objections. The Industrial Court felt that it would be impossible for it to receive evidence of approximately 1500 workmen and therefore appointed an Investigating Officer under section 9 of the Act for the purpose of determining the membership of the rival unions. In the meeting held before the Investigating Officer on 16.10.1981, a unanimous decision was taken by all the parties including the representaties of the second Respondent union wherein it was expressly agreed that only one question will be put to all workmen (i.e.) "In the year 1980 you were a member of which union". It was further agreed upon that in case the workman did not know the name of the union, they would be asked the name of the union leader or of the Committee Member of the Union to which they belong. Although the second Respondent had taken a number of pleas both in its preliminary and subsequent written objections it did not raise any such objection before the Investigating Officer and rest content by putting one question to all the workmen as agreed upon between the parties. The respondent union either gave up other objections or waived the same. After taking the evidence, the Investigating Officer accepted the claim of the appellant-union and submitted his report to the Industrial Court on March 12, 1982. The Industrial Court instead of accepting the report of the Investigating Officer permitted the respondent union to raise objections to the grant of the application. The appellant union was refused permission to produce material evidence to meet the objections raised. However, the Industrial Court overruled most of the objections raised, but accepting the three objections, namely, (1) that the Constitution of the appellant union is at variance with the requirement of clause (i) of section 19 inasmuch as the requirement of Section 19(1) 18 that the ruler of the union must provide that the membership subscription shall not be H 1010 less than fifty paise per month. But the Constitution ant the rules of the appellant union does not satisfy this requirement of section 19(1). (2) that a fairly large number of workers alleged to be members of the appellant union were in arrears of the subscription for a period of more than three calendar months during the period of six months immediately preceding such time; and (3) that some of the new members included as the workers of the appellant union had not paid their admission fees, dismissed the application of the appellant-union. Hence the appeal by special leave.
 Allowing the appeal, the Court, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The Court has to adopt a commonsense construction of a labour statute ant in any case where two constructions are possible, the one which is more rational should be accepted. [1019 C] 
 2.1 Rule 3 of the Constitution of the appellant union substantially satisfies the requirement of clause (i) of section 19 of the Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions ant Prevention of Unfair Labour Practices Act, 1971. me Constitution of the union provides for subscription of a sum of Rs. 24 for twelve months or Rs. 12 for six months which works out to Rs.2 per month which is obviously more than fifty paise per month required under clause (i) of section 19 of the Act. [1017 E-F] 
 2.2 Section 19 toes not talk of payment of subscription but talks of only four requirements stated therein. Reading section 3(11) as a whole, it is evident, that while defining "member" it permits the time for payment of subscription to be extended for a period of three months beyond the month in respect of which it becomes due. Therefore, the lumpsum payment of three months will satisfy the requirement of section 3(11) of the Act. [1018 F-G] 
 2.3 me requirement of section 3(11) of the Act is only about the payment of subscription ant not about the admission fee. If there is evidence to show that subscription has been received from the workmen it pre- supposes hat they were the valid members as no subscription will be taken from a workman who is not a member of the union and that also leads to the 1011 conclusion that the workmen were the valid members of the union according to the rules of the union. In view of the provision in Rule 3 of the Constitution itself exempting any worker or workers from payment of admission fee of Re.1 even if admission fee had not been paid it cannot affect the membership of the workman. [1020 D-E; F] 
 3. No new case which was not pleaded can be carved out by a Tribunal, as has been made out in this case. Besides both the parties having entered into an agreement to put only one question to each worker, the other objection having been either given up or waived respondent No.2 would be estopped from raising objections before the Industrial Court.
