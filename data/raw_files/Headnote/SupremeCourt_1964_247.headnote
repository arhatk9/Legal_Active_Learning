 G and his son V belonged to a Hindu undivided family, and as representatives of the family were partners in the assesee- firm holding therein shares of 71 as. and 2 1/2 as.
 respectively. The family thus held through them, an interest of 10 as. in the assessee-firm. On August 24, 1950, there was a partition in the family, and according to the partition-deed the 10 as. interest of the family in the assessee-firm was divided in such a way between seven members that the shares allotted to G and V came to 2 as.
 and 1 anna 4 pies respectively. On November 30, 1950, a new partnership-deed was drawn up by the partners of the assessee-firm and the shares allotted to G and V therein were again 7 1/2 as. and 21 as. respectively. The claim of the assessee-firm for Registration under s. 26-A of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, on the basis of the new deed, for the years 1952-53, 1953-54 and 1954-55 was accepted by the Income-tax authorities. G and V were duly assessed on their respective shares as shown in the partnership deed.
 But they contended that in respect of the first two years they were liable to pay tax only in respect of their respective shares as shown in the partition-deed of their erstwhile undivided family. Their contention was accepted by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal. Whereupon, the Commissioner of Income-tax acting under s. 33B of the afore- said Act cancelled the registration of the partnership for the three years on the ground that the partnership-deed did not show the correct shares of the partners in the partnership. The Tribunal, in appeal, upheld the Commis- sioner's action. At the assessee's instance, a reference was then made to the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad, the questions referred being whether the Commissioner's action under s. 33B was lawful, and if so, whether the firm was registerable under s. 26A for the assessment years in question. The High Court decided both the questions in favour of the assesee and against the Revenue. The Commissioner of Income-tax appealed to this court.
 It was contended on behalf of the Revenue that as the partnership-deed did not specify the correct shares of G and V in that while they were entitled only to 2 as. and 1 anna 4 pies share in accordance, with the partition-deed, they were shown in the partnership-deed as holding 7 1/2 as. and 2 1/2 as. shares respectively, and therefore, the Tribunal had rightly held that the said partnership could not be registered under s. 26A of the Act.
 
HELD : A contract of partnership has no concern with the obligation of the partners to others in respect of their shares of profit in the partnership. It only regulates the rights and liabilities of the partners. A partner may be the karta of a joint Hindu family, he may be a trustee; he may enter into sub-partnership with others; he may under an agreement express or implied, be the representative of a group of persons; he may be a benamidar for another. In all such cases he occupies a dual position. Qua 23 the partnership he functions in his personal capacity; qua the third parties, in his representative capacity. Third parties, whom one of the partner represents, cannot enforce their rights against the other partners nor can the other partners do so against the said third parties. Their right is only to a share in the profits of their partner- representative in accordance with law or in accordance with the terms of the agreement, as the case may be. [26 E-G] The law of partnership and Hindu law functions in different fields. A divided member or some of the divided members of an erstwhile joint family can certainly enter into a partnership with third parties under some arrangement among the members of the divided family. Their shares in the partnership depend on the terms of the partnership; the shares of the members of the divided family in the interest of their representative in the partnership depend upon the terms of the partition deed. [28 D-E] The High Court had given correct answers to the questions propounded. As the partnership-deed was genuine, the shares given to G and V in the said partnership were correct in accordance with the terms of the partnership deed.
