 The appellant was working as Headmaster of a school run by Respondent No. 1, which was a private body. After an enquiry, the management of the school reverted the appellant to the post of Assistant Teacher. Feeling aggrieved, the appellant appealed to the Deputy Director of Education. The Deputy Director, having found that the enquiry had been vitiated on account of violation of principles of natural justice, set aside the order of the management reverting the appellant and remanded the case to the management for a fresh decision. The Deputy Director dismissed the management's application for re-considering his decision on the ground that no such review petition could be filed before him. The management appealed against this order of the Deputy Director. The Director of Education dismissed the appeal. The management filed a petition before the Director to reconsider the case. This time the Director allowed the petition and set aside the order of the Deputy Director remanding the case. The appellant filed a writ petition before the High Court on the ground that the Director had no jurisdiction to review his earlier order. The High Court dismissed the writ petition holding that the teachers working in private schools could not enforce their right under Clause 77 and other connected clauses of the School Code which were not statutory rules. Hence this appeal by special leave.
 Allowing the appeal, 340 ^ 
 HELD: The order of the Director passed on the review petition is set aside and that of the Deputy Director is restored. [342H] The Court is aware of some of the decisions in which it is observed that no teacher could enforce a right under the School Code which is non-statutory in character against the management. But in the instant case, since the appellant was not seeking any relief directly against the management, a private body, but against the order passed in a quasi- judicial proceeding by the Director, an officer of Government who is always amenable to the jurisdiction of the Court, though in a case arising under the School Code and since the Director had assumed a jurisdiction to review his own orders not conferred on him, the appellant was entitled to maintain the petition under Article 226 of the Constitution. [342E-F] On merits it is not disputed that neither the Deputy Director nor the Director of Education had the power to review the order passed by him earlier. The Director had affirmed the order of the Deputy Director by his earlier order. The order passed by the Deputy Director remanding the case to the management for holding a fresh enquiry thus became final. The Director had no power to review his earlier order. [342G-H]
