 The respondents, who were agriculturists, took loans from two insurance companies in 1950 and 1952. In suits for the recovery of the debts, filed by the Life Insurance Corpora- tion after it had taken over the insurance companies, the respondents claimed that the debts should be scaled down in accordance with s. 4(e) of the Madras Agriculturists Relief Act, 1938. Section 4(e) kept certain debts and liabilities of agriculturists out of the reach of the Act, including any debt due to any Corporation formed in pursuance of any "Special Indian Law". The Corporation's contention that the debts would not be affected by s. 4(e) was rejected by the trial court as well as the High Court which held that because of the genesis of the debts, s. 4(e) was attracted.
 On appeal to this Court it was contended that s. 9(1) of the Life Insurance Corporation Act created a legal fiction that contracts to which an insurer was a party shall be deemed to have been entered into or issued in favour of the Corpora- tion and that being so, the debts in question should be taken as due to the Corporation from the be$inning and, therefore, outside s. 4(e) of the 1938-Act.
 Dismissing the appeals, 
 HELD: Section 9(1) of the Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956 does not create any legal fiction. It seeks to provide that the contracts and other instruments subsisting immedi- ately before the vesting may be enforced and acted upon by the Corporation after vesting. Under s. 9(2) any pending proceeding on the appointed day by or against an insurer may be continued by or against the Corporation. Section 7(1) provides that all the assets and liabilities of the insurers relating to their life insurance business vest in the Corpo- ration. Under s. 7(2) the liabilities include obligations of whatever kind existing on the appointed day. The debts due to the insurers in these two cases were liable to be scaled down in accordance with the provisions of the 1938-Act which was a liability or obligation appertaining to the debts on the appointed day, that is, September 1, 1956.
 This liability or obligation annexed to the debts must be held to have been transferred to and vested in the Corpora- tion along with the assets of the insurers under s. 7 and the Corporation in seeking to recover the debts cannot ignore the obligations of the insurers in respect of the transactions.
