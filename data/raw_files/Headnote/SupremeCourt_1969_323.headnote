 In a suit for redemption of a mortgage with possession under a mortgage deed of 1896, the Court declared the amount due on the mortgages. No payment was made under the decree by the mortgagor. Instead, on his death, his representatives applied for relief under s. 30 of the Punjab Relief of Indebtedness Act, 1934 and the Usurious Loans Act, 1918, as amended by the East Punjab Amendment Act, 1948. The applicants were given relief by the High Court and the representatives of the mortgagee appealed to this Court.
 
 HELD : (1) Under the covenants in the mortgage deed, there is a stipulated rate of interest payable by the mortgagor, and the amount recovered from the income was to be first applied towards interest and the balance towards principal.
 It was an anomalous mortgage and not a usufructuary mortgage. The liability of the mortgagor to pay the money due under the mortgage and to pay interest accruing due creates a debt, even if it be assumed that the mortgagee had no right to enforce the mortgage by sale but only had a right of foreclosure. [217 H, 218 C] (2) The obligation is enforceable against the estate of the debtor in the hands of his legal representatives. When it is so sought to be enforced, in the absence of an express provision to the contrary, the representatives may set up the defence which the original debtor could, if he had been sued. There is no warrant, therefore, for the contention that the jurisdiction of 'the court under s. 30 of the Punjab Relief of Indebtedness Act, is attracted only when the original debtor is the applicant and not on the application of his legal representatives. [218 H; 219 Al (3) The legal representatives were not entitled to claim the benefit of the Usurious Loans Act, 1918. Section 2(3) (a) and (b) do not apply to a suit for redemption by the mortgagor and cl. (c) only applies in those cases where the security is given after the commencement of the Usurious Loans Act. [219 G] (4) The legal representatives were entitled to the benefit of the Punjab Relief of Indebtedness Act. The application of s. 30 of the Act does not depend upon the suit being one to which the Usurious Loans Act applies. Even if the suit is not within the definition in s. 2(3) of the Usurious, Loans Act by virtue of s. 30 of the Punjab Relief of Indebtedness Act, the amount received by a creditor in excess of the amount due to him under s. 3 (2) (e) 'of the Usurious Loans Act is liable to be deducted from twice the amount actually advanced. [220 E] 214 (5) Section 30 uses the expression "sum found by the court to have been 'actually advanced.' Such amount is not the amount found by the court to be the amount due on taking account. Therefore, the amount declared by the court as the amount due cannot be deemed to be the amount actually advanced, and under s. 30, the-court cannot declare any amount due under the mortgage which is in excess of twice the. amount actually advanced less any amount received in excess of the amount due to the creditor under s. 3(2)(e) the Usurious Loans Act.
