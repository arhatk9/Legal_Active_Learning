 The respondent firm, was a registered dealer and furnished quarterly returns of its turnover as required by the Rules under the Punjab General Sales Tax Act, 1948. The Assessing Authority was not satisfied with the returns and issued a notice, under s. 11(2) of the Act asking the firm to produce evidence to establish that the returns were full and corn- plete. The notice was served on the firm before the expiry of three years from the respective dates for furnishing the returns. A partner of the firm complied with the notice by appearing and producing its account books. The officer held an enquiry, and passed an order stating that he was assessing the firm to the best of his judgment. The order was passed after the expiry of three years from the dates when the quarterly returns had to be filed. The firm challenged its validity by a writ petition, and the High Court hold that the order fell -Linder s. 11(4) of the Act and that it was barred by limitation.
 In appeal to this Court, HELD : The impugned order could not be said to be under s.
 11(4) ,even though it was stated that the assessment was made to the best of the officer's jud-ment, because, the condition precedent under that subsection is that a registered dealer who has furnished returns should fail to comply with the terms of the notice issued under s. 11(2).
 But assuming it was made under s. 11(4), the order could not be attacked on the ground of its being beyond limitation.
 Under s. 11(4), if a re. gistered dealer having furnished returns in respect of a period, fails to comply with the terms of a notice under s. 11(2), the Assessing Authority shall, within three years after the expiry of such period, proceed to assess, to the best of his judgment, the amount of tax due from the dealer. "Such period"., refers to the period mentioned earlier in the sub-section, that is, in the present case, to the quarters in respect of which the firm had to submit returns. The assessment proceedings commence, in the case of a registered dealer, either when be furnishes a return or when a notice is issued to him under s. 11(2), and would be pending from the time they ,ire initiated until they are terminated by a final order of assessment.
 Therefore, if such proceedings were taken within the prescribed time, though the assessment was made final subse- quently, even after the expiry of the prescribed time, no question of limitation would arise. [14 H; 15 A, F, G; 17 G;
