 MS the owner of properties A, 13 and C created several mortgages over them. The appellant was one of the mort- gagees of properties A and B and MG was one of the mortgagees of property C. Subsequently, the mortgagor sold property B to MG. One of the mortgagees of properties A and B filed a suit for recovery of the money due on the mortgage. MG claimed that the mortgage debt should first be satisfied out of property A not sold to him. This claim to marshalling was allowed. The appellant contended that under s. 56 of the Transfer of Property Act a purchaser who was also a mortgagee marshalling and that marshalling should not have been allowed in the present case as it was bound to prejudice the appellant.
 Held, that MG was entitled to marshalling. When s. 56 refers to a subsequent purchaser it does not exclude a pur- chaser who has a mortgage over some other property of the mortgagor not connected with the proceedings. Further, it could not follow as a matter of law that marshalling must necessarily prejudice a subsequent mortgagee. The question of prejudice is purely one of fact and is intimately connected with the value of the property against which the mortgagee is directed to proceed in the first instance. The appellant was not entitled to the benefit of the last portion of s. 56 as he had not raised any plea as to the value of the property showing that marshalling would prejudice him.
