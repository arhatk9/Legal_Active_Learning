 The election of the respondent was challenged by the appellant on the ground of corrupt practices under sub-ss.
 (3) and (4) of s. 123 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. The respondent was a nominee of the Utkal Congress of which BP was the founder leader. The respondent was also the editor of an Oriya Daily published by the Kalinga Publications whose Chairman was BP. The election symbols of Utkal Congress were Chakra (wheel) and Langala (plough). It was alleged that (i) the respondent had published an editorial in his paper appealing to the religious symbol of Chakra and Langala, the mythological weapons associated with Jagannath and Balram the most worshiped and esteemed deities, of Orissa for the furtherance of the prospects of his election and for prejudicially affecting the election of other candidates;
 (ii) BP in a public meeting appealed to the people invoking the religious symbol in the presence of the respondent with his consent and without any protest by him and that the respondent had published the report of the meeting in his paper and (iii) that the respondent made false statement of facts regarding the personal character and conduct of one of the defeated candidates and that this was published in the respondent's paper or with his consent by his subordinates.
 While conceding that he was the editor of the newspaper the respondent claimed that he was on leave at the relevant time and that he had nothing to do with the writing of the editorial or with the editing of the news reports.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) Though s. 7 of the Press and Registration of Books Act, 1867 raises a presumption that a person whose name is printed in a copy of the newspaper was the editor of every portion of that issue, that presumption might be rebutted by evidence. In order to rebut this presumption the respondent will have to establish that he had nothing to do with the publication of either the editorial or the news report or that any of them was written and/or published without his knowledge or without his, consent. [47-G-H] D. P. Mishra v. Kamal Narain Sharma [1971] 3 S.C.R. 257, held inapplicable.
 It is one of the accepted principles that pleadings must contain and contain only a statement in a summary form of material facts on which the party bases his claim or defence and facts which are merely evidence of material facts, though necessary to be proved at the trial, need not be pleaded; but if it is a material fact it should be pleaded.
 In the instant case the material facts had been stated and any omission to set out in the peadings the evidence that had been led to establish that the respondent was not concerned with the impugned corrupt practice could not be looked at with suspicion. [48H; 49A-B] (ii) Consent or agency could not be inferred from remote causes nor could it be inferred from mere close friendship or other relationship or political affiliation between the respondent and BP. However close the relationship, unless there is evidence to prove that the person publishing or writing the editorial was authorised by the returned candidate or he had undertaken to be responsible for all the publications, no consent could be inferred. Since the publication of the respondent's speech had not been made with his consent, that publication, even 40 assuming its contents had been proved, did not constitute a corrupt practice. [52FG] (iii) If amounts had been collected for any Public purpose, asking the person collecting those amounts of those who were responsible for their collection, to give an account, could not amount to an imputation against their personal character. Men in public life, particularly those who collect monies for public or charitable purposes ought not to be sensitive when there was a demand 'Lo account for those amounts. It might hurt the vanity or the ego of the person from whom accounts were asked, but it is far from being an imputation against the personal character or conduct of the person concerned. Such a demand would refer to the public conduct of the person who was liable to render accounts-and did not amount to corrupt practice. [55H. 56A- B]
