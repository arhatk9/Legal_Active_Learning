 S. the respondent, who died during the pendency of the appeal before the High Court, evolved a formula manufacturing a scent, 'Basant Bahar', which became very popular. S, applied for registration of the Trade Mark, but the application was not granted due to certain technical defects.
 The appellant had also put up for sale a scent prepared by him and save it the name of,'Pushp Raj' Scent.
 This scent,however,did not become popular. So, he started putting up for We his said scent under the name of Basant Bahar in receptacles, similar to those of the Respondent, except the name of the manufacturer.
 The Trial Court convicted the Appellant under s. 482 and s.
 486 I.P.C. and imposed a fine of Rs. 250- on each of the two counts. On appeal, the Addl. Session Judge set aside the said order of conviction and sentence. The complainant filed an appeal in the High Court. Pending the appeal, the complainant died. The High Court however, allowed the appeal on the ground that though in the complaint, the Complainant has used expressions, such as, Trade Mark, counterfeiting his Trade Mark etc, in substance the complainant averred counterfeiting of "property mark" and accordingly set aside the order of acquittal On appeal to this Court, the counsel for the appellant challenged the correctness of the view taken by the High Court.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) The concept of Trade Mark is distinct from that of a property mark., A Trade Mark means a mark used in relation to goods for the purpose of indicating a connection in the course of trade between the goods and some person having the right as proprietor to use that mark. The func- tion of a Trade Mark is to give an indication to the purchaser as to the manufacture or quality of the goods, to give an indication to his eye of the trade source from which the goods come or the trade hands through which they passed on their way to the market. [1055F] In re Powell's Trade Mark (1893) 10 R.P.C. 200, referred to.
 On the other hand, a property mark, 1893 defined by S.479 of the Penal Code, means a mark used for denoting that a moveable property belong to a particular person. Thus, the distinction between a Trade Mark and a property mark is that whereas the former denotes the manufacture or quality of the goods to which it is attached, the latter denotes the owner- ship in them. In other words a Trade Mark concerns the goods themselves, while a property mark concerns the proprietor. A property mark attached to the movable property of a person remains even if part of such property goes out of his hands and ceases to be his. [1055 H] 1051 (In Emperor v. Dhyabhai Chakasha, 1904 6 Bom. L.R., 513 referred to) (ii) To succeed on the charge under s. 482 and s. 486 the complainant had to establish that the appellant marked the scent manufactured and sold by him or the packets and receptacles containing such scent or us do packets or receptacles bearing that mark and that he did so in a manner calculated to cause it to be believed that the goods so marketed or scent contained in the, packets so marked belonged to the complainant. For the purpose of s.486, he had further to establish that the appellant had sold or exposed for sale or had in his possession for sale, goods having a mark calculated to cause it to be believed that the scent, was the scent manufactured by and belonging to the complainant. [1056 F] (iii) In the present case, the name 'Basant Bahar' with the same picture, the same inscriptions, and the same receptacles, was the 'property mark denoting that the scent in question was the one manufactured and belonging to the complainant. From the finding arrived at by the Trial Court, it must follow that the appellant marked his scent aid the packets in which it was packed with the same name, the same picture and the same inscriptions with the intention of causing it to be believed that the scent so marked, or the scent contained in the said packets, was the one manufactured by and sold in the market by the complainant. The appellant thus committed the offence of both using a false property mark and of selling goods marked with a counterfeit property mark. The High Court was Tight in setting aside the order of acquittal passed by the Additional Sessions Judge and in restoring the order of conviction and sentence passed by the Trail Court. [1057]
