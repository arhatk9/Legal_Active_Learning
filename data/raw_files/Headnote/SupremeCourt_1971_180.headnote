 In proceedings held under s. 14 of the Maharashtra Agricultural Lands (Ceiling on Holdings) Act, 1961, the Deputy Collector rejected the appellants' case of partition and determined the surplus land to be surrendered under the Act. He also held that of the 14 members of the family, three of them were born after January 26, 1962, that is, the appointed day under the Act, that appellant M had purchased 11 acres of land separately on March 11, 1960 and therefore they could not be treated as members of the family under s.
 6 for the purpose of the additional 1/6th of the basic ceiling area. On appeal, the Revenue Tribunal accepted the findings of the Deputy Collector. But the Tribunal made a modification in the order of the Deputy Collector in that it held that though the property was acquired in the name of M there was nothing to show that the acquisition was from his separate funds or was to be held by him separately and, hence he could not be excluded from the family for the purpose of s. 6. The Tribunal consequently modified the ceiling area.
 
HELD : (i) The Deputy Collector and the Tribunal have, after an examination of the materials placed before them, arrived at the concurrent finding that the appellants' case of severance of status and partition of the family land was not acceptable. This Court will not be justified in an appeal under Art. 136 in interfering with such a concurrent finding of fact. [54G] (ii) The scheme of the Act is to determine the ceiling of each person including a family with reference to the appointed day. The ceiling area so fixed would not be liable to fluctuations with the subsequent increase or decrease in number of the family members, for there is, apart from the explicit language of ss. 3 and 4 no provision in the Act providing for the redetermination of the ceiling area of a family on variations in the number of its members.
 The argument that variations in the number of the members of a family required a redetermination of the ceiling area would mean an almost perpetual fixation and re-fixation in the ceiling area by the revenue authorities, a state of affairs that could not have been contemplated by the lagislature.

 767/68, dt.
 49 18-4-1968 referred to; view contra in Civil Application No 1578 of 1969 decided on 16-7-1969,(Bombay) held incorrect.
 (iii) Under the proviso to s. 6 for the purpose of increasing the holding of a family in excess of the ceiling area, if a member there of holds any land separately he cannot be regarded as a member of that family for such purpose. The proviso is clear, since there was no evidence that M or the family had treated the lands purchased in the name of M on March 11, 1960 as the separate property of M, the tribunal was right in regarding M as a member of the family and consequently holding that the family would be entitled to an additional 1/6th of the ceiling area so far as M was concerned.
