 Much more than a century ago the appellant's ancestor Malharrao was granted 74 acres and 10 gunthas of lands by the Government, revenue assessment of which was Rs. 557, for founding a village called Malharpura. He was also appointed 'Patel' of the newly founded village and in lieu of remuneration therefor the lands were exempted from land revenue assessment. The annual remuneration for 'patelship' would have been only Rs. 67, but the entire land revenue assessment was treated as the annual remuneration of 'patelship' resulting in Malharrao annually receiving Rs.
 490 more remuneration in the shape of non-payment of land revenue assessment.
 In or about 1901 lands admeasuring 31 acres and 18 gunthas were taken away by the Government from the lands granted to Malharrao, without paying any compensation. The Commissioner (N.D.) was directed to arrange a reasonable settlement for transfer of the lands on such terms as the patel was willing to accept. Proceedings under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 were initiated which resulted in the Government granting certain lands to the 'patel'.
 
 3. The Agricultural Lands Tribunal sent a notice to the appellant's father to show cause why the land held by him should not be sold to the tenants as provided by the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948. The appellant intimated the Collector that the lands held by him were a service inam and the Bombay Hereditary Offices Act 1874 had 2 been applied to them as they were given to him as remuneration for services and, therefore, they were not liable to be proceeded against under the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act.
 
 4. The Collector by his order dated March 21, 1964, directed that plots of land admeasuring 6 acres and 28 gunthas held by the appellant were to be considered as Service Inam land and the remaining plots of lands were to be resumed and entered in the name of the State Government under Rule 4 of Resumption Rules, 1908. The lands which were held to be Service Inam lands were to be dealt with under the Gujarat Patel Watan Abolition Act, 1961, with effect from the April 1, 1963.
 
 5. An appeal was filed against this order of the Collector which was dismissed by the Special Secretary to the State Government. The appellant challenged the orders of the Collector and the Special Secretary under Article 226 of the Constitution, but the petition was dismissed.
 In the appeal to this Court on behalf of the appellant it was contended : (i) that the original grant was not a grant of the soil but of the revenue of the land and, therefore, the land was not liable to be resumed either under the Abolition Act or under the Resumption Rules 1908;
 (ii) that the lands granted by the Government to the appellant's predecessor under s. 32 of the Land Acquisition Act in lieu of the lands acquired could not be the subject- matter of watan and were, therefore not liable to resumption; (iii) that as the Abolition Act came into force on April 1, 1963, the watan rights in the lands stood abolished on and from that day and, therefore, when the Collector passed his order dated March 21, 1964, the land had ceased to be watan lands and no lands were available for resumption and, therefore, no order under the Resumption Rules, 1908, could have been made on March 21, 1964 and (iv) that the proceedings pending before the Collector on April 1, 1963 were not of the nature mentioned in s. 22 of the Abolition Act and, therefore, they were not saved by the provisions of that section.
 Dismissing the appeal, 3 ^ 
 HELD : 1. Two things which are saved by s. 22 of the Gujarat Patel Watans Abolition Act, 1961 are : (i) an obligation or liability already incurred under an incident of a patel watan before the appointed day, that is, April 1, 1963 and (ii) a proceeding or remedy in respect of such obligation or liability. [15 E-F] 
 2. Under Rule 4 of the Resumption Rules 1908, the Collector had the power to determine whether the remuneration for the performance of the service derived from the profits of the enjoyment of patel watan land was unnecessarily high or not and if it was unnecessarily high, to resume the whole or part of such land. [15 G; 16 A] 
 3. The proceedings which were pending before the Collector on April 1, 1963 were in respect of a liability which had already been incurred under an incident of a patel watan prior to April 1, 1963, this liability being that those lands or a part thereof were not liable to be resumed inasmuch as the remuneration received by the patel in respect of the services performed by him was wholly disproportionate to the remuneration actually payable for such services. The proceedings before the Collector thus fell within the express terms of s. 22 and under that section they could be continued after the Abolition Act came into force as if the Abolition Act had not been passed. The Collector was, therefore, entitled in law to continue those proceedings and to pass a final order in such proceedings as he did by his impugned order dated March 21, 1964. [16 D-G] 
 4. The grant made to Malharrao by the Government was a grant of soil and not of the revenue of the land and those lands were, therefore, liable to resumption. [13 D] 
 5. The lands which the appellant's predecessor got in lieu of lands which were acquired by the Government were of the same nature and class as the lands which had been acquired. [14 D] 
 6. Under Rule 1 of the Resumption Rules 1908 the Collector could at any time institute an enquiry into the title by which any land held for service was enjoyed. The jurisdiction of the Collector to determine the title to the 4 lands was invoked by the appellant's father, as a result of which an enquiry was instituted by the Collector and notice thereof was given to him. In the notice it was expressly stated that the hearing would be about the classification of patel lands and the steps to be taken according to Rule 4 of the Resumption Rules, 1908. Even if the statement relating to the steps to be taken according to Rule 4 was inserted later in the notice, the appellant's father and the appellant had full knowledge of it and had enough opportunity to put forward their case with respect to the proposed resumption of their lands.
