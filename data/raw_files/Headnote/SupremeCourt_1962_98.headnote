 The two appellants, who were tried with three others, were convicted under s. 302 read with s. 149 and s. 147 of the Indian Penal Code. Two of these five persons tried together were acquitted. In the charge these five accused persons and none others were mentioned as forming the unlawful assembly and the evidence led in the case was confined to them alone. The facts proved in the case unmistakably showed that the two appellants and the other convicted person, who inflicted the fatal blow, were actuated by the common intention of fatally assulting the deceased. It was contended in this Court that the conviction of the appellants under s. 302 read with s. 149 of the Indian Penal Code was not sustainable in law in view of the acquittal of two of the five accused persons who were alleged to have formed the unlawful assembly.
 Held, that the contention must prevail and the conviction altered to one under s. 302 read with s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code.
 Section 149 of Indian Penal Code prescribes vicarious or constructive criminal liability for members of an unlawful 849 assembly which under s. 141 must consist of five or more persons. Consequently, as soon as, in the present case, two of accused persons were acquitted, s. 141 ceased to apply and s.149 became inoperative.
 In dealing with the applicability of s. 149 of the Indian Sit Penal Code, one has to remember the several' categories of cases that come up before the courts for decision thereunder.
 Dalip Singh v. State of Punjab, [1953] INSC 42; [1954] S.C.R. 145 and Bharwad Mepa Dana v. State of Bombay, [1959] INSC 134; [1960] 2 S.C.R. 172, referred to.
 Kartar Singh v. State of Punjab, [1961] INSC 189; [1962] 2 S.C.R. 395, explained.
 Like s. 149 of the Indian Penal Code, s. 34 of that Code also deals with cases of constructive liability. But the essential constituent of the vicarious criminal liability under s. 34 is the existence of common intention. Being similar in some ways, the two sections may in some cases overlap. Nevertheless, common intention on which s. 34 has its basis is different from the common object of unlawful assembly. Common intention denotes action in concert and necessarily postulates a prearranged plan, a prior meeting of minds and an element of participation in action. The acts may be different and vary in character but they must be actuated by the same common intention, common intention is different from the same intention or similar intention.
 Mahabub Shah v. King Emperor, (1945) L.R. 72 I.A. 148, referred to.
