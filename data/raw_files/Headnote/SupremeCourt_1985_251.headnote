 The petitioner while returning from Nepal was intercepted by the Customs Officers in the morning of 20th November, 1984 and searched in the presence of independent witnesses. From his trousers' pocket two pieces of foreign marked gold in the shape of round tablets weighing 373.800 gms. were recovered and seized under the Customs Act. The petitioner was arrested and on interrogation he filed a written statement admitting the search and the seizure. On an application made by him he was released on bail.
 The second respondent thereafter passed an order dated 11th April 1985 under s. 3 of COFEPOSA Act directing the detention of the petitioner. The representation of the petitioner was rejected by the Central Government. The advisory Board opined that there was sufficient cause for the detention of the petitioner and the Central Government confirmed the detention order directing detention for one year.
 The petitioner challenged the validity of the order of detention before this Court contending: (i) that the order of detention was based on a solitary incident and apart from this incident there were no other incidents showing that he was habitually smuggling gold, (ii) that considerable time had elapsed between the date of recovery of gold pieces and the detention order, and this long lapse of time showed that the detention order was vitiated by malafides, and (iii) that the detention order was made with a view to circumventing or by-passing the criminal prosecution and that the power of detention cannot be used to subvert, supplant or substitute the punitive law.
 844 Dismissing the petition, ^ 
 HELD : 1. Having regard to the nature of the activity and the circumstances in which the petitioner was caught smuggling gold, and the facts set out by him in his written statement, the second respondent was justified in reaching the satisfaction that the petitioner was engaged in smuggling gold and that with a view to preventing him, it was necessary to detain him. [847 E-F] 
 2. Where an unreasonably long period has elapsed between the date of the incident and the date of the order of detention, an inference may legitimately be drawn that there is no nexus between the incident and the order of detention and the order of detention may be liable to be struck down as invalid. But there can be no hard and fast rule as to what is the length of time which should be regarded sufficient to snap the nexus between the incident and the order of detention. [848 A-B] In the instant case, the lapse of time between the date of the incident and the date of order of detention has been sufficiently explained by the detaining authority. No inference of malafides can, therefore, be drawn. [848 B-C] 
 3. The object of making an order of detention is preventive while the object of a criminal prosecution is punitive. Even if a criminal prosecution fails and an order of detention is then made, it would not invalidate the order of detention. If an order of detention is made only in order to bypass a criminal prosecution which may be irksome because of the inconvenience of proving guilt in a Court of law, it would certainly be an abuse of the power of preventive detention and the order of detention would be bad. But if the object of making the order of detention is to prevent the commission in future of activities injurious to the community, it would be a perfectly legitimate exercise of power to make the order of detention. The Court would have to consider all the facts and circumstances of the case in order to determine on which side of the line the order of detention falls. [848 F; 849 B-D] In the instant case, the petitioner was caught in the act of smuggling gold and the circumstances in which the gold was being smuggled as also the facts set out in the written statement of the petitioner clearly indicate that the petitioner was engaged in the activity of smuggling gold. It, therefore, cannot be said that the order of detention was passed by the second 845 respondent with a view to subverting, supplanting or substituting the criminal law of the land. The order of detention was passed plainly and indubitably with a view to preventing the petitioner from continuing the activity of smuggling and it was, therefore, a perfectly valid order of detention.
