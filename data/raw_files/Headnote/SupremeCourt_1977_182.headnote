 The appellants are the registered societies under the Andhra Pradesh Cooperative Societies Act and the area of operation, as provided by the bye-laws, was for the entire taluk with a view to grant arrack licences to them in respect of the arrack shops within the said taluk. To spread the co- operative movement at the village level the trials, in the various villages in the taluk, were also permitted to form their own village co-operative societies and to ask for grant of licences of their village shops in favour of the respective village societies and enter into the liquor trade. After the village societies were registered on 4th October 1975, the Deputy Registrar (Co-operative Societies), gave a notice to the appellants u/s. 16(5) of the Andhra Pradesh Co-operative Societies Act 1964 calling upon them to amend their bye-laws so as to restrict their area of operation only to the taluk headquarters.
 The revision petition filed by the Chintapalli Agency Society against the said orders of Deputy Registrar was allowed by the Registrar on 10-12-1975 directing the District Co-operative Authorities to recommend the case of the appellants for grant of licence for all the shops situated within the taluk for the excise year 1975-76 ending with 30th September 1976. As the licences had already been granted in favour of the village societies, the orders could not be given effect to for the year 1975-76. However, the licence was granted for the year 1976-77 ending with 30th September 1977 in favour of the appellants. The village societies preferred revision petitions under s. 77 of the Act against the orders of the Registrar dated 10-12-1975 before the Government. On the very day. namely, 6-10-1976 when the respondent-village societies filed their revision petitions before the Government, the appellants also filed an application before the Government disputing the claim of the village societies followed by another application dated 28-10-1976. On 5-11-1976, the appellants prayed to the Government for an opportunity to file their counter in the revision petition filed by the respondent-village societies.
 The Government, however, without any notice to the appellants passed final orders on 4-12-1976 allowing the two revision petitions filed by the village societies and set aside the orders of the Registrar dated 10-12-1975. The Government also "requested" the Excise Superintendent, Visakhapatnam, to take action u/s. 32 of the Andhra Pradesh Excise Act 1968 for withdrawal of the licence already granted in favour of the appellants and to issue a fresh licence amending the area of operation restricting it only to Chintapalli village. The writ petitions filed by the appellants were dismissed by a common judgment dated 27th January 1977 by the Andhra Pradesh High Court.
 Allowing the appeals by special leave, the court 
HELD : (1) Section 77(2) of the Andhra Pradesh Co-operative Societies Act 1964 is a mandatory provision. The view of the High Court that this provision can be by-passed by resort to belying into correspondence between the appellant and the Government is not correct; The minimal requirement u/s. 77(2) is a notice informing the opponent about the application and affording him an opportunity to make his representation against whatever has been alleged 564 in his petition. It is true that a personal hearing is not obligatory but the minimal requirement of the principles of natural justice which are ingrained in s. 77(2) is that the party whose rights are going to be affected and against whom some allegations are made and some prejudicial orders are claimed should have a written notice of the proceedings from the authority disclosing the grounds of complaint or other objection preferably by furnishing a copy of the petition on which action is contemplated in order that a proper and effective representation may be made. This minimal requirement can on no account be dispensed with by relying upon the principle of absence of prejudice or imputation of certain knowledge to the party against whom action is sought for.
 In the instant case the impugned order of the Government is invalid being in the teeth of s. 77(2) of the Act and in violation of the principles of natural justice. Even though the appellant may somehow get a copy of the application or the appellant may have, on its own motion, submitted certain representations, the duty of a quasi-judicial authority, as the Government undoubtedly is, in disposing of a matter u/s.
 77, could not be avoided in affording the appellant an opportunity to make representations. This requirement u/s 77(2) cannot be considered as an empty formality and sub- s.(2) of s. 77 has to be complied with by the Government.
 [569 H. 570 A-D] (2) It is not correct that the Registrar could not exercise powers u/s. 77 in examining the correctness, legality or propriety of the proceedings initiated by the Deputy Registrar u/s. 16(5) of the Act and that the Registrar's order in revision is, a nullity. In exercise of the powers conferred by s. 3 of the Act, the Governor of the Andhra Pradesh has conferred, inter alia, powers u/s. 16 on the Deputy Registrar of Co-operative Societies in charge of the Divisions. It was competent for the Deputy Registrar to issue the notice u/s. 16(5) to the appellants. Section 3(1) of the Act provides for the appointment of Registrars and "other persons". Under s. 3(2) "every other person appointed under subs. (1) "shall exercise such powers of the Registrar under the Act as the Government may confer on him under the general superintendence of the Registrar" The Deputy Registrar belongs to the category of "other persons" appointed under sub-s. (1) of s. 3. When, therefore, powers of the Registrar are conferred upon. him he has to act "under the general superintendence of the Registrar" as specifically mentioned in sub-s. (2) of s. 3. Under the scheme of the Act "any other person" appointed under s. 3(1) on whom Government confers powers under s. 3(2) is not equated with the Registrar. The Deputy Registrar is an officer subordinate to the Registrar for all purposes and has to act under the supervision of the Registrar. It is true that the power u/s. 16 is that of the Registrar but the Deputy Registrar exercises that power as empowered by the Government but always "under the general superintendence of the Registrar". Again, under s. 76(2) any order passed in pursuance of the power so exercised u/s. 16 is appealable to the Registrar as order passed by "any other officer" appointed u/s 3(1).

 (3) Any request of the Government to a subordinate authority is tantamount to a positive direction or order and it will be difficult for the subordinate authority to disregard the same. [The court, however, expressed no opinion as to whether Government in exercising revision power u/S. 77 of the Act was competent to issue directions to the Excise Department in the matter of settlement of arrack shops. The court also left open to the Government to notify the policy with regard to the settlement of arrack shops as it may deem fit.] [570 E-G]
