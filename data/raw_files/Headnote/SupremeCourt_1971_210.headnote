 Under ss. 14 and 15 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, groundnut is one of the declared goods' and a State is not empowered to levy purchase tax of more than 3% on the turnover, and further the tax cannot be levied at more than one stage. Under s.. 6 of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1956, the sales or purchases of 'declared good,&' by a dealer shall be liable to tax at the rate, and at the point of sale or purchase specified in the III Schedule to the Act. Item 6 of the III Schedule provides, that with respect to groundnut, the point of levy is, when purchased by a miller other than a decorticating miller in the State, at the point of purchase by such miller, and in all other cases, at the point of purchase by the last dealer who buys in the State.
 The assesseeswere millers but not decorticating millers and they were registered dealersunder the Act. Groundnut was purchased by them not for sale, but waseither used by them entirely for extracting oil or partly for extracting oil and the rest sold to others.
 On the question whether the event that gave rise to tax liability was (a) the purchase by the assessees, or (b) the crushing of the groundnut purchased by the assessees, or (c) the last purchase by a purchaser in the State, the High Court, in revision, held that the purchase tax should be levied when the assessees purchased the groundnut.
 Dismissing the appeals to this Court, 
HELD : (1) Under the sales-tax laws the charge in respect of a sale or purchase becomes effective as soon as the sale in the case of sales-tax and purchase in the case of purchase- tax is made, though, the liability of the dealer is computed only at the end of the year., Hence, the turnover relating to the purchases, in the present case, became charged with the liability to pay tax as soon as those purchases were made by the assesseemillers. That is to say, as soon as a first miller purchased groundnut, the turnover relating to that purchase-any question of exemption apart became liable to tax. [348 H; 349 A-C] (2)This interpretation would not make subsequent purchases by other millersof the same groundnut eligible to tax, because, in view of ss. 14 and 15of the General Sales Tax Act and s. 6 of Andhra Pradesh Act, purchase of groundnut can be taxed only at one stage. Once a particular quantity of groundnut has beer subjected to tax the State's power in respect of those goods is exhausted. [349 D-E] 3 4 7 (3)The language of item 6 of the III Schedule shows that it is only the first purchase that becomes exigible to tax., Therefore, there was no need, for the Legislature to say 'when purchased by the first miller' and the interpretation does not involve the adding of any word into that item. [349 E-F] (4)The event which attracted the tax in the present case is the purchase of groundnut by an assessee and not his act of crushing the groundnut purchased or dealing with the groundnut in any other manner, because, his subsequent dealings in those goods is irrelevant. Hence, it could not be said that the assessees should be taxed only in respect of that part of the turnover which related to groundnut crushed for extracting oil; and that with respect to the remaining part it was the last dealer who purchased it, that should be taxed. [349 G-H] (5)A Division Bench of a High Court is bound by an earlier decision of a co-ordinate Bench of the same High Court. If the Judges felt that the earlier decision should be reconsidered they should have referred the question to a larger Bench and should not have ignored the earlier deci- sion. [350 C-D] M. Madar Khan & Co. v. Assistant Commissioner (Commercial Taxes) Anantpur, 27 S.T.C. 18, overruled.
