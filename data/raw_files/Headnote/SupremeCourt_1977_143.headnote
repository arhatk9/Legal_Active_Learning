 The respondents were the owners of buildings situated in a street known as Fire Lane in the city of Calcutta. The Board of Trustees for the Improvement of Calcutta in exercise of the power conferred under s. 39(c) passed the necessary resolution and proceeded to frame a street scheme for the area which included Fire Lane as also the buildings belonging to the respondents. The notice containing the requisite particulars was published by the Board. The respondents submitted their objections but the Board after hearing the respondents rejected the objections and applied to the State Government for sanction under s. 47.
 Ultimately, the State Government granted sanction under s.
 
48. The Board was of the opinion that as a result of the making of the street scheme, lands of the respondents which were comprised in the street scheme would increase in value.
 The scheme, therefore, contained a declaration that a betterment fee shall be payable by the respondents in respect of the increases in the value of their respective lands. The Board gave a notice of the proposed assessment of the betterment fee under s. 78B(1) and then proceeded under s. (2) of that section to assess the betterment fee payable by the respondent. The respondents dissented from the assessment made on them and the matter was thereupon referred for determination by arbitrators as contemplated under section 78(B)(4), and an award was made. The respondents filed writ petitions challenging the validity of the award made by the arbitrators. Section 39 provides that whenever the Board is of the opinion that for the purpose, inter alia, of creating new or improving existing means of communication and facilities for traffic, it is expedient to lay out new streets or to alter existing street, the Board may pass a resolution to that effect and then proceed to frame a street scheme for such area as it may think fit.
 Section 43 requires the Board to give a notice mentioning where the map of the area and a statement of the land which is proposed to be acquired may be inspected. The said notice is to be published for general public under s. 45.
 Individual notice is to be served on every person whose name appears in Municipal Assessment Book as being primarily liable to pay the owner's share of the consolidated rate.
 Under s. 45(2), a person dissenting from the recovery of betterment fee has to state his reasons. Under s. 47 the Board after hearing all persons making dissent may either abandon the scheme or accept it with such modifications and thereafter submit it to the State Government containing reasons given for the dissent. The Board is required to publish notice of the fact that a particular scheme has been submitted to the Government for its sanction. The State Government may then refuse to sanction the scheme or sanction it with or without any modifications. The principal ground on which the validity of the Award of the Arbitrators was impugned in the writ petitioners was that section 78A to section 78G of the Act were ultra vires and void and that Rules 11 to 21 of the Rules were also invalid.
 The High Court upheld the challenge and struck down section 78B to s. 786 and Rules 11 to 21, as invalid.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD (1) The view taken by the High Court on the validity of section 78A to 78G is clearly erroneous. The High Court thought that the sections suffer from the vice of excessive delegation of legislative power because for determining what land should bear the burden of betterment fee, arbitrary and ,uncontrolled power has been given to the Trust and its Engineers either 137 include or not to include within the scheme lands which are required for the execution thereof. The reasoning of the High Court is clearly based on an erroneous premise.
 Section 39 lays down the factors which would guide the Board in deciding which area should be included in the scheme. It is only when the Board finds that for carrying out any of the four purposes set out in section 39, it is expedient to lay out new street or to alter existing street that the Board can proceed to frame a Scheme. Again the decision of the Board is not final. It is subject to the sanction of the State Government. Even after the scheme is sanctioned by the State Government it is open to the owner of the land to show that in fact the land would not increase in value by reason of the making of the scheme. The Board has to decide objectively whether there is any increase in the value of the land at all and if there is, assess the betterment fee on that basis. If the assessee does not agree with the betterment fees assessed, he is entitled to dissent and to have a hearing. Even thereafter if the owner is not satisfied by the decision of the Board he can have this question determined by a body of two independent arbitrators who would objectively decide the question. Therefore, there is no voice of excessive delegation. [142 C-H, 143 A-D] (2)Rule 11 provides the machinery for appointment of arbitrators in a case where the objectors fail to elect an arbitrator. Rules 12 to 21 lay down the procedure regulating the proceedings of arbitrator. These Rules are clearly covered by clause 3(a) of s. 137. The High Court completely erred in observing that the Rules are ultra vires the Act. [141 C, 142 B]
