 As a result of the Andhra State Act, 1953 a part of the Bellary district of Madras became part of the former State of Mysore, and as a result of the State Re-organisation Act, 1956 a part of the South Kanara district of Madras became part of the Mysore State. Under sections in those two Acts providing for the continuance of laws, s, 11 of the Madras Commercial Crops Market Act, 1933, as it stood before its amendment in 1955 by the Madras Legislature, was in force in the Bellary area of the Mysore State, and the section as amended in 1955, was in force in the South Kanara area.
 Section 11(1), before its amendment in 1955, empowered a 'Market Committee to levy fees, but after amendment, the levy was a cess by way of sales tax in addition to the sales tax levied under the Madras General Sales Tax Act. Even though no notification, as required by the section, was issued by the Government of Madras, the South Kanara Market Committee was levying the cess and continued to do so after the area became a part of Mysore. In order to validate the levy and to enable the Committee to continue the levy, the Madras Commercial Crops (Mysore Amendment and Validation of Levy of Cess) Act was passed by the Mysore Legislature in 1958. By the Mysore Amendment Act, a new section 11(1) was substituted for the s. 11 (1) as in force in the Madras area. This new sub-section also empowered the levy of cess by way of sales tax, in addition to the sales tax under the general sales tax law.
 The respondents were served a notice by the Secretary of the Bellary Market Committee to pay cess on groundnut seeds bought or sold in the notified area of the committee in the Bellary area of Mysore. As the respondents failed to comply with the demands, complaints were filed against them. The respondents filed petitions under Art. 226 of the Constitution challenging the validity of the levy and the High Court quashed the demand on the ground that what was being demanded was payment of sales-tax and since the maximum rate authorised by s. 15 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, read with s. 5(4) of the Mysore Sales Tax Act, 1957, had already been imposed, the Market Committee could not make a further levy.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD: (1) Section 11(1) as substituted by the Mysore Legislature in 1958, did not apply to the Bellary area and was confined only to the 'Madras area', which meant, that part of the South Kanara district which became part of the Mysore State, because, (a) The statement of objects and reasons of the Mysore Amendment shows that the changes in law and the validation provisions were confined only to the levy of a cess by way of sales-tax by the South Kanara Market Committee.
 527 (b) The Mysore Amendment was made applicable only to the 'Madras area' and this area could have reference only to the South Kanara area of the Mysore State, since: (i) By the Mysore Adaptation of Laws Order, 1956, read with s. 7(1) of the States Re-organisation Act, 'Madras area' under the Mysore General Clauses Act, 1899 (applicable to Mysore Act) means, the South Kanara area of the Mysore State; and (ii) it would be stretching language too far to include in the expression, 'Bellary area' what had ceased to be a part of the Madras State in 1953, long before the Mysore Amendment in 1958.
 (c) In s. 154 of the Mysore Agricultural Produce Marketing (Regulation) Act, 1966, it is stated that the Madras Commercial Crops Market Act as in force in the Bellary district, and the same Act as in force in the Madras area was being repealed, showing that the 'Bellary area' was not the same as the 'Madras area' of the Mysore State.
 (d) The Mysore Amendment Act specifies the rates of only two commodities, namely, arecanut and coconut in the 'Madras area' and these two commodities figure as the principal commercial crops in the bye laws of the South Kanara Market Committee, whereas they are not included as commercial crops in the bye laws of the Bellary Market Committee at all.
 [532A-533D] (2) If the Mysore Amendment Act, 1958, did not apply to the Bellary area, s. 11(1) of the Madras Commercial Crops Markets Act as it originally stood before its amendment in 1955 by the Madras Legislature was applicable. and under that provision only a fee and not tax could be levied.
 Therefore, even though the demand in the present case employed the word `cess', it referred only to a 'fee', and not to tax. [533E] [The matter was remitted to the High Court for determining the validity and legality of the levy as 'fee' in relation to the services rendered.]
