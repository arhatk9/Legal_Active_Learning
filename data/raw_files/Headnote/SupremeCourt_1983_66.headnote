 The respondents in these appeals had filed certain writ petitions challenging the levy and demand of non- agricultural assessment made by the appellants, on the ground, among others, that the above rules conferred unguided and uncontrolled power and there was excessive delegation of legislative functions and therefore the rules were violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution. The High Court accepted the contention and quashed the demand of assessment.

 HELD: Delegation of some part of legislative power becomes a compulsive necessity for viability and functioning of the various institutions created by the Constitution. The legislature can delegate details to be worked out by the delegate and the details may be numerous and significant yet they may well be made over to the appropriate agency. The guideline need not be found in the impugned provision. The same may be collected from the setting in which the provision is placed, the purpose for which the Act is enacted and even the preamble of the statute in which the provision is incorporated. The object sought to be achieved by legislation or statute can furnish reliable guideline for the exercise of discretionary power.

 The basic purpose for which a Land Revenue Act is enacted is for empowering the State and its agencies and its officials to assess and levy land revenue. The land revenue is a tax and the validity of a taxing statute has to be determined keeping in view the fact that in the matter of taxation the Court allows wide area of picking and choosing and the slab system. [105 A, G-H] In the instant case r. 71 is made in exercise of the rule making power conferred by s. 172 of the Hyderabad Land Revenue Act. This rule making power is to be exercised for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the Act.
 Whenever land is diverted to use other than agricultural, power is conferred to levy non-agricultural assessment or special assessment but this assessment is to be determined under the amended r. 71, keeping in view the purpose of the Act, namely, levying and collection of revenue, the use to which the land is put, the profit derived from such deviated use of the and again correlated to population as set out in various sub-clauses of amended r. 71 and within floor and ceiling prescribed in the impugned rule. The High Court fell into an error in holding that rule 71 allowed a wide margin to the revenue officers in the matter of determining the special assessment to be levied on land used for non- agricultural purposes. The High Court failed to notice that area within which the discretion of the revenue officer can operate is circumscribed both by the floor and ceiling fixed and while determining the quantum of assessment, the revenue officer has to bear in mind the use to which land is put as also the profit derived from the use of the of land. The order made by the revenue officer is appealable. When a demand is raised, it can always be controverted under the various provisions of the relevant rules and the concerned assessee will have full opportunity to vindicate his stand.
 [104 H; 105 A-B; E-G] There is no excessive delegation of legislative functions in the Hyderabad Land Revenue Act. Section 50 of the Act clearly confers power on the State Legislature to levy assessment and when the land is diverted to a use other than agriculture, the legislature conferred to power to levy non-agricultural assessment. Elaborate provision has been made for levying assessment. Section 172 conferred power to enact rules for giving effect to the provision of the Act and the guideline was provided as herein above indicated.
