 The petitioner owned premises which were in the occupation of a tenant. The tenant vacated the premises and delivered possession to the petitioner who moved into actual occupation and informed the authorities. Thereafter, the District Magistrate passed an order of requisition of these premises, without any enquiry as to whether the petitioner had any other alternative accommodation, and the petitioner challenged the order.
 Allowing the petition, 
HELD : (1) The petitioner was in actual residence of the requisitioned premises and his occupation was not unlawful.
 Section 7 of the Act does not, contain any impediment or bar to the landlord taking possession of the premises after the tenant has vacated. [408 EG] (2) The second proviso to s. 3 of the Act, therefore, applies, and under that proviso, the District Magistrate had to form an opinion that alternative accommodation for the person in occupation existed. Alternative accommodation will have to be alternative to the accommodation of which the person was in actual occupation. The existence of an alternative accommodation is a matter of fact and the opinion is to be formed on certain facts. That is, the District Magistrate had to hold an inquiry to ascertain the facts in order to arrive at the opinion that there existed alternative accommodation. It will not be correct to say that with-out holding such an inquiry or giving an opportunity to the person in occupation the District Magistrate can ascertain as to whether such alternative accommodation exists.
