 The Bihar Motor Spirit and High Speed Diesel Oil Dealers' Licensing Order, 1966 required that the names and addresses of the purchasers must be mentioned in the cash memos; but by a subsequent order issued by the State Government this requirement was dispensed with. On receipt of complaints that the petitioner was indulging in certain malpractices, including charging a price higher than the controlled price, a surprise physical verification of the stock of high speed diesel oil was made and it was found that he had stock of oil in excess of that shown in the stock register. The petitioner was detained under s. 3(2) (iii) of the Main- tenance of Internal Security Act, 1971 on the ground, among others, that he sold 762 litres of the said oil without giving the names and addresses of the purchasers in the cash receipts in contravention of cl. 7 of the licence and the supply under In a petition under Article 32 of the Constitution it was contended that the District Magistrate had totally failed to apply his mind and his subjective satisfaction based inter alia on ground number 5 was therefore vitiated and it ren- dered the order of detention invalid the said cash memos was to fictitious persons.
 Allowing the petition, 
HELD : The conclusion is inescapable that since ground no. 5 was wholly misconceived, non-existent and not available under the law the order of detention must be held to be invalid. If there is one principle more firmly established than any other in this field of jurisprudence, it is that even if one of the grounds or reasons which led to the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority is non- existent, misconceived or irrelevant the order of detention would be invalid and it would not avail the detaining authority to contend that the other grounds or reasons are good and do not suffer from any such infirmity because it can never be predicated to what extent the bad grounds or reasons operated on the mind of the detaining authority or whether the detention order would have been made at all if the bad grounds or reasons were excluded and the good grounds or reasons alone were before the detaining authority.

 In the instant case if only the District Magistrate had applied his mind property and carefully and acted with a greater sense of responsibility, the infirmity vitiating the order of detention could have been easily avoided. Not mentioning the names and addresses of the customers in the cash memos was no longer a breach of cl. 7 of the licence and it could not support an inference that the sales covered by the cash memos were to fictitious persons. The District Magistrate mechanically subscribed to the grounds of detention without even caring to examine whether ground no.
 5 was correct or not and proceeded to make the order of detention. [706H] Ground 1 disclosed yet another instance of non-application of mind on the part of the District Magistrate. This circumstance also is indicative of the rather casual manner in which the District Magistrate proceeded to make the order of detention without proper application of mind and it could have an invalidating consequence on the order of detention.
