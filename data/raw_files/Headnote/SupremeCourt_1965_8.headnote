 The appellant claimed to deduct from its gross turnover, amounts received from the State Government for building bus bodies, on the chassis supplied by the Government under a contract.
 Under the contract, the bus bodies were to be put on the chassis and the body consisted not only of things actually fixed on the chassis but movable things like seat cushions and other things which though fixed could be easily detached, like roof-lamps etc. The chassis with the bus body was to be delivered at the destination named within the stipulated time. If some work was not satisfactorily done the Government was entitled to seize the unfinished vehicle, get the work done by another agency and recover the difference in cost from the appellant. While the appellant was required to protect the chassis by insurance, there was no provision regarding insurance of bus bodies. The contract also provided that the process of manufacture was to be supervised on behalf of the Government, and that the work should be done with due deligence. There was also a provision for payment of damages until the defects detected on inspection were rectified.
 The Sales Tax Officer refused to allow the deduction. On appeal, the claim was allowed by the Collector, whose order was affirmed by the Sales Tax Tribunal, on appeal by the Department. On a reference to the High Court, the question, as to whether the amounts were not chargeable to sales tax, was answered against the appellant.
 In the appeal to the Supreme Court, on the question as to whether the contract was one for execution of work or for performance of service, or whether it was a contract for sale of goods.
 
HELD : (Per Gajendragadkar C.J., Hidayatullah, Sikri and Bachawat, JJ) : The contract as a whole was a contract for the sale of goods and the amounts were therefore chargeable to sales tax. [792 G] The answer to the question depended on the construction of the agreement regarding the building of bus bodies. On the terms of the contract the property in the bus body did not pass on its being placed or constructed on the chassis but when the whole vehicle including the bus body was delivered.
 The provision regarding insurance showed that till delivery was made, the bus bodies remained the property of the appel- lant and unlike the case of a contract a construct a building, where the property does not pass in the materials as movable the bus body never lost its character as movable property and the property in it passed to Government as movable Property. It is not the law, that whenever a contract provides for the fixing of a chattel to another chattel there is no sale of goods; and, a contract for the sale of goods to be manufactured does not cease to be a contract for sale of goods, merely because the process of manufacture is supervised by the purchaser.

 Per Shah, J. (dissenting) : The contract was one for work and not a contract for sale, because, the contract was not that the parties agreed that the "bus body" constructed by the appellants should be sold to the State. The contract was one in which the appellants agreed to construct "bus bodies" on the chassis supplied to them as bailers, and such a contract being one for work, the consideration paid was not taxable under the Sales Tax Act.
 The primary difference between a contract for work or service and a contract for sale of goods is that in the former there is in the person. performing work or rendering service no property in the thing produced as a whole notwithstanding that a part or even the whole of the materials used by him may have been his property. In the case of a contract for sale the thing produced as a whole has individual existence as the sole property of the party who produced it, at some time before delivery, and the property therein passes only under the contract relating thereto to the other party for price. Mere transfer of property in goods used in the performance of a contract is not sufficient : to constitute a sale there must be an agreement express or implied relating to sale of goods and completion of the agreement by passing of title in the very goods contracted to be sold. Ultimately the true effect of an accretion made pursuant to a contract has to be judged, not by any artificial rule that the accretion may be presumed to have become by virtue of affixing to a chattel, part of that chattel, but from the intention of the parties to the contract. [793 D; 794 A-C; 797 H; 798 A, C] In the instant case, imposition of the obligation to carry out the work with due diligence, the liability to pay damages and the right of the Government representative to supervise the production and to take away the unfinished vehicles and get them completed by some other agency are all indicative of the contract being one for work.
