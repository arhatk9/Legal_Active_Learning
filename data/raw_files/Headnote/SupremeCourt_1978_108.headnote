 Out of 17 categories of Junior Executives in the Traffic Department of the respondent Port Trust, except categories XVI-Labour Supervisors Grade-11 and categories XVII- Markers/Sorters/Checkers rest were on non-roster system.
 When the workmen belonging to the non-roster were asked to work on a Sunday they were given a day off on any other working day and were also paid half an extra day's wages.
 On the other hand workmen belonging to categories XVI and XVII had been put on roster system, under which whenever they were made to work on a Sunday on rotation, they were given another day off in a week but they were not paid extra wages for half a day as were given to the non-roster workmen. An Industrial dispute was therefore raised in the form viz., "Whether the demand for changing the Roster off system to giving Sundays' off as the weekly day rest in respect of Grade-11 Supervisors, and Markers, Sorters and Checkers is justified ?" The Industrial Tribunal decided the reference in favour of the workmen. The employer, thereafter, filed a special leave petition No. 451 of 1970 in this Court to challenge the award of the Tribunal, but the same was dismissed on 18-3-70, after perusal of the papers and hearing the counsel. As no reason for dismissal was given in the order, the respondent employers, filed a writ petition in the High Court on 28-3-70. The High Court allowed the writ petition, and quashed the Award of the Tribunal. The High Court was of the view that : (1) there was no unfair discrimination adopted by the Management.
 While the non-roster staff were given half-a-day's additional wages as also compensating holiday for working on their weekly holiday, the roster staff were paid one day's additional wages as also compensating holiday for working on their weekly holiday, the only difference being that while Sunday is always the weekly holiday for the non-roster staff the weekly holiday for the roster staff changes once in every three months according to the roster; (2) as the question of wages was not referred to the Tribunal, its Award was clearly in excess of jurisdiction; and (3) dismissal of the special leave petition by the Supreme Court did not operate as res judicata in the entertainment of the writ petition.
 Dismissing the appeal by certificate, the Court 
HELD : (1) The Judgment of the High Court is correct and sustainable in law.[1976 H] (2) The scope of the proceeding under Art. 136 is wider, than that of a writ petition., The dismissal of a special leave petition under Art. 136 does not necessarily bar the entertainment of a writ petition under Art. 226. The effect of non-speaking order of dismissal without anything more indicating the grounds or reasons of its dismissal must by necessary implication be taken to have decided that it was not a fit case where special leave should be granted. It may be due to several reasons. It may be one or more. It may also be that the merits of the award were taken into consideration and this Court felt that it did not require any interference. But since the order is not a speaking order it is difficult to accept the argument that it must be deemed to have necessarily decided implicitly all the questions in relation to the merits of the award. Whatever can be held to have been decided expressly implicitly or even constructively while dismissing the special leave petition Cannot be reopened. [977 E-G] 972 State of U.P. v.

 (3) But, dismissal of a writ petition in limine by a non- speaking order, even with one word order "dismissed" could certainly create a bar in the entertainment of another writ petition filed by the same party as the same cause of action as it must necessarily be taken to have decided impliedly that this is not a fit one for exercise of the writ jurisdiction of the High Court. If the writ petition is dismissed after contest by a speaking order obviously it will operate as res judicata in any other proceedings, such as of suit, Art. 32 or Art. 136 directed from the same order or decision. If the writ petition is dismissed by a speaking order either at the threshold or after contest, say, only on the ground of laches or the availability of an alternative remedy, then another remedy open in law either by way of suit or other proceedings obviously will not be barred on the principle of res judicata. A second writ petition on the same cause of action either filed in the same High Court or in another will not be maintainable because the dismissal of one petition will operate as a bar in the entertainment of another writ petition. 1978 A-C, 979 B] Daryao & Ors., v.

 (4) The doctrine of res judicata codified in s. 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure is not exhaustive. Principles of not only of direct res judicata, but of constructive res judicata engrafted in Explanation IV to s. 11 are applied in many other situations, besides civil suits. If by any judgment or order any matter in issue has been directly and explicitly decided the decision operates as res judicata and bars the trial of an identical issue in a subsequent proceeding between the same parties. The principle of res judicata also comes into play when by the judgment and order a decision of a particular issue is implicit in it, that is it must be deemed to have been necessarily decided by implication; then also the principle of res judicata on that issue is directly applicable. When any matter which might and ought to have been made a ground of defence or attack in a former proceeding but was not so made, then such a matter in the eye of law, to avoid multiplicity of litigation and to bring about finality in it is deemed to have been constructively in issue and, therefore, is taken as decided. [977 A-D] (5) The technical rule of res judicata, although a wholesome rule based on public policy cannot be stretched too far to bar the trial of identical issues in a separate proceeding merely on an uncertain assumption that the issues must have been decided. It is not safe to extend the principle of res judicata to such, an extent so as to found it in a mere guess work. in the instant case, the Award of the Tribunal no doubt was challenged in the special leave petition filed in this Court on almost all grounds which were in the subsequent proceedings agitated in the High Court, and there is no question of applying the principles of constructive res judicata. [977 D, G-H] (6) The relief granted by the Tribunal was beyond the scope of the reference : [981 F] (a) The Tribunal did not find that the roster system was not necessary for the successful working of the port work.
 No discrimination could be found in the roster off system as such; [981 A-B] (b) The error of law apparent on the face of the Award was that if the Roster off system was necessary for the supervisory staff and the age labour, then the Roster category of workmen was a class by 'itself and 97 3 equating such workmen with other categories of the workmen who were very seldom required to work on Sundays was obviously a wrong application of the principles of discrimination. In substance and in effect the Award went beyond the scope of reference although in form in which the final order was made it did not do so; [981 B-C] (c) The Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction in saying that categories XVI and VII of the workmen could always be made to work on Sundays but they should be given half day's wages besides a day off for working on Sundays. This is an entirely different kind of relief which the Tribunal purported to grant, and it was not within the terms of reference; and [981 C-D] (d) On the findings of the Tribunal the point of reference ought to have been answered by saying merely that the demand for changing the Roster-off system in respect of the two categories of the workmen was justified or not justified;
