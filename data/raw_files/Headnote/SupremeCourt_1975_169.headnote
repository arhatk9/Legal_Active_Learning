 on September 3, 1957 the Chief Commissioner of Delhi issued a notification under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act in respect of land measuring about 3,000 acres mentioned in the schedule attached to the notification. lt was also stated that the land is likely to be required to be taken at the public expense for a public purpose, namely, for the execution of the Interim General Plan for the Greater Delhi. The notification was published in the Delhi Gazette on September 12 1957. Large tracts of land belonging to the appellant and situated in villages Garhi Jaharia Maria and Zamurdupur were covered by the above notification. Declaration dated February 15, 1961 under section 6 of the Act in respect of the land of the appellant and some other lands covered by the above notification was published on February 23, 1961. On or about February 24, 1961 the appellant filed petition under article 226 of the Constitution challenging the validity of the notification under section 4 of the Act on various grounds. It was argued on behalf of the appellant in the High Court that the acquisition of the land was not for a public purpose. that the so-called public purpose was merely a colourable device for freezing huge areas of land and that there could not be successive declarations under section 6 of the Act in respect of the lands covered by one notification under section 4 of the Act. The High Court rejected the contentions and dismissed the writ petition.
 Dismissing the appeal.
 ^ 
 HELD : ( I ) The public purpose mentioned in the notification namely, for the execution of the Interim General Plan for the Greater Delhi, is specific in the circumstances and does not suffer from any vagueness. The land covered by the notification is not a small plot, but a huge area covering thousands of acres. In such cases it is difficult to insist upon greater precision for specifying the public purpose because it is quite possible that various plots covered by the notification may have to be utilised for different purposes set out in the Interim General Plan.
 No objection was also taken by the appellant before the authorities that the public purpose mentioned in the notification was not specific enough and as such he was not able to file effective objections against the proposed acquisition.

 Nos. 332 and 333 of 1971 decided on April 13, 1975, referred to.
 (ii) The lnterim General Plan was prepared and published by the Government after approval by the Cabinet as a policy decision for development of Delhi as an interim measure till a Master Plan could be made ready. In Aflatoon case this Court laid down that the planned development of Delhi was a public purpose for the purpose of section 4 of the Act. As the object of the Interim General Plan was to prevent haphazard and unplanned development of Delhi and thereby ensure planned development of Delhi. the execution of the Interim General Plan must be held to be a public purpose for the purpose of section 4 of the Act. [344G H, 345A] (iii) It is, true the effect of the notification under section 4 of the Act was to freeze the land, but that fact would not in any way affect the validity of the notification. The object of a notification under section 4 is to give public notice that it is proposed to acquire the land mentioned in the notification and 342 that any one who deals in that land subsequent to the notification would do so at his own risk. According to section 23 of the Act, in determining the amount of compensation to be awarded for land acquired under the Act, the Court shall take into consideration, besides other factors the market-value of the land at the date of the publication of the notification under section 4. It is further provided in section 24 of the Act that the Court shall not take into consideration any outlay or improvement on, or disposal of the land acquired, commenced, made or affected without the sanction of the Collector after the date of the publication of the notification under section 4, It is, therefore, obvious that the consequences of the "freezing of the land" is inherent in the nature of things once the notification under section 4 is issued.
