 On October 1, 1953 the State of Andhra came into existence. The Madras Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act, 1949 continued to be in operation in the State.
 The area known as Telengana was merged with Andhra and the new State of Andhra Pradesh came into existence on November 1,1956. The Hyderabad House (Rent, Eviction and Lease) Control Act, 1954 which was in force in the Telengana area continued to be in force in that area even after the new State of Andhra Pradesh came into existence.
 By a notification dated May 9, 1956 issued by the Government of Andhra Pradesh, all buildings in the Andhra area the construction of which was completed on or after October 1,1953 were exempted, from the Madras Act for a period of three years from the date of such completion. On August 26,1957 the State Government issued another notification under the Hyderabad Act exempting all buildings in the Telengana Area for a period of five years. Both the Madras Act and the Hyderabad Act were repealed and replaced by the Andhra Pradesh Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act, 1960, which was passed in 1960. Section 32 of the Act provided that the Act would not apply (a) to any building owned by the Government, (b) to any building constructed on and after 26th August, 1957.
 The constitutionality of sec. 32 (b) was questioned in a writ petition filed in 1964, in the High Court on the ground that it violated Art. 14 of the Constitution. That petition was dismissed by the High Court on January 5, 1965 595 (Chintapalli Achaiah v. P. Gopalakrishna Reddy, A.I.R. 1966 A.P. 51) upholding the validity of sec. 32 (b). The High Court held that the hardship caused to the tenant by the exemption given in the case of buildings constructed after August 26, 1957 under sec. 32 (b) of the Act was 'short lived' and the concession should be tolerated for a short while.
 In their writ petitions to this Court the petitioners assailed the constitutional validity of sec. 32 (b) of the Act contending that the buildings to which the Act was applicable were aged more than 26 years and those to which the Act was not applicable were aged about 26 years or less and during the 26 years from August 26, 1957 thousands of buildings had been constructed enjoying immunity of the Act, that on account of the exemption, there were two sets of buildings in every area those to which the Act was applicable and those which were exempted under sec. 32 (b) and there had also come into existence two classes of landlords-one class governed by the Act and the other not governed by the Act and two classes of tenants-one class having the protection of the remedial provisions of the Act and another class which did not have such protection, and that whatever might have been the position in the first few years after the Act was passed there was no justification for continuing this exemption for all time to come.
 The writ petitions were resisted by the State Government and the landlords, on the ground that since sec.
 32 (b) was valid at the commencement of the Act as held by the High Court in the year 1965 it could not be struck down at any time after it had came into force. If clause (b) of sec. 32 was invalid then the entire Act would have to be struck down, so that all the tenancies might be regulated by contracts entered into by the parties in accordance with their free will. They also urged that s. 32 (b) was not violative of Article 14. The State Government also stated that two attempts were made to get the Act amended but that they failed. In the first Bill it was proposed to substitute the date '26th August 1957' in sec. 32 (b) by the date 'the 1st January, 1968'. In the second Bill it was proposed to confine the exemption in respect of each building to a period of ten years after its construction.
 Allowing the writ petitions.

 HELD: 1. Clause (b) of sec. 32 of the Act should be declared as violative of Article 14 of the Constitution because the continuance of that provision on the statute book would imply the creation of a privileged class of landlords without any rational basis, as the incentive to build which provided a nexus for a reasonable classification of such class of landlords no longer existed by lapse of time in the case of the majority of such landlords. There was no reason why, after all these years, they should not be brought at par with other landlords who were subject to the restrictions imposed by the Act in the matter of eviction of tenants and control of rents. [619 B-C] 
 2. The burden of proof regarding the question that a piece of legislation is violative of Art. 14 was, no doubt, on the petitioners. That burden stood discharged by them in the instant cases. The impugned provisions had at any rate become per se discriminatory because it was not possible to support 596 the exemption given to buildings which had also now become old as many of them were now more than 10 years old. The State Government itself had made two abortive attempts to get the section amended. [604 G-H] 
 3. Many of the exempted buildings were more than ten years old. While there was some justification for exempting new buildings which were say five, seven or ten years old from the date of the Act, in order to provide an incentive to builders of new buildings, there was hardly any justification to allow buildings which were constructed more than ten years ago to remain outside the scope of the Act.
 The landlords of such buildings must have realised a large part of the investment made on such buildings by way of rents during all these years. The court could not fail to take into account that owing to continuous influx of population into urban areas in recent years the rents had gone up everywhere and that the landlords of such buildings had been able to take advantage of the situation created by the shortage of urban housing accommodation which was a universal phenomenon. In the case of these buildings there was no longer any need to continue the exemption.[605 G- 606A] 
 4. There could not be any valid justification to apply the Act to a building which was 27 years old and not to apply it to a building which was 26 years old. The anomaly brought about by sec. 32(b) would be more pronounced when the State Government by a notification brought the Act into force in any part of the State for the first time. On such extension of the Act only buildings constructed prior to August 26, 1957 in that part of the State would become subject to the Act and buildings constructed later would still be exempt from its operation. This was a wholly insupportable classification. The classification of buildings into two classes for purposes of sec. 32 (b) of the Act, therefore, did not any longer bear any relationship to the object, since the buildings which were exempted had already come into existence and their owners had realised a major part of their investment. [606 B-D] In the instant case, the legislature while passing the law had given the exemption apparently as an incentive to encourage building activity. It was not shown how the continuance of the exemption in the case of persons who had built houses more than two decades ago would act as an incentive to builders of new houses now. If that was so, then there was no justification to continue to have the restrictions imposed by the Act on buildings built prior to August 26, 1957 also and the whole Act should have to be repealed, for if the impugned exemption could act as an incentive the repeal of the Act should also act as an incentive. [613 G] 
 5. (i) The long period that had elapsed after the passing of the Act itself served as a crucial factor in deciding the question whether the impugned law had become discriminatory or not because the ground on which the classification of buildings into two categories was made was not a historical or geographical one but was an economic one. Exemption was granted by way of an incentive to encourage building activity and in the circumstances such exemption could not be allowed to last for ever. [613H-614] 597 (ii) The landlords of buildings constructed subsequent to August 26, 1957 were given undue preference over the landlords of buildings constructed prior to that date in that the former were free from the shackles of the Act while the latter were subjected to the restrictions imposed by it.
 What should have been just an incentive had become a permanent bonanza in favour of those who constructed buildings subsequent to August 26,1957. There being no justification for the continuance of the benefit to a class of persons without any rational basis whatsoever, the evil effects flowing from the impugned exemption had caused more harm to the society than one could anticipate. What was justifiable during a short period had turned out to be a case of hostile discrimination by lapse of nearly a quarter of century. [614 D-E] (iii) Mere lapse of time did not lend constitutionality to a provision which was otherwise bad. The garb of constitutionality which it may have possessed earlier had become worn out and its constitutionality had been now brought to a successful challenge. [614 G] 
 6. The striking down of clause (b) of sec. 32 of the Act did not in any way affect the rest of the provisions of the Act. The clause was not so inextricably bound up with the rest of the Act as to make the rest of the Act unworkable after it was struck down. Having regard to the history of the legislation the Act had to be sustained even after striking down clause (b) of sec. 32. The effect of striking down the impugned provision would be that all buildings, except those falling under clause (a) of sec. 32 or exempted under sec. 26 in the areas where the Act was in force, would be governed by the Act irrespective of the date of their construction.

 7. (1) The incentive to build provides a rational basis for classification and it is necessary, in the national interest, that there should be freedom from restrictions for a limited period of time. It is always open to the State Legislature or the State Government to take action by amending the Act itself or under sec. 26 of the Act, as the case may be, not only to provide incentive to persons who are desirous of building new houses, as it serves a definite social purpose but also to mitigate the rigour to such class of landlords who may have recently built their houses for a limited period as it has been done in the Union Territory of Chandigarh.
