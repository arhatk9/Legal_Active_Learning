 The River Steam Nagivation Co. Ltd. carried passengers and cargo in Inland Waters. It also owned a dock called Rajabagan Dockyard, where it carried out repairs to its own vessels. Majority of the shares of the Company were purchased by the Government of India and considerable financial assistance was also given by the Government. In the year 1966, the financial position of the company became so precarious that an application "or winding up of the company was made by one of its creditors in the High Court of Calcutta. The Government of India put forward a scheme of ,arrangement and compromise, and made an application to the High Court in the winding uppetition for sanction of the scheme. The appellant Corporation was incorporated and all the properties and assets of the Company stood transferred to and vested in the Corporation. As far as the liabilities are concerned, only some of them were transferred to the Corporation and the rest had to be discharged by the company. It was also provided in the scheme that the Corporation should take as many of the existing employees as possible. The scheme also provided that those employees who could not be taken over by the Corporation would be paid all legitimate and legal compensation by the Company. The Company was to stand closed. 8000 employees were working in the Company, out of when 5173 employees were given fresh appointments by the Corporation on new terms and condilions.
 The workmen working in Rajabagan Dockvard demanded payyment of bonus for the years 1967-68 and 1968-69 under the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965. The appellant raised a preliminary objection that the establishment of the Corporation in which the workmen were employed was a newly set up establishment since 5-6-1967 and the workmen were by reason of section 16 of the Payment of Bonus Act, not entitled to payment of bonus for the year 1967-68 and 1968-69, since the Corporation incurred losses during both these years.
 The Industrial Tribunal held that the workmen were entitled to bonus on the ground that the appellant was the successor in interest of the company in respect of the business carried on in the establishment of Rajabagan Dockyard.
 On appeal by special leave by the appellant, it was held The question which arises for determination is whether the Rajabagan Dockyard in the hands of the Corporation could be said to be an establishment newly set up since 5-6-1967.
 The Industrial Tribunal erred in addressing itself to a wholly different question namely whether the Corporation was the successor in interest of the company. That was not a relevant .question. [448 F-G] 
HELD FURTHER-The establishment of Rajabagan Dockyard was not a ,new establishment in the hands of the Corporation. It was the same establishment, the same manufacturing apparatus, which was operated by the cornpany prior to its taking over by the Corporation. The name of the establish- ment also continued to be the same. Its address remains the same and the registration number of the establishment under the Factories Act also remaintained the same. [451-H] 444 
HELD-The workmen were entitled to be paid bonus for the two years, as the Rajabagan Dockyard was not a new establishment. Observed further The workmen who were taken over by the Corporation were given fresh appointments after 5-6-1967 with different scales of pay and different condi- tions of service and there was a break in their continuity of service. If certainty of service was to be decided to these workers, they should have been paid closure compensation under section 25FFF or at any rate compensation tinder section 25FF of the Industrial Dispute.
