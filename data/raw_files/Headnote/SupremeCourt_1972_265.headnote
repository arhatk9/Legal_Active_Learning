 One J, the coaccused in the case, had tried to become intimate with the prosecutrix, a girl of fourteen, and to seduce her to go and live with him. When her father forbade J to visit his house, J started sending messages to the prosecutrix through the respondent. On the day of the occurrence, the respondent went to see the prosecutrix and asked her to visit his house, and later, on the same day, sent his daughter to fetch the prosecutrix. When she came the respondent informed her that she should come to his house at about midnight when she would be taken to J. That night, when the prosecutrix came to his house, the respondent took her with him and handed her over to J.
 On the question, whether the respondent was guilty under S.
 361, I.P.C., of the offence of kidnaping from lawful guardianship, the trial Court convicted him, but the High Court set aside the conviction, In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The acquittal of the respondent by the High Court was clearly erroneous both on facts and in law and considering the nature of the offence there was clear failure of justice justifying interference by this Court under Art. 136. [737 A-B] The object of S. 361, I.P.C., is to protect minor children from being seduced for improper purposes and to protect the rights and privileges of guardians having lawful charge or custody of their minor wards. The gravamen of this offence lies in the taking or enticing of a minor under the ages specified in the section, out of the keeping of the lawful guardian without the consent of such guardian. The use of the word 'keeping' connotes the idea of charge, protection, maintenance and control; further, the guardian's charge and control are compatible with the independence of action and movement in the minor, the guardian's protection and control of the minor being available, whenever necessity arises.
 The consent of the minor who is taken or enticed is wholly immaterial; it is only the guardian's consent, that would take a case out of the purview of the section. It is not necessary that the taking or enticing must be- shown to have been by means of force or fraud. Persuasion by the accused person which creates willingness on the part of the minor to be taken out of the keeping of the lawful guardian would be sufficient to attract the section. [734D-E] In the present case, the respondent's action was the proximate cause, of the prosecutrix going out of the keeping of her father, and, but for his persuasive offer to take her to J, the prosecutrix would not have gone out of the keeping of her father who was her lawful guardian, as she actually did. The respondent actively participated in the formation of the intention of the prosecutrix to leave her father's house, and the facts that the respondent did not go to her house to 'bring her and that she was easily persuaded to go with him would not prevent the respondent from 729 being guilty of the offence. Her consent or willingness to accompany the, respondent would be immaterial and it would be equally so even if the proposal to go with the respondent had emanated from her. There is a distinction between taking and allowing a minor to accompany a person, but the instant case is not one of the prosecutrix herself leaving her father's house without any inducement by the respondent who merely allowed her to accompany him.
