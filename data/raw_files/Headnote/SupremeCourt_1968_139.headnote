 On December 15, 1967 the District Magistrate, Cuttack- served an order made in exercise of power under s. 3 (1) (a) (ii) of the Preventive Detention Act, 1950 directing that the appellant be detained on various grounds. On December 19, 1967 the appellant filed a petition in the High Court challenging the order of detention on the grounds inter alia that the order and the grounds in support thereof served upon the appellant were written in the English language which the appellant did not understand. On January 18, 1968 the District Magistrate supplied to the appellant an Oriya translation of the order and the grounds. On January 28, 1968 the State of Orissa revoked the order and issued a fresh order of detention. A translation of this order in Oriya was supplied to the appellant. Thereafter the appellant submitted a supplementary petition challenging the validity of the order dated January 28, 1968. The High Court of Orissa rejected the petition filed by the appel- lant. Against that order, with certificate granted by the High Court the appellant came to this Court.
 
HELD : (i) The order of the District Magistrate passed on December 15, 1967 ran into fourteen typed pages. Mere oral explanation of such an order without supplying him a translation in a script or language which he understood, amounted to denial of the right of being communicated the grounds and of being afforded the opportunity of making a representation against the order. The order of the District Magistrate not having been followed up by service within five days as provided by s. 7 (1) of the communication to him of the grounds on which the order was made must be deemed to have become invalid and any subsequent detention of the appellant was unauthorised. [231 F-H] Harikisan v. State of Maharashtra. & Ors., [1962] Supp.1 S.C.R. 918, relied on.
 (ii) The second order dated January 28, 1968 passed by the State Government was not passed on any fresh facts which had arisen after the date of revocation of the first order and was on that ground invalid. There is nothing in s. 13(2) which indicates that the expression 'revocation' means only revocation of an order which is otherwise valid and operative : 'apparently it includes cancellation of all orders invalid as well -as valid. [233 F-H] The principle underlying s. 13(2) in its present form is the outcome of insistence by Parliament that the detaining authority shall fully apply its mind to and comply with their requirements of the statute and of insistence upon refusal to countenance slipshod exercise of power.
