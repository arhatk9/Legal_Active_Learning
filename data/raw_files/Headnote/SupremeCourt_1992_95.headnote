 Respondents Nos. 1 and 2 and PW. 18 were working as Sub-Treasury Officer, Shroff and Upper Division Accounto- cum-Double Lock Officer respectively in a non-Banking Treasury. The State Government ordered the conversion of the said Treasury into a Banking Treasury by handing over cash business to a local Bank from a particular date.
 However, on the report of respondent No. 1 that the case chest was not working as the key was stuck-up in the Reserve Bank of India chest and it was not possible to hand over the case business on the date ordered by the Government, the State Government fixed another date, and the conversion materialised, on the revised date, about a month after the original date.
 After sometime, the Accountant General and also the regional office of the Reserve Bank of India detected that seven demand drafts alleged to have been issued by the Reserve Bank of India were encashed in the Sub-Treasury on the last two days of its being handed over. It was found that no such demand drafts had at all been issued by the Reserve Bank of 345 India for being encashed at the Sub-Treasury in question, and that altogether different drafts were issued relating to other places outside the State, and except the serial numbers, all other particulars, namely the date, amount, name of the payee etc. were not at all tallying with the payment certificate sent by respondent No. 1, the then Sub- Treasury Officer. It was found that there was an embezzlement to the tune of Rs. 1,22,500 out of the case of the Sub-Treasury and all entries with regard to the payment of such amount and the signatures of the payees in token of receipts of money were all fake and forged by the accused persons.
 PW. 18 was granted pardon and declared an approver by the District Magistrate.
 The two respondents were charged for offences under Section 409, 467, 471 and 477-A I.P.C. The prosecution examined 27 witnesses and produced 113 documents in support of its case. The respondents denied the charges but did not lead any evidence in defence.
 The trial court held that the prosecution had proved beyond all reasonable doubt that the two respondents and PW.18, the approver, together made falsification of the accounts by writing false entries in the relevant registers as if some payments were made on the two dates in question to the fictitious persons whose names were mentioned in the payment register and other registers, and that both the accused persons and PW.18 connived in making false entries with dishonest intention of covering up of misappropriation of the public funds committed by them to the tune of Rs.
 1,22,500. According it found that the respondent were guilty of the offences under Section 409, 467, 471 and 477-A I.P.C. It acquitted the approver of all the charges levelled against him.
 On appeal, the High Court acquitted the respondents on the ground that the prosecution had failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt, and that though a huge amount had been embezzled, nevertheless it would not be proper to convict the accused when doubt was cast and benefit of doubt had to be given to the accused.
 Allowing the appeals of th State, this Court, 
 HELD : 1.1 The High Court totally misdirected itself and did not go deep into the matter, nor analysed the clinching oral and documentary 346 evidence produced by the prosecution and gave benefit of doubt to the respondents in a superficial manner. It did not deal with the detailed reasons given by the trial court and ignored the almost admitted facts and circumstances of the case. The accused persons had not received any demand drafts from the R.B.I. and all the entries in the relevant registers at the Sub-Treasury regarding payment of seven demand drafts amounting in all to Rs. 1,22,500 are fake, false forged and the accused persons were the authors of such entries. The prosecution has discharged its burden of establishing the charges levelled against the accused persons beyond any manner of doubt and the findings and conclusion drawn by the trial court and the conviction and sentence awarded by it are upheld. [350H, 357A-H] 1.2. It is clearly proved on record that the real and genuine demand drafts were Exhibits P.82 to P.88 issued from the regional office of the Reserve Bank of India and the same were not drawn to be payable at Sub-Treasury in question or at any other Sub-Treasury situated in the State.
 The amounts, the dates and the payees were entirely different from those demand drafts which have been entered and shown encashed from the said Sub-Treasury. Since the respondents had taken the stand that the payments or encashment of the demand drafts and the entries found the Exhibits P.2., P.3, P.5, P.6, P.8 and P.9 were all correct, and it may be that fake or spurious or bogus Reserve Bank of India demand drafts might have been presented by the payees, it was necessary for them to disclose the identity of the person who identified the payees at the time of encashment of the fake drafts. Admittedly, no advice for payment of the demand drafts had been received before the encashment of the demand drafts and even the alleged demand drafts after payment are not available on the record and the respondents took a false stand that they sent the paid drafts to the office of the Accountant General. Indisputably the amount of Rs. 1,22.500 was withdrawn by the respondents and the same has been shown to have been paid against fake and spurious demand drafts to unknown persons. [356C-F] 1.3. The High Court went wrong in throwing the burden on the prosection to prove that the entries in column 5 of Exhibits P.8 and P.9 containing the signatures or thumb impression of the payees was made by the respondents. In the facts and circumstances of this case, it was totally wrong to place such burden on the prosecution. The prosecution has discharged its burden by leading umimpeaching oral and documentary 347 evidence that no demand drafts were issued from the R.B.I., against which payments have been shown on the two dates in question in th record of Sub-Treasury and the names of the payees were also of unknown an unidentified persons. The entries in columns 1 to 4 of Exhibits P.8 and P.9 are admitted to be correct by the accused persons. These entries showing the names of the payees and the amount are proved to be false and incorrect beyond any shadow of doubt. In this background, it was no longer the duty of the prosecution to show as to who made the entries in column 5 of Exhibits P.8 and P.9 A.1 had put his signatures on Exhibits P.8 and P.9 and according to him the payments were made after getting the identity of the payees verified by a person well known to him. [356G-H, 357A-B] 1.4. When the payment of a huge amount of Rs. 1,22,500 was being made without receiving any advice from Reserve Bank of India, it was all the more necessary to make thorough enquiry regarding the correct identity and genuineness of the payee. These facts being in the special knowledge of the respondents, it was incumbent on them to disclose the names and identity of the person who had identified the payees and to establish their innocence by producing such person or the payees in defence evidence.
 Section 106 of the Evidence Act clearly provides that when any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him. [357C-D]
