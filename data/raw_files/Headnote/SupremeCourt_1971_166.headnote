 The appellant challenged the election of respondent No. 1 to the Naga Land Assembly on the ground that the result of the election in so far as it concerned the respondent had been materially affected by the improper reception of votes cast in his favour by the personnel of the 12th Battalion Assam Rifles. It was urged (i) that the Electoral Registration Officer had no jurisdiction to register the personnel of the 12th Batallion Assam Rifles as voters, because, the service personnel under s. 20(3) of the 1950 Act would be deemed to be ordinarily resident on any date in the constituency in which, but for his having such service qualifications he would have been ordinarily resident on that date and (ii) that the service personnel were not Indian citizens. The High Court dismissed the election petition. Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD:(i) Section 30 of the 1950 Act does not confer jurisdiction on a civil court to entertain or adjudicate upon a question whether a person is or is not entitled to register himself in the electoral roll of a constituency or to question the illegality of the action taken by or under the authority of the Electoral Registration Officer or any decision given by the authority appointed under the 1950 Act for the revision of any such roll. The civil court therefore would have no jurisdiction to adjudicate upon a question whether the personnel of the 12th Battalion Assam Rifles in the present case were validly registered as service electors.

 479 and Kabul Singh v. Kundan Singh, [1969] INSC 177; [1970] 1 S.C.R. 845, referred to.
 (ii)But lack of power in the Electoral Registration Officer to register voters in violation of the provisions of the relevant statutes would lead to the ground of improper reception, refusal or rejection of any caption of any vote which is void and would, therefore, be a avoiding the election under s. 100(1) (d) (iii) of the 1951 Act.
 Baidyanath Panjiar v. Sitaram Mahto, [1969] INSC 178; [1970] 1 S.C.R. 839, (iii)In the present case the Electoral Registration Officer his jurisdiction to register the personnel of the 12th Batallion residents in the constituency by reason of their statements in the prescribed forms. The effect of s.
 20(5) of the 1950 Act is that statement of a member having service qualification is to be accepted as correct in the absence of evidence to the contrary. There was no evidence to displace the statements in the present case. [960E] Under s. 20(3) a fiction is created that members having service qualification would be deemed to be ordinarily resident at their home town or place but for their service qualification. The statutory fiction is intended 957 to confer the right to be registered as electors at their home town or village but the fiction cannot take away the right of persons possessing service qualification to get themselves registered in a constituency in which they were ordinarily residing though such place happens to be their place of service. [961B] (iv)There was no evidence to substantiate the allegation that the members of the service personnel were not Indian citizens. On the contrary it was in evidence that the Electoral Registration Officer was satisfied about the declarations of the members of the service personnel about their citizenship. [962F]
