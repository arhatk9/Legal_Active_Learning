 The respondent No.1 - State Government issued a notification dated June 5, 1989 under section 5(1) of the Karnataka Educational Institutions (Prohibition of Capitation Fee) Act, 1984 fixing the tuition fee, other fees and deposits to be charged from the students by the private Medical Colleges in the State. The tuition fee per year for the candidates admitted against "Government seats" was Rs.2,000, whereas for the Karnataka students (other than those admitted against "Government seats") the tution fee was not exceeding Rs.25,000 and for the students belonging to the category of "Indian students from outside Karnataka" were to pay the tuition fee not exceeding Rs.60,000 per annum.
 The petitioner, who came under the category of "Indian students from outside Karnataka", was informed by the respondent No.3 - Private Medical College, that she could be admitted to the MBBS Course in the session commencing February/march 1991, provided she would deposit Rs.60,000 as the tuition fee for the first year and furnish a bank guarantee in respect of the fees for the remaining years of the MBBS Course. When the father of the petitioner informed the respondent No. 3 that he could not pay the exorbitant annual tution fee of Rs.60,000, the petitioner was denied admission.
 659 The petitioner has, under Article 32 of the Constitution of India, challenged the notification dated 5.6.1989 issued by the respondent No. 1, permitting the Private Medical Colleges to charge exorbitant tution fees from the students other than those admitted to the "Government seats".
 Respondent No.3 contended that the students from whom higher tuition fee was charged belong to a different class;
 that those who were admitted to the "Government seats" were meritorious and the remaining non-meritorious' that classification of candidates into those who possessed merit and those who did not posses merit was a valid classification and as such the college-management was within its right to charge more fee from those who did not possess merit; that the object sought to be achieved by the said classification was to collect money to meet the expenses incurred by the college in providing medical education to the students.
 The intervener-Karnataka Private Medical Colleges Association argued that the Private Medical Colleges in the State of Karnataka did not receive any financial aid from either the Central or the State Government; that the Private Medical Colleges would incur about Rs. 5 lakhs per student as expenditure for 5 year MBBS course; that 40% of the seats in the colleges were set apart as "Government seats" to be filled by the Government; that the students selected and admitted against Government seats would pay only Rs. 2,000 per annum as such the rest of the burden was on those who were admitted against management quota; that the tuition fee was not excessive and as such there was no question of making any profit by the Private Medical Colleges in the State of Karnataka.
 Respondent No.3 and the intervener submitted that in order to run the medical colleges the managements were justified in charging the capitation fee; that apart from the Act, there was not provision under the Constitution or under any other law which would forbid the charging of capitation fee.
 On the question: (1) Was there a `right to education' guaranteed to the people of India under the Constitution? If so, did the concept of `capitation fee' infrasts the same?;
 (2) Whether the charging of capitation fee in consideration of admissions to educational institutions was arbitrary, unfair, unjust and as such violated Article 14 of the Constitution?; (3) Whether the impugned notification permitted the Private Medical Colleges to charge capitation fee in the guise of regulating fees under the 660 Act? and (4) Whether the notification was violative of the provisions of the Act?, allowing the writ petition to the extent of striking down the capitation fee, this Court 
 HELD: 1.01. The dignity of man is inviolable. It is the duty of the State to respect and protect the same. It is primarily the education which brings-forth the dignity of a man. The framers of the Constitutions were aware that more than seventy per cent of the people, whom they were giving the Constitution of India, were illitrate. They were also hopeful that within a period of ten years illiteracy would be wiped out from the country. It was with that hope that Articles 41 and 45 were brought in Chapter IV of the constitution. An individual cannot be assured of human dignity unless his personality is developed and the only way to do that is to educate him. [667F] 1.02. Article 41 in Chapter IV of the Constitution recognises an individual's right "to education". It says that "the State shall, within the limits of its economic capacity and development, make effective provision for the securing the right....to education...." Although a citizen cannot enforce the directive principles contained in Chapter IV of the Constitution but these were not intended to be mere pious declarations. [667H] 1.03. Without making "right to education" under Article 41 of the Constitution a reality the fundamental rights under Chapter III shall remain beyond the reach of large majority which is illiterate. [668E] 1.04. The "right to education", therefore, is concomitant to the fundamental rights enshrined under Part III of the Constitution. The State is under a constitutional mandate to provide educational institutions at all levels for the benefit of the citizens. The educational institutions must function to the best advantage of the citizens. Opportunity to acquire education cannot be confined to the richer section of the society. [670A] 1.05. Every citizen has a `right to education' under the Constitution. The State is under an obligation to establish educational institutions to enable the citizens to enjoy the said right. The State may discharge its obligation through state-owned or state-recognised educational institutions. When the State Government grants recognition to the private educational institutions it creates an agency to fulfil its obligation under the Constitution. The students are given admission to the educational institutions - whether state-owned or state-recognised in recognition of their 661 `right' to education' under the Constitution. Charging capitation fee in consideration of admission to educational institutions, is a patent denial of a citizen's right to education under the Constitution. [672C-E] 1.06. Capitation fee is nothing but a price for selling education. The concept of "teaching shops" is contrary to the constitutional scheme and is wholly abhorrent to the Indian culture and heritage. [670C] 1.07. "Right to life" is the compendious expression for all those rights which the Court must enforce because they are basic to the dignified enjoyment of life. It extends to the full range of conduct which the individual is free to pursue. The right to education flows directly from right to life. The right to life under Article 21 and the dignity of an individual cannot be assured unless it is accompanied by the right to education. The State Government is under an obligation to make endeavour to provide educational facilities at all levels to its citizens. [669 F-G] 1.08. Capitation fee makes the availability of education beyond the reach of the poor. The State action in permitting capitation fee to be charged by State-recognised educational institutions is wholly arbitrary and as such violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India [672G] 1.09 The capitation fee brings to the fore a clear class bias. It enable the rich to take admission whereas the poor has to withdraw due to financial inability. A poor student with better merit cannot get admission because he has no money whereas the rich can purchase the admission.
 Such a treatment is patently unreasonably, unfair and unjust. There is, therefore, no escape from the conclusion that charging of capitation fee in consideration of admissions to educational institutions is wholly arbitrary and as such infracts Article 14 of the Constitution.

 2. The Karnataka Educational Institutions (prohibition of Capitation Fee) Act, 1984 has been brought into existence by the Karnataka State Legislature with the object of effectively curbing the evil practice of collecing capitation fee for admitting students into the educational institutions in the State of Karnataka. The preamble to the Act which makes the object clear. [679F] 3.01. The State Government in fulfilling its obligation under the Constitution to provide medical education to the citizens has fixed Rs.2,000 per annum as tuition fee for the students selected on merit for admission to the medical colleges and also against "Government seats" in private medical colleges. Therefore, the tuition fee by a student admitted to the private medical college is only Rs.2,000 per annum. The seats other than the "Government seats" which are to be filled from outside Karnataka the management has been given free hand where the criteria of merit is not applicable and those who can afford to pay Rs.60,000 per annum are considered at the discretion of the management. [680 F-H] 3.02. If the State Government fixes Rs.2,000 per annum as the tuition fee in government colleges and for "Government seats" in private medical colleges then it is the State-responsibility to see that any private college which has been set up with Government permission and is being run with Government recognition is prohibited from charging more than Rs.2,000 from any student who may be resident of any part of India. When the State Government permits a private medical college to be set-up and recognises its curriculum and degrees, then the said college is performing a function which under the Constitution has been assigned to the State Government. [681A] 3.03. Capitation fee in any form cannot be sustained in the eyes of law. The only method of admission to the medical colleges in consonance 663 with fair play and equity is by ways of merit and merit alone. Charging of capitation fee by the private educational institutions as a consideration for admission is wholly illegal and cannot be permitted. [674 B-C] 3.04. Rs.60,000 per annum permitted to be charged from Indian students from outside Karnataka in Para 1(d) of the notification is not tuition fee but in fact a capitation fee and as such cannot be sustained and is liable to be struck down. [681C] 3.05. What is provided is paras 1 (d) and 1(c) of the impugned notification dated June 5, 1989 is capitation fee and not a tuition fee. It has to be held that the notification is beyond the scope of the Act rather goes contrary to Section 3 of the Act and as such has to be set aside. It is not permissible in law for any educational institution to charge capitation fee as a consideration for admission to the said institution. [681E]
