 The appellant and respondents enterd into a contract under which, from the very inception, the respondents became liable to sell their immovable property and the appellants became liable to buy it. One of the terms of the contract provided that if the property was requisitioned by the Gov- ernment prior to the registration of the sale-deed the respondents should refund the earnest money paid by the appellants with interest. The premises were requisitioned before the execution of the sale-deed. The respondents tendered a cheque for the earnest money with interest and filed an appeal against the order of requisition but the appeal was dismissed. Notwithstanding the requisition, the appellants were repeatedly asking the respondents to execute the sale-deed in accordance with the agreement. As the respondents did not do so, the appellants filed a suit for specific performance of the contract about two years after the respondent's appeal against the order of requisition was dismissed. The trial court decreed the suit but the High Court reversed the decree.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD:(1) There is nothing in the agreement to show that non-requisitioning of the property was a condition precedent to the performance of the seller's (respondent's) obligation to sell the premises or that the contract came to an end on the requisitioning of the premises. On the contrary, the non-requisitioning of the premises was a condition precedent to the performance of the buyer's (appellants) obligation to buy the premises. That is, when the premises were requisitioned, the appellants could rescind the contract if they so desired. As the clause relating to requisitioning was inserted for the exclusive benefit of the vendee and not for the benefit of the vendor as well as the vendee and it did not create any liabilities against the vendee the appellants (vendee) could waive, unilaterally, the condition precedent specified in the clause.

Studd and Millington, [1913] 2 Ch. 648, referred to.
 (2)Where it would be unjust to give a remedy to a party either because he has, by his conduct, done that which might fairly be regarded as an equivalent to a waiver of it or, where by his conduct and neglect, be has, though perhaps not waiving that remedy, put the other party in a situation in which it would not be reasonable to place him if the remedy were afterwards to be asserted, in either of these cases, lapse of time and delay are material. [236G-H; 237A] In the present case, the appellants never abandoned their rights under the contract. They were justified in waiting till the date of disposal of the appeal against the order of requisition in the hope that the order of 231 requisition might be set aside in appeal. Thereafter, they were pressing the respondents to execute the sale deed.
 Therefore, they never waived the remedy of specific performance.
 Further there is no allegation in the respondent's written statement that they would be prejudiced by the specific performance, nor is there any evidence to that effect.
 Therefore, the delay in the institution of the Suit had not caused any disadvantage to the respondents.
