 The appellants. an accountant and a cashier, along with another person, were accused of preparing false pay bills and disbursing the amounts drawn from the treasury Lo fictitious persons. The Sessions Judge convicted and sentenced them under S. 420 read with s. 34, I.P.C. On appeal, the High Court confirmed the convictions and sentences passed against both of them.
 On further appeal to this Court, Allowing the appeals, 
HELD : For the purpose of holding the appellants guilty the evidence adduced must establish beyond reasonable doubt means rea on their part. [904 E] On the evidence all that could be said at the highest was that it was a failure on the part of the accountant to perform his duties or to observe the rules of procedure laid down in the duty chart in a proper manner and may therefore be an administrative lapse on his part. Without, however, anything more it will not be correct to impute guilty intention which is an essential ingredient of the offence of cheating. [905 D] The material before the High Court together with the significant observations made by it against the Superintendent and Deputy Superintendent do make out a case for giving benefit of reasonable doubt to the cashier as well. It is not possible to hold that the requisite means rea had been established against him. [906 F]
