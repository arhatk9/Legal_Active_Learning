 The Karta of a Joint Hindu Family was in sole management of the entire family affairs and he brought up his younger brother. The ancestral family business (Kulachara ) was that of tobacco and money lending. After sometime the Karta started a new business of lungi. In connection with this new venture he borrowed money from others either on promissory notes or on the security of the family properties. He suffered loss in the new business.
 When his creditors began to press him for immediate discharge of the debts the Karta and his brother on their behalf and on behalf of the other minors in the family entered into a written agreement on 7th July, 1955 (Ext. B- 4) with Govinda Swami Mudaliar and his two brothers whereby they agreed to sell their almost entire property for a sum of Rs. 14,000 to discharge their debts. Pursuant to this agreement a sale deed was executed on 22nd August, 1955 (Ext. B-5) for an enhanced consideration of Rs. 16,500. The sale deed referred to the various debts including the mortgage debts owed by the vendors which were to be discharged by the vendees and the balance if any to be paid to the vendors. The vendees were asked to pay off the mortgage debts mentioned in the sale deed in the first instance if they had no sufficient funds to clear off all the debts.
 The sons of the Karta and those of his brother filed two suits, suit No. 107 of 1958 and suit No. 108 of 1958 respectively challenging the sale deed dated 22nd 110 August, 1955 (Ext. B-5) and the mortgage deed of 2nd March, 1952 (Ext. B-49), and claiming partition.
 In suit No. 107 of 1958 the Karta and his brother were Defendant Nos. 1 and 2, the three minor sons of the Karta's brother, Defendant Nos. 3 and 5 and the vendees Defendant Nos. 6 to 8, the mortgagee, Defendant No. 9 and the official Receiver, Defendant No. 10. In suit No. 108 of 1958 the three minor sons of the Karta's brother were the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs and other defendants of suit No. 107 of 1958 were impleaded as defendants.
 It was alleged in the suits that the father of the plaintiffs (Karta) started a new business of lungi which was not the ancestral business of the family, and that in connection with the new venture he borrowed large sums of money. He sustained heavy losses, and when the mortgagees and unsecured creditors started pressing for immediate discharge of the debts he executed first an agreement to sell and then a registered sale deed for a nominal consideration of Rs. 16,500 which was grossly inadequate and extremely low considering the extent of the land and the ancestral house and its market value. It was further alleged that except the two mortgages mentioned in the sale deed the other debts shown as consideration for the sale were false and fictitious, that the said mortgages were paid by defendants 6 to 8 out of the standing crops, and that there was absolutely no necessity for borrowing the large sums considering the large income from the joint family properties.
 A third suit (suit No. 4 of 1960) was filed by a creditor of the Karta and his brother against the vendees, alleging that the Karta had borrowed a sum of Rs. 1000 and executed a bond for that amount and that barring some payments a substantial amount was due on account of principal and interest and that the Karta executed a sham, nominal and fraudulent sale deed in respect of the family property in favour of the defendant with an intent to defeat and delay his creditors, and that property worth Rs. 50,000 was alienated for a nominal price.
 The claim of the plaintiffs in the suits was resisted and contested by the transferees, alleging that the alienation by the Karta was for payment of antecedent debts which were untainted by immorality. The father under Hindu Law possessed a special power to alienate joint family property including the shares of his sons for payment of his own debts not incurred for immoral or illegal purposes and that in exercise of that power the Karta had sold all his interest and the interest of the minor sons, that an agreement of sale was first entered into and later on a sale deed was executed pursuant to the agreement for sale.
 The trial court held that at the time of execution of the sale deed Ext. B-5, the 4th defendant that is the Karta owed some creditors in whose favour he bad executed promissory notes and the bond debts involved in Ext. A-7 to A-11; but no provision at all had been made for these creditors either in the agreement of sale or in the sale deed. The letter by the Karta dated 27th July, 1954 (Ext. B- 54) alongwith other oral evidence clearly established the intention of the Karta to defeat and delay the claim of some of the creditors in screening his property by a nominal sale in favour of defendants I to 3. The sale deed is true and supported by consideration but only partly, and that it is liable to be set aside wholly as 111 an imprudent transaction. The mortgage deed is true and binding only so far as the shares of the Karta and his brother are concerned. The alienees under the sale transaction were not entitled to any equities.
 On these findings, the trial Court passed a preliminary decree for partition and division after setting aside the sale transaction the alienees being directed to work out their own remedies. The alienation dated 2nd March, 1952 was declared binding only on the shares of the Karta and his brother to the extent of Rs. 2,000. The Court however declined to give any relief to the alienees even in respect of the amount actually paid by them to discharge some of the debts incurred by the Karta on the ground that the transaction had been vitiated by fraud.
 The alienees defendants preferred appeals to the High Court but the mortgagee submitted to the judgment and decree and did not prefer any appeal presumably because he could realise the amount due to him by virtue of the decree granted to him, The High Court reversed the findings of the trial court in suits Nos. 107 and 108 of 1958 and set aside the decrees but confirmed the finding and decree in suit No. 4 of 1960, holding that the purchase of the suit land was for a reasonable price and the consideration of Rs. 16,500 was not a grossly low price. The lungi business started by the Karta was a new venture and not his family business. The debts mentioned in Ext. B-5 were antecedent debts from the point of view of the plaintiffs in suit No. 107 of 1958 and were binding on them. The debts evidenced by Exts. 13 and 14 were genuine debts and the alienation, Ext. 5 was binding on the plaintiffs in the two suits as the sale deed was executed by their father in discharge of antecedent debts.
 In the appeals to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellants that the High Court had omitted to take into consideration various circumstances considered by the trial court and as such the findings of the High Court on material issues were vitiated, that the High Court omitted to consider whether the impugned sale was an imprudent transaction, if not fictitious. On behalf of the respondents it was contended that the findings recorded by the High Court were pure findings of fact based on appraisal of evidence and this Court cannot reverse the findings recorded by the last court on facts Allowing the appeals ^ 
 HELD: 1. On the evidence both oral, documentary and circumstantial the trial court was right in holding that the sale deed is true and that it is supported by consideration but only in part and that even the recited consideration in the sale deed is thoroughly inadequate and that the sale deed was executed only nominally for a collateral purpose and with a view to stave off creditors. [ 134 D] 
 2. The contention of the counsel for the respondents that finding of fact cannot be interfered with by the Court has no force as the finding is being 112 reversed on the ground that material circumstances had been ignored by the High Court. [134 F] In the instant case, there is no question of giving any equities to the vendee even if some of the amount paid by the vendee to some of the creditors of the Karta were genuine. [134 G] 3 The finding that the consideration for the sale deed was thoroughly inadequate, is correct and the sale therefore cannot be upheld. [138 D] 
 4. ID order to uphold an alienation of a joint Hindu family property by the father or the manager it is not only necessary to prove that there was a legal necessity but also that the father or the manager acted like a prudent man and a did not sacrifice the property for an inadequate consideration. [137 H-138 A] In the instant case, the Karta had contracted the debt in connection with his new personal business and to clear all those debts he has executed the sale deed. The debt in question was an antecedent debt so far as his sons were concerned, and therefore, they were under a pious obligation to pay all those debts. It was open to the father to execute a sale deed in respect of the shares of his sons also unless it was shown that the debt was tainted with immorality or was for an illegal purpose. The case of the sons was not that the debt was contracted for an illegal or immoral purpose. The sale would therefore be binding on the sons of the Karta. With regard to the sons of the Karta's brother, the same is however not the position. In view of the factual position that the lungi business was the individual or private business of the Karta it could not be said that his brother had alienated the joint family property in the capacity as father of his sons for discharging any antecedent debt incurred by him merely because he had also joined the Karta in executing the sale. The share of the sons of the brother could not therefore have been alienated by the Karta for discharging antecedent debts. [135 E-H] 
 5. Ext. B-54, an inland letter dated 27th July, 1954 was written by the Karta in Telugu to Veeraswami Naidu, and is the most important document supporting the vendors. This letter has been relied upon by the trial Court but has been discarded by the High Court. If this letter is proved to be genuine it gives a death blow to the case of the vendees.
 This letter which bore postal stamps could not have been fabricated. The observation of the High Court that it might have been written subsequently is a conjecture. No such case was even set up by the vendees in the written statement or in the evidence. The High Court attached undue importance to the fact that if Ext. 54 reached the addressee on the 4th August, 1955 then Exts. B-20 and B-48 could not have been prepared on the 30th July, 1955. The difficulty is solved if a reference is made to the last paragraph of the letter. The addressee was informed that they were coming to meet D.W. 12 the next day. There was, therefore nothing improbable in the preparation of these two documents on 30th July, 1955. [123 B-C, 126 A, 125 H, 126 B-C] 
 6. The observation of the High Court that there was no necessity for the Karta and his brother to bring into existence fictitious promissory notes in favour of D.W. 3 and D.W. 12 as they could have easily mentioned the other undisputed 113 debts owed by them to support the recital of the consideration in the sale deed, A also does not hold good because there is ample evidence on record to warrant the conclusion that the promissory notes in favour of W. 3 and D.W. 12, were fictitious. Most of the debts have neither been referred lo in the deed of agreement for sale nor in the sale deed and it was purposely done. If the aforesaid circumstances had been taken into consideration the High Court could have had no difficulty in accepting Ext. 54 as genuine. [126 G-127 A] In the instant case, the new business of lungi started by the Karta ended in a loss. There was pressure from the creditors for the discharge of the debts. As a prudent man, he would have liked to save his property to the extent he possibly could and pay off the various debts incurred by him. Curiously enough the Karta and his brother sold away the entire landed property of about 47 acres, leaving behind only an acre, and a house, owned by the joint family for a petty sum of Rs. 16,500. Out of the total consideration of Rs. 16,500 the vendees were asked to discharge the various debts. All the debts incurred by the Karta were not shown in Ext. B-S and Ext. B-4 the deed of agreement. [127 C-D] 
 7. The stipulation in the sale deed that the vendee pay off only the secured debts and clear off the other ordinary debts at their leisure itself indicates that there was no anxiety on the part of the vendors to clear of all the debts. It is also not clear why the vendors should adopt such an attitude. These circumstances speak for themselves.
 They indicate that the vendees persuaded the Karta to execute a sale deed of almost his entire family property under the pretext of assistance to him with the stipulation that they would re-convey the property to the vendors after the pressure from the creditors was over. [128 C-E] 8(i) The legal position under the Hindu Law about the pious liability of the sons to discharge the antecedent debts of the father is quite clear. A natural guardian of a Hindu minor has power in the management of his estate to mortgage or sell part thereof in case of necessity or for the benefit of the estate. If the alienee does not prove any legal necessity or that he does not made reasonable enquiries, the sale is invalid. But the father in a joint Hindu Family may sell or mortgage the joint family property including the sons' interest therein to discharge a debt contracted by him for his own personal benefit and such alienation binds the sons provided: (a) the debt was antecedent to the alienation, and (b) it was not incurred for any immoral purpose. (ii) "Antecedent" debt means antecedent in fact as well as in time. The debt must be independent of and not part of the transactions impeached.
 The debt may be a deb; incurred In connection with a trade started by the father. The father alone can alienate the sons' share in the case of joint family. The privilege of alienating the whole of joint family property for payment of an antecedent debt is a privilege only of the father, grandfather and great grandfather qua the son or grandson only. No other person has any such privilege. [134 H-135 B, D-E] Sidheshwar Mukherjee v. Bhubneshwar Prasad Narain Singh and Ors. [1953] INSC 54; [1954] SCR 177; Brij Narain v. Mangla Prasad and ors, L.R. 51 I.A. 129. Shanmukam v. Nachu Ammal A.I.R.
 (1937) Mad. 140; Dudh Nath v. Sat Narain Ram A.I.R. (1966) All. 315, referred to.
 114 The validity of an alienation made to discharge an antecedent debt rests upon the pious duty of the son to discharge his father's debt not tainted with immorality.
