 The account books of the respondent for the assessment year 1952-53 showed three sums of Rs. 2,50,000, Rs. 1,50,000 and Rs. 30,000 as borrowed from parties in Nepal. The income- tax Officer added these amounts to the total income of the assessee as secret income falsely shown as loans. The Income-tax Officer noted that the assessee had withdrawn at Calcutta on March 31, 1952 a sum of Rs. 5,30,000 from a Calcutta Bank and had sent a sum of Rs. 5,85,000 to his Forbesganj branch on the same day to enable that branch to pay Rs. 2,50,000 to one of the creditors. The transfer of the money from Calcutta to Forbesganj on the same day was considered by the Income-tax Officer to be a physical impossibility. When the matter was in appeal before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, the latter not only confirmed the addition of the -aforesaid loan amounts to the income of the assessee but also held that the sum of Rs.
 5,85,000 transferred from Calcutta to the Forbesganj branch was also unexplained income of the assessee and after making allowance for an earlier withdrawal added a further sum of RS. 4,05,000 on this account to the assessed income of the respondent. The Tribunal held that the Appellate Assistant Commissioner had power to enhance the income as he did but reduced the enhancement to Rs. 1,55,000. The High Court however held, in -reference, that the Appellate Assistant Commissioner had no power to make the addition as the sum of Rs. 5,85,000 had not been considered by the Income-tax Officer for the purpose of assessment. In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The High Court was right. The power of enhancement given to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner by s. 31(3) of the Income-tax Act, 1922 is restricted to the sources of income which have been the subject-matter of consideration by the Income-tax Officer from the point of view of taxability. In this context 'consideration' does not mean 'incidental' or 'collateral' examination of any matter by the Income-tax Officer .in the process of assessment. [516G] In the present case it was manifest that the Income-tax Officer had not considered the entry of Rs. 5,85,000 from the point of view of its taxability and therefore the Appellate Assistant Commissioner had no jurisdiction in an appeal under s. 31 of the Act to enhance the assessment.
