 Section 2(d) of the Bihar Taxation on Passengers and Goods (carried by Public Service Motor Vehicles) Act, 1961, defines "owner" as the owner of a public service motor vehicle and includes the holder of a permit under the Motor Vehicles-Act, 1939, in respect of a public service motor vehicle or any person for the time being in charge of such vehicle or responsible for the management of the place of business of such owner. Section 3(2) of the Act provides that every owner shall pay to the State Government the amount of tax due under s. 3. Sub-Section 3 provides that every passenger carried by a public service motor vehicle and every person whose goods are carried by such vehicle shall be liable to pay to the owner the amount of tax payable under s. 3 and every owner would recover such tax from such owner or person as the case may be.
 There are identical provisions in the different State Acts. The term "operator" used in some Acts, instead of the word "owner", means any person whose name is entered in the permit as the permit-holder or any person having the possession or control of such vehicle.
 In a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution it was contended that the words "or any person for the time being in charge of such vehicle" in the definition of "owner" mean that if there are two types of owners for a particular vehicle, it will be the owner who transports the goods carried by the vehicle who is responsible to pay the tax.
 Dismissing the petition, ^ 
 HELD : The liability to pay tax is of the permit-holder in all cases. The permit-holder is the owner within the definition of the word "owner" in the Bihar and other State Acts and is also the "operator" within the meaning of the word "operator" in other Acts. [817G-H] (1) The definition of the term "owner" is exhaustive and intended to extend the meaning of the term by including within its sweep bailee of a public carrier vehicle or any manager acting on behalf of the owner. The intention of the Legislature to extend the meaning of the term by the definition given by it will be frustrated if what is intended to be inclusive is interpreted to exclude the actual owner. [815H] (2) The words "or any person for the time being in charge of such vehicle or responsible for the management of the place of business of such owner" indicate that the permit-holder will include any person who is in charge of such vehicle or any person who is responsible for the management of the place of business of such owner. The owner cannot escape the liability by stating that any person is for the time being in charge of such vehicle and, therefore such person is the owner and not the permit-holder. [815E] (3)(a) Once it is found that the Legislature levies tax on passengers and goods carried by public service motor vehicles, it becomes the responsibility of the owner of the vehicle not to permit the vehicle to be used until the tax is paid. [816D] (b) The operational arrangement has no relevance to the liability to taxation. The person who allows his vehicle to be used for the purpose of carrying goods or passengers is the permit-holder and, therefore, the liability to pay tax attaches to the permit-holder as the owner of the vehicle.
 The fact that 810 these licensed agents have to furnish the operators with correct figures of freight-receivable by them shows not only that they are accountable to the owners or operators but also that licensed agents are not the owners or operators.
 [816C; 817E] (c) Section 59 and 61 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, indicate that a permit cannot be transferred. [817G]
