 The respondents are members' clubs. They supply refreshments in the form of 'food, snacks and beverages to their members or their guest S to be paid for by the members. The articles necessary for this purpose are purchased by the clubs in the market out of club funds which consisted of the subscription of the members. The preparations are made within the club premises and are supplied to members at fixed prices. On the question whether the clubs are "dealers" liable to sales tax under the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1959, 
 HELD : (Per Full Court) As no transaction of sale was involved there could be no levy of sales tax under the provisions of the Act.
 (Per Hidayatullah, C. J. Hegde, Grover, Ray and Dua, JJ.) The State Legislature is only competent to legislate on taxes on sale or purchase of goods under Entry 54, List 11 of the 7th Schedule to the Constitution. If there is no transfer of property from one to another there is no sale which would be exigible to tax, in spite of the definition of 'sale' in S.2(n) read with Exp. I of the Act. [686G] In proprietary clubs where some of the shareholders are not members or some of the members are not shareholders, the members are not owners of, nor interested in, the property of the clubs. Unlike proprietary clubs the case of a members' club is analogous to that of an agent investing his own monies for preparing things for the consumption of the principal and later recouping himself for the expenses incurred. Therefore, in the present case, even though the clubs are distinct legal entities they were ,Only acting as agents for members in the matter of supply of various pre- parations to them and no sale would be involved as the element of transfer would be completely absent.

 681 (Per Shah, J. concurring) : The analogy of cases decided under the Licensing Act in the United Kingdom concerning the supply by clubs of alcoholic drinks to their members is not appropriate. Whether refreshments, beverages and other articles supplied by members' club for consideration, to its members, are in law sold depends upon the, circumstances in which the transaction takes place. in each case the liability to tax -of the transaction will depend upon its strictly legal form. If an incorporated members' club supplies its property to its members at a fixed tariff-the transaction would readily be deemed to be one for sale, even if the transaction is on a non-profit basis; such a transaction would be liable to sales tax. Where, however, the club is merely acting on behalf of the members to make available to them refreshments, beverages and other arti- cles, the transaction will not be regarded as a sale, for the club is the agency through which the members have arranged that the refreshments, beverages and other articles should be made available. The test in each case is whether the club transfers property belonging to it for a price or the club acts as an agent for making available property belonging to its members.

 In the present case on the findings recorded, the respondents were not transferring property belonging to them but were merely acting as agents for and on behalf of the members and hence, the transactions were not sales and could not therefore be subject to sales tax under the Act. [688 D]
