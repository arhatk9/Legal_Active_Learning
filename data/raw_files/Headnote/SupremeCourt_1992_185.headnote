 In the writ petitions and the appeals similar questions were raised against the validity of some of the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Debt Relief Act, 1980 and the Karnataka Debt Relief Act, 1976.
 The petitioners/appellants contended that they being money-lenders and pawn brokers, their business was not related to agricultural indebtedness; that the State Legislatures were incompetent to make any law granting any relief of non-agricultural indebtedness, adversely affecting their interest, that those provisions of the Tamil Nadu and Karnataka Acts which purported to extinguish the debts of all kinds incurred by small farmers, landless labour and persons belonging to weaker class were ultra vires of Articles 14 and 19(1)(f),(g).
 The appellants in C.A.No.1326 of 1979 also contended that the impugned provisions were violative of the guarantee under Article 722 19(1)(f),(g) of the Constitution, as the Karnataka Act was passed before 19(1)(f) was omitted from the Constitution' that it was a constitutional policy for entrusting only such matters concerning agriculture to the State and leaving the remaining field either for the Union's list I or the Concurrent List III' that as a result of the proclamation of Emergency, the enforcement of the fundamental rights was suspended but the rights themselves did not disappear; that when the Emergency was withdrawn, the impediment by way of suspension of the enforcement of the rights disappeared and the Act, if found to be in violation of the fundamental rights had to be declared ultra vires; that as a direct result of the Karnataka Act a particular class of debts automatically disappeared and the creditors were deprived of their right to hold their property in the shape of the loan due to them.
 Dismissing the writ petitions, appeals and Special Leave Petition, this Court 
 HELD : 1.01. The cardinal rule of interpretation that words should be read in their ordinary, natural and grammatical meaning is subject to this rider that while construing a constitutional document conferring legislative power the most liberal construction should be put upon the words so that the same may have effect in their widest amplitude. [727G] 1.02. None of the items on the Lists is to be read in a narrow or restricted sense, and that each general word should be held to extend to all ancillary or subsidiary matter which can fairly and reasonably be said to be comprehended in it.

 1.03. The purpose of inclusion of the subsequent words in entry No. 30 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution was to illustrate the scope and the object of the legislation envisaged by the opening 723 expression. The latter part serves another purpose also.
 [729B] 1.04. There was some scope for controversy as to the area covered by an entry limited to the first part of the present Entry No.30. [729C] 1.05. The decision giving a wide meaning to the expression could not be binding on the Supreme Court and so long the matter was not finally settled by this Court, the courts in the meantime could have been flooded by unnecessary litigation. This has been avoided by including the second part which should be treated as illustrating the scope and object of the legislation in the first part. [729D] 1.06. The second part has been included by way of abundant caution. The use of the word "relief" is also conscious so as to emphasise the wide range of order which can be passed bestowing benefits on the debtors of various kinds. Taking a hypothetical case where the debtor has received grains as loan on a condition to return the same in large quantity, it is open to the legislature to reduce the burden of the debtor by providing for a monetary relief to be calculated in a particular manner. [729E] 1.07. The word "indebtedness" by itself also could have given occasion for controversy on the ground of vagueness; but in the context it has been mentioned in the Entry, there is no room for doubt left. [79F] 1.08. There is no merit in the argument of the learned counsel that a scheme was adopted in the Constitution with respect to distribution of the subjects in the three lists to the Seventh Schedule, and that the State legislature was entrusted only with agricultural matters. The large number of entries in List II negative such an inference. [729G] A.L.S.P.P.L. Subrahmanyam Chettiar v. Muttuswami Goundan, (1940) FCR 188; Bank of Commerce Ltd. v.

 2.01. So far sub-clause(g) of Article 19(1) is concerned the impugned law is not putting any restriction on the carrying of the business at all.
 724 What it purports to do is to relieve the burden only of a category of debtors, who by reason of their poverty deserve assistance. [731G] 2.02. Both the Acts of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka have identifiled this group in need of help. The liability of the other debtors is untouched. The legislative measures, thus taken, are clearly in furtherance of the directive principles of the State policy as mentioned in Part IV of the Constitution, specially Article 39 and are protected by the provisions of clauses (5) and (6) of Article 19. [731H- 732A] 2.03. The issue cannot be decided merely be examining the past conduct of those who are chosen for relieving the burden of an under-privileged class. [732C] 2.04. With a view to secure social and economic justice, the matter has to be examined from the standpoint of the interest of the general public and the standard of reasonableness will very form age to age and be related to the adjustments necessary to solve the problems which communities face from time to time. The unfortunate plight of that section of the people who, placed socially and economically at a disadvantage, land themselves in debt trap is well-known for ages. [732D] 2.05. The State legislatures by enacting the laws under consideration are only fulfilling their obligation by extending social justice to them. In the Karnataka Act the group deserving the protection, has been identified as either a small farmer, or a landless agricultural labourer, or a person belonging to the weaker section of the people;
 and with a view to avoid any vagueness these three sub- classes have been precise definitions in the spirit in which the statute has been passed. It is natural to expect that the debts, thus covered by the beneficial provisions must have been smaller than those left untouched. [732E] 2.06. Section 3 of the Tamil Nadu Act has also limited the benefits of the laws to the less privileged section of the society. The debtors, placed comparatively in better economic circumstances, contracting loans due to extravagant habits or for urgently meeting some sudden demand or for similar reason have been deprived from the benefits of the Acts. This is a matter of policy to be decided by the State.
 The legislature is presumed to be in a position to appreciate the needs of the people and to judge as to what remedial reforms are called for. [732G] 725 2.07. In interpreting the constitutional provisions for judging the impact of an enactment on the fundamental rights of the citizen, the court has to take into account the social setting of the country, the increasing needs of the nation, the burning problems of the day and the complex issue facing the people which the legislature in its wisdom seeks to solve through beneficial legislation; and the judicial approach in this should be dynamic rather than static, pragmatic rather than pedantic and elastic rather than rigid. [733A] 2.08. The temper of the times and the living aspirations and the feelings of the people must be taken into consideration while striking a just balance between the fundamental rights and the larger and broader interests of society. Judged from this angle both the Act have to be upheld by virtue of clauses (5) of Article 19. [733B] Pathumma and others v. State of Kerala and others[1978] INSC 7; , [1978] 2 SCR 537, referred to.
