 Respondent no. 3 obtained a decree for permanent injunction restraining the State of U.P. and its Forest Department from interfering with his rights of cutting trees on a plot of land. Later on 'X' filed a suit and obtained a temporary injunction restraining respondent no.3 from cutting and removing trees from her plot under the guise of the injunction obtained by him. Thereafter 'X' reported to the District Senior Superintendent of Police about the disobedience of the temporary injunction; and ultimately the appellant, who was the Station House Officer of the area, seized certain logs of wood said to have been cut and removed from the plot of 'X'. Respondent no.3, moved the executing court under Order 21, Rule 32, C.P.C. impleading the S.S.P and the S.H.O., the appellant, and alleged that their action amounted to obstruction and was in defiance of the injunction granted in his favour. The objections filed by the S.S.P. and the appellant were dismissed and their properties were directed to be attached. On revision, the District Judge modified the attachment order absolving the S.S.P. of the obstruction.
 The appellant, after unsuccessfully challenging the orders of the civil courts in writ petition before the High Court, filed the appeal by special leave to this Court, Allowing the appeal and setting aside the orders of the High Court and of both the civil courts, this court, 184 
 HELD: 1. The provision of Order 21 Rule 32(1) C.P.C is applicable to a party against whom a decree for injunction had been passed, [p.186A-B] 
 2. The word 'party' occurring in Order 21 Rule 32(1), C.P.C. cannot be construed so liberally as to include each and every employee of the State to have been a party to the suit in which the injunction was passed . The intention manifested in the provision seems to confine the rigour to the party who had contested the suit and had suffered the decree and it is that pary when obstructing is liable of being detained in the civil prison, or suffer attachment of his property, or both. [p. 186C-D] 3.1 Although the Forest Department of the State of U.P.
 and the State of U.P were parties, and, being an employee of the State of U.P., the appellant was in an indirect way bound by the injunction, yet it cannot be said that he was by himself a party to the suit as such against whom the said decree was passed. [p.186B-C] 
 3.2 The appellant was not a party to the suit in which the injunction was granted. He need not suffer action under Order 21 Rule 32 C.P.C. or to remain under threat of attachment of his property, more so when he is no longer available at the scene to obstruct any more or to expose his property to such supposed attachment. [p.186B & D-E]
