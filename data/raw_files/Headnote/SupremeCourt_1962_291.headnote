 The assessee were members of a joint Hindu family who carried on the vocation of Pandas or priests who assisted devotees in performing worship and ceremonies connected with the pilgrimage to the temple of jagannath at Puri. They collected from the pilgrims amounts of money known as Annadan under writings called Annadan Patras signed by the pilgrims. The claimed that the offerings of Annadan were exempt from Income-tax under ss. 4 (3) (i) and (ii) of the Indian Income-tax Act,. 1922. because they were received by them on condition of utilising the same for the Bhog (food offering) in the temple of jagannath and were, therefore, income derived from property held under a trust and, in any event, income of a religious institution derived from voluntary contributions applicable solely to religious purposes. The income-tax authorities rejected the claim and held that the amount was liable to tax. The Appellate.
 Tribunal found that the money paid by the pilgrims as Annadan was not used for the exclusive purpose of offering Bhog, that the said amounts were earned by the assessees in the conduct of their business as Pandas, that the facts did not indicate that any trust was intended or created by the pilgrims. and that the assessees were not art institution.
 The 'Tribunal accordingly held that the assessees were not exempt under s. 4 (3) (ii) of the Act from liability to pay income-tax. On a reference under s. 66 (2) of the Act, the High Court took the view that it was not necessary to, decide the question whether the contributions made through Annadan Patras by the donor would amount to a trust, that even if it be assumed that a religious trust was created it was only a private 668 religious trust and that, therefore, the income of the assessees derived from the source was not exempt from liability to tax under ss. 4 (3) (i) and (ii) -of the Act.
 Held, that the amounts received by the assessees under the Annadan Patres were not exempt from tax under ss. 4 (3) (i) and (ii) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 since on the findings of the Tribunal, they -were not applicable exclusively to purposes religious or charitable.
 Held, further, that the High Court erred in ignoring the finding of the Appellate Tribunal that there was no trust and in coming to a conclusion, on the asumption that a trust was intended to be created by the pilgrims, that the trust was a private trust.
 Under the scheme of the Indian Income-tax Act the function of determining facts rests with the Tribunal and on the facts found the High court has to advise the Tribunal as to the law applicable. In the present case, the High Court attempted to exercise not the advisory jurisdiction ;in respect of the decision of the Tribunal which alone is conferred by s. 166 (2) of the Act, but jurisdiction which in substance was appellate.
