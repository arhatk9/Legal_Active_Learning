 A letter-petition, and an application, containing allegations of unauthorised and illegal mining in the Mussoorie-Dehradun belt, affecting adversely the ecology and environmental order of the area, were directed to be registrered as writ petitions under public interest litigation. Apart from the Governments of the Union and of Uttar Pradesh, several governmental agencies and mining lessees appeared in the proceedings. A number of committees and working groups were set up both by the Court and the Central Government to look into the various aspects of the problem, their reports received and several comprehensive interlocutory directions issued.
 One of the Committees, referred to as the Bhargava Committee, classified the mines into three groups, being A, B, C. On the basis of the recommendations of the Bhargava Committee Report and other material the Court directed, by its order dated 12th March, 1985, that category mines of the Bhargava Committee Report should be closed down permanently. Similar order was made in regard to category mines situated in the shasradhara block. The Court further directed category mines located within the Mussoorie municipal limits and the remaining B category mines to submit their mining scheme for scrutiny of the Bandyopadhyay Committee. The Court, however, allowed category mines located outside the city limits to operate.
 PG NO 690 PG NO 691 Some of the mines which were ordered to be closed down had earlier been refused renewal of their mining licences.
 These mines, however, continued to operate under the orders of various courts which had granted extension of their leases pending the final orders of the courts. This Court, in its order dated 12th March, 1985 had therefore, directed that if any mining lessee of a mine, which had been ordered to be closed down, was running under the first grant or under Court's orders after its expiry, it would not be entitled to take advantage of that position.
 In its order dated 16th December, 1986 this Court recognised the need to strike a balance between preservation and utilisation of deposits, and urged the Government to take a policy decision in the matter. The Government thereupon set up another committee to examine the working of the limestone mining operations in the Doon valley. This Committee inspected six mines which were operating. Three of these mines were operating under valid mining leases and the other three, whose leases had expired in December 1982? were operating under orders of different courts.
 Keeping in view the reports of the committee and the submissions at the Bar, the Court passed further orders.
 On behalf of the lessees it was contended: (1) decision of this Court dated 12th March, 1985 was final in certain aspects including the release of the A category mines outside the city limits from the proceedings, and in view of such finality it is not open to this Court in the same proceedings at a later stage to direct differently in regard to what has been decided earlier; (2) during the pendency of these writ petitions, the Environment Protection Act of l986 has come into force and since that Statute and the Rules made thereunder provide detailed procedure to deal with the situations that arise in these cases, this Could should no more deal with the matter and leave it to be looked into by the authorities under the Act, and (3) there would be a total stalemate in the manufacture of drugs and sugar, as also steel,in case mining activity is stopped.
 Disposing of the writ petition, this Court, 
 HELD: (1) "Forest" was initially a State subject covered by Entry 19 in List II of the Seventh Schedule. In 1976, under the 42nd Amendment the Entry was deleted and Entry 17- A in the concurrent List was lnserted. The change from the State List to the Concurrent List was brought about PG NO 692 following the realisation of the Central Government that `forests' were of national importance and should be placed in the Concurrent List to enable the Central Government to deal with the matter. The same amendment of the Constitution brought in Article 48,A and Article 51A(g) is Part IVA.
 [713H; 714A-B] (2) The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 does not permit mining in the forest area. If mining activity even to a limited extent is permitted in future, it would be not congenial to ecology and environment, and the natural calm and peace which is a special feature of this area in its normal condition shall not be restored. This tourist zone in its natural setting would certainly be at its best if its serenity is restored in the fullest way. [7l0E-F] (3) By the Court's order of 12th March, l985, the A category mining leases outside the city limits were only exempted from further scrutiny and not released from the proceedings. If the court really intended to release the A category mines outside the city limits, it could very well pronounce that in clear terms. [706E-H] (4) The examination by this Court when it made the order of 12th March, 1985, omitted to consider the impact of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 which was then a statute in force. If the provision of the Conservation Act had been noticed and impact thereof for the continuance of mining activity bad been considered, perhaps the Court would have made no exemptions and no mining may have been permitted.
 [706G] (5) The writ petitions are not inter-party disputes and have been raised by way of public interest litigation, and the controversy before the Court is as to whether for safety and for creating a hazardless environment for the people to live in, mining in the area should be permitted or stopped.
 The Court may not be taken to have said that for public interest litigations, procedural laws do not apply. At the same time, it has to be remembered that every technicality in the procedural law is not available as a defence when a matter of grave public importance is for consideration before the Court. Even if it is said that there was a final order, in a dispute of this type it would be difficult to entertain the plea of res judicata. Leaving the question open for examination in future would lead to unnecessary multiplicity of proceedings and would be against the interest of society. [707B-D] (6) These writ petitions were filed more than three years before the Environment (Protection) Act, l986 came PG NO 693 into force. This Court appointed several expert commitees, received their reports and made directions. The several parties and their counsel have been heard for days together on different issues during the three and a quarter years of the pendency of the proceedings. The Environment (Protection) Act does does purport to- and perhaps could not--take away the jurisdiction of this Court to deal with a case of this type. In consideration of these facts, there is no justification to decline the exercise of jurisdiction at this stage. [707E-G] (7) Ordinarily, the Court would not entertain a dispute for the adjudication of which a special provision has been made by law but that rule is not attracted in the present situation in these cases. Besides it is a rule of practice and prudence and not one of jurisdiction. [707H] (8) The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 applies to renewals as well and even if there was a provision for renewal in the lease agreement on exercise of Lessee's option,the requirements of l980 Act had to be satisfied before such renewal could be granted. [717G-H] Ambica Quarry Works v. State of Gujarat & Ors., [1986] INSC 264; [1987] 1 SCC 213; State of Rajasthan v. Hari Shankar Rajindra Pal, [l965l 3 SCR 402 and State of Bihar v. Banshi Ram Modi, [l985] 3 SCC 643, referred to.
 (9) It is clear from the directions contained in the order of 12th March, 1985, as also the ratio of the judgment in the Ambica Quarry Works case, that even if there has been an order of the Court and no challenge is raised against such order, this Court could invoke its jurisdiction to nullify the direction or order, and if any order, direction or decree has been passed ignoring the provisions of the Conservation Act of 1980 the same would not be binding. [7l8B-C] (10) Parties have been heard on various aspects. An order made by this Court to nullify the decrees in such circumstances would not be violative of the principles of natural justice. [718F] (11) it any decree or order has already been obtained from any court relating to renewal of these leases, the same shall stand vacated, and similarly any appeal or other proceeding taken to obtain a renewal Or against order/decrees granting renewal shall also become nonest.
 [718G-H] (12) Most of these mines are either within reserved forests or in forest lands as covered by the U.P. Amendment of the Forest Act. To these areas the Forest Conservation PG NO 694 Act applies and to allow mining ia these areas even under strictest control as a permanent feature would not only be violative of the provisions of Forest (Conservation) Act but would be detrimental to restoration of the forest growth in a natural way in this area. Once the importance of forests is realised and as a matter of national policy and in the interests of the community, preservation of forests is accepted as the goal, nothing which would detract from that end should be permitted. In such circumstances, mining activity in this valley must be completely stopped. But such a situation will be available only after the original leases of the working mines are over. [726G-H; 727Al (13) The court accepts the position that manufacture of drugs and sugar, as steel, would be hard-hit if mining activity in this area is stopped all of a sudden. With the pressing demand in the market and discovery of useful limestone deposits in other parts of the country apart from what has been indicated in the second affidavit of the Union of India, the trade would adjust itself as every economic activity does. However, the position should be monitored and the switch-over from the present position to a total ban should be spread over a period and not be sudden. [727D-E] (14) In the circumstances, allowing the three on-going mines to operate for their initial period of lease is the most appropriate direction that can be given during the switch over from the present position to one of complete closing down of mining operation. [730C-H] (15) There is no dispute that continuance of mining operations effects environment and ecology adversely and at the same time creates a prejudicial situation against conservation of forests. It is, therefore, necessary that each of these working mines shall have to work with an undertaking given to the Monitoring Committee that all care and attention shall be bestowed to preserve ecological and environmental balance while carrying on mining operations.
 [731D-E] (16) The Court ordered the setting up of the Monitoring Committee to look after reafforestation, mining activities and all other aspects necessary to bring about natural normalcy in the Doon Valley. The Court also issued directions regarding the finances, powers and duties of the Monitoring Committee. [733E] (17) The Court has no other option but to close down the mining activity in the broad interests of the community.
 This, however, does not mean that the displaced mine owners PG NO 695 should not be provided with alternative occupation. Pious observation or even a direction in that regard may not be adequate. What is necessary is a time frame functioning if rehabilitation is to be made effective. It is, therefore, necessary that a Committee should be set up to oversee the rehabilitation of the displaced mine owners. [732B-C]
