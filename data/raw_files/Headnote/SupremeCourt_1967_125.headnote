 Section 2(c) of the Bengal Finance (Sales-tax) Act, 1941 defines a "dealer" as meaning any person who carries on the business of selling goods in West Bengal and as including the Government. The appellant was a widespread Organisation of the Government of India set up for the disposal of surplus American war equipment which included goods of at diversity and which 'had been taken over by the Government of India after the Second World War. The Government of India received the equipment free of cost. A part of the equipment was appropriated by the Government of India to their own use, some equipment was sold to the State Governments and other autonomous bodies, and the rest was sold to the public. The sales were spread over a number of years and goods of the value of several lakhs had been sold in auctions held from time to time after advertising in newspapers.
 On the question whether the appellant was a "dealer" and therefore liable to pay sales-tax, 
HELD : (Per Sikri and Ramaswami JJ.) : In disposing of the goods the appellant was not carrying on the business of selling goods, and therefore, the appellant was not a "dealer" within the meaning of s. 2(c) of the Act, and, the transactions of sale were not liable to be taxed under the Act. The appellant was not selling the goods for profit but was merely disposing them of by way of realisation of capital. [786 B-D] Commissioner of Taxes v.

 Per Shah J. (dissenting) : It could be inferred from the totality of circumstances that the appellant was not merely realising capital, but was carrying on business, and was therefore a dealer within the meaning of s. 2(c) of the Act and liable to he assessed to sales-tax. [780 A, H] It cannot be said that because the Government of India received the equipment free, of cost it could not set up a business to dispose of that equipment. There was an organised course of activity which was systematic and with the set purpose of making profit and the tests of volume.
