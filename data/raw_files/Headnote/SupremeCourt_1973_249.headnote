 The detention order served on the petitioner stated that on three different dates he along with his associates was found to have smuggled rice to the rationing areas of Hoogly and Howrah and violently attacked the anti-smuggling party and disrupted the smooth running of the train service. The representation of the detenu was received by the State Government on June 2, 1973. The State Government rejected the representation on June 4, 1973 and forwarded the same to the Advisory Board. The Advisory Board by their report dated July 11, 1973, held that there was sufficient cause for the detention of the petitioner. On July 30, 1973, the State Government confirmed the order of detention. The detention was inter (alia challenged on the ground of delay and vagueness of grounds.
 Dismissing the writ petition, 
HELD : (1) The State Government received the representation on June 2, 1973 and rejected the same on June 4, 1973.
 There was no delay in the disposal of the representation by the State Government. There was also no inordinate delay although a period of more than ten days had elapsed from the date of submission of the representation and its actual disposal. [804 H] (2)The mere fact that the detention order is on a cyclostyled sheet wherein necessary particulars were filled in ink would not go to show that the particulars in ink were filled subsequent to the signing of the detention order.
 There was no evidence to prove the allegation. [805 C] (3)The date, time and place of each of the incidents were specified in the grounds. Particulars were also given regarding the nature of the activities of the petitioner.
 The facts stated in the grounds of detention were sufficient to apprise the petitioner of the precise activities on account of which the detention order had been made. The fact that the names of the associates of the petitioners were not mentioned in the grounds of detention would not go to show that they suffered from the infirmity of vagueness.
 The Courts look with disfavour upon vague rounds of detention, because such grounds fail to convey to the detenu the precise activity on account of which he is being detained so as to enable him to make an effective representation. [806C]
