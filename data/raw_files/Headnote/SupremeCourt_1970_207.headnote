 The appellant was convicted. by the Trial Court for offences under Sections 326 and 324 I.P.C. for having voluntarily caused grievous hurt with a dangerous weapon to one person, and for causing hurt to three other persons. He was sentenced to imprisonment for four years for his conviction under Section 326 and for 11/2 years for each of the three offences under Section 324, all sentences to run concurrently. The appellant filed an appeal against his conviction to the High Court at Bombay but his appeal was dismissed by the Court with one word "dismissed".
 In appeal to this Court by special leave under Article 136, it was contended on behalf of the appellant that the injuries complained of were inflicted by him in the exercise of his lawful and legitimate right of self-defence. It was also contended that the statements of three of the eye witnesses made in the committing Court from which they had:
 resiled at the trial should not have been acted upon by the Trial Court in support of the prosecution version; and that the only witness who did not resile from the statement in the committing Court was a highly interested witness in that he was the person on whom injuries were stated to,. have been inflicted by the appellant; therefore his evidence should not have been implicitly accepted.
 
HELD : dismissing the appeal, (i) On the evidence, the plea of self defence taken by the appellant could not be sustained. Furthermore the statements of the three witnesses in the committing court from which they resiled at the trial and which were duly brought on the record of the trial court under Section 288 Cr. P.C. constituted substantive evidence and if the court was satisfied that those statements were true whereas those made in the trial court were untrue, then the earlier statements could safely be relied upon to sustain the conviction. In this case a mere reading of the statements at the trial demonstrated their unconvincing nature and it was clear that there was some ulterior motive for the witnesses to resile from the earlier statements which appeared to have a ring of truth about them. The trial court was therefore right in convicting the appellant for offences under Ss. 326 and 324 I.P.C. [536 B-D] (ii) On reading the judgment of the learned Additional Sessions Judge and the memorandum of the grounds of appeal in the High Court it was clear that the summary dismissal of the appeal by the High Court with one word "dismissed" without indicating its views on the points raised in the appeal which appeared to be arguable was not right. This 5 3 0 Court has repeatedly pointed out that when an appeal to the High Court under the Code of Criminal Procedure raises some arguable points, the High Court would be well-advised to give some indication of the reasons for its view while repelling those points. Without having the benefit of the opinion of the High Court, this Court is likely to feel embarrassed in dealing with those points on appeal by special leave. [530 H-531 C] Mustak Hussein, v. The State of Bombay, [1953] INSC 26; [1953] S.C.R. 809 at 820 and Challappa Ramaswami v. State of Maharashtra [1970] (2) S.C.R. 426; referred to.
 Section 410 Cr.P.C. confers a right of appeal to the High Court on a person convicted on a trial held by a Sessions Judge or an Additional Sessions Judge. This right entitles the aggrieved party to challenge conclusions of facts and to claim reappraisal of evidence. It would, therefore, be conducive to the ends of justice if the High Courts were as a general rule to let this Court have the benefit of their valuable opinion in cases which raise arguable points whether on facts or on law so as to enable this Court satisfactorily to exercise its power under Art. 136 and dispose of the appeal finally. [in order to avoid further delay in the disposal of the present case the Court decided to go into the evidence-a course this Court is normally reluctant to adopt in appeals under Art. 136-because this case prima facie raised arguable points]. [531 D-F] (iii) Although this Court would not normally interfere with the quantum of sentences on appeal under Art. 136, in the present case as the High Court had erroneously dismissed the appeal summarily without giving the reasons, this was a fit case where this Court on a consideration of the relevant circumstances could go into the question of sentences itself (the Court field that the sentence of two years imprisonment would meet the ends of justice).
