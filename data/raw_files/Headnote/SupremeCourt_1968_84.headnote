 The petitioners who were working as Assistants were by the operation of the Railway Board's Secretariat Clerical Service (Reorganisation) Scheme reverted as Upper Division Clerks in 1967. The said scheme was framed on February 5, 1957 but was brought into effect from December 1, 1954.
 Certain modifications to the scheme relating to the manner of filling up of permanent and temporary vacancies in Grade I of the Service were made in 1963. The petitioners came to this Court under Art. 32 of the Constitution challenging the orders of reversion passed against them as illegal. On behalf of respondents the orders were defended as being based on the order of seniority which had been refixed according to the said Scheme. The contentions advanced on behalf of the petitioners were : (i) That their promotion as Upper Division Clerks and later as Assistants had been on a permanent basis and could not be disturbed; (ii) That the Scheme as well as the various orders passed by the respon- dents were violative of Arts. 14 and 16 of the Constitution;
 (iii) That the second respondent (Railway Board) had no power in law, to frame either the Scheme, or the modified Scheme so as to have retrospective effect from December 1.
 1954.
 
HELD : (-i) The ranking given to the petitioners as a result of which the impugned orders of reversion were passed was in accordance with the Scheme as modified in 1963. On the facts, the contention of the petitioners that their appointment as Upper Division Clerks and later as Assistants was on a permanent basis, could not be accepted. [582 B-C] (ii) Once it was held that the petitioners did not satisfy the requirements of the scheme for being retained as Assistants there was no question of any discrimination under Art. 14 or violation of Art. 16 arising for consideration at all. [582 G] (iii) The Indian Railway Establishment Code has been issued by the President in exercise of the powers vested in him by the proviso to, Art. 309 of the Constitution.. Rule 157 of the Code gives the Railway Board full powers to make rules of a general application to non-gazetted railway servants under their control. If full effect is given to the words in Art. 309, namely 'and any rules so made shall have effect subject to the provisions of any such AcV, then in the absence of any Act as aforesaid, in the present case, the power to make rules with retrospective effect cannot be denied to the Railway Board. Accordingly the Scheme framed by the said Board in 1957 could be made retrospectively effective from Decemher 1, 1954. [583 E, 584 H, A-El State v.
