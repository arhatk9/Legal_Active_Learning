 Section 65 of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948, which was one of the Aots that had been included in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution, was amended by Bombay Act 13 of 1956, to give the State, the power of taking over the management of any land on the ground that full and efficient use of the land had not been made for purposes of agriculture for two consecutive years, for reasons not beyond the holder's control. Under s. 65(2), on the assumption of management, the provisions of Chapter IV of the Act which contains ss. 44 and 61 apply to such land mutatis mutandis. Under s. 61, the State Government may renounce the management when it is satisfied that it is no longer necessary.
 The appellants were for several years cultivating their land by ploughing it, sowing therein good seeds of grass and cutting the grass grown thereon and using it as fodder for their cattle. The concerned authority under the Act issued a notice to them to show cause why management of the land should not be taken over by the State. The appellants showed cause, but the concerned authority held that the land was cultivable, that grains and fruits could be grown on it, that therefore full and efficient its,-, ,of the land was, not made for two consecutive years and directed that the management of the land Should be taken over on behalf of the state. The appellants challenged the order in the High Court', but their petitions were dismissed.
 In appeal to this Court, on the question whether the amendment to s.65 is ultra vires and therefore the orders passed thereunder are illegal, 
HELD : The amendment to s. 65 is not protected from challenge by Arts. 31-A or 31-B of the, Constitution, and since the amendment confers arbitrary 'and unreasonable power on the concerned officer, it is ultra vires, and the orders passed thereunder, taking over management of the lands, could not be upheld.
 (1) Article 31A does not protect the amendment to the section.
 Article 31A(1) (a) deals with acquisition of an estate or rights therein, and extinguishment or modification of such rights, whereas Art. 3 1A(1) (b) specifically provides for management by the, State. Therefore, cl. (a) is not attracted and the matter should be considered in the light of cl. (b). But that clause can be invoked only if management of any property is taken over by the State in public interest or to secure proper management, for a limited period. Merely because there is a possibility of -a return of 43 the land to the original owner, it could not be said that the management was for a limited period. Section 61 itself, which provides for termination of management, does not set any time limit for the management. Moreover, though the provisions of Chapter IV are made applicable to lands whose management is taken over, so far as lands of non-landholders are concerned, it is under the rules that management is carried on Under r. 35, the manager makes a report after about a year to enable the Government to decide whether it is necessary to continue management or releaser the land.
 The management may be continued for periods of 5 years at a time on the strength of periodic reports, but, if management is to continue beyond 10 years, a formal inquiry is necessary before Government decides to continue the management. Thus, assuming that the rules read with s. 61 could indicate a limited period of management the rules, in fact, do not indicate such a time limit. Without a limit of time the management would be, an excuse for deprivation of property without compensation. Therefore the protection of Art. 31A(1)(b) is not ,available. [53F-54G; 55B, D-E, G-H] (2) Article 31B and the Ninth Schedule could not be called in aid to protect the amendment.
 (a) The Article gives protection to all the statutes listed in Schedule IX of the Constitution, but the impugned amendment was made after the Act was listed. Therefore, the amended section could not be said to have been considered when the Act was included in the Ninth Schedule. If the amended section is also accepted as unassailable, it will have The effect of the State Legislature doing something beyond its competence, namely, amending the Ninth Schedule by including something new in it. [52F] (b) The preamble to the Act and s. 44 have the protection of Art. 3 1B .and are made applicable by s. 65(2) to lands whose; management is taken over by the State. Even assuming by such applicability, that they give validity and protection to s. 65, such protection is given only to the unamended section, because, the preamble and s. 44 deal with lands of landholders, whereas, the impugned amendment to s.
 65, carries it into new fields by applying it to the lands of non-landholders also. [52G-H] (3) The amendment to s. 65 gives unguided power to the concerned officer. It is therefore ultra vires and the orders passed thereunder are invalid.
 Agriculture includes growing of grass, and other definitions emphasise the need of growing grass by including the operation in the word 'cultivation'. Grass is as important for agricultural communities as foodgrains and fruits, and therefore the Act gives importance to both. There is nothing to show from an agrarian point of view that grass grown on the lands in question was not necessary at all or that it was being inefficiently grown. No objective tests are laid down for deciding when cultivation can be said to be efficient or when a different kind of cultivation can be imposed upon the land. A person is entitled to hold and enjoy his property as he thinks best, and if regard is to be had for the benefits of society a clear law and a clear determination are required, But, no provision is made for inquiry to determine the questions and no opportunity is given to the cultivator to change his cultivation from one kind to -another No criteria are laid down even with regard to management on behalf of the State as to when it is to be considered efficient. The officer concerned, purely on the basis of his subjective satisfaction had held that the and could grow grain or fruits. and on such opinion the land was to be taken away. [56G-57E] 44
