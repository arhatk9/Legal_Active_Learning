 The appellant filed two suits in the Court of the Civil Judge, one for declaration of his title to the suit property and the second for other reliefs. While these suits were pending the respondent instituted two suits in the Munsif's court against the appellant claiming joint ownership to the suit property and other reliefs. The four suits were tried together by the Civil Judge. Some of the issues were common to all the suits and one of the common issues relating to the title of the parties were found in favour of the respondent. The Civil Judge dismissed the appellant's title suit, decreed his other suit partly, and decreed the two suits of the respondent. The appellant filed appeals against teh decree in each suit. The High Court dismissed the two appeals arising out of the respondent's sutis, one as time barred, and the other for failure to apply for translation and printing of the record. As th title of the respondent to the suit property had become final on account of such dismissal, the respondent prayed for the dismissal of the other two appeals also, as the main question involved therein, was the same. The High court agreed that the appeals were barred by res judicata and dismissed them. against these orders of dismissal, the appellant filed appeals to this Court, and contended that (i) the title to the property was not directly-and substantially in issue in the respondent's suits; (ii) The Munsif's Court could not try the title suit filed by the appellant; (iii) it could not be said that appeals arising out of the respondent's suits were former suits and as such the decision therein would be res judicata and (iv) the two appeals dismissed-one on the ground of limitation, and the other on the ground of not printing the records, could not be said to be heard and finally decided.
 HELD : The appeals must be dismissed.
 (i)The contention that the issue as to title was not directly and substantially in issue in the respondent's suits must be rejected. The judgment of the Civil Judge showed that this issue was raised in the respondents suits, that it was directly and substantially in issue in those suits also, and did arise out of the pleadings of the parties. [306 C] (ii)It is the court which decides the former suit whose jurisdiction to the subsequent suit has to be considered, and not the court in which the former suit may have been filed. Though the respondent's suits may have been filed in the Munsif's court, they were transferred to the court of the Civil Judge and were decided by him. Therefore, the contention that the Munsif before whom the respondent's suits were filed, could not try the subsequent title suit of the appellant had no force. [306 E] (iii)The High Court's decision in the two appeals arising from the respondent's suits were undoubtedly earlier and therefore the condition that there should have been a decision in a former suit to give rise to res judicata in a subsequent suit was satisfied in the present case. [307 C] 301 Nahari v. Shanker, [1950] INSC 25; [1950] S.CR. 754, distinguished.
 (iv)Where the trial court has decided two suits having common issues on the merits and there are two appeals therefrom and one of them is dismissed on some preliminary ground, like limitation or default in printing, with the result that the trial court's decision stands confirmed, the decision of the appeal court will be res judicata and the appeal court must be deemed to have heard and finally decided the matter. In such a case the result of the decision of the appeal court is to confirm the decision of the trial court given on merits, and if that is so, the decision of the appeal court will be res judicata whatever may be the reason for the dismissal. It would be a different matter, however, where the decision of the appeal court does not result in the confirmation of the decision of the trial court given on the merits, as for example, where the appeal court hold that the trial court had no jurisdiction and dismisses the appeal, even though the trial court might have dismissed the suit on the merits.
