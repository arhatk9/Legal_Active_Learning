 The respondent firm carried on business in hides and skins in Madras. For the assessment year 1953-54 they applied for a licence under s. 5 of the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939. The Commercial Tax Officer relying on a judgment of the Madras High Court held that the respondent was not liable to tax and made a 'Nil' assessment. The order was however not communicated to the respondent. The aforesaid judgment of the Madras High Court was later reversed by this Court. The Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes Madras, being of the view that the order of 'nit' assessment relating to 1953-54 was illegal commenced proceedings under s. 32 of the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1959 and thereafter assessed the respondent. The Sales Tax Tribunal confirmed the order of Commercial Tax Officer. The High Court in revision held that since the Commercial Tax Officer had not communicated his order to the assessee the time for appeal had not expired and therefore the Deputy Commissioner had no power to revise the order under s. 32 of the Act of 1939. The State appealed.
 
HELD : In the present case no tax was assessed, not even the taxable turnover was determined. No appeal could therefore lie under s. 11 of the Act of 1939 against the order of 'Nil' assessment. There was thus no bar against the exercise of jurisdiction of the Deputy Commissioner under s.
 32(1) to commence Proceedings of re-assessment. [621D] M/s. M.A. Noor Mohamed & Company v. State of Madras & Anr., A.I.R. 1957 Mad. 33 and State of Madras & Anr. v. Mls. M.
