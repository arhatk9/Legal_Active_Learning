 A business family consisting of a father and four sons carried on business. Dispute arose in this family regarding the division of the business. P.P., the father, J.P., V.P., 
 Engineers. It has tow factories, the latter at Maneja and the former at Pratapnagar. The dispute between two group P.P. & J.P on the one hand, and B.P. & G.P. on the other, was in regard to the equal division of the assets and liabilities for the two businesses o the retirement of P.P & J.P. from the firm as per the terms of a "deed of dissolution" dated 31.12.1979 executed by and between the partners.
 This dispute was the subject matter of three civil suits. When one of the two interim order passed therein came up before this Court, this Court suggested that the disputes be settled by arbitration. This suggestion was accepted and the parties agreed that the "subject matter of the three suits as well as disputes relating to the dissolution deed" be referred to arbitration. The arbitrator was a retired Judge of the High Court. The arbitrators changed several times and eventually a retired Chief Justice of the High Court completed the arbitration, and made two awards: one, an interim award dated 22.2.91 and the other, the final award dated 18.7.91.
 In the appeal and interlocutory applications to this Court, P.P. and J.P. sought to have the award made the rule of Court except on two or three issues, while V.P. and G.P.
 sought to have the awards set aside in material respect, but were agreed that the Pratapnagar factory should be taken over by the former and the Maneja factory by the latter.
 On the question as to how far the aforesaid awards 2should be made a rule of Court, the issues involved were:
 
1. Valuation by the arbitrator of the land, raw material and semi finished goods at the two factories.
 
2. Interpretation by the arbitrator of the term of the deed of dissolution as to which of the parties should bear certain outstanding liabilities.
 
3. Findings of the arbitrator in regard to allegations of falsification of accounts and payments to traders and depositors;
 4. Arithmetical errors that have crept into the award;
 and 5. The liability to pay interest.
 Disposing of the appeal and interlocutory applications, this Court, 
HELD : RANGANATHAN AND V. RAMASWAMY, JJ. (PER RAN GANATHAN, J.) 
1. VALUATION (i) The deed of dissolution itself stipulated that the assets should be got valued by a Government approved valuer.
 A perusal of the award shows, that, though the arbitrator made reference to the report of Patel - the "Government" valuer - and its objectively, he has indicated sufficient grounds for fixing the values in the manner he has done. He rejected the instances of sale cited by the applicants. So far as Jaiswal - expert witness - was concerned, he found that there was not much difference between the "base" value for lands in the locality suggested by Patel (Rs.25) and Jaiswal (Rs. 30). He found that the ground given by Jaiswal for additions thereto were not tenable and as between the base value of Rs. 25 and Rs. 30, he had accepted the former.
 He has also given reasons for preferring Patel's valuation of Rs. 4.50 in preference of Jaiswal's valuation of Rs.2 in respect of the Maneja lands. The arbitrator has, in the circumstances, acted on proper material in fixing the value of the lands at Pratapnagar as well as Maneja and his award in this respect has to be upheld.
 [128-E-H, 129-H] (ii) The shifting of the venue to Baroda was acquiesced in by both parties and there is a record by the arbitrator to this effect. So far as the request for the oral evidence is concerned it was made at a belated stage after the parties has agreed to have day to day proceedings and to avoid adjournment to enable V.P. to appeal and depose cannot be characterised as misconduct. [129-C-D] (iii) The mere fact that J.P. relied upon the valuation given in Exhibit 71/2 for purpose of seeking an injunction from alienating any of the goods cannot be taken as an admission on his part as to their value. The arbitrator was free to go into the whole question and determine the valuation independently. [130-G-H] (iv) It is not the province of this Court to delve into the details and examine whether the opponent's objections in various items thereof and their genuineness or correctness should have been accepted or not. [129-F] (v) The arbitrator has pointed out that, so far as the items in possession of the objectors are concerned, there was no rate mentioned in Ex.576 and the figure of Rs.14 per kg. was agreed to by both parties. Again, so far as the lead in possession of the applicants is concerned, the applicants themselves has valued it at Rs. 8 per kg. There is nothing to indicate the nature of the material in question and there is no explanation as to why the applicants who placed no value on the same item in the possession of the objectors valued the lead in their possession at Rs.8. In these circumstance there is no reason to interfere with the arbitrator's conclusions on these issues.[131-F] 
2. INTERPRETATION (i) The dissolution deed dated December 31, 1979, is described as a "deed of retirement from partnership". The deed is a carefully thought out document with its clauses set out in a logical sequence, only, not apparently being a deed drafted by lawyers, its language in some places is not very felicitous. The grievance related to four items of apportionment - [131-B-C] (i) Bank liabilities;
 (ii) Gratuity, bonus, P.L.. and medical facilities;
 (iii) Liability of advance against the order received from the Department of Atomic Energy; and [131-G-H] (iv) Excise liability. [132-A] The last item was not pressed.
 (ii) Clause (11) of the deed of dissolution is very clear that the responsibility of paying the dues of the Central Bank is undertaken by the objectors merely because the liability of the said Bank is larger than the liability to the Bank of Maharashtra, the objector cannot ask for a contribution of the excess from the applicants. A perusal of the various clause of the deed of dissolution shows that various assets and liabilities of the firm have been apportioned between the two groups of partners Clause (14) deals with Bank accounts. [134-F-G] (iii) The terms of the dissolution deed are very clear and the arbitrator was right in saying that the terms of clause (14) clearly govern the issue. [135-D] (iv) If Clause 22 is read as a general clause, clause (14), being a specific clause in respect of Bank debts, will certainly override clause (22). That apart, if the conclusion of arbitrator is consistent to upholding the conclusion of the arbitrator, though on a different reasoning. [135-F] (v) The parties have agreed under clause (17), that, except for gratuity, all other payments to workers will be borne by the respective parties. This is a specific kind of liability towards workers for which clause (17) makes provision in its first part and so clause (22) does not enter into the picture at all. It is not correct to say that clause (17) does not apply and so clause (22) will be attracted. [136-G-H] (vi) On the language of clause (18, there can be no doubt that the arbitrator was right in holding the respondents wholly liable to meet the liabilities to the Central Bank. Under clause (14), the objector have taken over the entirety of dealing with the Central Bank. Just as all liabilities to the Central Bank of India are to be discharged by the objector, the amount of fixed deposit with the same Bank and due or received from it should also belong exclusively to them. The reasoning that the fixed deposit is not the part of the Bank account taken over by the opponents but an independent assets of the firm, which has only been pledge as a security for obtaining necessary advance from the Bank to enable the opponents to execute the contract is somewhat artificial and far-fetched, the contract, it should be treated as an integral part of the dealings between the objectors and the said Bank. This is indeed clear from the clarification contained in clause (18) regarding the Pratapnagar factory. The position regarding the fixed deposit is therefore different. It should be treated as the exclusive property of the opponents not divisible between the two groups. [138-E-G] 
3. ACCOUNTS A perusal of the award shows that the arbitrator has examined the state of the accounts in great detail, considered various items appearing in the accounts and elaborately discussed the objections put forward by the objectors. The question of onus does not have importance at this stage where the arbitrator has examined the entire materials available and reached his conclusion thereon. The other grievance of the opponents is that some of these entries are not correct. This of course is a question of fact, and no ground is found to interfere with the finding of the arbitrator. [140-F-G] 
4. ARITHMETICAL ERRORS There are arithmetical errors in the decision of the arbitrator in respect of issue Nos. 7, 15(c) and 19(c) dealt with in paragraph 52 and 69 of the interim award. If these errors are rectified, the opponents will be entitled to receive a sum of Rs.1.52 lakhs.[140-H, 141-A] 
5. INTEREST (i) When the disputes between the parties pending adjudication in the suit have been referred to an arbitrator, the arbitrator has all the powers which the Court itself would have in deciding the issues in the suit.
 (ii) There is some force in the contention that in Seth Thawardas Pherumal v. Union of India, the grant of interest of the pre-reference period was set aside and to this extent its authority remain unaffected by the decision in Secretary Irrigation Department v. G.C. Roy and that as the reference was prior to the coming into force of the Interest Act, 1978, the award of interest for the pre-reference period was not justified. [146-F] (iii) That apart, this is not a fit case for the grant of interest from January 1, 1980. The arbitrator should have been guided by the term of clause (5) of the deed of dissolution which envisages the grant of interest only from the date of valuation of the assets. At the same time, this cannot mean that the objectors can take advantage of the entire delay in valuation. Some reasonable margin of time should be allowed for this process. It would not be correct to mulct the objectors with interest at least till the lapse of a reasonable time by which a valuation of all the assets and assessments of the rights of respective parties under the deed have been undertaken. [146-G] (iv) It will be reasonable and proper to direct the payment of interest from January 1, 1983 onwards. There is however, no reason to otherwise modify the award on the question of interest, either in regard to the rate of interest, or in regard to the addition of interest till the date of award to be principle amount determined as payable to the applicants which is permissible under section 34 CPC.
 The award on interest will be modified accordingly. [147-A] Seth Thawardas Pherumal v Union of India, [1955] 2 SCR 48 and Secretary Irrigation Department v G.C. Roy, [1992] 1 SCC 508, referred to.
 Per B.P. Jeevan Reddy, J. (Concurring) 
1. The decision in G.C. Roy's Case was concerned only with the power of arbitrator to award interest pendente lite. It was not concerned with his power to award interest for the reference period. This was made clear at more than one place in the said judgment. [149-B] 
2. It would not be correct to read the first of the five principles set out in para 43 of G.C. Roy's case, [1992] 1 SCC 508, 532-33, as overruling Jena's case in so far as it dealt with the arbitrator's power to award interest for the pre-reference period. Principle No. (i) should be read along with principle No. (v) wherein it is clearly stated that the interest for the period anterior to the reference (pre-reference period) is a matter of substantive law unlike interest pendente lite. The conclusion in para 44 again deals with the power of the arbitrator to award interest pendente lite. It is, therefore, not right to read the said decision as over ruling Jena's case in so far as it dealt with the power of the arbitrator to award interest for the pre-reference period. [151-G-H] 
3. So far as the instant case is concerned, it is a reference in pending suit. In such a case, the arbitrator has all the powers of the court in the matter of awarding interest. [152-A] Secretary Irrigation Department v. G.C. Roy, [1992] 1 SCC 508 and Executive Engineer, Irrigation, Galimala v.
 Abaaduta Jena[1987] INSC 264; , [1988] 1 SCR 253, referred to and explained.
