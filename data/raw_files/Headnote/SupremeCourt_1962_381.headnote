 The Official Liquidator of the respondent Bank advertised for sale, the two houses belonging to the Bank. These houses were sold to the second appellant with the sanction of the court. The second appellant thereafter transferred the houses to the first appellant reciting in the deed that the latter was the real owner and that the sale deed from the Official Liquidator was obtained benami for him. The Official Liquidator moved the High Court at Allahabad for an order declaring the sale null and void and for an order re- transferring the houses to the Bank. A 476 single judge of the High Court held that the first appellant being at the material time a member of the committee of inspection and he having suppressed that interest was precluded from buying the property of the Bank and directed the first appellant to convey the houses to the Official Liquidator of the Bank. This order was confirmed by a Division Bench of the High Court in appeal under cl. 10 of the Letters Patent. The High Court then certified the case under Art. 133 (1) (a) of the Constitution ,or appeal to this Court. It was urged at the hearing of the appeal on behalf of the Official Liquidator that the appeal was incompetent, for the High Court had no jurisdiction to grant the certificate under art. 133 (1) (a) of the Constitution without certifying that the appeal involved some substantial question of law.
 Held, that under Art. 133 (1) of the Constitution the expression 'Court immediately below' has not the same conno- tation as the expression 'Court subordinate to the High Court' and as the judgment of the Single judge was affirmed in appeal, the appeal to the Supreme Court could not be entertained with a certificate under Art. 133 (1) (a) unless it was certified that it involves some substantial question of law.
