 The appellant and respondent Nos. 3 and 4 were appointed Associate Professors of Plastic Surgery in the Patna Medical College on September 29, 1978. In the appointment order the name of the appellant was placed below the two respondents. In a writ petition moved by him under Art. 226 of the Constitution claiming seniority above respondent No. 4, the High Court found that he had teaching experience in Plastic Surgery for a period of 3 years 8 months 3 days, while the respondent No. 4 had such experience for 4 years 7 months Z7 days and accordingly held that the respondent No. 4 was senior to the appellant.
 In this appeal by special leave it was contended for the appellant that in calculating the length of teaching experience the High Court had not taken into consideration that he had worked in the Plastic Surgery Department from November 29, 1963 to June 28, 1966 under the Head of the Department and if that period was taken into consideration along with the period determined by the High Court he would be senior to respondent No. 4.
 Allowing the appeal, 
 HELD: The question of seniority between the appellant and respondent No. 4 is to be resolved on the basis of the length of teaching experience in Plastic Surgery. [568D] A separate unit of PLastic Surgery was created in the Medical College Hospital on January 2, 1964. It is not disputed that the appellant had worked as a teacher in that unit from January 2, 1964 to June 28, 1966. It cannot be said that during this period he had gained teaching experience in General Surgery, as stated in the affidavit of the State Government, when as a matter of fact; be was teaching in Plastic Surgery. Though the appellant had PG NO 567 addressed a letter to the Superintendent, Patna Medical College Hospital on December 21, l963 seeking transfer to the Department of General Surgery, there is no material to show that his request was acceded to or that he was, as a matter of fact, transferred from the Plastic Surgery Unit to the General Surgery Department. Instead of complying with his request it was ordered that though he would work in the Plastic Surgery Department, he would be deemed to have gained teaching experience in the Department of General Surgery. Such an order was not asked for by the appellant.
 The order was not only improper and unjust but also illegal.
 [568G, 569B, E-G] The High Court was, therefore, not justified in excluding the period from 2. 1. l964 to 28.6.1966 from the computation of the teaching experience of the appellant in determining his seniority. That period when added to the period of admitted, teaching experience of the appellant, as found by the High Court, he will be senior to respondent No. 4. [569H-570A] The State of Bihar to assign to the appellant seniority over respondent No. 4. [570B-C]
