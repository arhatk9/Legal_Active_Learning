 Various disputes between the parties were referred to a sole arbitrator. In an application under s. 151 C.P.C., the point was raised before the High Court that as the award directed partition of immovable property and the value of the immovable property was more than one lakh rupees it required registration under s. 17(1)(b) of the Indian Registration Act, 1908 and as it had not been registered, it was not admissible in evidence and could not be enforced and could not confer any rights. A single judge of' the High Court held that since the award had not been registered as required by section 17(1)(b) of the Registration Act it could not be made a rule of the court under s. 17 of the Arbitration Act.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : The award falls under s. 17(2)(v) of the Registration Act and is, therefore, not registerable.
 The High Court has proceeded on the basis that the award related to partition of immovable property of the value exceeding Rs. 100/- and, therefore, came within the ambit of s. 17(1) (b) of the Indian Registration Act. No doubt it did; but the High Court did not bestow attention on the words of that section and see whether it operated to create rights in the immovable property or whether it merely created a right to obtain another document, which will, when executed create any such right. The award itself did not purport or operate to create, declare, assign, limit or' extinguish, whether in present or in future any right, title or interest whether vested of continent of the value of Rs.
 100/- and upwards in respect of immovable property as contemplated under s. 17(1)(b) of the Registration Act. It merely created a right to obtain another document which would when executed, create declare, assign, limit or extinguish any such right, title or interest. [2E; 4B] Rajangam Ayyar v.
