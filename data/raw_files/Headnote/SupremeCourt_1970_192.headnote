 The respondent was holding the substantive post of Sergeant in the Bihar Police Force till July 31, 1946. On August 1, 1946 he was promoted to officiate in the higher post of Subedar. In January 1948, while still holding the substantive post of Sergeant he was promoted to officiate temporarily as Subedar Major. In October 1950 the Commandant of the Bihar Military Police, Muzaffarpur wrote to the Deputy Inspector General of Police Armed Forces suggesting that the respondent should be censured for having assaulted an orderly. The Deputy Inspector General recommended to the Inspector General that in view of the aforesaid incident the respondent be reverted to his substantive post of- Sergeant pending the result of the departmental enquiry for misconduct which was already going on against him. In November 1950 the Inspector General reverted the respondent to the post of Sergeant. After the conclusion of the department enquiry the respondent was dismissed from service in April 1953 by an order of the Deputy Inspector General. In February 1954 the respondent filed a suit for declaration that his demotion to the post of Sergeant and subsequent dismissal from service were wrongful, illegal and inoperative. The trial court dismissed the suit. The High Court on appeal reversed the decision of the trial court on the finding that the 'reversion was not in the usual course or for administrative reasons but it was after the finding on an inquiry about some complaint against the plaintiff in, by way of punishment to him.' The order of dismissal was set aside on the ground that it had been made by the Deputy Inspector General while the appointing authority in the case of the post of Subedar-Major was the Inspector General so that there was a violation of Art. 31 1 ( 1 ). In appeal to this Court against the judgment of the High Court the question that fell for consideration was was whether the reversion of the respondent from the post of officiating Subedar-Major was made in circumstances which would attract the appli- cability of Art. 311(2) of the Constitution.
 
HELD : Dhaba's case is not an authority for the proposition that so long as there are no express words of stigma attributed to the conduct of a Government officer in the impugned order it cannot be held to have been made by way of punishment. The form of the order is not conclusive of its true nature and it might merely be a cloak and camouflage for an order founded on misconduct. It may be that an order which is innocuous on the face and does not contain any imputation of misconduct is a circumstance or a piece of evidence for finding whether it was made by way of punishment or administrative routine. But the entirety of circumstances preceding or attendant on the impugned order must 192 be examined and the overriding test will aways be whether the misconduct is a mere motive or is the very foundation of the order. 1196 C-E] In the present case the High Court found that the order of reversion was made owing to the note of the Deputy Inspector General of Police following the report of the Commandant.
 The order of reversion was directly and proximately founded on what the Commandant and the Deputy Inspector General of Police said relating to the respondent's conduct generally and in particular with reference to the incident of assault by him on the orderly. There was no reason to disagree with the High Court that the order of reversion wits void. In that situation it was not disputed that the order of dismissal which was passed by the Deputy Inspector General of Police violated Art. 311(1) of the Constitution and had been rightly set aside by the High Court.
