 All Party Hill Leaders' Conference was constituted as a political party in the composite State of Assam in 1960. In 1962, APHLC contested General Elections and secured 11 out of 15 seats in the Assam Legislative Assembly reserved for the autonomous Hill districts of the State of Assam and returned one member to the Lok Sabha. In 1967 it contested the General Elections and secured 9 seats in the.
 Legislative Assembly and returned one member to the Lok Sabha. In 1970, an autonomous State of Meghalaya within the State of Assam was constituted under s. 3 of the Assam Reorganisation Act, 1969 and the APHLC secured 34 seats in the Legislative Assembly.
 In 1972, State of Meghalaya came into being. In the same year APHLC contested the General Elections and secured 32 seats in the Meghalaya Legislative Assembly out of 60 and returned 2 members to the Lok Sabha and 1 member to the Rajya Sabha. In August 1976, General Conference of APHLC discussed the question of merger with the Indian National Congress and decided that there should be no merger but friendly relations should be strengthened. In November 1976, in a meeting of the Central Office bearers Committee which is the executive body of the APHLC capt. Sangma who was the President of APHLC as well as the Chief Minister of Meghalaya made an announcement that the Congress High Command had rejected the resolution of friendly relations and that it had insisted that the APHLC should merge with the Indian National Congress. It was, therefore, decided to call a meeting of the General Conference in November, 1976 "to review the implementation of the political resolution of the Conference held at Shillong on 19th and 20th August, 1976." The agenda, however, did not specifically mention about the discussion of the issue of merger.
 There was a storm of protest from several quarters. On 4-11-1976, the Executive Committee of the Khasi Hills District expressed grave concern about the matter and requested President Sangma to postpone the Conference. On 8-11-1976, several leaders from Garo Hills including the then Chief Executive Member of the District Council and the, then Chairman of the Garo Hills District Conference presented a Memorandum to Capt. Sangma requesting post- ponement of the Conference so that the leaders and the workers of the party have enough time to consider the matter. On 10th and 11th November, 1976 the Executive Committee Khasi Hills District decided not to participate in the Conference. The Committee further appealed to the President of the Party for postponement of the holding of the proposed Conference to enable the leadership to take the rank and file of the party and the people into confidence.
 On 14th November, 1976, the Shillong Unit of the Party by a resolution requested Capt. Sangma for giving the leaders and members of the party time and opportunity to consider all aspects of the merger issue.
 Notwithstanding the opposition, the Conference was held on 16-11-1976 which was attended by 81 delegates out of 121 and a resolution was passed unanimously in favour of the merger with the Congress. The meeting authorised President Sangma to form a committee consisting of 5 members to work out the modalities, technicalities and details of the merger with the Indian National Congress in consultation with the Congress High Command. Although the 394 resolution recalled the part played by the people in constituting a common political platform the appeal by a vocal section of the party to go back to the people to ascertain their wish as to obliteration of the platform constituted by them fell on deaf ears. The Conference of 81 members unmandated for the purpose decided for the people and the President acquired from that small body absolute power to nominate his own Committee and to do all that was necessary in order to announce the merger of the party.
 Immediately after passing of the resolution 4 APHLC leaders who were Cabinet Ministers, tendered their resignation.
 Thereafter, Mr. Nongtdu describing himself as Joint Secretary of the erstwhile APHLC informed the Election Commission that the APHLC had merged with the Indian National Congress and that the Election Commission should withdraw the election symbol "flower" reserved for the erstwhile APHLC. As against that, Mr. Pugh informed the Commission that some APHLC leaders including Capt. Sangma had joined the Indian National Congress and that the leader who had left the party had no authority to decide dissolution of the party or to approach the authorities on the question of recognition or derecognition that the party was still in existence and there was no provision whatever for a person or a group of persons to dissolve the party of the people. The Commission invited comments from the parties and after hearing them delivered its order holding that APHLC had ceased to exist and that, therefore, the name of that party and the, symbol 'flower' reserved for it should be deleted from the list of recognised State parties.
 The Election Commission ordered that the symbol 'flower' would remain frozen and that it should not be included as a free symbol.
 The appellant filed a Special Leave petition in this Court against the order of the Election Commission which was granted. At the hearing the respondent raised the preliminary objection as to the maintainability of the appeal by Special Leave on the ground that the Election Commission is not a Tribunal within the meaning of Article 136 of the Constitution. The appellant contended that 81 delegates without any mandate from the members of a party cannot dissolve a,, party.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) This Court has laid down several tests to determine whether a particular body or authority is a Tribunal within the ambit of Art. 136. The tests are not exhaustive in all cases. It is, however, absolutely necessary that the authority in order to come within the ambit of Art. 136(1) as Tribunal must be constituted by the State and invested with some function of judicial power of the State. This test is an unfailing one while some of the other tests may or may not be present at the same time. [404 F-H] Sadiq Ali & Anr. etc. v.

 (2)The Election Commission is a creature of the Constitution. Under Article 324, the superintendence, direction and control and the preparation of the electoral roll for and the conduct of all elections to Parliament and to the Legislature of every State and all elections to the offices of the President and the Vice President shall be vested in the Election Commission. The Chief Election Commissioner cannot be removed from his office except in like manner and on the like grounds as a Judge of the Supreme Court. The Chief Election Com- 395 missioner is a high dignitary whose independence, impartiality and fair mindedness are intended to be guaranteed by the Constitution. for the purpose of holding elections allocation of symbol will find a prime place in a country where illiteracy is still very high. It has been found from experience that symbol as a device for casting votes in favour of a candidate of one's choice has proved as invaluable aid. [406 G, 407 A-D, E] (3)Article 327 empowers the Parliament to make 'provisions with respect to all matters relating to or in connection with the elections. The Representation of the Peoples Act 1951 does not provide for any provisions with regard to symbol. However, under s. 169(1) of the Representation of the Peoples Act, the Central Government is empowered to make rules after consulting the Commission for carrying out the purpose of the Act. Sub-section (2) of s. 169 provides that in particular and without prejudice to the generality of the power u/s. 169(1) such rules might provide for the matters specified from (a) to (1). Clause (c) provides for the manner in which votes are to be given both generally and in the case of illiterate voters or voters under physical disadvantage. The last clause is a residuary clause with regard to any other matter that may be required to be prescribed by the Act. The Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, which have been framed in exercise of the power conferred by s. 169 of the Act provides for various matters. Rules 5 and 10(4)(5)(6) deal with matters relating to symbol. In exercise of the power vested in the Commission under Article 324 and rules 5 and 10 of the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961, and all other powers enabling it in that behalf the Election Commission, made the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order 1968. It is not necessary to deal with the question whether the symbols order made by the Commission is a piece of legislative activity. It is enough to hold, which the Court held, that the Commission is empowered on its own right under Article 324 of the Constitution and also under rules 5 and 10 of the Rules to make directions in general in widest terms necessary and also in specific cases in order to facilitate a free and fair election with promptitude. It was held in Sadiq Ali's case that the symbol order was made by the Election Commission in exercise of powers which flow from Article 324 as well as rules 5 and 10. The Court, therefore, held that the Election Commission is a Tribunal within the meaning of Article 136.
 [407 G-H, 408 A-E, G-H] (4)The 81 members of the Conference had decided that APHLC should dissolve. 40 members had opposed the move and stayed away from the Conference. This led to the dispute as to whether notwithstanding the majority resolution in the Conference the APHLC could still continue as a recognised political party in the State of Meghalaya for the purpose of allotment of the reserved symbol. There is thus his between the two groups of the Conference. The Commission is the specified and exclusive adjudicating authority of this lis.
 The Commission is created by the Constitution and the power to adjudicate the dispute flows from Article 324 as well as from rule 5 and is thus conferred under the law as a fraction of judicial power of the State. The Commission has prescribed its own procedure in the symbol order, namely, to give a hearing to the parties when there is a dispute with regard to recognition or regarding choice of symbols. The power to decide the dispute in question is a part of the State's judicial power and that power is conferred on the Election Commission by Art. 324 of the Constitution as also by rule 5 of the Rules. The principal and nonfailing test which must be present in order to determine whether a body or authority is a Tribunal within the ambit of Art. 136(1) is fulfilled in this case. The question whether the primary function of the Election Commission is adjudicatory or not is not relevant. The question is whether in deciding the particular disputes between the parties in a matter the Commission is exercising a judicial function and it has a duty to act judicially. Having regard to the character of the Commission in dealing with the particular matter and the nature 'of the enquiry envisaged and the procedure which is reasonably required to be followed, the Court held, that its primary function in respect of the subject matter is judicial. [409 E-G 410 E, 411 A-B] (5)APHLC has been recognised as a political party in the State of Meghalaya since 1962. The party has no written constitution. It is, however, not disputed that the APHLC is a democratically run party. In normal working in a democratic Organisation the rule of majority must prevail.
 That, however, 396 will not conclude the matter as the Commission thought in this case. The APHLC is a regional party but with high ideals of working out the salvation of the area as proud partners in a larger scheme of advancement of the whole nation without at the same time losing their identity, culture, customs. When a partylike this has to disappear from the political scene as a distinct party it is a very grave and serious decision to take. A party which has been successfully running a State Government cannot claim to a party of merely leaders as is sought to be represented by the respondents. The fact that 121 persons who were invited to the Conference are delegates shows that they must be delegates of some body or persons. There is clear evidence of democratic feature in the pattern of working of the APHLC. Any issue on which the decision might normally be taken by the Conference must relate to live matters of a living organ and not to its death wish. Without the nexus with the generality of membership decision will derive no force or vigour and no party or Conference can hope to succeed in their plans, efforts or struggle unless backed by the same. There is no evidence authorising the Conference to dissolve itself by merger or otherwise and it is not possible to apply' the rule of majority only in the Confe- rence for such a decision affecting the entire body as an entity in the absences of a clear mandate from the General Membership. Assuming that the Conference decided by a majority to dissolve the APHLC it would have been in accordance with the democratic principles to place that decision before the General Membership of the party for rectification prior to implementing the mere majority decision of the Conference without regard to the wishes of the members a,,; a whole. It is difficult to appreciate that this reasonable request from a responsible section of the Conference for referring the matter to the people was disregarded:"It appears that the proposal to merge did not come from within but was wanted" from outside. [412A, E, F, 413 F-H, 414'A-C, 415 C] The Commission fell into an error in holding that the Conference of APHLC was the General Body even to take a decision about its dissolution by a majority vote. [415 D] The matter would have been absolutely different if in the general body of all members from different areas or from representatives for the parties assembled to take a decision about the dissolution of the party had reached a decision by majority. [415 D] Under para 6 of the Symbols Order a political party shall be treated as a recognised political party in a State if it fulfils either the conditions specified in clause A or in clause B, i.e., either securing certain number of seats or certain number of valid votes. It is not disputed that the APHLC with 40 members still claiming to continue its reserved symbol answers the test laid down in Commission's directions for being recognised as a State Political Party in para 6 of the Symbols Order. s, the APHLC as a recognised State Political Party in Meghalaya stays and is entitled to continue with their reserved symbol 'flower'.
