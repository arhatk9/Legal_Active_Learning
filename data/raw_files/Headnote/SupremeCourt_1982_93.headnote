 Consequent to the passing of the Coking Coal Mines (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1971, which was replaced by the Coking Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act, 1972, the Coal Mines (Taking Over of Management) Act, 1973 and the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act, 1973, all coal mines known to exist in the country were nationalised, whether they are coking coal mines or non-coking mines. Along with them coke oven plants in or belonging to the mines were also nationalised. In addition twelve specified coke oven plants not belonging to the owners of the mines, but known to exist near about the mines were also nationalised. All other coke oven plants were left out of the scheme of nationalisation for private exploitation.
 Sanjeev Coke Manufacturing Company, Bhowra Coke Company who were owners of the coke oven plants described in items 2 and 9 of the Second Schedule filed writ petitions in the Calcutta High Court challenging the inclusion of their coke oven plants in the Second Schedule as violative of the provisions of Article 14 of the Constitution. The writ petitions were withdrawn to the Supreme Court under Article 139 A.
 Dismissing the petitions, the Court ^ 
 HELD: 1. It is not open to a court to answer academic or hypothetical questions on such considerations, such as that they dealt with Constitutional amendments and not ordinary law, which of their own force permitted violation of freedoms through laws passed for certain purposes, particularly so when serious constitutional issues are involved. Judges are not authorised to make disembodied pronouncements on serious and cloudy issues of constitutional policy without battle lines being properly drawn. Judicial pronouncements cannot be immaculate legal conceptions. It is but right that no important point of law should be decided without a proper lis between parties properly ranged on either side and a crossing of the swords.
 It is in expedient for the Supreme Court to delve into problems which do not arise and express opinion thereon.

 2. Adjectives are attractive forensic aids but in matters of interpretation they are diverting intruders. They should not be allowed to get the better of the nouns which they qualify. [1020 G-H] 3:1. Validity of legislation is not to be judged merely by affidavits filed on behalf of the State, but by all the relevant circumstances which the court may ultimately find out and more especially by what may be gathered from what the legislature has itself said. [1029 F-G] 3:2. Courts are not really concerned with the hollowness or the self-condemnatory nature of the statements made in the affidavits filed by the respondents to justify and sustain the legislation. The deponents of the affidavits filed into court may speak for the parties on whose behalf they swear to the statements. They do not speak for the Parliament and Parliament is never before the Court. Once a statute leaves Parliament House, the Court's is the only authentic voice which may echo (interpret) the Parliament.
 This the court will do with reference to the language of the statute and other permissible aids. [1029 A-D] 1002 3:3. No act of Parliament can be struck down because of the under standing or misunderstanding of Parliamentary intention by the executive government or because their (the Government's) spokesmen do not bring out relevant circumstances but indulge in empty and self defeating affidavits. They do not and cannot bind Parliament. [1029 E- F] 4:1. The Coking Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act 1972 is a legislation for giving effect to the policy of the State towards securing the principle specified in Article 39(b) of the Constitution and is, therefore, immune under Article 31-C from attack on the ground that it offends the fundamental right guaranteed by Article 14. [1027 C-D] 4:2. By the Coking Coal Mines Nationalisation Act all coking coal mines known to exist in the country were nationalised. Other coke oven plants which did not belong to the owners of the mines but which were located near about the nationalised coking coal mines were also identified and nationalised by express provision to that effect. At that stage of the rationalisation and nationalisation of the coal mining industry, it was apparently thought necessary and sufficient to nationalise such coke oven plants as were in or belonged to the nationalised coking coal mines or as were identified as located near the nationalised coking coal mines, leaving out all other coke oven plants. [1021 F-H;
 1022 A-B] 4:3. The object of the coking coal Mines (Nationalisation Act is to recognise and reconstruct coking coal mines and coke oven plants for the purpose of protecting, conserving and promoting scientific development of the resources of coking coal needed to meet the growing requirements of the Iron and Steel Industry and for matters connected therewith and incidental thereto. The requirements of the Iron and Steel industry are recognised as 'Growing requirements' and it is found necessary to protect conserve and promote the scientific development of resources of coking coal so as to meet those 'growing requirements' The Act is contemplating the future. If the object of the Act is to provide for the future, it does not make any difference, if in the past or in the present, the hard coke produced by the nationalised coking coal mines is diverted elsewhere than the Iron and Steel Industry. The requirements of the Iron and Steel Industry which are to be met by the nationalised coke oven plants are its growing requirements, that is to say, its future requirements. [1026 E-H; 1027 A] 5:1. The Coking Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act is not violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. There has been no such infringement, as could be seen from the facts of the right guaranteed under Article 14. [1027 D; 1028 F] 5:2. The process of nationalisation of the Coal industry is, of course, not complete as yet. Nationalisation of any industry or means of production may not be and need not be effected all at once. It may be achieved in stages.
 If in the process of nationalisation some units are left out in the earlier stages either because it is so planned or because of some mistake it cannot be said that there has been a violation of Article 14. Nor can any inference be drawn of discrimination from the circumstance that subsequently eighty seven new coke oven plants have been allowed to come up. Obviously there is demand for hard coke from industries other than the iron and steel industry and normally, 1003 the State does not want to stifle those industries by making it difficult for them to obtain their requirements, especially since the production of the Nationalised Coke Oven Plants has first to meet the requirements of the iron and steel industry. What is important to note is that these eighty seven new coke oven plants are not situated in or about coal mines though they are in the coal field area, as indeed they are bound to be. [1028 E-H] 
 6. The distribution between public, private and joint sectors and the extent and range of any scheme of nationalisation are essentially matters of State policy which are inherently inappropriate subjects for judicial review. Scales of justice are just not designed to weigh competing social and economic factors. In such matters legislative wisdom must prevail and judicial review must abstain. The contention that Article 39(b) would be attracted, if the industry as a whole was nationalised and not if only a part of the industry was nationalised is, therefore, misplaced. [1026 B-D] 7:1. The expression "Material resources of the community" as used in Article 39(b) of the Constitution is not confined to natural resources; it is not confined to resources owned by the public; it means and includes all resources, natural and man-made, public and private-owned.
 [1026 A-B] 7:2. The expression "material resources of the community" means all things which are capable of producing wealth for the community. There is no warrant for interpreting the expression in so narrow a fashion as to confine it to public-owned material resources and exclude private owned material resources. The expression involves no dichotomy. The words must be understood in the context of the constitutional goal of establishing a sovereign, socialist, secular' democratic republic. [1022 H; 1023 A-B] 7:3. When Article 39(b) refers to material resources of the community it does not refer only to resources owned by the community as a whole, but it refers also to resources owned by individual members of the community.
 Resources of the community do not mean public resources only but include private resources as well The distribution envisaged by Article 39(b) necessarily takes within its stride the transformation of wealth from private-ownership into public-ownership and is not confined to that which is already public-owned. [1023 G-H; 1024 A-B] State of Karnataka v. Ranganathan Reddy, [1977] INSC 195; [1978] 1 S.C.R. 641 @ 689 followed.
 8:1. The question of the validity of Article 31 C stands concluded by the decision of the Supreme Court in Keshavananda Bharati's case. in which it was expressly ruled that Article 31 C, as it stood at that time i.e., as inserted by the Constitution (Twenty-fifth Amendment) Act, 1971, was constitutionally valid. No doubt the protection of Article 31C was at that time confined to law giving effect to the policy of the clauses (b) and (c) of Article 39. By the Constitution Forty Second Amendment Act, the protection was extended to all laws giving effect to all or any of the principles laid down in Part IV. The dialectics, the logic and the rationale involved in upholding the validity of Article 31C when it confined its protection to laws enacted to further Article 39(b) or Article 39(c) should uncompromisingly lead to the same resolute 1004 conclusion that Article 31 C with its extended protection is also constitutionally valid. It cannot also be said that the nature of the Directive Principles enunciated in other Articles of Part IV of the Constitution is so drastic or different from the Directive Principle in clauses (b) and (c) of Article 39, that the extension of constitutional immunity to laws made to further those principles would afford the basic structure of the constitution Any observations made to the contrary in Minerva Mills' case[1980] INSC 141; , [1981] 1 S.C.R. 206 may be held to be obiter. [1016 D-H] 9:2. To contend that a law founded on discrimination is not entitled to the protection of Article 31 C, as such a law can never be said to further the directive principles affirmed in Article 39(b) would be to put the cart before the horse. If the law made to further directive principle is necessarily non-discriminatory or is based on a reasonable classification, then such law does not need any protection such as that afforded by Article 31 C. Such law would be valid on its own strength, with no aid from Article 31 C. To make it a condition precedent that a law seeking the haven of Article 31 C must not be discriminatory or based on reasonable classification is to make Article 31 C meaningless. If Article 14 is not offended, no one need give any immunity from an attack based on Article 14. [1019 A;
 1020 A-B] The broad egalitarian principle of social and economic justice for all was was implicit in every Directive Principle, and, therefore, a law designed to promote a directive principle, even if it came into conflict with the formalistic and doctrinaire view of equality before the law, would most certainly advance the broader egalitarian principle and the desirable constitutional goal of social and economic justice to all. If the law was aimed at the broader egalitarianism of the Directive Principles, Article 31 C protected the law from needless, unending and rancourous debate on the question whether the law contravened Article 14's concept of equality before the law.
 The law seeking the immunity afforded by Article 31 C must be a law directing the policy of the State towards securing a Directive Principle. The object of the law must be to give effect to the Directive Principle and the connection with the Directive Principle must not be "same remote or tenuous connection". [1020 B-F] 9:3. When Article 31 C comes in, Article 14 goes out.
 There is no scope for bringing in Article 14 by a side wind as it were, that is, by equating the rule of equality before the law of Article 14 with the broad egalitarianism of Article 39(b) or by treating the principle of Article 14, as included in the principle of Article 39(b). To insist on nexus between the law for which protection is claimed and the principle of Article 39(b) is not to insist on fulfilment of the requirement of Article 14. They are different concepts and in certain circumstances, may even run counter to each other. That is why the need for the immunity afforded by Articles 31 C. [1021 A-B] 10:1. The word "Mine" as defined in Section 3(j) of the Coking Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act 36 of 1972 does include 'Coke Oven Plant'. If the definition of 'Coke Oven Plant' in Section 3(b) is read alongside clauses (vi) and (x) of Section 3(j) which defines mine, it becomes plain that 'coke oven plant' belonging to or in a mine is treated as comprised in 'mine' as defined. Therefore, all coke oven plants belong to or in the mines mentioned in the First Schedule, 1005 by the very force of definition of 'mine', go with the mines and the right, title, and interest thereto vest in the Central Government under Section 4(1) of the Act. [1008 D-F;
 1010 D] Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. v. P.K. Agarwala and Anr, [1979] 3 S.C.R. 609, over ruled.
 10:2. The object of the Coking Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act was to nationalise all coking coal mines and coke oven plants situated in or about the mines whether or not they belonged to the owners of the mines.
 Those which belonged to the owners of the mines, went with the mines, but [those which did not belong to the owners of the mines, obviously did not go with the mines, and separate provision had to be made for their nationalisation, and payment of compensation etc. That was the reason for the separate definition of "Coke Oven Plant" and the separate provision for the nationalisation of certain coke oven plants. The reason was not any dichotomy between the word 'mine' on the one hand and the words "coke oven plant" on the other. [1010 E-F] 10:3. All coke oven plants were not nationalised; only those which were situated in or about the nationalised coking coal mines were nationalised. There was no separate legislation providing for the take over of all coke oven plants but as a part of the legislation to take over coking coal mines, such coke oven plants were also nationalised.
 Quite obviously coke oven plants situated in or about coal mines had to be nationalised along with the mines in the interests of convenience and efficiency of the coal industry and to minimise the opportunities for clandestine operations for which the coal industry has become notorious. Coke oven plants away from the mines were not touched either by the Coking Coal (Emergency Provisions) Act or the Coking Coal (Nationalisation) Act. [1010 H; 1011 A-C] Amarendra Nath Sen, J. (Contra) costs generally follow event. When a citizen is deprived of his property by a State action and feels aggrieved by the act of the State and approaches the Court and if it cannot be said that his grievance is absolutely frivolous, the citizen in such a case should not be saddled with the costs simply because the Court finds that his grievance has no valid legal basis.
