 In the Civil Miscellaneous Petitions it was pointed out that neither the Government of India nor the Medical Council of India was in a position to hold an All India Entrance Examination for the purpose of filling in 30% seats of the open category in the 1st year M.B.B.S. Course and 50% of the open seats in the Post-Graduate Course until the year 1986.
 The implementation of the directions given by this Court earlier should not be, therefore, insisted upon for the current academic year 1985, because otherwise each State Government will have to hold an entrance examination causing hardship and inconvenience to the students. Moreover, many State Governments are not yet ready to hold such examinations.
 Allowing the petitions, ^ 
 HELD: 1. Save and except in those cases where entrance examination has already been held by any State Government or Government of any Union Territory or any University pursuant to the directions given earlier, such directions shall be implemented only from the academic year 1986 and shall not be effective for the current academic year 1985. Where, however, the entrance examination has already been held or was being held even before the delivery of the main judgment on 22.6.84, this order shall not affect the validity of such examination which might have already been held or which may be held hereafter. [3 A-B] 
 2. If any admissions have been made in the implementation of the directions they shall not be affected nor shall they be invalidated.[3 E] 2 
 3. Every Municipal Corporation is a local authority and hence a State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution and, therefore, Medical Colleges run by Municipal Corporations are bound by these directions. [3F]
