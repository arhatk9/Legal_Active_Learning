 The appellants, who were the voters of the constituency, challenged the election of the first respondent who was a nominee of the Akali Dal, to the State Legislative Assembly, on the ground that he was guilty of corrupt practice under v. 123(3) and (3A) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. The second respondent, who was a nominee of the Congress and the third respondent, who was an independent candidate, were unsuccessful in the election. The charge of corrupt practice against the first respondent was based on the publication of a poster. The High Court hold, (i) that the poster was printed from a document produced by the appellant's witness; (ii) that the signature on that document was that of the first respondent; (iii) the document produced by the court witness as the one from which the poster was printed was manufactured for the. purpose of election petition, and that its production as well as. the production of a tape-recorded conversation between the Is respondent and the husband of the 2nd respondent, showed an anxiety on the part of the first respondent to steer clear of his signature on the document produced by the appellant's witness; and (iv) that such anxiety of the first respondent could only arise because he had, in fact, signed the document produced by the appellant's witness, as it was not his case that he ever signed any blank paper. The High Court, however, dismissed the petition holding that it was not sure of the existence of the offending poster before the Poll.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) The conclusion of the High Court that the poster was not printed before the poll is completely non-sequitur, in view of the other findings of the High Court which are home out by the evidence on record. The evidence establishes that the printing of the poster was before the poll and that it was the first respondent who got it printed. [793C-D; 795A] (a) The absence of a complaint by the second respondent does not lead to the conclusion that the poster was not printed before the appeal. [793-D] (b) The tape-recorded conversation is absolutely unhelpful to the first resPondent's case and it does not establish that the first respondent was surprised and bewildered at the fact that the document produced by the appellant's witness bore his signature. [795D-E] (2) The evidence also established that the poster was distributed in various villages at the instance of the first respondent. The reason given by the High Court for disbelieving the oral testimony of one of the witnesses regarding the distribution, namely, 'that he was an Akali and that his testimony could not be accepted and he would be the last person to support the congress candidate' is the very reason that the evidence of that witness should have been accepted against the first respondent.
