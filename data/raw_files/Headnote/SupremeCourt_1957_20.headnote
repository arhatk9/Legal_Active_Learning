 The petitioner obtained a licence for importing soda ash during the free licencing period in 1952. On the basis of the licence certain consignments of soda ash were received in Bombay. 'The Customs Authorities had reason to suspect that the petitioner was trafficking in his licence and on investigation found that two of the consignments had actually been imported by another party and confiscated them' The petitioner appealed to the Central Board of Revenue and thereafter moved the Government of India, but to no effect. The Collector of Customs ordered the goods to be auctioned. Five petitions were filed in this court under Art. 32 of the Constitution seeking for the issue of appropriate writs in respect of the confiscation of the goods and seizure of the licence. It was contended on behalf of the petitioner that the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, 1947 not having re-enacted the provisions of r. 84(2) Of the Defence of India Rules, S. 3(1)(a) of the Act had no application to soda ash and no licence was required to import it ; that, in the alternative, legislation authorisirig the issue of licences amounted to delegated legislation and was, therefore, invalid. It was further contended that the Policy Statement made by the Government in the Press Note dated February 1955, and Public Notice dated June 30, 1956, created a monopoly and infringed the petitioner's fundamental right to carry on his trade and business and lastly, that the virtual invalidation of his licence having been improperly made should be set aside and the same directed to be revalidated for the unexpired period.
 Held, that the contentions raised on behalf of the petitioner must fail and the petitions must be dismissed.. I The language Of S. 3(1)(a) of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, 1947, made it abundantly clear that it was intended to apply to the import of all goods of specified description covered by r. 84(2) Of the Defence of India Rules including soda ash so as to render the re-enactment of that rule wholly unnecessary. The provision of the section must be read disjunctively and distributively and it was wholly unreasonable to suggest that the words 'import' and 'export' could be qualified by the expressions ,carriage coastwise' or 'shipment as ships' stores' occurring in the section.
 Nor could the section be held to be ultra vires on the ground of delegated legislation as the preamble and the relevant sections of the Act as also those of the Defence of India Act, which it purported to continue and to which reference would be perfectly legitimate, show that the Legislature had clearly indicated the, policy and enunciated the principles that were to guide those entrusted with the implementation of the Act which had for its purpose the maintenance of supplies essential to the community.
 Harishankar Bagla v. The State of Madhya Pradesh, (1955) I S.C.R. 380, applied.
 703 Pannalal Binjraj v. The Union of India, [1956] INSC 86; (1957) S.C.R. 233, referred to.
 It was perfectly open to the Government of India to change its import and export policy with a view to adjust it to the varying needs of the country and if importers were found to resort to malpractices leading to instability of prices, it would be its duty to intervene and regulate distribution, if need be, with the assistance of importer-stockists working under its general supervision and no exception could be taken to such a policy on the ground that it created a monopoly or infringed the fundamental right to carry on trade or business.
 As, in the instant case, the goods were lawfully confiscated by the Sea Customs Authorities as a result of an investigation which they were competent to make, it was not open to the petitioner under Art. 32 of the Constitution to challenge their conclusions on the ground that they had not been properly drawn and no question, therefore, of any revalidation of. his licence could at all arise.
