 The appellant was a District Magistrate. In a case pending before him an affidavit of one of the sureties was attested by the respondent who was a practising advocate On the failure of the surety to appear in the Court on the due date, notice was issued to him. The notice having been returned unserved, the Magistrate issued a notice to the respondent, despite the fact that he was not the duly constituted attorney of the surety, calling upon him to appear in the court in connection with this case. The respondent thereupon moved the High Court under s. 561A Cr.
 P.C. alleging that the notice was arbitrary and amounted to an abuse of the process of the court because there was no provision in the Criminal Procedure Code empowering the Magistrate to issue such a notice to him that he was in no way connected with the bail bond and that the notice was issued to humiliate him and the Bar since the latter had passed a resolution protesting against the improper and discourteous behaviour of the Magistrate. The respondent prayed that the appellant be directed to withdraw the notice.
 The High Court called for a report from the appellant as to the circumstances in which he had thought fit to issue notice as also the provision of law. After receiving the appellant's report the High Court quashed the notice holding that the action of the Magistrate constituted grave misuse of his power and flagrant abuse of the process or the Court.
 The appellant's application to the High Court for expansion of certain remarks made against him was rejected.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court.

 HELD : (1) The tests to be applied in considering expansion of disparaging remarks against persons or authorities whose conduct comes in for consideration before courts of law in cases to be decided by them are (i) Whether the party whose conduct is in question is before the Court or has an opportunity of explaining or defending himself;
 (ii) Whether there is evidence on record hearing on that conduct justifying the remarks and (iii) Whether it is necessary for the decision of the case, as an integral part thereof, to animadvert on that conduct. lt has also been recognised that judicial pronouncements must be judicial in nature and should not normally depart from sobriety, moderation and reserve. [209A-D] State of U.P. V. Muhammad Nain, [1963] INSC 60; [1964] 2 S.C.R. 363 at 374, applied.
 In the present case in response to the High' Court's notice the appellant submitted a detailed report Before the High Court he was represented by a senior Public prosecutor. He had thus adequate opportunity of explaining his conduct in defending the impugned action. The appellant cannot complain that the remarks were passed by. the High Court without affording him due opportunity to explain and defend his action. [209E-F] (2) Though the notice by itself was not a very offensive document the allegation of bad faith and that it was issued to humiliate an advocate and the Bar who had earlier passed a resolution complaining against the misbehaviour of the appellant showed that the notice was illegal arbitrary and tainted with bad faith. It was a preliminary step taken under cover of s. 476 Cr. P.( for possible prosecution of the Advocate. [209G-210C] 205 (3)(a) The notice issued to the surety which was returned by the police stated that the service could not be effected for want of sufficient information and more detailed particulars regarding the surety while the appellant stated that "it was reported by the police that there was no such person as far as they could gather from the detailed inquiries made and, therefore, notice could not be served" Evidently this misleading stand was taken by the appellant to show that action under s. 476 Cr. P.C. against the Advocate would not be groundless. [210E H] (b)The remarks of the High Court were an integral part of the reasoning of the High Court. They were not irrelevant or foreign to the matter under issue.. They were inextricably intertwined with the findings and the order recorded by the High Court. Excision of these remarks would emasculate the order of the High Court robbing it of its very rationale.[211A-B]
