 Matters relating to grant, transfer and vesting of mining rights in Goa, Daman and Diu during the Portuguese rule, were government by the "Portuguese Colonial Mining Laws". Under those laws a person could, make a declaration" in writing stating that "he has discovered a mineral deposit". Such a declaration was called a "Mining Manifest ' and the person making the declaration was called a "Manifestor". The object of making a Mining Manifest was to acquire mining rights from the Government in respect of the area covered by the Manifest. On verification, the concerned authorities would prepare a "Notice of Manifest". The Notice of Manifest was an acknowledgment by public authorities of the authenticity of the Mining Manifest and it was a step- in-aid to the grant of mining rights. The Notice of Manifest was followed by the grant of "Title of Manifest", "a certificate in terms of the note of manifest pertaining to the legal right to concession, and entitled the manifestor to a "Mining Concession" under which he was permitted "to explore a mining property and to enjoy thereon all mining rights". The mining concession was 'unlimited in duration as long as the concessionaire complied with the conditions which the law and title of concession imposed on him".
 Article 119 of the Portuguese Colonial Mining Laws provided that a "prospecting license" was not transferable but by article 120, a Title of Manifest was transferable by simple endorsement on the original title, duly executed in terms of Article 60.
 The territories comprised in Goa, Daman and Diu under the Portuguese rule were annexed by the Government of India by conquest on December 20, 393 1961. These territories became a part of India, and for the purpose of making A provision for their administration, the President of India, promulgated on March 5, 1962 the Goa, Daman and Diu (Administration) ordinance. On March 27, 1962 the Indian Parliament enacted the Goa, Daman and Diu (Administration) Act 1 of 1962 replacing the aforesaid ordinance with effect from March 5, 1962. On the same date, Parliament enacted the Constitution (Twelfth Amendment) Act, 1962 whereby Goa, Daman and Diu were added as Entry S in Part II of the First Schedule to the Constitution, and as clause (d) in Article 240 of the Constitution, with retrospective effect from December 20, 1961. Goa, Daman and Diu thus became a part of the Union Territories of India with effect from the date of their annexation by conquest.
 On November 28, 1962 the President promulgated the Goa, Daman and Diu (Laws) Regulation No. 12 of 1962. The various Acts specified in the Schedule to the Regulation were extended to Goa, Daman and Diu, one of such Acts being the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957.
 Section 4 of the Regulation provided or the repeal and saving of laws. By a notification issued by the Lt. Governor of Goa, Daman and Diu under section 3 of the Regulation, the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957 and the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960, were made applicable to Goa, Daman and Diu with effect from October 1, 1963.
 On September 5, 1958 one "K" obtained four Titles of Manifest from the Portuguese Government, and sold those Manifests to Respondent No. I sometime in 1959. The sale was in conformity with the Portuguese Laws and was duly attested by a Notary Public in Goa. On September 4, 1959, Respondent No. I made four applications, one in respect of each Manifest, to the Governor General of Portugal, for demarcation of the area in respect of which the mineral concession was sought. On September 17, 1959 Respondent No I presented four applications attaching to them certain other documents and on September 24, 1959 he paid the balance of the fee prescribed for the grant of mineral concessions.
 On the date on which the Act was extended to Goa, Daman and Diu, the applications made by respondent 1 on September 4 and 17, 1959 to the Governor General of Portuguese Goa were pending consideration for the grant of mineral concessions. Similar applications filed by other persons were also pending on that date. On September 16, 1964, the Mining Engineer, Department of Mines, Goa, informed respondent 1 that since his applications for mineral concessions had not been granted prior to October 1, 1963 when the Rules came into force, the said applications were deemed to have lapsed. He was however asked to submit fresh applications for grant of mineral concessions which would be considered on merits. On October S, 1964 the Secretary of the Goa Mineral ore Exporters Association made a representation to the Government, requesting that all cases in which applications were made and mineral concession fees were paid prior to October 1, 1963 should be treated by the Government sympathetically and mineral concessions granted.
 On October 17, 1964 the appellant applied for a prospecting licence in respect of a large area, which included the four areas for which respondent 1 had 394 applied for a mining concession during the Portuguese rule.
 In September 1965, the Government of Goa, decided to grant a prospecting licence to the appellant in respect of the whole area for which he had applied and sought approval of the Central Government under section 5(2) of the Act. As the application, was not granted within the time limit prescribed by the Rules, it was deemed to have been rejected. However, the Central Government on February 10, 1966 acting under S. 30 of the Act restored the application of the appellant and made a recommendation to the State Government that a prospecting licence should be granted to him in respect of certain area which included the area for which respondent 1 had applied to the Portuguese Government in September 1959. In pursuance of the Central Government's recommendation, the State Government granted to the appellant a prospecting licence on February 26, 1966.
 On August 16, 1966 respondent 1 made four applications for mining Leases in respect of the very same area for which he had applied for mineral concessions during the Portuguese rule and in respect of which the Government of Goa had, granted a prospecting licence to the appellant on February 26, 1966.
 The appellant applied for mining lease on May 8, 1967.
 The State Government having delayed the grant to the appellant, he filed a revision application under rule 54 of the Rules against the deemed refusal of his application. On April 20, 1969 the revision application was allowed by the Central Government which directed the State Government to grant a mining lease to the appellant in respect of a smaller area. This area covered the area in respect of which respondent 1 was agitating his right to obtain a mining lease.
 In between, upon the rejection of his revision application by the Central Government in September 1967, respondent I filed a writ petition challenging the orders of the Government refusing to grant a mining lease to him in respect of the four areas for which he had applied on August 16, 1966, contending that by virtue of the four titles of manifest duly transferred in his favour he had acquired an indefeasible right to obtain concessions over the said area even prior to the annexation of Goa, that he had presented applications and paid the necessary fees prior to the annexation, and that therefore, the right which had accrued in his favour could not be considered as having lapsed on the annexation.
 The High Court allowed the writ petition and quashed the orders dated September 16, 1964, September 18, 1967 and September 29, 1967 whereby respondent 1's applications for mining leases and his revision applications were rejected by the Government. The High Court also quashed the order dated February 26, 1966 whereby a prospecting licence was granted to the appellant and directed the State Government to treat the applications of respondent I dated September 4 and September 17, 1959 as still subsisting and to dispose them of.
 In the appeal to this Court, it was contended on behalf of the appellant, that there was an interregnum between December 20, 1961 when the Government of India annexed Goa, and March 5, 1962 when the Administration Act was brought into force, as a result of which, laws which were in force in Portuguese 395 Goa immediately before the annexation of Goa ceased to apply to that territory with effect from December 20, 1961 until March S, 1962. By section 5(1) of the Administration Act, it was only with effect from March S, 1962 that such laws continued in force in the annexed territory. Since respondent 1 had made his applications for mining leases or mining concessions under the Portuguese law and since that law itself ceased to apply to the conquered territory with effect from the date of conquest, the applications lapsed on that date. The "Titles of Manifest" obtained by respondent I under those laws conferred upon him no vested right to obtain the mineral concessions or mining leases. They only enabled him to apply for concessions, since the Title of Manifest under the Portuguese law was no more than what a prospecting licence is under the Indian law of mining.
 On behalf of respondent I it was contended that by virtue of the four Titles of Manifest which were duly transferred in his favour he had acquired the right to obtain mineral concessions in respect of the four areas prior to the annexation of Goa. He had presented the necessary applications within the prescribed period and he had also paid the necessary fees for obtaining mineral concessions. Since he was entitled to obtain mineral concessions or mining leases from the Portuguese Government, he would be entitled to obtain such concessions or leases from the Government of Goa also. Though, on the extension of the Act and the Rules to Goa with effect from October I, 1963, the Portuguese mining laws stood repealed by reason of section 4(1) of the Regulation the previous operation of the Portuguese mining laws so repealed was saved by reason of section 4(2) of the Regulation. Sub-section (2) also saved anything duly done or suffered under the Portuguese laws, as also the right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under those laws. The applications filed by respondent I for the grant of mining concessions were "legal proceedings" within the meaning of section 4(2) of the Regulation. Since those proceedings were instituted in accordance with the Portuguese mining laws on the basis of the right possessed by respondent I to obtain mining concessions, he was entitled to continue the proceedings as if the Regulation had not been passed, that is, to say as if the Portuguese mining laws continued to be in force in the conquered territory of Goa.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The applications for mineral concessions made by respondent 1 on the basis of Title Manifests of 1959 had lapsed. Even assuming that those applications were pending when the Act and the Rules were extended to Goa on October 1,1963, respondent 1's applications could only be decided in conformity with the Act and the Rules. Section 4 of the Act and rule 38 of the Rules support this view. Section 21 of the Act makes it penal to do any prospecting or mining operation otherwise than in accordance with the Act or the Rules. The Act and the Rules having been made applicable to the territory of Goa on October 1,1963, and the supposedly pending applications of respondent I not having been granted within a period of nine months, they must be deemed to have been refused under rule 24(3) of the Rules. [416 C-E] 
 2. Incases of acquisition of a territory by conquest, rights which had accrued under the old laws do not survive and cannot be enforced against the 396 new Government unless it chooses to recognise those rights.
 In order to recognise the old rights, it is not necessary for the new Government to continue the old laws under which those rights had accrued because, old rights can be recognised without continuing the old laws as, for example.
 by contract or executive action. On the other hand, the mere continuance of old laws does not imply the recognition of old rights which had accrued under those laws. Something more than the continuance of old laws is necessary in order to support the claim that old rights have been recognised by the new Government. That 'something more' can be found in a statutory provision whereby rights which had already accrued under the old laws are saved. In so far as the continuance of old laws is concerned, as a general rule, they continue in operation after the conquest, which means that the new Government is at liberty not to adopt them at all or to adopt them without a break in their continuity or else to adopt them from a date subsequent to the date of conquest.
 [413 D-F] In the instant case there was an interregnum between December 20, 1961 and March 5, 1962. During that period the old laws of the Portuguese regime were not in operation in the conquered territory of Goa. Secondly the rights recognised under sub-section 2 of section 4 the Regulation did not extend any protection to the rights which had accrued prior December 20, 1961 but envisaged only such rights which had come into being after March 5, 1962 by reason of the laws continued by the Act and the Regulation.
 Apart from that, the Government of India never recognised either during the interregnum or thereafter, any rights on the basis of titles of manifest obtained by any person during the Portuguese rule. On September 16, 1964 the Government of India issued an order stating expressly that all applications for mineral concessions made to the Portuguese Government on the basis of titles of manifest shall be deemed to have lapsed. Thus, far from there being any recognition by the Indian Government of rights accruing from titles of manifest there is a clear indication that it decided not to recognise those rights. For two years after the order of the Government of India dated September 16, 1961, Respondent 1 did not take any steps at all for the recognition or reassertion of his rights. He had obtained an order of refund of the amount which he had paid to the Portuguese Government. It was on August 16, 1966 that he applied for a mining lease under the Indian Law. He did so after the appellant had obtained a mining lease in his favour on February 26, 1966 and he applied for a lease in respect of the very same areas over which the appellant was granted a mining lease. On September 20, 1967 the Central Government rejected the application of respondent 1 for a mining lease and it is eleven months thereafter that he filed a writ petition challenging the various orders passed against him and the order by which a mining lease was granted to the appellant. No right had accrued in favour of respondent I under the Portuguese law and correspondingly, no liability or obligation was incurred by the Portuguese Government which the Government of India would be under a compulsion to accept by reason of the provisions contained in section 4 of the Regulation.
