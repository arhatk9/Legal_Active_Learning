 The Industrial Disputes Act was enacted to make provision for the investigation and settlement of the industrial disputes. The Act envisages collective bargaining, contracts between the workers' unions and management and the like which are matters outside the realm of the common law or the law of contracts. The Act defines an industrial dispute and what the term "settlement" means.
 Different authorities have been created at different levels for settlement and adjudication of industrial disputes, conferring on them varied and extensive powers. Where a dispute between the workers and management cannot be resolved by the conciliation procedure envisaged under the Act, the dispute is referred by the Government to a Labour Court or a Tribunal, the award of which becomes final and cannot be called in question by any court in any manner whatsoever. Under s. 18(1) a settlement arrived at by agreement between the employer and workmen, otherwise than in the course of conciliation proceeding, shall be binding on the parties to the agreement.
 In one of the departments of the appellant there were three groups of workers: One, the workers' union which was earlier recognised as a "trade union, and was derecognised by the appellant, and secondly another union which was recognised in its place and thirdly workmen who were members of neither union. As a result of a settlement entered into with the derecognised union an incentive scheme was in force in this department of the appellant. After the derecognition of the union. because of the increase in the strength of the workmen it became necessary for the company to revise the target figures of the incentive scheme. The company, therefore, entered into a settlement with the union recognised later. This led to protests from the derecognised union. Respondents 1 and 2 who were members of the derecognised union, instituted a suit in the Civil Court under O. I r. 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure in a representative capacity alleging that the earlier settlement was a contract of service and that the new settlement would bring about a change in their service conditions, that the new settlement was arrived at without following the mandatory requirements of s. 9A of the Act and have prayed for a permanent injunction to restrain the appellant from implementing the later settlement. During the trial the plaintiffs stated that they did not wish to enforce the first agreement as it would not be binding upon the workmen who were the members of the derecognised union. This led to dropping the issue relating to non-compliance with s. 9A of the Act also.
 The trial court held that it had jurisdiction to try the suit as it was a suit of a civil nature for enforcement of rights of common and general law and consequently there was no question of reliefs being claimed under the Industrial Disputes Act. Treating the incentive payments made during the years when the first agreement was in force as implied terms of conditions of service and trial court granted a conditional decree of injunction. On appeal, the High Court upheld the view of the trial court. On further appeal to this Court it was contended by the respondents that the remedy provided under the Industrial Disputes Act was a misnomer in that reference of an industrial dispute for adjudication to a tribunal 428 would depend upon the exercise of the power by the Government under s. 10(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act.
 The Act did not confer any right on the suitor.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD : The suit for a decree for permanent injunction was not maintainable in the civil court as it had no jurisdiction to grant the relief or even a temporary relief.
 [448C-D] (1) The principles applicable to the jurisdiction of the civil court in relation to an industrial dispute are, (i) if the dispute is not an industrial dispute nor does it relate to enforcement of any other right under the Act the remedy lies only in the civil court; (ii) if the dispute is an industrial dispute arising out of a right or liability under the general or common law and not under the Act, the jurisdiction of the civil court is alternative, leaving it to the election of the suitor concerned to choose his remedy for the relief which is competent to be granted in a particular remedy; (iii) if the industrial dispute relates to the enforcement of a right or an obligation created under the Act then the only remedy available to the suitor is to get an adjudication under the Act; (iv) if the right which is sought to be enforced is a right created under the Act such as Chapter VA then the remedy for its enforcement is either s. 33C or the raising of an industrial dispute, as the case may be.

 (2) In the present case it is clear that what the plaintiff, respondents wanted to prevent was the threatened breach of their right which flowed from the agreement entered into between the derecognised union and the company.
 Such a collective agreement is recognised and creates a right in favour of the members of the Union only under s.
 18(1) of the Act and not under the general law of contract.
 Withdrawal of the claim based upon the said agreement from the trial court had no effect on the question of its jurisdiction to try the suit. In so far as the suit was filed in a representative capacity on behalf of the members of the derecognised 429 union by two of its members under O. I r. 8 of the Code it was clearly a suit in relation to the exercise of right created under the Act. In their case it was not permissible to fall back upon the alleged implied terms and conditions of service. The source of their right was that agreement.
 Even the workmen who were not members of the derecognised union but were given the benefit of incentive payments under the said agreement were so given because they tacitly agreed to be bound by the agreement. Even accepting that in their case it had assumed the character of an implied term of contract of service, the alternative claim made in paragraph 8 of the plaint as being a condition of service otherwise, can be referable to the claim of the non-members only. The source of their right in that event was different and a representative suit on their behalf by the two plaintiffs could not be maintained. The numerous persons must have the same interest in one suit instituted under O. I r. 8 of the Code. Persons having different interests cannot be so represented. The better and more reasonable view therefore, is that all workmen represented by the two plaintiffs sought an order of injunction in the civil court to prevent an injury which was proposed to be caused to them in relation to their right under the Act. [447E-H, 448AB] (3) The dispute could well be decided from all aspects in a reference under the Act. Although the issue as to the non-compliance with the requirements of s. 9A of the Act was dropped, the trial court seems to have found that the proposed change in the conditions of service was adverse to the interests of the workmen. Whether it was so or not is a matter of debate. But it is apparent that both the agreements could not be simultaneously given effect to. The result of the order of injunction made by the trial court was that the workmen represented by the two plaintiffs were to get incentive payments in accordance with the scheme embodied in the earlier agreement ignoring the addition to the strength of the workmen. On the other hand, the members of the recognised union who had entered into the second agreement were to get their incentive payments in accordance with that agreement taking into account the contribution made in the matter of production by the newly added workmen.
 This leads to an impracticable result. [448C-G] (4) Section 41(a) of the Specific Relief Act says that an injunction cannot be granted to prevent breach of a contract the performance of which would not be specifically enforced. Section 42 providing an exception to this is not attracted in this case. Section 14(1)(c) says that a contract which is in its nature determinable cannot be specifically enforced. The contract in question embodied in the earlier agreement was in its nature determinable under s. 19(2) of the Act or could be varied by following the procedure under s. 9A. The decree or order of injunction made therein, is not sustainable on this account too. [448H, 449AB] (5) It cannot be said that remedy provided under the Industrial Disputes Act is a misnomer. Reference of industrial disputes for adjudication in exercise of the power of the Government under s. 10(1) is so common that it is difficult to call the remedy a misnomer or insufficient or inadequate for the purpose of enforcement of the right or liability created under the Act. The enforcement of a right or an obligation under the Act, the remedy provided uno flatu in it is the exclusive remedy. The legislature in its wisdom did not think it fit and proper to provide a very easy and smooth remedy for enforcement of the rights and obligations created under the Act. Persons wishing the enjoyment of such rights and wanting its enforcement must rest content to secure the remedy provided by the Act. The possibility that the Government may not ultimately refer an industrial dispute under s. 10 on the ground of expediency is not a relevant consideration in this regard. [439C-F] (6) The principle of separate remedy only for the purpose of injunction available in a court of Chancery, which was kept intact even after the judicature Act of 1873 is not applicable in India. In India, under s. 9 C.P.C.
 courts have, subject to certain restrictions, jurisdiction to try suits of civil nature excepting suits of which their cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred. If a suit in relation to an industrial dispute relates to the enforcement of a right created under the Act by necessary intendment, the jurisdiction of the civil court is barred.
 That being so. in India, it is barred for all purposes and a suit for in- 430 junction only would not lie. The jurisdiction of the civil court in India to grant a relief of injunction is limited to cases in which there is a right at law. that is to say, a right to be pursued in such court.

 (7) (a) The manner of voluntary reference of industrial disputes to arbitration is provided in s. 10A of the Industrial Disputes Act. The reference to arbitration has to be on the basis of a written agreement between the employer and the workmen. As provided in s. 10A(5) of the Industrial Disputes Act, nothing in the Arbitration Act, 1940 shall apply to arbitrations under s. 10A of the Act. [449H, 450A] (b) Where a written agreement was executed, according to which the parties agreed to refer a dispute regarding dismissal of certain workmen to a Board of Arbitrators consisting of three persons and the employer terminates the settlement under s. 19(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act and later withdraws its nominee from the Board of Arbitrators, a suit filed in a civil court by the employees challenging the action of the employer and for direction to restrain the employer from committing a breach of the agreement and to a point its nominee in the place of the one who had withdrawn, such a suit is in relation to the enforcement of a right created under the Act. In such a case the remedy in civil court is barred. The only remedy available to the workmen concerned was the raising of an industrial dispute. [450BCD] South Indian Bank Ltd. v. A. R.
