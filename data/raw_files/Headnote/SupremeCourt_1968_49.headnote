 A joint stock company had an employees provident fund scheme which was being managed by a board of trustees. The first respondent, a chartered accountants was appointed by the board of directors of the company to audit the accounts of the Provident Fund for the years 1953 and 1954. During 1954 the trustees of the Fund made certain advances of over rupees six lakhs to the company in contravention of the Rules of the Fund. The company issued various cheques in repayment of the advances but, .it the request of the company, the cheques were not cashed and were kept by the trustees. After receiving the cheques the trustees made book en-tries showing repayment of the advances though the cheques were uncashed. On May 25, 1955, the first respondent wrote to the company disapproving the advances as not being in accordance with the Rules as Well as the fact that the cheques issued by the company in repayment were not cashed promptly. At a meeting of the Trustees on May 27, 1955 it was regretted that the cheques, were not cashed at he company's request and resolved that they should be returned to the company and interest charged from the date of issue of the cheques.
 The first respondent signed the statements of accounts of the Provident Fund for 1953 on May 14, 1954 and for 1954 on June 30, 1955 and certified them as "Checked with the books and accounts produced and found correct". The second respondent filed a complaint against him with the institute of Chartered Accountants of India alleging that as the auditor, he had failed to disclose in his certificate on the statement of accounts that advances were made to the company in contravention of Rules of the Fund or to draw attention to the fact that a large amount of cash was shown as cash in hand in the statements of accounts also in contravention of the Rules. After an enquiry under s. 21 of the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949, the Disciplinary Committee of the Institute found the first respondent guilty of professional misconduct,under items (o), (p) and (q) of the Schedule to the Act and the Council of the Institute confirmed this finding and referred the case to the High Court for final orders. The High Court set aside these findings and absolved the first respondent of the crages of misconduct.
 On appeal to this Court, HELD Allowing the appeal:
 (1) On June 30, 1955 when the first respondent signed the statement of accounts for 1954 be fully knew that a loan had been granted by the trustees to the company in violation of the Rules; and further that cheques 331 received in repayment were not cashed and, indeed, were not intended to be cashed, and were issued by the Company for a false indication of adjustment at the end of the accounting year. In these circumstances it was ,,he duty of the first respondent to point out in the statement of accounts that a major part of the cash in hand represented uncashed cheques, that the cheques were apparently given by the company for repayment of the loan and that the transaction was in violation of the Rule,, of the Provident Fund. His failure in not pointing out these facts constituted professional misconduct falling within cl. (o) of the Schedule to the Act. [336 A, E-G] (ii) It was no defence- for the first respondent to 'say that he had disclosed the irregularity to the company by his letter dated May 5, 1955 and that he owed a duty only to the company which appointed him to audit the account's of the Provident Fund but not to the beneficiaries of the Fund. On the contrary it was a breach of duty on his part not to have made a disclosure to the beneficiaries of the Provident Fund in the statement of accounts. The primary object of auditing the Fund was to apprise the beneficiaries of the true financial Position of the accounts and investments made from time to time and in such a case the auditor is under a clear duty towards the beneficiaries "to probe into the transaction" and to report on their true character.
