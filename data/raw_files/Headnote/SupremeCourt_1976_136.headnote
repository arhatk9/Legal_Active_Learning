 Dharmavaram., forwarded it to the police under s. 156(3) Cr.P.C. for investigation The appellants filed an application in the High Court under s. 482 Cr.P.C. 1973, against the Magistrate's order, hut the same was dismissed.
 it was contended before this Court that the complaint included offences triable exclusively by the Sessions Court, and under s. 202(1) Proviso l(a), 1973, the Magistrate was prohibited from directing the police to investigate it, that he was bound to proceed with it himself before issuing process to the accused. The appeal was, inter alia, contested on the ground that . the powers conferred on the Magistrate under s. 156(3) of the Code are independent of his power to send the case for investigation under s. 2021 af the Code. Section 156(3) can be invoked before the Magistrate takes congnizace of the case but s. 202 comes into operation only after he start; dealing with the com Plaint in accordance with the provisions of Chapter XV.
 Dismissing the appeal of the Court, 
^ HELD: (1) The power to order police investigation under , 156(3) different from the power to direct investigation conferred by s. '202(1). 'The.` two operate in distinct spheres at different stages. The first is exercisable at the re-cognizance stage, the second at the post-cognizance stage when the Magistrate is in seisin of the case. An investigation under s. 202 is "for the purpose or deciding whether or not there is sufficient ground for proceeding".
 its not to initiate a fresh case on police report, but to assist the Magistrate in completing proceedings already instituted upon a complaint before him. The stage at which s. 202 could become operative was never reached in this case. [530-H; 531B] (2) When on receiving a complaint, the Magistrate applies his mind for the purposes of proceeding under s. 200 and the succeeding sections in chapter XV of the Code of 1973 he is said to have taken cognizance of the offence within the meaning of s. 190(l)(a). If instead of' proceeding under Chapter XV. he has in the exercise of his discretion, taken action of some other kind, he cannot be said to have taken cognizance of any offence.
