 In certain land acquisition references the District Judge passed an order in 1963 awarding compensation to be paid by the appellant to the first respondent. When the first respondent levied execution the appellant filed objections on Aug" 27, 1964, under s. 47, Civil Procedure Code, but the objection petitions were dismissed in January 1965. On March 4, 1965, it was discovered that no appeal was filed against the. Order of the district judge awarding compensation. Thereafter the appellant took diligent and active steps to challenge the decision of.the district judge. On the advice of the legal adviser an application under Art. 227 was filed on May 17, 1965 and on July 4, 1965 appeals were filed against the decision of the district judge with an application under s. 5 of the Limitation Act 1963, praying that the delay in filing the appeal may be excused. In that application after stating the above facts it was also severed that the delay was caused by the omission and neglect of the Government Pleader to advise the appellant. The High Court held that the appellant had not sufficiently explained the delay during the period between August 27, 1964 and July 3, 1965 but gave no reasons for its conclusion.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : It is not possible to lay down precisely as to what facts or matters would constitute 'sufficient cause' under s. 5 of the Limitation Act. But those words should be liberally construed so as to advance substantial justice when no negligence or any inaction or want of bona fides is imputable to a party; that is, the delay in filing an.
 appeal should not have been for reasons which indicate the party's negligence in not taking necessary steps which he could have or should have taken. What would be 'such necessary steps will again depend upon the circumstances of a particular case. The High Court in the present case was certainly not bound to accept readily whatever has been stated on behalf of the State to explain the delay. But, it was the duty of the High Court to have scrutinised the reasons given by the State and considered the same on merits. The circumstance that the appellant discovered that no appeal was filed only in March 1965 and that thereafter diligent steps were taken by filing the application under Art. 227 and the appeal show that it is not possible to impute to the appellant want of bona fides or such inaction.
 or negligence as would deprive them of the protection of s.
 5 of the Limitation Act. Even if filing the application under Act. 227 was not a proper step, if a party had acted in a particular manner on the wrong advice given by his legal adviser he cannot be held guilty of negligence so as to dissentitle him to plead 'sufficient cause' under s. 5 of the Limitation Act.
