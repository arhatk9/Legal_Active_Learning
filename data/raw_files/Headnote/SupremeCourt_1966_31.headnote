 On supersession of the Patna Municipality, the State Government by a notification directed an officer of the Municipality to exercise and perform the powers and duties of the Commissioner under s. 107 of the Bihar and Orissa Municipal Act, 1922. Under s. 117 every application presented to the Commissioners for review of an assessment or valuation had to be heard and determined by a Committee consisting of two Commissioners, two tax-payers and a Deputy Magistrate as provided in the section. By a later notification, the Government directed each of the three persons mentioned therein one of whom was the aforesaid officer, to exercise and perform the powers and duties conferred and imposed on Committee constituted under s. 117 of the Act. Pursuant to these notifications, the said officer enhanced the valuation of the holding of the appellant and the assessment thereof under s. 107(1)(c) of the Act and rejected the review petition under s. 117(1) of the Act. The appellant filed a suit challenging the validity of the order of the officer.
 
HELD : (i) The order of the officer rejecting the objections filed by the appellant and enhancing the value of the holdings was without jurisdiction.
 By a later Notification, if it was intended to 'replace the committee by one or other of the three persons mentioned therein, it would be beyond the powers of the Government conferred under the provisions of s. 386(1) (b) of the Act. The effect of this clause is that all the powers and duties of the Commissioners conferred and imposed on them under the various sections of the Act whether acting in.
 committees or individually would be exercised by such person or persons as the State Government may direct. So, the committee under s. 117 could have been constituted with one or more of the three persons nominated by the Government under s. 386(1) (b) of the Act, and two tax-payers nominated by them and a Deputy Magistrate nominated by the Government.
 To say that when once the Commissioners vacated their office on supersession it was impossible for them to nominate or elect two other taxpayers to the committee within the meaning of s. 117(1) would render inoperative all sections whereunder powers were conferred or duties imposed on Commissioners, and would make s. 117(1) unworkable leading of the anomaly that the same officer who revised the assessment would sit in judgment over it. [471 0; 472 A-D] (ii) Under s. 107(1) (c) of the Act, the burden is upon the Commissioners, before they could amend the valuation and assessment already made, to establish that the previous assessment was incorrectly made by reason, of fraud, misrepresentation or mistake.
