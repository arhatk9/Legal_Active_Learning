 The first respondent was successful in the election to the State Legislative Assembly. At the time of election he was the Chief Minister of the State. The election was challenged by the petitioner on the allegations that by ordering the covering of a nallah, the construction of a road, the installation of water caps and the grant of pattas to the inhabitants of a colony for construction of houses, the first respondent made a bargain with the people for votes and thus committed corrupt practice as defined in s.
 123(1) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.
 Though the High Court found certain facts against the first respondent, it decided all the issues in his favour and dismissed the election petition.
 In appeal to this Court, 
 HELD : (1) On the evidence, oral and documentary, the findings of fact found against the first respondent by the High Court should be reversed, even though no appeal was preferred by the first respondent . [541 G-H; 542 H] (2) When it appears that the High Court had not taken into consideration the entire documentary and oral evidence in arriving at a finding and that the High Court had overlooked such important and crucial evidence, this Court is justified in deciding in favour of the respondent, after considering that evidence by reversing the findings of fact arrived at by the High Court. [542 G-H; 543 A-B] (3) Under s. 116C of the Act, the procedure in an appeal under s. 116A to this Court is that subject to the provisions of the Act and rules, if any, made thereunder, every appeal shall be heard and determined by this Court as nearly as may be in accordance with the procedure applicable to the hearing and determination of an appeal from the final order passed by a High Court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction and the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure and the rules of the Court shall, as far as possible, apply in relation to such appeal. There are no rules of this Court, and the provisions contained, in 0.41, r. 22, C.P.C., are attracted with the result that the respondent may support the decision of the High Court even on any ground decided against him, without preferring an appeal.

 Shaiza, C.A. No. 1125/1970 dt. 21.1.1971, followed.
 523 (4) Ordinarily amelioration of grievances of the public is innocuous, and cannot be construed against a candidate who is a Minister. If, however, there is evidence to indicate that any candidate at the election abused his power and position as a Minister in the Government by utilising public revenues for conferring advantage or benefit on a particular group of people for the purpose of obtaining their votes, different considerations will arise and it may be held to be a corrupt practice within the meaning of s. 123(1) of the Act. [544 D-F] In the present case, in all the instances relied upon by the appellant the evidence showed that there were long standing public grievances and the Government had from time to time made suggestions and recommendations for redress of the grievances and amelioration of the condition of the people.
 It cannot be said that on the eve of election there was any sudden or spontaneous outburst of public activity in the shape of diverting money to win electors to the side of the first respondent by throwing baits or giving them any particular and specially favoured treatment.
