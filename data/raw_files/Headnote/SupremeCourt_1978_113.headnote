 A chargesheet to the effect viz., "Neglect of work in-that on 21-5-66 you packed approximately 130M, Embassy packets with Scissors slides whilst operating M/C No. 14 resulting in loss of 200 (two hundred man hours approximately for opening up the packets and changing the slides, and loss of material valued at Rs. 126/- approximately." was served upon respondent no. 3 for his misconduct which was followed up by a domestic enquiry which found him guilty. Accepting the report his services were terminated.
 On the raising of an industrial dispute it was referred for adjudication by the Government of Bihar to the Labour Court, Patna, respondent no. 1 by a Notification dated the 6th/17th February, 1968. The Labour Court noticed "(1) from the documents of record it is abundantly clear that the management and Shri Ram Krishan Pathak are not on happy terms for several years" (2) "the service card indicates that the service records of Shri Pathak are not neat and clean". In view of its finding that the order of discharge was mala fide and unreasonable in the sense that the workman was guilty of the charge of fault only and not of misconduct the Labour Court made an award on November 23, 1970 ordering reinstatement of Respondent No. 3 with all his back wages from the date of dismissal till the date of reinstatement.
 The Appellant challenged the award by filing a writ petition in the High Court which was dismissed on July 23, 1973. At the instance of the Management a certificate of fitness was granted by the High Court on February 22, 1974. In the order granting the certificate the High Court mentioned that out of three points urged by the appellant only one point justified the ground of certificate as that point involved a substantial question of law of general importance needing the decision by the Supreme Court. Pursuant to the grant of the certificate, a petition of appeal was filed in this Court, followed in the usual course by a statement of the case. Various other points which have been argued on behalf of the management before the labour court as also in the High Court were taken in the petition of appeal and the statement of the case. However no separate petition was lodged by the appellant along with the petition of appeal in accordance with Rule 5 of Order XV of the Supreme Court Rules 1966. The appellant restricted his arguments only to the three following points out of the several argued before the High Court, viz. (a) That the reference is invalid on the very face of it, that it was-mechanically made by the Government without the application of mind. (b) That the workman was guilty of misconduct within the meaning of 1045 clause (ii) of Standing Order 20 applicable to the appellant and both the Courts below have committed errors of law on the face of the record in taking a contrary view. (c) That in any view of the matter on the facts and in the circumstances of the case it was not expedient, fit or proper to order reinstatement of the concerned workman and in lieu thereof only compensation should have been allowed.
 A preliminary objection was raised on behalf of respondent no. 3 to the effect that the appellant, having not complied with the requirement of Rule 5 of Order XV of the Supreme Court Rules 1966, could urge only one point on the basis on which the certificate was granted by the High Court and not other.
 Allowing the appeal in part the Court 
HELD : (1) (a) Rule 5 of Order XV of the Supreme Court Rules, was not applicable and compliance thereof was not necessary to enable the appellant to urge and reiterate any of the points taken by it in the High Court; (b) Rule 5-A of Order XV suggests that the High Court 'is required to record the reasons or the grounds for granting the certificate. In this case the High Court in its order gave the reasons and finding that atleast one of the points was such that could justify the granting of the certificate under Art. 133(1) and granted the certificate to appeal to the Supreme Court;
 and (c) The certificate granted is an open one enabling the appellant to urge all the points arising in the appeal in this Court. There is nothing either in any provision of the Constitution or the rules to indicate the points other than the one which enabled the High Court to grant the certificate could not be raised in this Court without its leave. [1049BE] (2) For the purpose of granting the certificate all that the High Court is the groundmentioned in the constitutional provision. Even if a single such question oflaw is found to arise in the case, a certificate must be granted.
 Once the certificate is granted and the appeal is lodged in the Supreme Court it is open to the appellant to raise all grounds which properly arise in the appeal. The circumstance, that there are grounds which were not found sufficient for the grant of a certificate does not preclude the Supreme Court from entertaining them as grounds arising in the appeal. The stage at which the High Court considers the grant of a certificate under Art. 133(1) and the stage at which the Supreme Court hears the appeal are two distinct stages and different jurisdictions are exercised with respect to each stage. Considerations pertinent to the grant of a certificate are not identical with considerations which govern the hearing of the appeal. Accordingly even if some of the points raised by the appellant in the High Court in support of the petition for a certificate are found insufficient for that purpose, they can still be considered as grounds during the hearing of the appeal. The amendment brought about in Art. 133(1) makes no difference in the matter of the applicability of the principle to the point at issue. In the instant case it is clear that the leave of this Court was not necessary to enable the appellant to urge in appeal the other grounds of attack in relation to the award as affirmed by the High Court.[1049 F-H, 1050 A. D] Addagada Raghavamma & Anr. v. Addagada Chenchamma & Anr., [1963] INSC 90; [1964] 2 SCR 933 followed. , (3)Order XV of the Rules is not confined to a certificate granted by a High Court under clause (1) of Art. 133 only.
 But it relates to a certificate granted under clause (1) of Art. 132 also. Order XV of the Rules will be clearly attracted to such a situation stated in Art. 132(3). When a certificate is granted under Art. 133(1) only, then the party appealing to the Supreme Court can urge as one of the grounds in appeal filed pursuant to such certificate that a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution has been wrongly decided. An express provision to this effect was, perhaps, thought necessary to remove any doubt for the raising of such a new point even without the leave of the Court. That being so, it will be highly unreasonable to hold that in an appeal filed in accordance with Art. 133(1) of the Constitution the appellant cannot urge any new grounds and must be confined to the grounds which enable the High Court to grant the certificate. [1050 E, F, H, 1051A] 1046 (4)The reference, in the instant case, was not bad for the alleged non-application of the mind by the Government though care should always be taken to avoid the mere copying of the words from the Statute while making an order of reference.
 [1051 F-G] (a)To keep an order of reference free from the pale of attack on the groundthat the Government did not apply its mind to the fact whether the disputeis only apprehended on whether a specific dispute existed. the Government must specify one or the other in their order of reference. The Government should clarify the position in such cases and remove the ambiguity by filing a counter when the reference order is challenged on this ground. [1051 H,1052-A] In the instant case, neither the one nor the other was done although the State was made a party respondent to this writ petition, and (b) on the facts and in the circumstances the industrial dispute existed when it was referred to by the Government to the Labour Court for adjudication and the Government made the reference on being satisfied that it was so. There was no question of dispute being apprehended.
 The mention of the words "or is apprehended" in the order of reference is a mere surplus age and does not in this case, necessarily lead to the conclusion that the reference was made in a cavalier manner without any application of mind;
 and (c) The observation in M/s. Hindustan General Electrical Corporation Ltd. Karampura v. State of Bihar & Ors. AIR 1967 Pat. 284 indicating that even if no definite opinion was formed as to the existence or apprehension of a dispute, the reference could be made are not quite correct.
 (d) In Kurji Holy Family Hospital case, 1970 labour and Industrial Cases, 105, while making the reference an identically defective phraseology was used without specifying whether the industrial dispute existed or was apprehended. The view expressed by the Patna High Court therein viz. "merely because in the notification the words "or is apprehended" are also there, it cannot be said that the Government were not satisfied as to the existence of a dispute was not quite accurate either though it can be sustained on a slightly different basis.

 (5)The argument that even neglect of work simpliciter can be a misconduct within the meaning of sub-clause (i) of clause (ii) of Standing Order 20 apart from its being a fault within the meaning of sub-clause (b) of clause (i) of the said Standing Order, as the word 'habitual' in the former merely qualifies the word 'negligence' and not the expression 'neglect of work' is not correct. [1056A] Mere neglect of work cannot be both. If it is so it is a fault. If it is habitual, that is, if it is repeated several times then only it is misconduct. It may well be that fault of one kind or the other as enumerated in sub- clause (a) to (g) of Standing Order 20(i) if repeated more than once may be habitual within the meaning of Standing Order 20(ii)(i) and especially in the light of the fourth fault being a misconduct within the meaning of Standing Order 20(a). But on the facts of this case there being no charge against respondent no. 3 that he was guilty of habitual neglect of work, the Labour Court found that the negligence of the workman was not of a serious kind. Some others in the factory also contributed to it. [1056 B-C] (6)While considering the proper relief to be granted to the workman whose dismissal has been found to be wrongful, mala fide or illegal, though no hard and fast rule could be laid down the Tribunal has to consider each case on its merits.
 The past record of the employee, the nature of his alleged present lapse and the ground on which the order of the management is set aside are also relevant factors for consideration. The High Court has the authority to 1047 interfere with the discretion of the Tribunal where reinstatement was ordered without proper, adequate and justifiable factors in support of the alternative relief of compensation.

 Western India Automobile v. Industrial Tribunal Bombay & Ors. (1949-50) SCR 321 referred to.
 In the present case; (a) the Labour Court without applying its mind, in spite of its noticing the unsatisfactory record of respondent no. 3, as to whether it was a fit case where reinstatement should be ordered or compensation should be awarded, followed the former course which was affirmed by the High Court. (b ) every case has to be adjudged on its special facts and in the instant case, the service record of the employee showed that he had committed several faults in the past, was sometimes warned, sometimes suspended and sometimes reprimanded for all those omissions and commissions. In the incident in question he was clearly guilty of neglect of duty in putting wrong slides, although they were wrongly supplied to him, while packing the cigarettes on the packing machine. Even shortly before the incident in question according to his own showing he was once warned for absence from proper place of work without permission and was suspended for three days for an act subversive of discipline before he was dismissed in June 1966. Therefore it was not a fit case where the High Court ought to have sustained the order of reinstatement as passed by the Labour Court [1057 F-H, 1058 B, C, E] [The Court directed payment of a sum of Rs. 30,000/- to respondent no. 3 within a month's time by way of compensation in addition to the gratuity and provident fund admissible to him less any amount paid already.]
