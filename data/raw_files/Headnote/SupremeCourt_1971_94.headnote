 The appellant and the third respondent were members of the Punjab Civil Medical Service, Class I. The second Respondent, who was serving abroad, was offered the post of Civil Surgeon in the Punjab Civil Medical Service and he joined the post of Chief Medical Officer in the Punjab Civil Medical Service, Class 1, temporarily. Applications for filling up the post permanently were invited through the.
 Public Service Commission, and the second respondent was selected and appointed. Thereafter, he was appointed in the Selection Grade of the Punjab Civil Medical Service. Ten day,. later, the appellant and the third respondent were also appointed. to the selection Grade.
 The appellant impeached the second respondent's appointment to the Selection Grade on two grounds: (1) that the appointment to the Selection ,Grade could only be by promotion from Punjab Civil Medical Service, Class 1, and not by direct appointment; and (2) even if the second respondent could be appointed direct to the Selection Grade his seniority should be below that of the appellant and the third respondent, on the ground that the appellant and the third respondent were senior to the second respondent in the time scale of Class I Service.
 
HELD:(1) The Service as defined in r. 2(c) of the Punjab Civil Medical Service Class I (Recruitment and conditions of Service) Rules, means the Punjab Civil Medical Service Class I and the Selection Grade is a part and parcel of the Punjab Civil Medical Service Class I Therefore, when r. 5 specifically speaks of appointment to the Service by direct recruitment it embraces both Class I and the Selection Grade. The word appointment means both by promotion and by direct recruitment and is used in that sense in relation to the selection grade in r. 5 and in relation to the total number of appointments to the service in r. 9(3). Direct appointment to Selection Grade is not only contemplated in rr. 5 and 9(3) but is also implicit in them. Further, the rules contemplate direct appointment to Selection Grade in proper cases when there are no suitable persons in Class Itime scale who can be promoted to the Selection Grade. [226A; 228B-F] (2)The second respondent's appointment to the post of Chief Medical Officer was in consultation with the Punjab Public Service Commission as contemplated by r. 3, but the seniority list of the Class I service to which the appellant and the respondents belonged was not fixed. Where there are no specific rules in regard to the fixation of seniority in the Selection Grade in the case of direct appointment, the second respondent, having been recruited earlier than the appellant and the third respondent, his seniority should not be disturbed.
