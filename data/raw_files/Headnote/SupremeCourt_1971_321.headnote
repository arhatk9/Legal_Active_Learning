 The appellant company objected to an order tinder s. 23A sought to be passed against it by the Income-tax Officer on the ground that it was an order of assessment or re- assessment within the meaning of s. 34(3) of the Act and barred by time. The writ petition in the High Court having failed the company by special leave appealed to this Court.
 A plea was made for reviewing the judgment in Parikh's case in which this Court had held that s. 34(3) was not applicable to an order tinder s. 23A.
 
HELD : The plea for review of Parikh's case must be rejected because : (i) The point was not likely to arise under the Income-tax Act, 1961 as s. 106 thereof provides a period of limitation for an order such as the one in question; (ii) It was not shown that some vital point was not considered or that the judgment was clearly erroneous so as to justify review on the principles laid down in Keshav Mills; (iii) The words 'after the expiry of four years from the end of the year in which the income. profits and gains were first assessable' in s. 34(3) are not apposite to cover the order made under s. 23A as it stood before its amendment by the Finance Act It of 1957. An order tinder s. 23A does not assess income. profits and gains as such but levies super-tax on a certain portion of the undistributed profits and gains. The taxable event is non-distribution of some part of profits which have already been assessed. They were not only first assessable but assessed. It would be odd to start the beginning ,of the period of limitation from the time the profits were actually first assessed. [504 H-505 F] The appeal must accordingly be dismissed.
