 The appellant was convicted u/s. 302 I.P.C. by the Sessions' Judge for murdering his father and sentenced to death. The High Court accepted the death sentence and dismissed his appeal. He was also convicted for an alleged illegal possession of a gun and his convictions and sentences under secs. 25 and 27 of the Arms Act were upheld by the High Court. The prosecution case was that the deceased was a wealthy landlord whose sister was the Maharani of Patiala.
 He had executed a will in favour of his wife and two sons on 24-8-1967. He cancelled this will and executed another in favour of his sister, Rani Prem Kaur, on 18-4-1968 and got it registered at a place called Dhuri, probably because P.W.
 1, a friend of the deceased, was the Sub Registrar there.
 The deceased also alienated some property to a minor son of P.W. 1 sometime before the murder. The elder son of deceased had filed a suit to preempt this sale and the suit was pending hi it the time of the occurrence. The relation between the deceased, s wife and children were strained and this background was said to provide the motive for murder. It is alleged that the appellant, on the day of occurrence, had entered the room, where the deceased was sitting with 2 of his friends, P.W. 1 and P.W. 2, in the blazing light of electricity and had shot his father with a gun.
 Before this Court, the appellant raised several questions of law and contended that there has been a miscarriage of justice because the Courts below have ignored certain basic defects in the prosecution version and misread the evidence.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) It is not the practice of this Court in appeal by special leave to disturb concurrent findings of fact unless the case discloses some exceptional features indicating that a serious miscarriage of justice has taken place. [809 G-H] (ii)In criminal cases, it is often difficult for courts of law to arrive at the real truth. The judicial process can only operate on the firm foundations of actual and credible evidence on record. Mere suspicion or suspicious circumstances cannot relieve the prosecution of its primary duty of proving its case against an accused person beyond reasonable doubt. Courts of justice cannot be swayed by sentiment or prejudice against a person accused of the very reprehensible crime of patricide. If the pieces of evidence on which the prosecution closes to rest its case are so brittle that they crumble easily, the superstructure built on such insecure foundations also collapses. [810E] (iii)Ile super-structure of the prosecution case rests on the testimony of two alleged eye-witnesses whose evidence is not only of an inherently unreliable nature because of features disclosed by evidence, but the artificial and incredible versions of the shooting put forward by them are too unnatural to be accepted.
 (iv)P.W. 1 gave a false explanation to accept for his presence at the house of the deceased on the evening of 22-2-1970. He admitted, at the trial that he gave false information as to when he left for Patiala, but he pleaded that he did so at the instance of the S.D.O. who had put pressure on him not to give evidence in the prosecution case against the appellant. If, as he had admitted, he was capable of making a false statement under such pressure, it is not possible to describe this witness as thoroughly reliable. It is also difficult to believe that an S.D.O.
 will put pressure upon a Naib Tehsildar working under him to commit perjury. Therefore, the testimony of the witness is inherently unreliable. He was both a chance witness and one who admitted having committed, perjury.
 809 (v)It is also difficult to believe that P.W. 2, another eye-witness, who came to, the house of the deceased by chance, was really present at the time of the occurrence.
 Although this witness did not tell a deliberate lie but he had written a letter, exhibit 'X', wherein he stated that he had not witnessed the murder at all, and that the police was harassing him to make a false statement. The handwriting on this letter and the signature below it were denied by the witness who duly proved to be his. There was no reason to discard the evidence of the hand-writing expert on these points. Balbir Singh, P.W. 2. had written this letter he was shown to have done, he could not be relied upon at all when he stated that he witnessed the murder.
 (vi)Conflicting statements made about the time of the alleged presence of the witnesses on the scene of murder also show that they were not there at all to witness it.
 (vii)Further, from a careful writing of the F.I.R., it seems that the said F.I.R. was written up carefully afterwards. Under the circumstances, the conviction and sentence cannot be sustained.
