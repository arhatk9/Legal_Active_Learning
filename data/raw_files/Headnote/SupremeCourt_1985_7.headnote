 The petitioner-union contended in the writ petitions to this Court that out of the 16,000 and odd workers working within the premises of the respondent undertaking as many as a thousand workers were treated as 'contract labour' and placed under the control and at the mercy of contractors and that though they did the same work as the workers directly employed by the undertaking, they were not paid the same wages nor were their conditions of service the same. It was further alleged that the management pays to the contractors and in turn the contractors pay them their salary after deducting substantial commissions and that the wages received by them bear no comparison with the wages paid to those directly employed by the undertaking. In view of these circumstances it was alleged that the rights of these workers were infringed under Articles 14 and 19(1) (f) and a declaration was sought from the Court, that the system of contract labour prevalent in the respondent-undertaking was illegal, that the 'contract labour' employees were direct employees of the respondent-undertaking and entitled to equal pay as the workmen directly employed, 612 The respondent-undertaking opposed the writ petitions and contended that if the petitioners had any genuine grievance they could have availed themselves of the rights secured to them under the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970 Minimum Wages Act, 1948. Equal Remuneration Act 1976 etc., for ventilation their grievances and seeking appropriate relief, instead of invoking Article 
32. It was further contended, that certain jobs though required to be done within the plant area could be more conveniently and efficiently done on a job-con tract basis by contractors and this Was actually due to the incorporation of new technology for expansion of production programme with foreign collaboration. The jobs themselves were entrusted to contractors and it was not appropriate to say that the contractors merely supplied the labour, they were required to do the total job and payment was made on the basis of the quantum of work involved and not on the basis of the workers employed by the contractor.
 Dismissing the writ petitions, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970 does not provide for the total abolition of contract labour, but only for its abolition in certain circumstances, and for the regulation of the employment of con tract labour in certain establishments The Act is not confined to private employers only. The definitions of 'establishment' section 2(e), and 'principal employer' section 2(g), expressly include the Government or any of its departments. [616F, 617] 
 2. No invidious distinction can be made against Contract labour. Contract labour is entitled to the same wages, holidays, hours of work, and conditions of service as are applicable to workmen directly employed by the principal employer of the establishment on the same or similar kind of work. They are entitled to recover their wages and their conditions of service in the same manner as workers employed by the principal employer under the appropriate Industrial and Labour Laws. If there is any dispute with regard to the type of work, the dispute has to be decided by the Chief Labour Commissioner (Central). [620A-C] 
 3. Parliament has not abolished contract labour but has provided for its abolition by the Central Government in appropriate cases under sec. 10 of the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970. It is not for the court to enquire into the question and to decide whether the employment of contract labour in any process, operation or other work in any establishment should be abolished or not.
 This is a matter for the decision of the Government after considering the matters required to be considered under sec.
 10 of the Act. [620C-D] 
 4. Whether the work done by the Contract Labour is the same or similar work as that done by the workmen directly employed by the principal employer of any establishment is a matter to be decided by the Chief Labour Commissioner under the proviso to Rule 25(ii) (v) (a) of the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Central Rules, 1971. [620D-E] 31 In the instant case, from the allegations and counter- allegations made in the writ petition it is not possible in an application under Art. 32 to embark into an enquiry whether the thousand and odd workmen working in various capacities and engaged in multifarious activities do work identical with work done-by 613 the workmen directly employed by the BHEL and whether for that reason they should be treated not as contract labour but as direct employees of the undertakings. There are other forums created under statutes designed for deciding such question.
 
 5. A direction would issue to the Central Government to consider whether the employment of Contract Labour should not be prohibited under sec. 10 of the Act in any process, operation or other work of the public undertaking. [620E] 6.
 There will also be a direction to the Chief Labour Commissioner to enquire into the question whether the work done by the workmen employed by the contractors is the same type of work as that done by the workmen directly employed by the principal employer in the undertaking. [620E-F]
