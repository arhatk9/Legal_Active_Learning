 The appellant was repatriated from the temporay post of Controller of Food Grains Department to his parent department of Excise and Prohibition. His record of service showed that he was chosen to go on deputation twice in 1942 and in 1957 and that he was chosen for his experience. The record also showed that he was promoted from time to time.
 While holding the post of Controller, the Director of Civil Supplies asked him about certain charges of receiving money and gifts at the time of the marriage of his daughter and that he forced his peons to do menial work at the marriage.
 The Secretary to the Government virtually threatened to repatriate him to his parent department, and the Minister visited ',he office of the appellant and said there were complaints against him. The appellant asked for an inquiry and the police conducted an inquiry. The investigation indicated that the appellant was totally free from blame or taint. At the time of the passing of the order of reversion the appellant protested and asked the Government to wait for the completion of the investigation but the Government did not accede to the request.
 On the question whether there was violation of the provisions in Art. 311 of the Constitution, 
HELD: The facts and circumstances bring out in bold relief that the order of reversion was in the nature of punishment and was passed without complying with the provisions of the Constitution. [123H] The post which the appellant was holding was a temporary one, but the appellant was reverted neither because the temporary post was abolished nor because he was unsuitable to continue nor because the parent department of the appellant wanted him back. A Government servant holding a temporary post and having a lien on his substantive post may be sent back to the substantive post in ordinary routine administration or because of exigencies of service. Such a person may have been drawing a salary higher than that of his substantive post but when he is reverted to the parent department the loss of salary cannot be said to have any penal consequences. The matter has to be viewed as one of substance and all relevant factors have to be considered in ascertaining whether the order is a genuine one of accident of service in which a person sent from the substantive post to a temporary post has to go back to the parent post without any aspersion against his character or integrity, or whether the order amounts to, a reduction in rank by way of punishment.
