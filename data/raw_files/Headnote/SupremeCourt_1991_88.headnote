 The appellant, a Government company, entered into a Technical collaboration agreement with the respondent, a foreign corporation, under which the respondent was to provide technical know-how to the appellant, and the appellant was to pay the respondent fee in foreign currency in three installments. The appellant was required to apply for registration and/or Governmental approval and furnish satisfactory evidence of receipt of such approval. The effective date of the agreement was the date on which the notification was received by the respondent that all governmental approvals in that regard had been secured. The agreement was entered into with the approval of the Secretariat for Industrial Approvals. The agreement as well as the supplementary agreement, incorporating certain changes suggested by the Government, were filed with the Government, which took the same on record, by its letter of approval, A copy of the letter of approval and also the 68 collaboration agreement was sent to the RBI.
 After obtaining the necessary order under Section 195(2) of the Income Tax Act from the Income Tax Officer and the permit from the RBI, the appellant remitted the first installment of fee to the respondent. Thereafter, the respondent, alleging non-payment of subsequent installments, and consequent breach of terms of contract, sought to invoke clause 8.2 of the agreement for terminating the agreement.
 The appellant questioned respondent's right to invoke clause 8.2. Thereafter the respondent invoked the arbitration clause, clause 12.1 of the agreement, for referring disputes and difference to the arbitration of International Chamber of Commerce and claimed certain amount for the services actually rendered and also informed the ICC accordingly.
 The appellant challenged the legality and validity of the agreement as void ab initio, and also clause 12.1 as non-est and legally unforceable, and filed an application under Section 33 of the Arbitration Act, contending that the agreement being a contingent one, commencing from the effective date, and necessary approval having not been secured, the agreement had not commenced and, consequently the arbitration clause, being part of the very same agreement, the respondent was not entitled to invoke the said clause, and that in the absence of a valid permission from the RBI under Section 28(1) (b) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973, the agreement was clearly void by the thrust of Section 28(2) of the Act.
 The respondent contended that the necessary Government approvals were obtained and hence the `effective date' was reached and that under the Exchange Control Manual only the Indian Company could apply to SIA for approval and once such approval was accorded, the foreign collaborator to the contract was not expected to secure the RBI permission under Section 28(1) (b), since under the manual, SIA approval was to be deemed to be RBI's permission also; and therefore, the agreement was legal and valid and the respondent was entitled to seek its enforcement.
 The High Court held that on a true interpretation of the contract, it must be held to be voidable at the discretion of either party, that even if the contract was terminated or rendered void, the arbitration clause therein did not perish ipso facto, that the application to the Income Tax Officer for making payment of first installment could not have been made unless the necessary approvals were obtained, that the RBI had granted permission to remit the installment money (fee), after the Income Tax Officer had made the order under Section 195(2) of the 69 Income Tax Act, and it was only on account of this payment, that the respondent furnished the technology and provided technical services, and that, on account of appellant's failure to pay subsequent installments, a dispute had clearly arisen which had to be resolved through arbitration.
 In the appeal before this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant company that paragraph 25A.2 of the Exchange Control Manual, 1978, provided that applications for permission under Section 28(1)(b) should be made in FNC5 and since no such application in FNC5 was made, a clear inference could be raised that the RBI had not granted permission under Section 28(1), and accordingly the agreement and the arbitration clause forming part of it were void ab initio by the thrust of Section 28(2), and that the prescribed form for SIA approval under paragraph 24A.11 was not the same as FNC5 prescribed under paragraph 25A.2 and administrative direction in paragraph 24A.11 that no separate permission under Section 28(1) was necessary could not override the statutory requirement of the Section.
 It was contended on behalf of the respondent that requirements of Section 28(1) were fully complied with and the RBI's sanction, being essentially administrative, it was enough to show that the RBI had granted permission, no matter whether it had followed the procedure of paragraph 24A.11(i) or 25A.2 of the Exchange Control Manual.
 Dismissing the appeal, this Court, 
 HELD: 1.1 Section 28(1) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 places restrictions on appointment of certain individuals and companies as technical or management advisers in India unless the RBI approves the same by a general or special permission. The section is silent on the mode and manner of securing such permission. However, sub- section (4) of Section 73 provides that where any provision of the Act requires the RBI's permission for doing anything under such provision, the RBI may specify the form in which an application for such permission shall be made. On a plain reading of paragraph 24A.11 Exchange Control Manual, 1978., it becomes clear that the intention is to introduce the single counter or window procedure to avoid duplication and hardship to the foreign collaborators, and once the collaboration is approved by SIA, and the agreement is `taken on record' there is no need to obtain a separate permission from the RBI. Paragraph 9 of the Guidelines for Industries stipulates that after the agreement is taken on record, a copy thereof has to be sent to the RBI to enable it to 70 authorise remittances to the foreign collaborator.
 [82E,84C,85A] 
 1.2 In the instant case, the appellant had sought the SIA approval, which was granted subject to the terms and conditions set out in the letter of approval. It was only thereafter that the agreement was executed. The appellant then sent a copy of the agreement to the Government of India which was duly examined in the light of the terms and conditions on which the approval was granted by the SIA and certain discrepancies were communicated to the appellant which necessitated the execution of supplementary agreement.
 It was only thereafter that the appellant was informed that the collaboration agreement and the supplementary agreement `have been taken on record. This was then forwarded to the RBI. The matter was processed by the RBI and the remittance of the first instalment of the fees took place after the income-tax was duly recovered at source. [85A-D] 
 1.3 The affidavits filed on behalf of the RBI leave no doubt that the remittance was permitted only after the RBI was satisfied that all the terms and conditions were duly satisfied, though the RBI's approval `remained to be communicated' to the appellant company. Failure to discharge the ministerial duty cannot obliterate the conscious decision taken by the RBI after application of mind. [85E,G] 
 1.4 The RBI had applied its mind to the question of grant of permission and had only thereafter permitted remittance of the first instalment of the fees payable to the foreign collaborator. Merely because application for such permission was not made in FNC5 form cannot cloud the fact that the decision to grant the permission was actually taken, but the ministerial function of communicating the same remained to be done by oversight. This lapse cannot erase the decision already taken. [86H,87A] 
 2.1 The prescription of the form is merely to aid the RBI to process the application for permission. Emphasis must be laid on substance and not on mere form. If there has been substantial compliance mere lapse on the part of the RBI in failing to communicate its decision should make no difference. Paragraph 25A.2 is not in derogation of paragraph 24.A.11(i) nor does it dilute the requirement of Section 28(1). Factum of permission, and not the procedure followed, is relevant. [86G] 
 2.2 The RBI had granted the permission contemplated by Section 28(1) and hence the agreement cannot be voided by virtue of Section 28(2) of FERA. Once the decision to grant the permission is taken, 71 whether through the course charted by paragraph 24A.11(i) or 25A.2, that decision stands unless rescinded and the authorities are bound to act in aid thereof.[87B-C] 
 3. In the circumstances it is unnecessary to examine the question whether clause 12.1 of the agreement would stand or perish if the agreement is rendered void under Section 28(2) for failure to secure permission under Section 28(1).[87D] M/s.
