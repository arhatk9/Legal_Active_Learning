 Respondent no. 1, a member of the Assam Judicial Service, was confirmed fly the High Court of Assam and Nagaland in Judicial Service (Junior) Grade I against the post of sub- Judge. The Accountant General., of Nagaland took objection to this order of confirmation on the ground that under r.
 5(iv) of the Assam Judicial Service (Junior) Rules, 1954 the confirmation could only be made by the Governor and not by the High Court. Rule 5 (iv) inter alia, provides that "when a person is appointed to a permanent post, he will be confirmed after the period of probations in the case of Deputy Registrar and Assistant Registrar-by the High Court and in other cases, it will be made by the Governor in consultation with the High Court".

The High Court allowed the petition.
