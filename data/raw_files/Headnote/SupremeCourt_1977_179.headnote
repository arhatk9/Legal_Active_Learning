 The assessee borrowed a large sum of money from a bank and purchased shares from it; but did not take delivery of the transfer forms and share certificates by making payment of the purchase price. Clause (3) of the agreement, however, stipulated that if the shares were not taken delivery of by a certain date, dividends, rights, bonuses etc. which might be declared after that date would be held by the bank for the benefit of the assessee; and that the assessee would be liable to pay interest on the purchase price. Clause (4) provided that if the assessee did not take delivery of the shares by a certain date, the bank would be at liberty to sell the undelivered shares and to hold the assessee liable for the difference in the. price fetched by the shares.
 The assessee paid to the bank over two lacs of rupees by way of interest and more than a lac of rupees by way of damages for failure to take delivery of the shares. A sum of Rs.
 95,000 odd was earned as dividend by the assessee on the shares.
 The Income Tax Officer disallowed the claim of the assessee for deduction Linder s. 12(2) of the Indian Income Tax Act 1922 of the interest on the loan and damages paid by him to the bank but included the dividend earned on the shares in his total income. On appeal the Appellate Assistant Commissioner affirmed the view of the Income Tax Officer.
 The Tribunal, on the other hand, held that since there was no transfer of equitable title in the shares to the assesee he was not entitled to any deduction of interest; disallowed the deduction of damages paid by the assessee but excluded the dividend from his total income on the ground that it was not dividend earned by him. On reference, the High Court affirmed the findings of the Tribunal.
 Allowing the appeal in part, 
HELD : (1) The High Court and the Tribunal were wrong in taking the view that the Income Tax Officer rightly disallowed the interest claimed by the assessee. This amount was a permissible deduction under s.12(2) of the Act and should have been allowed. There is a direct nexus between the amount paid by the assessee as interest and the earning of the dividend income. [546 A-B] (2) In the Bank of India v. J. A. H. Chinoy A.I.R. 1950 P.C. 90 at 97, the Privy Council held that even though a transaction may not amount to an acquisition of equitable interest, yet as between the vendor and the purchaser a term regarding payment of the declared dividend would be fully effective because once the dividends are declared, they will be deemed to have accrued to the purchaser even though there may not have been any transfer of equitable title to the purchaser. Clause (3) of the agreement read in the light of this decision shows that even if there was no transfer of equitable title to the assessee, since the dividend declared would be an additional source of income to him, the assessee would be entitled to deduct the interest paid on the loan for acquiring the shares. [541 E & H] 538 (3) An analysis of s.12(2) of the Indian Income Tax Act 1922 shows that before this provision could apply, the following conditions must be fulfilled; (i) the expenditure must have been incurred solely and exclusively for the pur- pose of earning income or making profit; (ii) the expenditure should not be is the nature of a capital expenditure; (iii) the amount in question should not be in the nature of personal expenses of the assessee; (iv) the expenditure should be incurred in the accounting year; and (v there must be a clear nexus between the expenditure incurred and the income sought to be earned. [542 E-G] In the instant case (i) a genuine and bona fide contract had been entered into between the assessee and the bank for transfer of a large number of shares to the assessee; (ii) the assessee, in pursuance of this agreement raised the loan from the bank and paid interest for this purpose; and (iii) under cl.(3) of the agreement the dividends, rights and bonuses etc., were held by the bank for the benefit of the assessee after they were declared.

 (4) Since the assessee's main business was not dealing in shares, damages were paid by him due to his own default.
 The damages paid would, therefore, be capital expenditure.
 [546 C] (5) The dividend earned by the assessee should be included in his total income. [546 F]
