 The appellants, workmen of the respondent company, filed an application under section 33C(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, in the Labour Court asking it to compute their wages due from the respondent on the basis of certain settlements said to have been arrived at between them and the management. Holding that each of the workman in the Assam Sector was also entitled to take advantage of the settlement between the company and its employees in West Bengal, the Labour Court allowed their application in part rejecting only that portion of the claim of the workmen for Rs.13/- p.m. from Feb. 1971 to Mar., 1972. The Gauhati High Court allowed the writ application filed by the management and quashed the order of the Labour Court.
 Allowing the appeal by special leave, the Court, 
HELD : (1) The High Court Committed an error in narrowly interpreting section 33C(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. There are two parts of the 'sub-section (2) of section 33C of the Act. The first part is concerned with the money claim simpliciter and the second part speaks about computation in terms of money of any benefit to which the workman is entitled. Where any workman is entitled to receive from employer any money and if any question arises as to the amount of money due, then the question may be decided by the Labour Court. The expression "if any question arises as to the amount of money due" embraces within its ambit any' one or more of four kinds of disputes, namely : (1) Whether there is any settlement or award as, alleged?, (2) Whether any workman is entitled to receive from the employer money at all under any settlement or an award etc. ? (3) If so, what be the rate or quantum of such amount ? and, (4) Whether the amount claimed is due or not? A dispute as to all such questions or any of them would attract the provisions of section 33C (2) of the Act and make the remedy available to the workman concerned. If the right to get the money on the basis of the settlement or the award is not established, no amount of money will be due.
 If it is established, then it has to be found out, albeit, it may be by mere calculation, as to what is the amount due.
 For finding it out, it is not necessary that there should be a dispute as to the amount of money due also. The fourth kind of dispute will be covered by phrase "amount of money due".

 (2)Satisfaction of the appropriate Government which is spoken of in sub-section (1) of section 33C of the Act in their prima facie satisfaction when a claim is made by any workman before the Government for issuance of a certificate by the Collector for realisation of the amount due. If the appropriate Government finds that the amount claimed by the workman is due- and there is no such dispute which needs any adjudication by the Labour Court in accordance with sub- section (2) or the dispute raised is not bona fide, then 206 the Government shall issue a certificate for the amount due to the Collector who shall proceed to recover the same in the manner as an arrears of land revenue.
