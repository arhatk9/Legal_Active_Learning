 The appellant was convicted by the Panchayati Adalat for theft and sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 75/- in 1950. The conviction and sentence was confirmed in 1953 by the High Court in revision.
 In 1958 proceedings were taken to recover the fine. The appellant contended that the recovery was barred by s. 70 The Indian Penal Code. The respondent contended that s. 70 was not applicable to convictions by Panchayati Adalats and that the limitation started from the date of the order of the High Court.
 651 ^ Held, that s. 70 Indian Penal Code was applicable to convictions by the Panchayati Adalats and that the recovery of the fine after the expiry of six years from the date of conviction was barred. There was no provision in the U. P. Panchayat Raj Act prescribing any period of limitation or providing for the non- applicability of s. 70 of the Code to sentences of fine imposed by the Panchayati Adalats. The limitation started from the date of the "passing of the sentence" and the filing of appeal or revision did not, unless specifically ordered, arrest the operation of the order imposing the sentence.
