 In order to raise the presumption under s.4(1) of the prevention of Corruption Act what the prosecution has to prove is that the accused person has received 'gratification other than legal remuneration' and when it is shown that he has received a certain sum of money which was not a legal remuneration, then, the condition prescribed by the section is satisfied and the presumption thereunder must be raised.
 To raise the presumption it is not necessary to show that the receipt of the gratification was accepted as bribe. In other words, the factum of receipt of money with a conscious mind or guilty conscience is not necessary in order to bring the case within the Purview of section 4. The word 'gratification' in section 4(1) has to be given its literal dictionary meaning of satisfaction of apetite or desire; it could not be construed to mean money paid by way of a bribe.
 The words 'unless the contrary is proved' mean that the presumption raised by section 4 has to be rebutted by proof and not by explanation which may be merely plausible. The required proof need not be such as is expected for sustaining a criminal conviction; it need only establish a high degree of probability. [252G-253C] State of Madras v.
