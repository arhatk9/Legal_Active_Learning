 By agreement dated March 21, 1949, the plaintiff contracted to sell leasehold rights in a piece of land and in the building constructed thereon to the defendant. The plaintiff received Rs. 25,000/- under the agreement and delivered possession of the building and the land in his occupation to the defendant, but the sale was not completed before the expiry of the period stipulated in the agreement, and for this default each party blamed the other. The plaintiff instituted a suit in the court of the Subordinate judge claiming to forfeit the amount of Rs. 25,000/- received by him, and praying for a decree for possession of the land and building and for compensation for use and occupation of the building from the date of delivery of possession to the defendant of the property. The defendant contended that the plaintiff having broken the contract could not forfeit the amount of Rs. 25,000/- received by him nor claim any compensation. The trial judge held that the plaintiff had failed to put the defendant in possession and could not therefore retain Rs. 25,000/- and accordingly directed that on the plaintiff depositing Rs. 25,000/- less Rs. 1,400/- the defendant do put the plaintiff in possession and awarded to the plaintiff future mesne profits at the rate of Rs. 140/- permitters from the date of the suit until delivery of possession. On appeal the High Court modified the decree of the trial court and declared ,that the plaintiff was entitled to retain out of Rs. 25,000/- paid by the defendant under the sale agreement, a sum of Rs.
 11,250/- and directed that the plaintiff do get from the defendant compensation for use at the rate of Rs. 265/- per mensem.
 Held, that the High Court was right in holding that the defendant had committed breach of the contract;
 516 Held, further that the expression "the contract contains any other stipulation by way of penalty" comprehensively applies to every covenant involving a penalty-whether it is for payment on breach of contract of money, or delivery of property in future, or for forfeiture of right to money or other property already delivered. Duty not to enforce the penalty clause but only to award reasonable compensation is statutorily imposed upon courts by s. 74 of the Indian Contract Act. In all cases, therefore, where there is a stipulation in the nature of penalty for forfeiture of an amount deposited pursuant to' the terms of a contract which expressly provides for forfeiture, the court has jurisdiction to award such sum only as it considers reasonable, but not exceeding the amount specified in the contract as liable to forfeiture.
 In the present case in the absence of any proof of damage arising from the breach of contract, the amount of Rs.
 1,000/which had been forfeited and liability to forfeiture whereof was not challenged and the advantage that the plaintiff derived by retaining the sum of Rs. 24,000/- was sufficient compensation to the plaintiff For loss suffered by him. In the absence of evidence to show that the value of the property had depreciated, since the dateof the contract, the decree passed by the High Court awarding10% of the contract price to the plaintiff as compensation could not be sustained.
