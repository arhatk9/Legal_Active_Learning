 The appellant company carried on the business of manufacturing barrels and for that purpose required steel sheets. By 'reason of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 the Iron & Steel (Conirol) Order, 1956 and diverse orders passed by the Iron and Steel Controller the appellant company could get supply of steel sheets only by obtaining release orders from the Controller on stockists and importers. The Controller would direct under such a release order an importer or a stockist to supply steel sheets to the appellant company at rates and on terms and conditions specified by him therein. By three such release orders of October 28 and 29, 1960 the Controller directed the 6th respondent to supply to the appellant a certain quantity of steel sheets at a specified rate. There was dispute between the appellant and the 6th respondent as to the quantity to be supplied and the rate of supply. The appellant claimed that it had already -paid an excess. sum of Rs. 7 lacs and odd to the 6th respondent in respect of earlier release orders. On the dispute being referred to the Controller he ordered the 6th respondent to supply steel sheets to the appellant at the specified rate after making allowance for the excess of Rs. 7 lacs and odd already paid. He also ordered that if the appellant did not pay the price and the transaction was not completed Within a certain time owing to the fault of the appellant be would allot the steel sheets to some other party. Owing to the persistence of differences with the 6th respondent the appellant could not carry out the transaction but instead filed a suit in the High Court. The Controller then cancelled the allotment in favour of the appellant. Against this order of cancellation the appellant filed a writ petition in the High Court. The High Court passed a consent order asking the Controller to 'hear' the parties and decide whether the appellant was at fault in not lifting the goods. At the bearing the appellant wanted to examine a witness but the request was refused by the Controller. The Controller decided against the- appellant. The appellant filed another writ petition in the High Court. The writ petition and the subsequent letters patent appeal filed by the appellant were both dismissed. The appellants came to Court and contended :
 (1) The Controller by refusing to examine the appellants witness violated natural justice.
 (2) On the question of the refund of the excess charges the Controller's order suffered from an error apparent on the face of the record; and (3) The finding of the Controller that the appellant wanted to pick and choose the goods was without evidence.
 
HELD : (i) While considering the question of breach of the principles of natural justice the court should not proceed as if there are any 740 inflexible rules of natural justice of universal application. The Court has to consider in each case whether in the light of the facts and circumstances of that case, the nature of the issues involved in the inquiry,, the nature of the order passed and the interest affected thereby, a fair and reasonable opportunity of being heard was furnished by the person affected. A refusal to record oral evidence does not necessarily mean contravention of the rules of natural justice. [746 D; 747 G-H] Local Government Board v.

 The Controller had heard the case of the parties through their counsel. The witness was a director of the appellant company. Being present at the hearing,he could have instructed counsel to state all that he wanted to depose.
 That not having been done the company could have no grievance of nothaving been heard. The witness produced by the appellant was not of a material character.
