 The Thiyyas of the former Calicut, Taluk are governed by the customary law known as Makkathayam and as per the Makkathayam rule of inheritance an undivided brother of a deceased person succeeds to the self-acquired property of the deceased in preference to the wife and daughter of the deceased. Therefore, the daughter's son who comes after them under the general Hindu Law cannot have a superior claim unless a custom to that effect is pleaded and proved.
