 In execution of a money decree, a court-sale took place. Three pieces of agricultural land of the judgment- debtor-respondent were put to auction. The decree-holder- appellant purchased the same.
 Item Nos.1 and 2 of the auctioned property remained in possession of the respondent, but item no. 3 went into the possession of the appellant.
 The respondent approached the executing court filing a petition u/s. 20 of the Kerala Agriculturists Act, 1970, for retrieval of the entire property on the basis that he had continued to be in possession of a part of it.
 The appellant contested the Debt Relief Petition contending that as the respondent was not in possession of the entire property, Section 20 of the Act was inapplicable and that in case it was then before possession of property, item no. 3 could be asked to be given, cost of improvements had to be paid under sub-section (5) of Section 20.
 All the courts below decided against the appellant.
 This appeal by special leave was confined to a claim to property Item No. 3 of the Debt Relief Petition.
 Dismissing the appeal of the decree-holder, this Court, 
 HELD : 1.01. The Kerala Agriculturists Debt Relief Act is a local legislation and had come to give some succour to the indebted agriculturists. The conditions which led to the passing of such legislation 308 presumably were well known to the Kerala State Legislature and the pulse of it was felt by the High Court Kerala in its Interpretive role. [309D] 1.02. The sale conceived of under Section 20 is one and indivisible and when it is required to be set aside only a portion of the property sold need be in possession of the judgment-debtor to make him eligible to maintain the Debt Relief Petition. [309E] 1.03. An interpretation, beneficial as it is to the indebted peasantry is approved. The courts below as well as the High Court let the respondent maintain his Debt Relief Petition. Such a course is concurred with. Sequally property item no. 3 has also to be retrieved from the hands of the appellant. [309F] 1.04. In the interests of justice, neither is the appellant held entitled to any cost of improvements nor would he be liable for payment of any mesne profits for the preceding three years. [310A-B] Syed Mohammed Beevi Amma v. Mathai Devasia, 1960 KLT 163; Ramasuppa Iyer v. Daveed Christudas, 1963 KLT 886, approved.
