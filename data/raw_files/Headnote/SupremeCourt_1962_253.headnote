 S who was the owner of the raiyati interest in the lands in question acquired the entire interest of the Lakhirajdar under whom he was the raiyat. These lands were purchased by the appellants under a deed dated May 15, 1935, from the successors in interest of S. The plaintiffs' case was that no interest passed to the vendees by the sale deed because the raiyati character of the land was existing on the date of transfer and this was inalienable under the provisions of s. 27 of Regulation III of 1872. The trial court took the view that the land did not retain its raiyati character after S acquired the landlord's interest and so s. 27 of Regulation III was not applicable. The High Court was of the opinion that the raiyati interest recorded in the earlier settlement continued in spite of the entry "Bakasht Malik" in the subsequent settlement and that the raiyati interest could not be alienated by the sale deed dated May 15,1935.
 Held, that S's raiyati interest was not merged in his pro- prietary interest but continued side by side, and that his successors in interest did not in law transfer the raiyati interest in the land to the vendees in 1935.
 The legal position as regards merger, apart from statutory provisions, is that while the union of the superior and subordinate interests will not automatically cause a merger, merger will be held to have taken place if the intention to merge is clear and not otherwise. In the absence of any express indication of intention, the courts will proceed on the basis that the party had no intention to merge it if it is to his interest not to merge and also if a duty lay on him to keep the interests separate. In deciding the intention of the party the court will have regard also to his conduct; there was, in the present case, no evidence of intention to merge and S must be held to have intended to keep the two interests distinct and separate.
 14 The entry in the record of "Bakasht Malik" against the land meant that the land which was formerly recorded as in the cultivating possession of a raiyat under a landlord was in the cultivating possession of the landlord himself.
 Held, further, that s. 27 (3) of Regulation III did not stand in the way of the plaintiffs getting relief in the civil court.
 Semble, in the community village areas of the Santhal Parganas which covered the greater part of the district, a raiyat has not got the right to put an end to his raiyati interest even where he acquires the superior interest. The doctrine of merger does not apply to the case of raiyati holders in the Santhal Parganas.
