 Section 2 (f) of the University Commission Act, 1956 defines "a University" to mean: "a University established or incorporated by or under a Central Act, a Provincial Act, or a State Act, and includes any such institution, as may in consultation with the University concerned, be recognised by the Commission in accordance with the regulations made in this behalf under this Act". Section 22 which empower the right to confer degrees and Section 23 which imposes the prohibition for use of the word "University" also provides that way. Penalties for contravening the provisions of sections 22 and 23 are provided under section 24 of the Act but the proviso to section 23 exempts any institution having a suffix "University" before the commencement of the University Grants Commission Act, for a period of two years only to enable it to take appropriate steps under the University Grants Commission Act.
 Commercial University which was registered under the companies Act of 1913 and before the coming into force of the University Commission Grants Act, 1956 and was doing useful service to the students community did not take any steps as required under the new Act even after the lapse of the two years, and therefore, the appellant came to be prosecuted for the offences under sections 22 and 23. The appellants having lost their case including in the High Court have come up in appeal by way of special leave.
 Allowing the appeal in part and setting aside the convictions and sentence of fine, the Court 884 ^ 
 HELD 1: 1 The University Grants Commission Act, 1956 did not intend to admit a company incorporated under the Companies Act into the definition of a "University" under section 2 (f) or for the purposes of Section 23. Several institutions staying themselves as `universities' had started awarding degrees and diplomas which had no basis and could not be accepted. Keeping in view the mischief which was sought to be eradicated and the consideration which weighed with Parliament to introduce the prohibition in the Act, the Act recognises only those institutions established or incorporated under special statutes of sovereign legislatures. [890D-E] 1:2 The definition of university and the provisions in S.23 of the Act refer to Acts of the Central, Provincial or the State legislatures by which one or more universities are established or incorporated and not to institutions incorporated under a general statute providing for incorporation. The words "established" or "incorporated" referred to Act under which universities are established or incorporated. Several universities in this country have been either established or incorporated under special statutes, such as the Delhi University Act, the Banaras Hindu University Act, the Allahabad University Act etc. In these cases, there is a special Act either of the Central or the Provincial or the State legislatures establishing and incorporating the particular universities. There is also another pattern-where under one compoundious Act several universities ere either established or incorporated-for instance, the Madhya Pradesh Universities Act 1973. [889G-E;
 F] 1:3 Commercial University Ltd. when incorporated under the Companies Act, therefore, did not satisfy the definition as also the provisions of section 23 of Act consequently the prosecution under section 23 was valid. [889H] Attorney General v. H.R.H. Augushtis [1957] 1 All E.R.

 2:1 The definition of University given in section 2 (f) or the prohibition in section 23 of the Act are not ultra vires the Parliament on the ground that such provisions are beyond its legislative competence. [891F] 2:2 `Education including universities' was a State subject until by the 42nd Amendment of the Constitution in 1976, that entry was omitted from the State list and, was taken into entry 25 of the Concurrent list. The University Grants Commissions Act essentially intended to make provisions for the coordination and determination of standards in universities and that, is squarely covered under entry 66 of list I. While legislating for a purpose germane to the subject covered by that entry and establishing a University Grants Commission, Parliament considered it necessary, as a regulatory measure, to prohibit unauthorised conferment of degrees and diplomas as also use of the word `university' by institution which had not been either established or incorporated by special legisla- 885 ation. In doing so the Parliament did not entrench upon legislative power reserved for the State legislature. [890E- G] 2:3. The legal position is well-settled that the entries incorporated in the lists covered by Schedule VII are not powers of legislation but `fields' of legislation.
 Such entries are mere legislative heads and are of an enabling character. The language of the entries should be given the widest scope or amplitude. Each general word has been asked to be extended to all ancillary or subsidiary matters which can fairly and reasonably be comprehended. An entry confers powers upon the legislature to legislate for matters ancillary or incidental, including provision for avoiding the law. As long as the legislation is within the permissible field in pith and substance, objection would not be entertained merely on the ground that while enacting legislation, provision has been made for a matter which though germane for the purpose for which competent legislation is made it covers an aspect beyond it. If an enactment substantially falls within the powers expressly conferred by the Constitution upon the legislature enacting it, it cannot be held to be invalid merely because it incidentally encroaches on matters assigned to another legislature.

 3. The observations in Azeez Pasha & Anr v. Union of India [1968] I.S.C.R. 833 were with reference to the rights of the minority community to establish a university in exercise of its right guaranteed under Art. 30 of the Constitution. Admittedly. CUL is not an institution belonging to any minority community. It will not be appropriate either to allow arguments based on what has been observed with reference to an institution belonging to the minority community or to examine the vires of the Act with reference to what does not arise for consideration in the appeals. [892A-B] 
 4. Though the proviso to s. 23 had specified a period of two years within which the word `university' had to be omitted by the institution not entitled to its use yet there is scope for the submission that being incorporated under a Central Act, the people connected with CUL worked under the bona fide impression that such incorporation satisfied the requirements of the Act. In such circumstances, the conviction of the appellant must be set aside. [892D-E]
