 The question for decision was whether a criminal appellate court could order the re- hearing of an appeal which it had earlier dismissed, when neither the appellants nor their counsel appeared, holding that it had perused the record of the case and saw no reason for interference with the trial court's order.
 ^ Held, that the appellate court's omission to write a detailed judgment in a criminal appeal in which neither the appellant nor his counsel appeared might not be in compliance with the provisions of s.367 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and might be liable to be set aside by a superior court, but will not give that court itself power to set it aside and re-hear the appeal.
 At the re-hearing of the appeal the successor of the appellate court was competent to consider, on an objection being raised by the other party, whether the appeal was validly up for hearing before him.
 Section 369 read with s. 424 of the Code of Criminal Procedure specifically prohibits the altering or reviewing of its order by a court.
 Inherent powers of the court cannot be exercised to do what the Code specifically prohibits the court from doing.
