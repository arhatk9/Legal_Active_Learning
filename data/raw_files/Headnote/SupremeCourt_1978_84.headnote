 Maharaj Shri Amarsinhji Himatsinhji was granted certain jagirs. According to the respondent by several grants he was given full proprietary rights in the soil of the villages mentioned in the grant, i.e. it was a proprietary jagir. On the coming into force of the Bombay Merged Territories and Areas (Jagirs Abolition) Act 1953 with effect from 1st August, 1954 Daljitgarh jagir stood abolished and all his rights in the jagir villages save as expressly provided by or under the Act were extinguished and the respondent became entitled to compensation under section 11 of the Act. For the purpose of. implementing the provisions of that Act the competent authority (Collector of District Sabarntha) held an enquiry into the question whether the respondent's jagir was proprietary (involving any right or interest in the soil) or non-proprietary (involving mere assignment of land revenue or rent due to Government) under Section 2(4)(i) of the Act and having regard to the documentary and other evidence laid before it, the competent authority held that the Daljitgarh jagir of the respondent was a proprietary jagir. The necessary entry was made in the revenue record to the effect that the respondent's right to take out gravel and stones was recognized but the right relating to excavation of mica had been reserved and retained by the Government.
 The respondent made an application and requested the Collector to issue necessary orders to the Mamlatdar to make appropriate entries regarding his rights in the minerals in respect of certain villages. Thereupon a notice under Sec.
 37(2) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code for the purpose of holding an enquiry into the rights of the respondent to mines and mineral products of the said villages claimed by the respondent was served upon him. The respondent raised a preliminary objection that such enquiry was misconceived and incompetent in view of the determination made under Sec.
 2(4)(i) of the Act and having regard to the provision of Section 10 of the Act his rights to mines and mineral products were expressly saved. The Collector of Sabarkantha over-ruled the preliminary objection and directed that the enquiry should proceed. The respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court. The High Court by a writ of certiorari quashed the order of the Collector and issued a direction to the Collector restraining him from further proceeding with the enquiry under Sec. 37(2) of the Land Revenue Code. The High Court took the view that in determination by the competent authority under Sec. 2(4)(i) of the Act that respondent's jagir was a proprietary one there was an implicit decision that the respondent was a grantee of the soil which included sub-soil entitling him to mines and mineral products and as such further enquiry by the Collector under Sec. 37(2) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code was incompetent and without jurisdiction. The State of Gujarat in an appeal by Special Leave contended (i) The High Court adopted an erroneous view of the scope and ambit of the enquiry contemplated under sec. 2(4)(i) of the Act by the competent authority inasmuch as under the said Act the competent authority had power merely to decide the question whether the respondent's jagir was a 'proprietary or a non- proprietary jagir and had no power or jurisdiction to determine whether on the appointed date i.e. on 1st August, 1954 when the Act came into force the respondent had subsisting rights to mines and mineral products in the jagir villages so as to be saved under sec. 10 (ii) it was for the Collector to hold an inquiry 676 under Sec. 37(2) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code and to recognise the right of the respondent. On the other hand the counsel for the respondent contended that a determination under s. 2(4)(i) of the Act that a particular jagir was a proprietary one necessarily implied that the grant was of soil and the grantee was entitled to mines and mineral products. It was also contended that unless a claim to property or rights over property was made by the State against any person or by any person against the State, there could be no occasion for the Collector to hold an enquiry contemplated by s. 37(2) of the Act.
 
HELD : (1) Having regard to the, object and scheme of the Act as disclosed by the Preamble and material provisions and the definition of 'Proprietary Jagir' in s. 2(xviii) it is clear that an enquiry into the nature of the jagir under s. 2(4)(i) is for the purpose of determining the quantum of compensation payable to a jagirdar and the determination of the question whether a jagir is proprietary or non- proprietary, does not necessarily involve the determination of question whether the jagirdar had any rights to mines and mineral products on the appointed date. Even if the competent authority has declared a particular jagir to be a proprietary one under s. 2(4)(i) of the Act, a further enquiry under s. 37(2) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code into the question whether a jagirdar had any subsisting rights to mines and mineral products in the jagir villages on the appointed date would be competent unless the grant of a right to mines and minerals products or the actual enjoyment thereof in keeping with the grant happens to be the basis of the determination under s. 2(4) (i) of the Act.
 [682 C, F. G, 683 B-D] (2)However, the enquiry initiated by the Collector under s. 37(2) of the BombayLand Revenue Code in this case will have to be regarded as incompetent,misconceived and uncalled for because the condition precedent which can lead to the initiation of such enquiry is absent. It is clear from a reading of s. 37(2) that laying a claim to a property or any right over the property either by the State against an individual or by the individual against the State is a condition precedent to the Collector's power to hold an enquiry contemplated by that provision. The respondent by making the applications to the Mamlatdar, in the present case, could not be said to have put forward or laid a claim so as to afford an occasion for the Collector to initiate the inquiry.
