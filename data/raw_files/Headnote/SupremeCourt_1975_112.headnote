 The Government set up Town Planning Organisation in 1955 which prepared an interim general Plan for Delhi in 1956.
 The influx of displaced persons after partition of the country, the growth of slum, the problems of overcrowding, insanitation, traffic hazards, sub-standard construction and lack of proper civic amenities led the Government to take effective measures to ensure orderly and planned development of the city. The Planning is to provide for different classes of people who have to live and work in the city of Delhi. The plan has to provide for bona fide requirements of the public for residential, industrial and commercial purposes and to ensure healthy and properly planned development of Delhi. The Government decided to acquire 34070 acres of land in and around the city. The land was acquired after issuing notification under section 4 and section 6.
 The petitioners in the present petition contended, (1) Compensation which is related to date of notification under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act is bad.
 (2) The planned development of Delhi is vague and, therefore, the acquisition is bad.
 Dismissing the petition, 
HELD : (i) The question about the payment of the compensation as on the date of the section 4 notification has been held to be valid by this Court in the case of Aflatoon. Them is a provision for payment of interest at the rate of 6 per cent of the market value after the expiry of 3 years from the date of notification under s. 4 to the date of payment of compensation. Again, any outlay or improvement made after the date of & 4 notification with the sanction of the Collector has to be taken into consideration in awarding compensation. 1363 C-E] (ii) This Court has also held that the planned development of Delhi is a public purpose in Aflatoon's case. It was held in that case that in the case of an acquisition of a large area of land comprising several plots belonging to different persons the specification of the purpose can only be with reference to acquisition of the whole area. The notification which was for the acquisition of over 30,000 acres of land in the very nature of things could not specify each particular purpose and, therefore, the planned development of Delhi was of sufficient particularly.
