 Appellant, a motor driver in the Milk Scheme at Nagpur, was dismissed from service by the order of Dairy Development Commissioner, Bombay. The appellant was on probation for 6 months after his appointment and he continued in service more than 2 years when his services were terminated. The appellant filed an application, under s. 16 of the C.P. and Berar Industrial Disputes Settlement Act, 1947, before the Asstt. Labour Commissioner, praying for reinstatement with back wages and continuity of employment, The Asstt. Labour Commissioner set aside the order of termination and directed respondents 3 to 5 to reinstate the appellant with back wages.
 Respondents 3. to 5 filed a revision before the State Industrial Court u/s. 16(5) of the Berar Act. That Court set aside the order and remanded the case for a fresh decision as to whether the appellant was a permit agent employee and whether he was illegally retrenched. After remand the Deputy Commissioner of Labour concluded that the appellant was not a permanent employee under the provisions of the Standing Orders. He, however held that as the employee was in continuous service, he bad been retrenched illegally and in violation of s. 25F ,of the Industrial Disputes Act, the Central Act.
 Against this order, respondents 3 to 5 filed a revision application u/s. 16(5) of the State Act before the State Industrial Court. This Court set aside the retrenchment order and held that the appellant was entitled to retrenchment compensation and so remained the case for determination of what that compensation should be. Against this order respondents 3 to 5 filed a petition before the High Court. The appellant also filed a petition under Art.
 226 of the Constitution for modification of the order of the State Industrial Court and for reinstatement with back wages etc. Both the repetitions were beard together and by a common judgment, allowed the application of Respondents 3 to 5 holding that the appellant was not an "employee within the meaning of S. 2(10) of the State Act as his dismissal, discharge or removal was not on account of an Industrial dispute and accordingly, the appellant's petition was dismissed.
 The question which fell for consideration was whether under the State Act a dismissed, discharged or retrenched employee was an "employee" within the meaning of s.2(10) of the Act and could invoke the jurisdiction of the authority under the State Act for obtaining redress.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) A combined reading of the definition of an "employee" in s. 2(10) with s.2 (12) & (13) would show that those who had ceased to be in service were also included within the definition of an "employee". [546A-B] (ii)Under s. 16(2), an employee working in an industry to which a notification under Sub-s. (1) is applied can within 6 months of his dismissal, discharge, removal or suspension apply to the labour commissioner for reinstatement and payment of compensation for loss of wages. An employee dismissed, discharged or removed on account of any industrial dispute is certainly an employee under s.2(10), and what is meant by an "industrial dispute" can be ascertained by reference to s.2(12), under which any dispute or difference connected with an industrial matter arising between employer and employee or between employers or employees is an industrial dispute. [546C-E] 542 Since the question of reinstatement is an industrial dispute, in the present case, the appellant would be an employee within the meaning of s.2 (10) of the Act for the purposes of availing himself of the right under sub-s.(2) of sec. 16 of the Act.[546-F] Central Provinces Transport Services Ltd., Nagpur v.
