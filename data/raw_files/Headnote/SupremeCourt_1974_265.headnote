 The respondent was tenant of certain premises. As a result of a decree in a partition suit the premises fell to the share of the appellants and they filed a suit for eviction.
 They also applied under s. 11A of the Bihar Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act, 1947, for payment of arrears of rent, and the Court directed the respondents to pay into court the arrears and future rent. The respondent did not comply with the order and his detenue to the eviction suit was struck out. Thereafter. an ex-parte decree evicting the respondent was passed and it was confirmed by the first appellate Court. In second appeal, the High Court remitted the case to the trial Court on the ground that since the respondent had not admitted the appellants to be full owners of the prermises but contended that other co-sharers of the appellant's family had also shares therein, there was a denial of the relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties and so the order striking out the respondent's defence qua tenant did not prevent him from contesting the suit on the question of title.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD. The respondent had admitted that he was tenant under the appellants and had paid rent to the appellants recognising them as his landlords. It was not therefore a case of denial of relationship of land lord and tenant between the parties. His plea was only that the appellants being landlords of a share of the premises could not by themselves claim a decree of eviction against him. Such a plea was a plea qua tenant and not dehors it. The striking out of his defence had thus, the effect of striking out all the defences raised by the respondent qua tenant including his defence that the appellants being co-sharer landlords were not entitled to maintain the suit for eviction.
