 Rule 4A(iv)(b) of the Madras General Sales-tax (Turnover and Assessment) Rules, 1939 lays down that tax has to be levied from the dealer who buy-, cotton in the State and is the last dealer not exempt from taxation. Sale-&-tax was sought to be recovered from the respondents on cotton purchased by them within the State and sold to persons who were non- resident within the area to which the Madras Sales-tax Act, 1939 applied. The non-resident buyers never entered the State either for entering into contracts for the sale or for taking delivery. The delivery was given within the State to the common carrier, and the non-resident buyers insured the goods as owners thereof and transmitted them to destination.
 The respondents' plea that since the goods were sold by them within the State to non-residents, they were not the last dealers not exempt from taxation, was accepted by the Sales-tax Appellate Tribunal and the High Court. In appeal to this Court the appellant-State contended that (i) on the facts the respondents were the last dealers not exempt from taxation and (ii) a buyer who was not resident within the area to which the Act applied could not be held to be the last dealer for the purpose of the Rule.
 
HELD : (i) The contention had no force. The common carrier took delivery as agent of the buyer and the delivery was within the State. There was the further circumstance that, during transit, the goods were insured by the buyers at their own cost, and not by the respondents. The buyers thus recognised that they were already the owners of the goods as soon as they were given for transmission to the common carrier. [630 E] The movement of the goods outside the State was by the buyers themselves after property in them bad passed to them;
 so, the sales in question were not sales in the course of inter-State trade. [631 C] Tata Iron and Steel Co. Ltd., Bombay v. S. R. Sarkar & Ors.

 (ii) Under the Rule the location of the dealer buying it was immaterial. Therefore the non-resident buyers were the last-dealers who bought it in the State and tax had to be levied from them. [631 G-H] State of Andhra Pradesh v. M/s. Abdul Bakhi & Bros. A.I.R.
