 The respondent company was the tenant of the flat in dispute. Consequent upon a winding up order in respect of the Company in Company Petition No. 59 of 1984 the official liquidator took possession of the flat and sealed it. The appellant in C.A.No. 886/92 before this Court, who is the sister of one of the Directors of the Company claimed on the basis of an agreement dated 15.7.79 said to have been entered into between her and the Company, to be the sub- tenant of the flat except a small portion thereof and that with the consent of the landlord she was in possession of the premises since the date of the agreement. The official liquidator delivered the possession of the premises to her, but later he threatened to dispossess her, whereupon the appellant filed a suit against the company in the court of Small Causes for injunction and for a declaration that she was the lawful tenant and/or a protected sub-tenant of the flat in dispute (excluding the portion reserved for the Company).
 On an objection raised by the Official liquidator the appellant applied under s. 446 of the Companies Act to the High Court for grant of leave to proceed with the suit. The Company Judge rejected the application holding the suit a collusive.
 986 On appeal, the Division Bench transferred the suit to the High Court granting leave with the conditions that the official liquidator would take possession of the entire premises and would allow the appellant to occupy the area in the premises, which at the relevant time was in her possession, as an agent of the official liquidator pending the disposal of the suit, on payment of a monthly compensation of Rs. 7,500 besides depositing Rs. 15,000.
 Aggrieved the appellant preferred the appeal by special leave to this Court.
 The landlord-Trust filed a company application in Company Petition No. 59 of 1984 for possession of the flat including symbolic possession of the premises in occupation of the appellant on the ground that the Company no more required the portion in their possession. The Single Judge dismissed the application holding that the liquidator required the said portion for storing the company records at Bombay. Dismissing the consequent appeal the Division Bench of the High Court held that a proposal from Rashtriya Girni Kamgar Sangh for revival the Company was under consideration. The said order is the subject matter of C.A.No. 887 of 1992.
 It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the tenancy interest of the company in the flat was not an asset of the Company in liquidation and th liquidator could not trade in the said right; that the appellant had a right to be in possession of the premises in her own right as a sub- tenant; and in view of the Bombay Rent Act, the High Court erred in converting the appellant into an agent of the official liquidator and in imposing the conditions and enhancing the rent.
 The official liquidator contended that the landlord Trust acted beyond th authority in consenting, if at all, to the said sub-tenancy.
 Counsel for the landlord-trust accepted the fact of oral consent to the sub-tenancy.
 Against an order dated 9.8.1989 passed by the Company Judge, the landlord Trust -filed S.L.P. No. 16368 of 1990 before this Court as also an appeal before the Division Bench of the High Court. Since the appeal had been dismissed by the High Court, this court dismissed the special leave petition as infructuous.
 Disposing of the appellant's appeal (C.A.No. 886/92) and dismissing 987 the appeal of the landlord - Trust (C.A.No. 887/92), this Court, 
 HELD : 1. Merely because a company goes in liquidation and a liquidator/official liquidator is appointed, the rights of the company viz a-viz its landlord and/or its tenant do not undergo any change. [p. 994C-D] 
 2. The tenancy rights the company had in the flat in dispute may not be an asset for the purpose of liquidation proceedings. [p. 994B-C] 
 3. Having regard to the facts - the admission of official liquidator of a special resolution passed by the Board of Directors of the Company affirming the sub-tenancy, and the consent of the landlord-Trust to the said sub-tenancy (a fact not present before the High Court) and appellant's possession over a major portion of the said flat on the date of appointment of the official liquidator on a monthly rent of Rs. 600 payable by the appellant to the Company as against the monthly rent of Rs. 900 payable by the Company - the appellant's plea of sub-tenancy is, preima facie, established; and in the circumstances, prima facie speaking, her claim of protection of Bombay Rent Control Act cannot be rejected.
 [pp.993 C-D; GH; 994A-B] 
 4. The rights of the appellant and the questions whether the sub-tenancy is true, whether it is valid in law and whether the consent of the landlord is true and valid would be decided in the suit. [9. 993E-F] 
 5.1 The directions made by the Division Bench of the High Court have the effect of dispossessing the appellant from the premises in dispute and were not warranted at the interlocutory stage when the rights of the appellant are yet to be adjudicated upon. The character of her possession has also wrongly been altered as she is permitted to be in occupation of a portion of the flat as an agent of the liquidator. [p. 994D-F] 
 5.2 Having regard to the particular facts and circumstances of the case and with a view to safeguard the rights of the company in the event of dismissal of the suit, the appellant should furnish security in a sum of rupees five lakh by way of bank guarantee to the satisfaction of the Company Judge. The amount already deposited shall continue to lie in Court. The instant arrangement is an interim one pending the suit and shall not reflect upon the merits of the the suit. [pp. 994 G-H; 995A-B] 
 6. The official liquidator's requirement of the portion of the flat (which is in his actual possession) for storing the company books, and 988 the proposal of the Rashtriya Girni Kamgar Sangh who are said to have formed an action committee of the Khandesh Mill Employees Industrial Production Co-operative Society for revival of the said company are relevant factors; and the High Court rightly dismissed the application and the appeal filed by the landlord Trust.
