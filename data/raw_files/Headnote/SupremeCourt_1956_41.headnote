 A Parsi testator by a holograph will provided, "I hereby give, devise and bequeath to my so called mother Mrs.
 Shirinbai, .......... her heirs, executors and administrators, for her and their own use and benefit, absolutely and for ever all my estate and effects, both real and personal, whatsoever and wheresoever and of what nature and quality soever, and I hereby appoint her the said Mrs.
 Shirinbai Maneckshaw Bejonji Mistry, sole executrix of this my Will................. The will was attested by two witnesses one of whom was the husband of Mrs. Shirinbai.
 Mrs. Shirinbai as the sole executrix obtained probate of the said will from the High -Court and took possession of the estate. A suit was brought by the heirs of the testator in the Court of the Civil Judge for a declaration that the bequest in favour of Mrs. Shirinbai was void in law by operation of s. 67 of the Indian Succession Act and that the estate of the testator had, therefore, become divisible amongst his heirs as on intestacy. The trial- Judge hold that the bequest in favour of Mrs. Shirinbai was void under s. 67 of the Indian Succession Act and there wag no gift over but that the plaintiffs were not the heirs of the testator and, consequently, they could not maintain the suit. On appeal by the plaintiffs, the High Court agreed with the first two findings of the trial Judge, but reversed his decision and decreed the suit holding that the plaintiffs were the heirs of the testator. It was contended on behalf of Mrs. Shirinbai and her two daughters in this appeal that on a true construction of the will there was a substitutional bequest in favour of the heirs, executors and administrators of Mrs. Shirin- 592 bai and that even if the bequest to her failed by operation of s. 67 of the Act, the other bequest must take effect.
 Held, that on a proper construction of the will as a whole and the words "for her and their own use and benefit" used by the testator and having regard to the facts and the circumstances in which he executed it, there could be no doubt that the intention of the testator was to create a substitutional bequest. Although his primary intention was to benefit Mrs. Shirinbai, the language he used unmistakably showed that be intended to prevent his estate from passing on to his step relations as on intestacy, should the bequest in favour of Mrs. Shirinbai fail by reason of her predeceasing him.
 In re Mcelligott, (L.R. [1944] Chancery 216), dissented from.
 That as the will did not in terms state that the substitutional bequest was to take effect only in the event of Mrs. Shirinbai predeceasing the testator, and so did not come under the illustration to s. 130 of the Indian Succession Act, that section had no application and s. 129 of the Act would apply.
 That the result was that the substitutional bequest in favour of the two daughters, who were presumptive heirs of Mrs. Shirinbai when the testator died, would take effect although it must fail so far as her executors and administrators were concerned.
