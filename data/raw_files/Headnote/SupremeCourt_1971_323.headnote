 On the basis of the recommendation of the Tariff Commission the Government of India promulgated the Motor Car (Distribution and Sale) Control (Amendment) Order 1969 under s. 18G of the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951. By this order the Government fixed the exfactory prices of the three cars manufactured in India namely Hindustan Ambassador, Fiat 1100-D and Standard Herald 4 Door. These prices were inclusive of dealers' commission but did not include the excise duties, Central Sales-tax and local taxes, if any, and transport charges. The manufacturers or dealers were prohibited from selling or offering for sale or otherwise transferring or disposing of the motor cars for a price exceeding the price given in the order. The manufacturers of these vehicles and two of their dealers filed writ petitions in this Court under Art. 32 of the Constitution challenging the price fixed. On May 5, 1970 this Court after partly hearing the petitioners recommended to the Government to appoint a commission for the purpose of suggesting a fair price for the three cars by taking into consideration all the relevant matters. The Government accordingly appointed a Commission of three members headed by a retired High Court Judge and by a notification dated June 5, 1970 all the provisions of the Commission of Enquiry Act 1952 were made applicable to the Commission. The Commission, decided to recommend a fair price for two periods, (1) as in September 1969 and (2) as in July 1970. It was considered necessary to determine the price in September 1969 because the impugned order was promulgated at that time. For the September 1969 prices the computation was done according to the 'historical method', which meant that not only the prices in September 1969 were kept in view but also the value of pending stocks of raw materials and the average of the price at which purchases had been effected at that time were taken into account. The prices for July 1970 were computed on the basis of the actual cost obtaining in the month of July 1970. The report of the Commission suggesting fair prices for the three cars in question was filed before the court. The findings of the Commission were criticised by the writ petitioners on the following grounds : (1) That the Commission had taken the production capacity at an excessive figure and had thus artificially reduced the cost; (ii) that cost and expenses on account of warranty and statutory bonus had been wrongly excluded from the ex-works cost; (iii) that in fixing the cost for September 1969 even the actual admitted cost found by the Commission had not been taken into account and the price had been fixed on the historical cost, whereas in.
 fixing the price for July 1970 the projected and estimated cost for July 1970 had been ignored; (iv) that no pro-vision had 527 been made for an escalation clause in order to ensure that the prices fixed would ensure for a reasonable period of time; (v) that the return which bad been allowed was wholly inadequate on the admitted and proved facts, and (vi) that the depreciation of plant and machinery had been allowed on the basis of original cost whereas it should have been allowed on the replacement value or on the peculiar facts of the case. It was common ground that deviation from the report of the Commission which was an expert body presided over by a former judge of a High Court should be directed only when it was shown that there had been a departure from established principles or the conclusions of the Commission were shown to be demonstrably wrong or erroneous.
 
HELD : (By the Court) (i) The very concept of fair price vhich can be fixed under s. 18 G of the Act takes in all the elements, which make it 'fair' for the consumer leaving a reasonable margin of profit to the manufacturcr without which no one will engage in any manufacturing activity Capacity utilisation of a manufacturing unit, the quality oil its product, and the maintenance of proper standards at various levels of production are all relevant factors for the determination of the price. Capacity utilisation, has to be on the basis of what can be reasonably achieved keeping in view always the practical side. [549 H-550 A] Within regard to the Premier Automobiles at no stage except for the second half of the year April 1970 to March 1971 import licences had been granted for production of more than 1200 cars. It was only in that year that for the first half it was granted for 6050 cars and for the second half for 7000 cars. From the practical point of view therefore the achievable capacity for September 1969 could not have been fixed for more than 12000 cars a year The Commission was right in fixing the achievable capacity for July 1970 at the figure of 14000 cats per year. In regard to Standard Motors that Commission was not justified in departing from the recommendations of its technical committee and fixing the production capacity at 4000 cars, and 1000 commercial vehicles per annum. , On an overall consideration the capacity of Standard,, Motors would be 3400. cars and 1000 trucks as found by the technical team. [552 B-C; 553 A-B;
 555 G] As regards Hindustan Motors the production capacity should have been assessed at the figure given by the technical team namely 30000 cars, and 5000 trucks per year. The Commission was wrong in relying on the applications for import licences made by Hindustan Motors and on their basis assessing the production capacity for trucks at 10500. In such applications the estimates given are likely to be Mated.
 The technical committee had proceeded on the basis of independent physical checking and verification in all respects. There was no justification for rejecting the opinion of the experts especially when no member of the team was examined as a witness for finding out those facts and data which the Commission had sought to use for rejecting the technical team's report. [557 H-558 D] (ii) (a) As laid down in the order promulgated by the Government in March 1968 under s. 16 of the Act all defects due to faulty manufacture of workmanship shall be rectified and defective parts replaced during the warranty period without passing any part of the burden including incidental charges to the consumer. The effect of the above direction cannot be ignored although it may not be conclusive in the matter of fixing a fair price. The statement of the Commission that if the warranty was to be made out of the profits every manufacturer would try to minimise warranty cost by improving the quality: of his product was unexceptionable. If it is to be included in the ex-works cost it would 528 mean virtually passing it on to the consumer. [538 G-539 Al (b) The question whether bonus is linked with profit or cost stands concluded by the provisions of the Bonus Act itself as also the decision of this Court in Jalan Trading Co.'s case. The object of the Bonus Act as observed in that case is to make an equitable distribution of the surplus profits of the establishment with a view to maintain peace and harmony between the three agencies (capital, management and labour) which contribute to the earning of profits. The Commission came to the correct conclusion that bonus is connected with profits and it cannot be included in ex-works cost. [540 E; 541 E] Jalan Trading Co. (P) Ltd. v. Mill Mazdoor Union, [1966] INSC 132; [1967] 1 S.C.R. 15, referred to.
 (iii) There was no authority or principle on which the method of calculating the ex-works cost on historical basis could be justifiably adopted for September 1969 when a different method was adopted for July 1970 cost. The ex- works cost for September 1969 should have been determined according to the current prices as was done with regard to July 1970. [541 H] (iv) In view of the rising prices of components provision for escalation and de-escalation of car prices was_necessary, [Directions given] [543 A-D; 562 H] (v) The quantum of return has essentially to vary from industry to industry. The Commission took figures from authentic sources i.e. the report of the Reserve Bank of India and an analysis carried out by the Economic and Scientific Research Foundation with regard to the return which was being earned by the various companies on the capital employed. After taking the maximum return which an investor can expect from fixed deposits and other relevant factors into consideration the commission was of the view that a dividend of 10% to the equity shareholder after providing for the tax liability of the company and other outgoing would be fair and reasonable.. The outgoing which are to be met out of the return are (1) the actual interest on borrowings; (2) the minimum bonus; (3) other financial charges; (4) warranty charges and in case of Premier Automobiles the guarantee commission paid on loans obtained from foreign sources and differences in exchange. After making provision for these outgoing the dividends on preference shares, if any, the tax liability of the company and a return of 10% on the equity share capital, the total profit of the company as a whole was calculated which when related to the capital employed of the respective companies worked out to 15.43% in the case of Hindustan Motors, 16.22% in that of Premier Automobiles and 17.36% in Standard Motors. Considering the above and taking an over all view of the car industry 16% return on capital employed was considered to give a reasonable return to the car manufacturer. [545 E546 A] At first sight it may appear that return of 16% on the capital employed is a very large return but this return includes numerous items which reduce the return to the equity shareholder to a percentage which, even according to the Commission, on an average cannot exceed 10%. The plea of the car manufacturers for exclusion of warranty and bonus charges from the return and for their inclusion in the ex- works cost could not be accepted. At the same time the return of 12% recommended by the Tariff Commission was wholly inadequate when all the items that the Car Price Commission had mentioned had to be paid out of it.
 529 The return of 16% granted by the Commission was a reasonable one keeping in view the entire circumstances. A total return of 16% will leave some margin if proper economies are effected by the manufacturers for replacement and rehabilitation and improvement of the plant and machinery.
 The main objective is to project the interest of the consumer while at the same time provide a reasonable margin of profit to the producers. The general approach has to be to determine the ex-works cost and then to arrive at the fair price after examining other claims of the industry and providing a reasonable return. There was no principle which had been demonstrated to be wrong in the report of the Com- mission so far as the fixation of the return was concerned.
 [546 D-H] Even though the return to the equity shareholders of all the there companies may not be uniformly 10% it was not possible to make any distinction or discrimination between the three manufacturers. A separate rate of return for each could not be fixed when dealing with the automobile car industry as a whole. [546 B-C] (vi) The Commission was right in allowing depreciation on the actual cost and not on the replacement value. The depreciation which is allowed under the tax laws is very liberal and there is no reason to pass on the burden to the present consumer who is not likely to get any benefit out of the replacement proposed to be provided for by the manufacturers. There was no serious infirmity or flaw in the reasoning or the conclusion of the Commission on the question of depreciation. [548 A-C] 
ALSO HELD : (1) The amount payable on account of royalty per car in the case of Standard Motors pursuant to the collaboration agreement the renewal of which had been approved by the Government of India must be included in the ex-works cost for July 1970 [562 E-F] (2) The conclusion of the Commission relating to the percentage of the local steel sheets by the Hindustan Motors was correct. [562 F] (3) The dealers, shall, for the present, be entitled only to the mark up in terms of the recommendations of the Commission. [562 G] On the relationship between taxation and the high prices of cars the Court observed : It will not be out of place to notice a few observations of expert bodies about taxation which forms at least one third part of the price of a car.
 The Tariff Commission in its third report published in 1968 recorded that high prices of the vehicles were due mostly to the existing multiple taxes on the automobiles at different stages of production and sale. It had recommended a reduction in the burden of taxation which would lead to reduction in the prices of cars. The Jha Committee bad emphasized the same in 1960 and had pointed out that taxation was a burden on the consumer rather than on the producer. The Car Price Enquiry Commission has said in its main report at page 292 :"The incidence of tax on a car is very heavy inasmuch as it constitutes46% of the ex- factory price. The car is no longer an item of luxuryand under the existing conditions it is fast becoming an item of necessity. That being so, there is a case for giving some relief out of the excise duties and other levies which are by their nature multi-point taxes causing hardship." [436 F--537 A] Per Khanna, J. (Partly dissenting) The production capacity which has to be taken into account is the achievable capacity of a plant run in a reasonably efficient manner. Concerted effort has to be made to attain a high level of production for two obvious reasons : (1) supply of new cars falls considerably short of the demand and the intending purchasers have to be kept on the waiting list 530 for inordinate length of time and (2) increased production would bring down the ex-works costs of the car. Although it would not be practicable and realistic to insist upon the highest or absolute efficiency, it would be equally unjust and inequitable to throw the burden of inefficiency of a manufacturer on the consumer in working out the figure of 'fair price' of the article manufactured. To put it differently, the authority concerned in determining fair price should not demand from the manufacturer the paragon of excellence in the matter of volume of production but at the same time the authority should not make the consumer bear the margin of high cost resulting from avoiding low production. It is, of course, implicit in that that reasonable facilities would be afforded to the manufacturer for procuring material like imported parts and steel which is under the Government control so as to be in a position to manufacture the requisite number of cars. The concept of 'fair price' postulates that the price should be fair not only to the producer but also to the consumer; the goal should be to arrive at just and reasonable rates. [566 E-H] No case had been made for interfering with the July 1970 price of Standard Herald as found by the Commission on the ground that the production capacity of that company from July onwards was 3400 and riot 4000 cars. The latter estimate made by the Commission was not excessive considering the admissions made by the company in its applications dated 19-6-1968 and 20-12-1969 in which the company had estimated its production at 4200 cars. It is wellknown that admissions constitute a strong piece of evidence against the party making the admissions and it is for that party to show that the admissions are mistaken or are not true. On the material on record the company had failed to discharge that onus. The argument that the petitioner in order to obtain import licence had to give a bloated figure of estimated production did not appear to be convincing because the excess of the imported material had to be adjusted in the subsequent import licences. [570 H-571 D, F] From the Technical Team's own report it was clear that neither any physical verification could be made by the Tr- ,am nor could it make a systematic study and it had to content itself with the materials supplied by the petitioner-company. The Verghese Committee no doubt dealt with the question of capacity but in a rather general way.
 There was nothing to indicate that any attempt was made before the Committee to show that the achievable capacity of the petitioner company was more than what was stated on behalf of the petitioner. In these circumstances there was no reason to rely on the recommendations of the Technical Team or the Verghese Committee in preference to the findings of the Commission. [568 E, 569 A-B]
