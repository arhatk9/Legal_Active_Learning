 The appellant was charged with the offence of murder. The trial court observed in its judgment that it appeared that the deceased must have picked up a quarrel with the appellant's brother, that the deceased overpowered the appellant's brother, threw him on the ground and sat on his chest giving him fist blows, and that since the appellant could not, prevent the deceased hitting his brother by the use of his fist, he stabbed the deceased in the back with a knife. The trial court found the appellant guilty of murder, and the High Court dismissed his appeal summarily, agreeing generally with the conclusions of the trial court.
 On the question of the nature of the offence, 
HELD : The appellant had exceeded his right of private defence and his guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder punishable under the first part of s.304, I.P.C.
 (Per Bhargava, J.) On the facts stated the deceased was the aggressor and a right of self-defence of the body of his brother had accrued to the appellant. But the right is governed by s. 101, I.P.C., and is subject to the limitations that in the exercise of the right death may not be caused, and that the force used should not exceed the minimum required to save the person in whose defence it is used. In the present case, the use of the knife itself was in excess of the right and it became much more excessive when the blow was given in a vital part of the victim's body and was, in the ordinary, course of nature, likely to cause his death. [945 G-H; 946 A-D] (Per Dua, J.) The right of private defence is codified in ss. 96 to 100 I.P.C. By enacting these sections the authors of the Code wanted to except from the operation of its penal clauses classes of acts done in good faith for the purpose of repelling unlawful aggression. This right is available against an offence and, therefore, where an act is done in exercise of right of private defence such an act cannot give rise to a right of private defence in favour of the aggressor in return. This would seem to be so even if the person exercising the right of private defence has the better of his aggressor provided he does not exceed his right because the moment be exceeds it he commits an offence. There is also no right of private defence when there is time to have recourse to the protection of public authorities. This right is essentially a defensive right circumscribed by the statute, and should not be allowed as a pretext for vindictive, aggressive or retributive purpose.
 As this right vests even in strangers for defence of body and property of others against offences, the courts should be careful in seeing that no one on the mere pretext of exercise of right of private defence takes sides in a quarrel between two or more persons and inflicts injuries on one or the other. When two parties are having a free fight without disclosing as to who is the initial aggressor it would be dangerous as a general rule 944 to clothe either of them or a sympathizer with a right of private defence. If however, one of them is shown to be committing an offence affecting human body then that would give rise to such right. When there is no initial right of private defence there can hardly be any question of exceed- ing that right. [947 E-H; 948 A-B] in the present borderline case the facts of which are peculiar there was no firm finding by the trial court that the deceased was guilty of unlawful aggression or of an offence giving rise to the right of private of defence. In view of the summary dismissal of the appeal by the High Court in a brief order expressing general agreement with the conclusions of the trial court the appellant was given the benefit of the trial court's observation that the deceased must have picked up a quarrel with Zulfikuar.
