 The appellant-Bank and its employees were parties to the Sastry and Desai Awards published on March 26, 1953 and June 13, 1962 respectively. The two awards provided for the grant of allowance to head cashiers and a special allowance to supervisors when a person falls in the category of a supervisor, or is found eligible to be put in that category, by whatever nomenclature such person may be designated, in view of the supervisory nature of the duties and functions assigned to him. But in paragraph 338, the Sastry Award rejected the demand made by head cashiers to be treated as supervisors while fixing emoluments appropriate to the position of supervisors, and the Desai Award, in paragraph 5.249, rejected a similar demand by head cashiers for giving them supervisory grades.
 The respondents in the present case were head cashiers of the appellant Bank and were receiving the special allowance due to them as head cashiers. The duties and functions of head cashiers were set out in the agreements entered into between the Bank and the head cashiers. The items of work done by the respondents were those usually done by head cashiers. They were also doing some items of work which could be called supervisory- They filed applications before the Labour Court under s. 33C(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, and claimed payment of the special allowance granted to supervisor&. The Labour Court found' that the respondents were discharging some supervisory functions without specifying which part of their work was of a supervisory nature, and allowed the claim.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD: (1) The Labour Court had been specified and conferred jurisdiction to entertain the applications. [374F] (2) The status of an employee as to whether he is a head cashier or supervisor is not a pure question of fact and has to be inferred as a matter of law from the facts found by the Labour Court. The mere fact that a person whose duties are essentially and mainly that of a headcashier, for whom also a special allowance was payable under the two awards, performs occasionally or casually or as incidental to his work as a headcashier, duties which may be characterised as supervisory, will not entitle him to claim the special allowance granted to a supervisor under the two awards. The two awards dealt with headcashiers and supervisors as entirely different categories. Only persons falling under the category of supervisors or discharging functions which were mainly or essentially of a supervisory nature, were treated as supervisors; and headcashiers were not treated on a par with supervisors, because, the functions discharged by headcashiers and supervisors materially differ. If headcashiers were treated as supervisors merely because they did some work of a supervisory nature there should be no distinction between the two categories. [377B-C, G-H; 378B- C; 382G-H; 383A-C; 384B-E] 366 in the present case, the work done by the respondents, on their own .admission and on the findings of the Labour Court, consisted of only items of work which a headcashier was bound to do. They never claimed that they fell within the category of supervisors or discharging any 'work essentially of a supervisory nature. The work might have been important, responsible and onerous but on that basis they were not entitled to the special allowance as supervisors. Even the few items of work ,claimed by them to be supervisory were really done by them as incidental to their main duties as headcashiers. It was not necessary to remand the matter to the Labour Court for investigation as to which parts of the items of work claimed to have been done by the respondents could be characterised as supervisory functions, because, the respondents only claimed that in the discharge of their work as headcashiers, they were doing certain items of work-which were of a supervisory nature, and not that they have been doing any work which was essentially of a supervisory nature.
