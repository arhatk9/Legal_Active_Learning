Before going on leave, he appointed 'M' to act as Chief Reporter temporarily during his absence. The respondent was not satisfied with this arrangement and so he began to ignore the assignments allotted to him by the Acting Chief Reporter. The Acting Chief Reporter complained to the Managing-Director that the respondent was ignoring the assignments allotted to him on the basis of the above-mentioned complaint an enquiry was held against the respondent. It was held day to day and the respondent cross-examined the witnesses at length. The enquiry officer did not allow the Editor to be examined on behalf of the respondent on the ground that he was not a material witness. The Enquiry Officer found that the charge had been proved against the respondent. The Management accepted the enquiry report and discharged him from the service.
