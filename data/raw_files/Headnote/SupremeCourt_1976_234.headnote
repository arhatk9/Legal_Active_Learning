 Fifteen routes including the route Ranchi-Daltonganj via Kuru was nationalised by a scheme by the respondent State as per gazette notification dated September 13, 1972. The scheme concerned inter aria the area and the route between Ranchi and Daltonganj including Ranchi, Kuru and Chandwa Daltonganj, being a rural service. The scheme permitted the existing private operators to continue till the expiry of their permits. The appellants challenged the scheme by way of an application under Art. 226 in the Patna High Court which was dismissed in limine.
 Dismissing the appeal by special leave the Court, 
 HELD: (1 ) Rule 94A speaks of particulars of scheme proposing modification of an approved scheme prepared by the Transport Corporation. It is wrong to read serial Nos. 4, 5 and 6 in schedule II in Form, A which mentions the number of State carriages, scheduled to operate in each route by private operators and by State Transport Undertaking and the number of daily trips scheduled in each route by both these operators, to suggest that even though . the route is natio- nalised, there must be private operators. The form is general. There may be on the same route both private opera- tors and State Transport or there may be only private opera- tors or there may be only State Transport. The form does not suggest that even though the route is nationalised, there must be private operators. [662 F-G,-663 A--B] (2) Section 68D of the Motor Vehicles Act states that the State Government may, after considering the objections and after giving an opportunity to the objector or his representatives and the representatives of the State Trans- port Undertaking to be heard in the matter, if they so desire, approve or modify the scheme. No. finding of fact is necessary on each and every separate objection.

 (3) No monopoly is conferred on the private operators who were allowed to continue to operate. Allowing them to operate means they were allowed to continue to operate in accordance with the permits. Operation after the expiry of the current permits would depend on the policy of the Government whether there would be any renewal and it there would be any renewal, that should be in accordance with law. [663 H. 664 A] (4) Fresh plea by way of an allegation in the affidavit rejoinder to the writ petition when the State had no oppor- tunity to deal with such allegation cannot be allowed to be agitated.
