 The respondent was an employee of a statutory body. On allegations of theft, misappropriation of stocks and certain other irregularities a preliminary enquiry was conducted by the Managing Director (the appellant) and charges were framed against the employee. In the explanation submitted by him he expressly demanded that he wished to cross-examine certain witnesses whose names were given by him, and wanted to examine certain other persons as witnesses. A few months thereafter, the appellant passed the impugned order of dismissal and required him to pay Rs. 549/- on account of certain commodities allegedly misappropriated by him.
 The employee's petition under Article 226 for the issue of a writ of certiorari was rejected by a single Judge. The Division Bench allowed the writ on the ground that the Corporation which was required to act in a quasi-judicial manner failed to give an opportunity of being heard to the dismissed employee and that therefore the order of dismissal was bad.
 On appeal, the appellant contended that Regulation 16 providing for an enquiry and giving an opportunity to an employee against whom an enquiry was to be held for misconduct had not come into force when the respondent was dismissed and, therefore, he had no statutory status and no locus-standi to maintain the writ which in substance was for specific performance of a contract of service.
 Dismissing the appeal ^ 
 HELD: (Per Sarkaria, J.) 
 1. The impugned order of dismissal was bad in law and had been rightly set aside by the High Court [781 F] (a) Regulations defining duties, conduct and conditions of its employees framed by statutory bodies have the force of law. The form and content of contract with a particular employee being prescriptive and statutory, the statutory bodies have no free hand in framing the terms and conditions of service to their employees, but are bound to apply them as laid down in the 774 regulations. The regulations give the employees a statutory status and impose obligations on the statutory authorities, and that they cannot deviate from the conditions of service laid down therein. There is no personal element in public employment and service. Whenever employees rights are affected by a decision taken under statutory powers the court would presume the existence of a duty to observe the rules of natural justice and compliance by the statutory body with rules and regulations imposed by the statute. [779 E-G] Sukhdev Singh v. Bhagat Ram [1975] INSC 43; [1975] 3 SCR 619 referred to In the instant case the appellant was a statutory body and, therefore, even if at the time of dismissal the statutory regulations had not been framed or had not come into force, employment being public employment, the employer could not terminate the employee's services without due enquiry in accordance with the regulations in force or in the absence of any regulations, in accordance with the rules of natural justice. Such an enquiry into the conduct of a public employee is of a quasi-judicial character. The respondent was employed by the Corporation in exercise of the powers conferred on it by the statute and, therefore, the Corporation's power to dismiss the respondent from service was derived from this statute. The court would presume the existence of a duty on the part of the dismissing authority to observe rules of natural justice and to act in accordance with the spirit of the regulation which was then on the anvil and came into force shortly after the dismissal. Secondly, in the instant case no regular departmental enquiry was held. The order of dismissal was passed summarily after perusing the employee's explanation.
 The rules of natural justice require that the dismissed employee should be given a reasonable opportunity to deny his guilt, to defend himself and to establish his innocence which means an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses relied upon by the Corporation and an opportunity to lead evidence in defence of the charge as also the show-cause notice for the proposed punishment. Such an opportunity was denied to the respondent. [780 G-H; 781 A-D] Executive Committee of U.P. State Warehousing Corporation Ltd. v. chandra Kiran Tyagi [1969] INSC 221; [1970] 2 S.C.R. 250;

 2. The High Court was in error in directing payment of full back wages to the dismissed employee. [783 E] 3(a) In exercise of its certiorari jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court acts only in a supervisory capacity and not as an appellate tribunal. It does not review the evidence upon which the inferior Tribunal proposed to base its conclusion; it simply demolishes the order which it considers to be without jurisdiction or manifestly erroneous but does not substitute its own view for the view of the inferior tribunal. In matters of employment while exercising its supervisory jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution over the orders and quasi-judicial proceedings of an administrative authority culminating in dismissal of an employee, the High Court should ordinarily, in the event of the dismissal being found illegal, simply quash the same and should not further give a positive direction for payment to the employees full back wages (although as a consequence of the annulment of the dismissal the position as it obtained immediately before the dismissal is restored. [782 F-H] 775 (b) Whether an employee of a statutory authority should be reinstated in public employment with or without full back wages, is a question of fact depending on evidence to be produced before the tribunal. One of the important factors to be considered in determining whether reinstatement should be with full back wages and with continuity of employment is to see if after the termination of his employment the employee was gainfully employed elsewhere. [783 D-E] In the instant case the employee did not raise an industrial dispute nor did he invoke the jurisdiction of the Labour Court or Industrial Tribunal but moved the High Court under Article 226 primarily on the ground of violation of the principles of natural justice.

 There is hardly any distinction, on principle, between a person directly under the employment of the Government and a person under the employment of an agency or instrumentality of the Government or a corporation set up under a statute or incorporated but wholly owned by the Government. The desire to achieve the objectives enumerated in the preamble to the Constitution has resulted in intense governmental activity in manifold ways. Today, the Government either directly or through corporations set up by it or owned by it, owns or manages a large number of industries and institutions. These agencies and instrumentalities, corporations or companies have become the biggest employers in the country. There is no good reason why if the Government is bound to observe the equality clauses of the Constitution in the matter of employment and in its dealing with its employees, the Corporations set up or owned by the Government should not be equally bound and why instead, such Corporations should become citadels of patronage and arbitrary action. To confine the applicability of the equality clauses, in relation to matters of employment, strictly to direct employment under the Governments, in a country like ours is perhaps to mock at the Constitution and the people. Some element of public employment is all that is necessary to take the employee beyond the reach of the rule which denies him access to a court so as to enforce a contract of employment and denies him the protection of Articles 14 and 16. Employees in public sector often discharge the onerous duties as civil servants and participate in activities vital to the country's economy. Many enactments have declared persons in the service of local authorities, government companies and statutory corporations, as public servants and extended to them the protection which is extended to civil servants from suits and prosecutions. It is, therefore, but right that the independence and integrity of those employed in the public sector should be secured as much as the independence and integrity of civil servants.
