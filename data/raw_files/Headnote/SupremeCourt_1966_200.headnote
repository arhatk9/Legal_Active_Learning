 For the assessment year 1950-51 the respondent submitted a return of its net turnover to the Deputy Commercial Tax Officer who was the assessing authority. As he determined the net turnover at a higher amount the respondent appealed to the Commercial Tax Officer, who allowed the appeal with respect to one item. On 28th November 1952, the assessing authority issued a revised assessment order as per the order of the Commercial Tax Officer. On 27th December 1952, the respondent presented a revision petition before the Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes raising the only objection, as a new -contention, that it should not have been assessed to tax on amounts collected by it by way of tax. On 21st August 1954, the Deputy Commissioner dismissed the petition on the ground that the respondent was not entitled to raise a new Contention for the first time. On 4th August 1958.
 the Board of Revenue issued a notice to the respondent stating that it proposed to revise the assessment by including in the net turnover a sum representing the value of cotton purchased by the respondent from outside the State and which was excluded by the assessing authority. After considering the respondent's objections the Board fixed the net taxable turnover by including that amount. The respondent's appeal to the High Court was allowed.
 In appeal by the State, 
HELD : The order of the Board of Revenue was invalid, because, under s. 12(4) (b) of the Madras General Sales-tax Act, 1939, the Board of Revenue could invoke its revisional jurisdiction.only within four years from the date on which the order of the assessing authority was communicated to the assessee. [734 G; 736 B-C] (i)The subject-matter of the revision proceedings before the Board of Revenue was only the revised assessment order of the assessing authority dated 28th November 1952, and not the Deputy Commissioner's order dated 21st August 1954. [736 C] The objection taken by the Board was with regard to the question of exemption allowed by the assessing authority on the value of cotton purchased from outside, and that question was not' raised in revision before the Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes. [736 C-D] (ii)It cannot be said that the order of the Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, in revision, is the only operative decision in law on the basis that the order of the inferior Tribunal (the order of the assessing authority dated 28th November 1952) merged in that of the superior Tribunal (order of the Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, dated 21st August 1954). [736 F] The application of the doctrine of merger depends on the nature of the appellate or revisional order in each case and the scope of the statu- 733 tory provisions conferring the appellate or revisional jurisdiction. In the circumstances of the present case it could not be said that there was a merger of the order of assessment dated November 28, 1952 with the order in revision dated 21st August 1954, because, the question of exclusion of the value of yarn purchased from outside the State was not the subject-matter of revision before the Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes.
