 Certain tenants of ryotwari land in Gwalior district filed a suit under 's. 326 of the Qanoon Mal alleging dispossession by the landlords and praying for restoration of possession. On behalf of the defendants it was urged that by not paying land revenue the plaintiffs' rights had been ,extinguished under s.' 82 of the Qanoon Ryotwari. The Revenue authorities decreed the suit on the view that even when land revenue was not paid the landlord could not take possession without recourse to a suit under s. 137 Qanoon.
 Ryotwari. The High Court however allowed landlords' petition under Art. 227 of the Constitution holding that it was not obligatory on the landlord to resort to Court in order to eject a defaulting lessee, and that in a proceeding under s. 163 of Qanoon Ryotwari it was not sufficient to determine the question of de facto possession alone but it was also necessary to enquire as to whether' this possession was or was not wrong. The appellant, who was one of the tenants came to this Court.
 Held: (i) Under s. 82(3) Qanoon Ryotwari, the right of a Khatedar extinguished if the khatedar keeps in arrears the land revenue of his khata but there is no automatic extinguishment of his right because the proviso to s. 137 of the Qanoon Ryotwari enables the Collector to accept arrears if the khatedar is a good payer (khush-dehanda) and there are special reasons beyond his control for not paying land revenue. The proviso would become a dead letter if in every case when there are arrears of land revenue the landlord could take possession forcibly without trying to recover the land revenue under s. 137. [207 E-G] Further s. 163 of Qanoon Ryotiwari clearly provides for suits of the nature described in s. 326 of Qanoon Mat.
 Section 326 is very similar 10 s. 9 of the Specific Relief Act 1877, and the words 'disturbed unlawfully'. in s. 326 mean "disturbed not in due course of law". Otherwise. there is no reason why a shorter period of limitation and summary procedure is provided in s. 326 while s. 325 provides a longer period of three years for a suit for possession. The word 'trespass' in s. 326 would include forcible entry and dispoSsession by the landlord. [207 G-208A] (ii) Under s. 9 of the Specific Relief Act the question of title is irrelevant under that section. Section 326 of Qanoon Mal read with Qanoon Ryotwari being similar to that section must be similarly interpreted. [208B] Midnapur Zamindary Company Limited v. Naresh Narayan Roy, 5t I.A. 293, K.K.
