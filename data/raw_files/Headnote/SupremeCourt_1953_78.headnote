 The detention order was made containing two grounds under sub-clauses (ii) and (iii) of clause (a) of section 3 (1) of the Preventive Detention Act, 1950, as amended by later Acts. In exercise of the powers under section 11 of the Act the Government confirmed the detention order against the detenu under sub-clause (ii) of section 3 (1) (a) of the Act but as respects the second ground under sub-clause (iii) of section 3 (1) (a) of the Act the Government did not uphold his detention and revoked it under this sub-clause ^ Held, that the original order made under section 3: (1) (a) is not sustainable.
 To say that the other ground which still remains is quite sufficient to sustain the order would be to substitute an objective judicial test for the subjective decision of the executive authority which is againstthe legislative policy underlying the statute. In such cases theposition would be the same as if one of these two grounds was irrelevant for the purpose of the Act or was wholly illusory and this would vitiate the detention order as a whole.
 Keshav v. The King-Emperor(1) referred to.
 It is well settled that the power to issue a detention order under section 3 of the Preventive Detention Act depends entirely upon thesatisfaction of the appropriate authority specified in that section. The sufficiency of the grounds upon which such satisfaction purportsto be based provided they have a rational probative value and are not extraneous to the scope or purpose of the legislative provision cannot be challenged in a court of law except on the grounds of mala fides.
 State of Bombay v. Atma Ram Sridhar Vaidya(2) referred to.
 Section 11 of the Preventive Detention Act lays down what action the Government it to take after the Advisory Board has submitted its report. If in the opinion of the Board there is sufficient reason for the detention of a person the Government may confirm the detention order and continue the detention for such (1) [1943] F.C.R. 88. (2) [1951] INSC 5; [1951] S.C.R. 167.
 419 period asit thinks proper. On the other hand if the Advisory Board isof opinion that there is no sufficient reason for the detentionof the person concerned, the Government is in duty bound torevoke the detention order.
 What the Government has done in this case is to confirm the detention order and at the same time to revoke it under one of the sub-clauses of section 3 (1) (a) of the Act. This is not what the section contemplates.
