 C's property passed under his Will, drawn in 1883, to K and M who were brothers. M died and K entered into possession of his share also. On K's death in 1922 his mother entered into possession of the whole property. She gave over the management of the property to the Court of Wards under s. 10 of the U.P. Court of Wards Act, 1912. The daughter of M however with the consent of K's mother got her father's share released from the management of the Court of Wards in her favour. In 1932 G, sister's son of K, filed a suit in which he challenged the release of M's share in favour of his daughter. Two other suits were filed in respect of the property by descendants of C's brother who as collaterals claimed to be next reversioners to the property.
 The plaintiff in one of these suits was the present appellant; in the other suit the plaintiff was his brother.
 In these suits a declaration was sought that G and M's daughter had no rights in the properties in question. G, M's daughter. K's mother and the Court of Wards were made parties to these suits. Both these suits were cornpromised.
 The suit of the present appellant was compromised by ,a document Ex. Y-13, to which, among others, the appellant, G, and K s mother were parties. G had withdrawn his own suit shortly before. Acting on the document Ex. Y-13 G paid monies to the Court of Wards to clear his liabilities and get released from its management the properties in question.
 C, M's daughter, K's mother and the Court of promise.
 However, subsequently, the appellant filed a suit in which he challenged the validity of Ex. Y-13. Having failed in the trial court as 'well as in the High Court he appealed to this Court by special leave.
 The questions that fell for determination were: (1) whether Ex. Y-13 was binding on the parties as a family arrangement or settlement, (2) whether certain reservation in the said deed, leaving it open to the parties to challenge its recitals in certain contingencies had the effect that the deed was not intended to be final, and (3) whether the family settlement fell within the mischief of s. 37(a.) of the U.P. Court of Wards Act.
 
 HELD: (i) The document Ex. Y-13 was in substance a family 'arrangement and therefore binding on all the parties to it. On the face of it, the document was a compromise of conflicting claims. The 842 parties recognised each others' rights to property, which they had earlier disputed. The suit filed by G was withdrawn shortly before the document was executed and those filed by the appellant and his brother were compromised on the day of its execution. All these transactions were part of one main transaction which was the settlement by members of the family of all their property disputes once and for all.
 Further, all those who could be said to be interested in the property were made parties to the transaction. [845H-846A] In these circumstances, the appellant who had taken benefit under the transaction was not entitled to turn round and challenge its validity'. He was also estopped from doing so because G, acting on the document had paid monies to the Court of Wards to get his property released. [850G] Ramgouda Annagouda v. Bhausaheb, L.R. 54 I.A. 396, relied (ii) Courts give effect to a family settlement upon the broad and general round that its object is to settle existing or future disputes general regarding property amongst members of a family. The word family in this context is not to be given a narrow meaning. In Ramgouda Annagouda's case, of the three parties, to the settlement of a dispute concerning the property of a deceased person one was his widow, another her brother, and the third her son-in-law. The two latter were not heirs of the deceased, yet bearing in mind their relationship to the widow the settlement of the dispute was regarded as the settlement of a family dispute. The consideration for such a settlement is the expectation that it will result in amity and goodwill amongst persons bearing relationship to one another. That consideration having passed by each of the disputants, the settlement consisting of recognition of the right asserted by each other cannot be permitted to be impeached thereafter. [850F-H, 851A-B] (iii) No doubt the parties to Ex. Y-13 recognised each others relationship to K only for the purposes of the deed, and also reserved to themselves the right to challenge the recitals to the deed, in certain contingencies. Thereby it is not established that the document was not intended to be final. Read as a whole the document left no doubt that it was intended to be a final settlement. If it were intended otherwise there would have been express mention to that effect in the deed. [848A-B] Moreover what was permitted was a challenge to the recitals only. What the appellant's suit challenged. however was not the recitals but the terms of the deed which none of the parties was given liberty to derogate from. [849B-C] (iv) A family settlement is not a transfer or creation of interest in the property within the meaning of s. 37(a) of the U.P. Court of Wards Act, 1912. It is in no sense an alienation by a limited owner of family property. Apart from that the two suits which were pending were compromised with the full knowledge of the Court of Wards which was also a party to both the suits and the Court of Wards in fact accepted monies from G which were due to it. In these circumstances the appellant was not entitled to press in his favour the provisions of s. 37(a) of the U.P. Court of Wards Act. [851C-852H] Mst. Hiran Bibi v. Mst.
