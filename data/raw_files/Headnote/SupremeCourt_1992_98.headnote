 The two respondents and two others were charged under Sections 366/34 and 376 read with 34 I.P.C. for kidnapping and committing rape on P.W.1. In the Identification Parade, conducted by P.W.13, the Executive Magistrate, P.W.1, the victim, identified the two respondents and one other accused. The trial court accepted her evidence and convicted the two respondents and sentenced them to undergo three years' rigorous imprisonment on each count.
 The trial court acquitted the other two accused and this became final since there was no appeal against it. The Sessions Court confirmed the sentences of the two respondent.
 On appeal, the High Court acquitted the two respondents on the grounds that P.W.1 identifying the respondents could not be relied upon, that there was no corroboration to her evidence, and that when there was gang rape there would be several injuries on the person of the victim, which were absent, and therefore, she was a consenting party.
 Allowing the appeal of the State, this Court, 
 HELD: 1.1 It is not necessary that there should be corroboration to the evidence of the victim of rape. If the evidence inspires confidence to be truthful, that itself would be sufficient to convict the accused. [396D] 394 
 1.2 In the instant case, there is no necessity for any corroboration of P.W.1's evidence. She was a simple village girl and she would not leave out her own assaillants and implicate falsely other innocent persons with the allegation that she was raped by them. Though she was a stranger to the accused she is the victim of dastardly offences of kidnapping and gang rape and it was done in broad day time. Therefore, when she was kidnapped into forest by the accused, she had opportunity to see them, though later her eyes were closed with a piece of cloth.
 When she was made to lie down on the ground at the threat of her life and gang rape was committed, she was absolutely helpless. The medical evidence amply corroborates that she had injuries on her private parts and so there is yet enough resistence put up by her to the gang rage committed one after the another. When it was done at the threat of her life she cannot be expected to go on resisting except to resisting to her fate and succumb to their assault. P.W.1 also identified the respondents in the identification parade. She had enough opportunity to identify the persons who committed rape on her. Even if corroboration is necessary, the injuries on her private parts; medical evidence of the doctor and her first information report provide such corroboration. The evidence of P.W.1 has to be accepted as truthful. [396B-E] 
 1.3 It is, therefore, not possible to accept the reasoning of the High Court in rejecting P.W.1's evidence and acquitting the two respondents. Besides, the High Court also did not make any attempt to disbelieve her evidence on its own merits. [396A,F] 
 1.4 In these circumstances, the casual and mechanical approach, without regard to human probabilities, and the consequent acquittal by the High Court resulted in grave miscarriage of justice. The Judgment of the High Court and order of acquittal of respondents is set aside. The judgments and convictions and sentences recorded by the trial court, and affirmed by the Sessions Court, are restored. The respondents should surrender and serve out the sentences. [396F,G]
