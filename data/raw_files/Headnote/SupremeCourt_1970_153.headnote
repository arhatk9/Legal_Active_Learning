 The appellant was a private limited company. The business and assets of the appellant were purchased by another company under agreement dated September 9, 1951. In the original proceedings for assessment to income-tax for the assessment year 1952-53 the appellant brought the transactions of sale to the notice of the Income-tax Officer and placed before him certain relevant documents and also furnished the information asked for. Setting off the unabsorbed depreciation brought forward against the income as found by him the Income-tax office determined the income of the appellant for the said assessment year at 'NIL'.
 Sometime later the successor-in-office of the said Income- tax Officer issued a notice under s. 34(1) (a) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 to the appellant after obtaining sanction from the Commissioner of Income-tax. He hold that the appellant had not disclosed its profit under s. 10(2) (vii) of the Act resulting from the sale of its assets and determining the said profits at Rs. 4,88,386, he made a re- assessment. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner confirmed the order. The Tribunal, however, held that the material facts were all disclosed to the Income-tax Officer at the time of the original assessment and a mere change of opinion did not justify proceedings under s. 34(1)(a). At the request of the Commissioner of Income-tax the Tribunal referred to the High Court the questions (i) whether in the circumstances of the case it could be held that in the original assessment proceedings the assessee had made a full disclosure of material particulars; and (ii) whether having initiated proceedings under s. 34(1) (a) the Income-tax Officer could have later relied on s. 34(1)(b).
 
HELD : The law casts a duty on the assessee to 'disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment' for the relevant year. ,Further the explanation to section 34(1) says that mere production before the Income-tax Officer of account books or other evidence from which material facts with due diligence could have been discovered by the Income-tax Officer will not amount to disclosure within the meaning of the section. In the present case the price realised at the sale in excess of the written down value of the assets sold, had not been included as profits in the return submitted by the assessee. It had also not shown the same in section 'D' of Part I of the return. The assessee had not shown either in its return or in any of the documents submitted to the Income-tax Officer.
 the written down value of the assets sold. This failure amounted to a failure on the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly the material 762 facts necessary for its assessment. From the cryptic statement of the Income-tax Officer in the original assessment order that 'no adjustment is necessary' the Tribunal was not justified in drawing the interence that the Income-tax Officer had considered all the facts.

 The High Court should not have and this Court would not answer the questions referred under s. 66(1) of the Act because those questions ,could not be answered without first deciding whether a part of the sale price received by the assessee amounted to profits under s. 10(2)(vii). [768 C-D] [Tribunal directed to decide first whether the assessee had any profits failing within s. 10(2)(vii) and thereafter decide the appeal]
