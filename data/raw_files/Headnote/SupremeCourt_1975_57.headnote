 By an agreement entered into between the petitioner, the Government of India, Burma Oil Company Limited and Assam Oil Company Limited, it was agreed that all crude oil produced by the petitioner (except Assam Oil Company's entitlement) be sold to and purchased by the Government of India. The exact clause reads as under :
 "All crude oil produced by Oil India excluding Assam Oil Company's entitlement in respect of Oil India's existing areas under clause 20 of the Promotion Agreement will (subject as hereinafter provided) be, sold to and purchased by the Government of India PROVIDED, that after meeting as a first call on such oil the joint annual requirements upto 21 million tons of Indian Refineries Limited's Barauni and Nunmati Refineries Assam Oil Companys Digboi refinery shall have the next call thereon up to a maximum of 435,000 tons per annum to the extent that it cannot be economically met from Assam Oil Company's leased areas." The petitioner pursuant to the. provisions of the said clause 7 supplied crude oil to Barauni Refinery of Indian Oil Corporation situated in Bihar through pipeline constructed and owned by the petitioner Company. At Barauni Refinery the crude oil which flows through the pipes from the oil fields of Assam is pumped into the Indian Oil Corporation's tanks and thereafter it is measured. After the measurement is agreed upon, the, Indian Oil Corporation takes delivery on behalf of the Government of India. The petitioner Company has been filing regular sales tax returns under the Bihar Sales Tax Act and was being assessed under that Act for the supply of crude oil to the Refinery at Barauni treating the supply as intrastate sales.
 Thereafter. the Sales Tax Authority in Assam issued notice to the petitioner on the, ground that the Central sales tax was payable under the central Sales Tax Act on the supply of crude oil to the Refinery at Barauni as the sales were in the course of inter-State trade. The Assessing Authority held that the supply of crude oil to the Refinery at Barauni by the petitioner attracted Central Sales Tax. In the present petition, the petitioner seeks a writ of mandamus directing the Assam Sales Tax Authorities not to levy the sales tax under the Central Sales Tax Act on the supply of crude oil to the refinery at Barauni. In the alternative, the petitioner prayed for a direction to the Bihar Tax Authorities to refund the taxes collected.
 
HELD : Under Section 3 of the Central Sales Tax Act a sale or purchase of goods shall be deemed to have taken place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce if the sale or purchase occasions movement of goods from one State to another. "is Court has held in a number of cases that if the movement of goods from one State to another is the result of a covenant or an incident of the contract of sale then the sale is an inter-State sale. In this case, the crude oil was carried from Assam through pipeline to Barauni in Bihar. Clause 12 of the agreement provides that the petitioner shall arrange for the construction of pipeline or such other related facilities as the Company shall consider necessary for the transport of crude oil to be produced by it to the refinery at Barauni. This would indicate, that the construction of the pipeline was undertaken by the petitioner in pursuance of the agreement 798 and that was for the specific purpose of transporting crude oil to Barauni from Assam. This can only point to the conclusion that the parties contemplated that there should be movement of goods from the State of Assam to the State of Bihar in pursuance to the contract of sale. It is immaterial as to in which state the property in the goods pass". It is not necessary that the sale must precede the inter-State movement in order that the sale may be deemed to have occasioned such movement. The sales were, therefore, in the course of interState trade and the Bihar Government had no jurisdiction to tax the sales under the Sales Tax Laws of the State. The Bihar Sales Tax Authorities were directed not to impose sales tax under the provisions of Bihar Sales Tax Act and were directed to refund the sales tax already collected. [800D-(G 8O1A-C]
