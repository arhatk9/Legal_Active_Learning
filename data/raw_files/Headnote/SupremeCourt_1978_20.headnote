 The Government of Maharashtra referred to the Industrial Tribunal the dispute between the New Standard Engineering Co. Ltd. and its workmen for adjudication under section 10(1)(d) of the Industrial Disputes Act 1947. The Tribunal gave its award in November, 1972, and it directed that the revised wage scales and the scheme of dearness allowance shall come into force with retrospective effect from 1st of January, 1968. The Company challenged the award in the High Court by a petition under Articles 226 and 227 of the Con- stitution which was fixed for hearing on 30-7-1973. A settlement was arrived at between the company and the Bhartiya Kamgar Sena (respondent No. 3) on 31-7-1973 but the application for adjournment was refused. The dictation of the judgment commenced on 31-7-1973 and was concluded on 1st August, 1973.
 One of the points urged in the High Court was that the Company had arrived at the settlement and award may be made in terms of that settlement or a direction may be given to the Tribunal to consider whether the settlement was fair and reasonable. The High Court held that the alleged settlement was not a settlement under section 2(p) of the Act it was not open to it to take notice of it in proceedings under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution. it therefore thought it proper to dispose of the petition on merits rather than leave it to uncertainty and inter-union rivalry which may lead to industrial unrest.
 The Company riled an appeal in this Court by Special Leave.
 This Court sent the matter to the Tribunal for finding whether the settlement arrived at by the Company and respondent No. 3 was under section 2(p) of the Act, whether the settlement was entered into voluntarily and whether it was just and fair. The Tribunal found that out of 1328 workmen who were in service on 31-7-1973, 995 workmen had signed the settlement and had also accepted their dues thereunder, and 242 workmen had only accepted their dues under the settlement by signing receipts though they did not sign the settlement.
 The Counsel for respondent No. 2 contended that the settlement dated 31-7-1973 was not just and fair. The Counsel further argued that while tinder the award the increased rates were admissible from January, 1968, the settlement put that off to January. 1973 and was, therefore, unjust and unfair. It was also contended that by the settlement the amount of arrears payable was reduced from Rs 40 lakhs to Rs. 11.5 lakhs. On the other hand Counsel for the Company pointed out with reference to the balance sheets that the Company bad paid all its tax and other liabilities which were beyond recall and that during the period from 1968 to 1972 it had only a net surplus of Rs. 5,11 lakhs, and that the Company had agreed to--Pay about Rs. 11.56 lakhs in addition to the difference in dearness allowance amounting to Rs. 3.64 lakhs which had already been paid to the workmen. It was stated that the Company had exceeded its borrowing limit and it was not possible to pay more than what it had agreed to pay under the settlement.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : 1. Settlement of labour disputes by direct negotiation or settlement through collective bargaining is always to be referred for it is the best guarantee of industrial peace which is the aim of all legislation for settlement of 799 labour disputes. In order to bring about such a settlement more easily and to make it more workable and effective, it is no longer necessary under the law that the settlement should be confined to that arrived at in the course of a conciliation proceeding, but now includes by virtue of the definition in Section 2(p) of the Act, a written agreement between the employer and the workman arrived at otherwise than in the course of conciliation proceedings where such agreement has been signed by the parties in the prescribed manner and a copy thereof has been sent to the authorised officer. Rule 58(2) of the Industrial Disputes (Central) Rules, 1957, prescribes the manner of signing the settlement. Section 18(1) specifically states that a settlement arrived at by agreement between the employer and the workman otherwise than in the course of conciliation proceedings shall be binding on the parties to the agree- ment.

2. Under the present settlement, the workmen have received the same wagesand dearness allowance which were awarded to them by the Tribunal. They,therefore, lost nothing on that account. The stipulation about increased production had nothing to do with the period prior to January, 1973.
 nor was there any condition in the settlement according to which the benefits of the settlement were to be forefeited in case the workmen did not carry out the stipulation. [803 A-B, D] 
3. The question of justness and fairness of a settlement should be examined with reference to the situation as it stood on the date on which it was arrived at i.e.. on 31-7- 1973. One of the ground of challenge to the award before the High Court was the contention that the Tribunal had not made a proper comparison of wages and the dearness allowance on industry-cum-region basis. The possibility of an adverse decision by the court could therefore operate as a positive force in favour of deliberate and careful effort by both the parties to settle their dispute through direct negotiation.
 It is that force which has brought about settlement under consideration. In the event of the success of the Company in the High Court the workmen were liable to refund the amounts which had already been paid to them. 995 workmen had signed the settlement and 242 workmen have accepted their dues under settlement. Bonafide of respondent No. 2 Union had not been challenged. [803 F, H, 804 A, B-E] 
4. The Court directed that the award of the Tribunal be substituted by the settlement. [804 F]
