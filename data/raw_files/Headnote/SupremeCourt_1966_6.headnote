 M, P and G carried on business in several commodities and in the assessment year 1954-55, the Income-Tax Officer brought to tax a third share in Rs. 51,280., computed as profits from the business in the hands of each of the three, persons. Thereafter, he called upon M to submit a return of the "income of the joint venture" on the footing that the parties thereto constituted an unregistered firm. On a return being filed, despite the objection of the assessees, the Income-Tax Officer completed the assessment of the three persons to the joint venture under section 23(3) of the Income-Tax Act, 1922 in the status of an unregistered firm and computed the income of the "joint venture" at Rs.
 80,925. An appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner was dismissed.
 In second appeal, the Tribunal held that the Income-Tax Officer had the option to assess the individual parties to the joint venture, and having exercised that option it was not open to the Income-Tax Officer thereafter to reassess the same income collectively in the hands of the three persons as an unregistered firm. On a reference, the High Court confirmed this view.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the Revenue that the Income-Tax Officer making the first assessment of the three persons was not informed that they constituted an unregistered firm and he was therefore in law competent to assess the entity which was in truth liable to be, assessed to tax; and in making the earlier order of assessment he could not be deemed to have exercised an option which precluded him from assessing the income of the three persons as an unregistered firm.
 
HELD : The three persons could be assessed individually or they could be assessed collectively in the status of an unregistered firm; the Income-Tax Officer could not seek to assess one income twice-once in the hands of the partners and again in the hands of the unregistered firm. [221 E] The plea that the Income-Tax Officer was not in possession of information relying on which, if he desired, he could have assessed the three persons collectively as an unregistered firm cannot be accented.
 When the, Income-Tax Officer assessed the three persons separately, he unquestionably exercised an option knowing that they had entered into a trading transaction in which they were jointly interested. [222 E]
