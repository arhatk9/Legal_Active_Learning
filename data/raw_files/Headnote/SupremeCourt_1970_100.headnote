 Section 154(1) of the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, 1888, provides that the annual rent for which a building might reasonably be expected to be let from year to year shall be the basis for fixing the rateable value of the building. Section 5(10) of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Act, 1947 (the Rent Act) defines standard rent and s. 5(7) of the Rent Act defines 'permitted increase' to mean an increase in rent permitted under the provisions of the Rent Act. Under ,ss. 10, 10A and 10AA of the Rent Act, a landlord can increase the rent on account of payment of rates, cesses or taxes imposed or levied by a local authority.
 The appellant imposed a tax known as educational cess on all the properties within its limits and the respondent increased the rents payable by its tenants to the extent of the educational cess under s. 10AA of the Rent Act. The appellant increased the rateable value on the ground that the educational cess should be deemed to be a part of the annual rent for which the building might reasonably be expected to be let from year to year' The High Court held that under s. 7 of the Rent Act the increase shall not be deemed to be an increase in rent and that therefore the rateable value could be fixed only on the basis of the standard rent fixed under the Rent Act.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : Section 7 of the Rent Act provides that it shall not be lawful for the landlord to claim on account of rent any increase above the standard rent, but it does not prohibit the recovery of the increase to which a landlord may be entitled under the provisions of the Act, in addition to the-standard rent. The definition in s. 5(7) and the language and ss. 10, 10A and 10AA indicate that the Legislature treated the permitted increase as a part of the rent which the landlord would be entitled to receive from the tenant. That is, the building can well said to be reasonably expected to be let from year to year at the figure arrived at by adding the permitted increase to the standard rent. Therefore, in the present case, the valuation had to be arrived at after taking into account the amount of educational cess levied by the appellant, even if it leads to some inconvenience by varying the valuation at frequent intervals.
