 The suits, lands, together with the fruit-bearing trees standing thereon, were demised for a period of 24 years under two documents which specified the kanartham (kanam amount). The documents did not contain any recital that they created security for repayment of a debt nor purported to be transactions for securing debts such as a mortgages, panama or kyyasampanayam. The transferees were entitled to enjoy the lands with the standing trees, plant other fruit-bearing trees thereon, appropriate the income of the lands in lieu of interest on the kanam amounts, and to hold the lands even after the expiry of 24 years until payment of the kanam amounts and the value of trees planted.
 The documents were styled kanan deeds and one of them explicitly stated that the demises were in kanam-kuzhikanam right. Subsequent documents also all recited that the transactions were kanam-kuzhikanam transactions.
 
HELD: The transactions were kanam-kuzhikanam and were not usufructuary mortgages. [316 B-C] A kanan-kuzhikanam and a usufructuary mortgage have many common features. Both of them involve transfer of possession on payment of money by the transferee, set off profits against interest, and retention of possession until repayment of the money. The essential distinction between them is that the kanam-kuzhikanam is a lease, and is, therefore -a transfer of a right to enjoy the property, whereas, a mortgage is a transfer of an interest in the property for securing the repayment of a debt.
