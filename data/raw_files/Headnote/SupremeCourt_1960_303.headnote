 The appellant was an employee of one T, a vendor of edible oils. He was found to have sold adulterated mustard oil and he and T were prosecuted for an offence under S. 7 read with S....16 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954.
 Both were found guilty; T was sentenced to pay a fine of Rs.
 200, but in view of a previous conviction the appellant was sentenced to one year's rigorous imprisonment and RS. 2,000 fine, the minimum prescribed by S. 16(ii). The appellant contended: (i) that a servant who sold food on behalf of his employer was not liable unless it was known that he had done so with the knowledge that the food was adulterated, and (ii) that there were special and adequate reasons justifying the imposition of a penalty less than the minimum prescribed for a second offence.
 Held, that S. 7 of the Act enjoins everyone, whether an employer or a servant, not to sell adulterated food, and anyone who contravenes this provision is punishable under S.
 16 without proof of mens rea.
 325 Re: S. Moses, I. L. R. (1959) Mad. 418, disapproved.
 Held, further, that the facts that the appellant was a mere employee of T, that it had not been shown that he had made any profit for himself, and that T had been sentenced to a fine of RS. 200 only, were special and adequate reasons within the meaning of the proviso to S. 16(ii) to justify the imposition of a penalty less than the minimum prescribed by S. 16(ii).
