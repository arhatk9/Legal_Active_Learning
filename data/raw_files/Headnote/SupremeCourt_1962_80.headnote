 The appellant was a member of the Bombay Bullion Association Ltd. He entered into certain forward transactions with certain other persons. According to the bye-laws of the Association the appellant had to submit a balance sheet and to give kapli (vouchers) for the amounts due from him, but the appellant did not include the amounts due from him in the balance sheet nor did he give the kaplis on the ground that these transactions were fictitious and illegal. On the settlement day the Clearance House committee called upon the appellant to appear before them. Before the Committee the appellant took the stand that they had no jurisdiction to proceed with the matter as he was claiming, arbitration.
 The committee passed a resolution declaring him a defaulters The appellant filed a suit challenging the resolution, inter alia. on the ground that the Committee, after its decision, was bound, under bye-law.155 (4) to give him an Opportunity to give the kaplis before it could declare him a defaulter.
 The bye-law provided:- 542 "If any member does not submit a kapli in the prescribed form in respect of the amount found claimable from him to his party (creditor), the Clearing House committee shall call him and demand an explanation from him and can there after, if such a kapli is not submitted the Clearing House Committee can declare him a defaulter." Held, that the resolution declaring the appellant a defaulter was validly Bye-law declaring (4) provide that if a member did notsubmit a kapli found claimable from him, the Committee shall call him and demand an explanation from him and can thereafter if such kapli is not submitted declare him a defaulter. Under this bye- law first the explanation is called and after if is giver. and some decision is arrived at, the person complained against can file the kapli but no specific period is 'prescribed for doing so nor is the Committee required to call him for this purpose. the period of time depends upon the circumstances in each case. In the present case since the appellant had made it clear before the Committee that he was not going to make the payment, the giving of time was wholly unnecessary.
 It is not a requirement of the bye-law that the clearing House Committee should call the person defaulting by tele- phone or by letter or by giving him notice.
