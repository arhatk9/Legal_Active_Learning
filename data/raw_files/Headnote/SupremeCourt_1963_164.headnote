 The appellant is a manufacturer of aluminium, having two factories one near Asansol and another in Asansol. A dispute having arisen between the appellant and the respondent on the question of bonus for the year 1957-58 it was referred to the Industrial Tribunal by the Government of West Bengal. A similar dispute arose between the appellant and its workmen in the second factory and this also was referred to the same tribunal. In the second dispute the parties submitted joint petitions before the tribunal agreeing to abide by the award on the bonus question in the first dispute and requesting that similar award be made ,in the second dispute also. In the first dispute the Tribunal awarded a bonus equivalent to three months basic wages inclusive of the amount that had already been paid by the company voluntarily. An award was made in the second dispute also in similar terms. In determining the amount of available surplus the Tribunal applied the rules embodied in the Full Bench Formula which was approved by this Court in Associated Cement Co. Ltd. v. Itsworkmen, [1959] S.C.R.
 925, and allowed Rs. 43 lacs as returnon reserve used as working capital and allowed nothing under the head rehabilitation charge. The appellant appealed against both the awards by way of special leave granted by this Court.
 On behalf of the appellant it was contended that there was no justification in rejecting the claim under the head rehabilitation charge. It was urged that the balance sheet of the company would by itself show what part of reserve was used as working capital and a correct way of reaching at the figure of reserve 430 used as working capital would be by deducting liabilities of the company in the balance sheet from as shown therein.
 Held : (i) The burden to prove any prior head of rehabilitation lies on the employer and that unless the employer has by proper evidence established its claim to some amount as rehabilitation charge the claim must be rejected. In the present case the materials on the basis of which the multipliers and devisers have been arrived at have not been established by proper evidence and therefore the tribunal was justified in rejecting the claim under the head rehabilitation charge.
 (ii)Regarding the claim of prior charges under the head "return on reserve used as working capital" the appellant gave widely different estimates and this fact gives some justification in refusing to accept any of these as correct.
 The mere statements in the balance sheet as regards current assets and liabilities cannot be taken as correct. They have to be established by proper evidence by those responsible for preparing the balance sheet or by other competent witnesses. This has not been done in the present case.

 841, Bengal Kagazkal Mazdoor Union v. The Titagarh Paper Mills Co. [1964] 3 S.C.R. 38, referred to.
 (iii)The practice on the part of employers to show the entire amount of reserve available for use as working capital as the actual amount used was wrong.
 (iv)For deciding what part of the available surplus should be paid to the workmen as bonus the wage bill of the workmen only has to be considered and the Tribunal is not concerned with what is paid by the company to its officers.
 The Tribunal has not committed any error in fixing the bonus figures and the appeals arc therefore dismissed.
