 The appellant, a Hindu undivided family, carried on the business of. money-lending and maintained its accounts on cash basis. After the appellant had obtained a decree for the recovery of a loan made to a debtor, the latter obtained an order under the U.P. Encumbered Estates Act 25 of 1934, applying the provisions of the Act to him. The Special Judge, Sultanpur, thereafter passed an order for payment of the principal sum and interest to the appellant. Pursuant to this order the appellant received in 1946 an amount in cash from the debtor and for the balance the State Government gave to the appellant U.P. Encumbered Estates Bonds. While the cash amount received in 1946 was appropriated by the appellant towards the principal due, he split up the amount of the face value of the bonds into two sums and credited one amount in the books of account towards the balance of principal and the other amount to an account styled as "interest accrued". In submitting the return of the taxable income for the assessment year 1948-49, The appellant did not disclose any -receipt of income from interest due on the loans advanced to the debtor and was duly assessed to tax on the income disclosed by him. In October 1948 the appellant sold the bonds and disclosed in the return for the assessment year 1949-'50 as interest received during the year of account the difference between the amount realised by sale of the bonds and the amount due as principal. The Income-tax Officer issued a notice under s. 34(1)(a) of the Income-tax Act, 1922 and brought to tax the amount disclosed by the appellant as escaped income of the previous year relevant to the assessment year 1948-49.
 This order was confirmed by the Appellant Assistant Commissioner as well as by the Tribunal. The High Court, upon a reference, also held in favour of the respondent.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that the accounts maintained by the appellant being, on cash basis until the appellant realised the value of the bonds, no interest was received by him; that when a trader maintains accounts on cash basis, the receipt of money alone can be taken into account in determining the taxable income. It was contended in the alternative that the bonds issued by the Government merely amounted to a fresh promise by an agent of the debtor to pay the amount of the bonds in instalments and by receiving the bonds incorporating such a promise, no money or money's worth was received by the creditor.
 
HELD : Dismissing the appeal; the Encumbered Estates Bonds were by operation of the statute received by the appellant in satisfaction pro tanto of the liability of the debtor.
 They were a fresh security. the liability of the original debtor was substituted by an obligation undertaken 483 by the State : the bonds were convertible in terms of money : income was therefore received by the appellant when the bonds were received.
 Where the accounts are maintained on cash basis receipt of money or money's worth and not accrual of the right to receive is the determining factor. Therefore, if commercial assets are received by a trader maintaining accounts on cash basis in satisfaction of an obligation, income which is embedded in the value of the assets is deemed to be received; the receipt of income is not deferred till the asset is realised in terms of cash or money. It makes no difference whether the receipt of assets is in pursuance of an agreement or that the trader is compelled by law to accept the assets from the debtor. Once title of the trader to an asset received is complete whether by consensual arrangement or by operation of law, he receive-, the income embedded in the value of the asset,.,,.

 Although the Government had the right to recover the amount due tinder the bonds from the land-holder, it did not, on that account, become the agent of the land-holder for payment of his dues. Even if the Government was unable to recover the money from the land-holder, the liability undertaken by it Linder the bond remained unimpaired. [487C- D] Cross (H. M. Inspector of Taxes) v. London and Provincial Trust Ltd. 21 T.C. 705, distinguished.
 What was taxable was only that income which represented the difference between the amount due as principal and the market value of the bonds, it the date of receipt. [488E-F]
