 Dismissing the appeal, this Court, 
HELD: 1. 1. The appellant has been unjustifiably denied his right to be appointed to the post to which he was selected and recommended by the Union Public Service Commission. No reasonable person, on the basis of the material on record can come to the conclusion that the appellant's antecedents and character are such that he Is unfit to be appointed to the post of Senior Public Prosecutor. There has been total lack of application of mind on the part of the respondents. Only on the basis of surmises and conjectures arising out of a single incident 78 which happened in the year 1983 it has been concluded that the appellant is not a desirable person to be appointed to Government service (80-C-D).
 1.2. Ordinarily this court would have directed the respondents to appoint the appellant, but keeping in view the time lapse and the appellant has already entered 50th year of his age and has put in about 23 years of practice as an advocate, it would not be in the interest of justice to issue a direction to that effect (80-F).
