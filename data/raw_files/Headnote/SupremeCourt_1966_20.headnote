 The appellant entered into a contract with the Director- General of Civil Supplies, New Delhi for the supply of axle bodies manufactured by its principals in Belgium. The goods were inspected on behalf of the buyers in Belgium but under the contract they were liable to rejection after further inspection in India. In pursuance of the contract the appellant supplied axle-bodies to the Southern Railway at Perambur and Mysore. The Joint Commercial Tax Officer Madras rejected the contention of the appellant that the sales were in the course of import. He held that the said sales were intra-State sales because the seller was the consignee of the goods and the buyer had reserved the right to reject the goods even after their arrival in India. He made an assessment under the Madras General Sales Tax Act in respect of the supplies at Perambur and another assessment under the Central Sales Tax Act in respect of the supplies at Mysore. The appellant filed appeals against the assessments but the Appellant Assistant Commissioner rejected them. The Tribunal held that part of the goods were sold in the course of import. Against the Tribunal's orders both parties filed two revisions each in the High Court. The High Court allowed the petitions filed by the State and rejected those filed by the assessee. It held that "before a sale can be said to have occasioned the impart it is necessary that the sale should have preceded the import" and as the sale had not taken place at Belgium there was no question of sale occasioning the impart of the goods. The appellant then came to this Court by special leave. On behalf of the respondents two preliminary objections were raised : (1) The appellant had not complied with O.Xlll r. 2 of the Supreme Court Rules, 1950 before coming to this Court; (2) The appellant had filed only two appeals in this Court while the High Court's judgment covered four revision petitions.
 
HELD : (i) The appellant had not filed a petition for certificate before the Madras High Court as required by O.XIII r. 2 because of the view of that High Court that no such petition lay in Revenue matters. Therefore non- compliance with O.XIII r. 2 could be condoned.
 (ii)Two revisions were filed in the High Court by the appellant and two by the State in respect of two assessment orders and they were disposed of by a common judgment. The subject matter of the four revisions were two assessments, one under the Madras General Sales Tax Act and the other under the Central Sales Tax Act. The appellant was quite right in filing two appeals before this Court. [356 B-D] (iii)Section 5(2) of the Central Sales Tax Act does not lay down any condition that before a sale could be said to have occasioned import it is 353 necessary that the sale should have preceded the import.
 The High Court wrongly held so. [358 D-E] Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. v. S. R. Sarkar, [1961] 1 S. C.
 R. 379, relied on.

 (iv)In the present case it was quite clear from the contract that it was incidental to the contract that the axle-box bodies would be manufactured in Belgium, inspected there, and imported into India for the consignee. Movement of goods from Belgium to India was in pursuance of the conditions of the contract between the assessee and the Director-General of Supplies. There was no possibility of those goods being diverted by the assessee for any other purpose. Consequently the sales took place in the course of import of goods within s. 5(2) of the Act and were therefore exempt from taxation. [358 F]
