 The first respondent company manufactures trailers ant water tankers at its factory at Pimpri in the District of Poone. Pursuant to the acceptance of the tenders submitted to the Defence Department of the Union of India, the first respondent sold different quantities of 100 C.W.D. ant 10 C.W.D. trailers and two-wheeled water tankers. Under the terms of the contract, the ownership passed to the Government of India on inspection of the goods at the first respondent's factory premises at Pimpri and appropriation thereof to the contract consequent on approval of the goods but delivery was to be effected by the company free of charge within the cantonment limits of Dehu Road.
 The first appellant Board claimed from the respondent company payment of octroi-duty aggregating Rs.3,37,628-08 on the trailers/water tankers so supplied to the Defence Department. In the appeal preferred by the first respondent under section 84 of the Cantonment Boards' Act, the District Magistrate held that the trailers/water tankers supplied did not fall within the scope of any of the items enumerated in the First Schedule to the Notification No. SRO 318 Dt.
 29.10.59 and therefore the levy of octroi-duty was illegal.
 The appellants preferred a batch of Writ Petitions before the High Court which were dismissed upholding the Magistrate's judgment. Hence the appeal by certificate granted by the Bombay High Court under Article 133(1)(a) ant (c) of the Constitution.
 962 Dismissing the appeals, the Court, ^ 
 HELD 1.1 None of the items 3, ll, 14 and 16(b) of the First Schedule to the Notification No SRO 318 dt 29 .10.59 will take within its scope the trailers/water tankers in respect of which the notices of demand of octroi-duty were issued to the first respondent company. The imposition and demand of the octroi duty in relation to them was wholly unwarranted. Entry No.3 read as a whole contains clear indication of the nature and type of the articles intended to be comprehended by the description "All articles of Galvanised, Iron or steel". Entries 11 and 14 deal with "machinery" and "machines" and the trailers/water tankers by themselves cannot be regarded as "machinery" or "machines" Under Entry 16(b), they cannot be regarded as "accessories" of conveyance either. [965 E; 966 C-G] 
 1.2 Even if it is assumed that any of the entries in the First Schedule to the Notification did cover the trailers/ water tankers, the levy of octroi duty in respect of them would still be illegal in view of clause (vi) of Schedule II to the Notification since no octroi duty shall be levied on "Military Stores" etc. [966 G-H 967 A] 
 1.3 The expression "Military Stores" used in Schedule II is comprehensive enough to cover articles essential for military use inclusive of trailers/water tankers' supplies of which are accumulated in the depot for being drawn upon when ever needed The matter is placed beyond doubt by the significant fact that in the Schedule to the acceptance of tenders Annexure 'A', pursuant to which the trailers/water- tankers were supplied, paragraph 12 which contains "despatch instructions" specifically refers to the trailers/water tankers as 'stores'. Further, as per the tender terms the trailers/water tankers supplied to the Defence Department of the Government of India, had become the property of the Defence Department even prior to their entry into the Dehu Road cantonment Board The requirement regarding certification by the Superintendent of Police has no application in respect of the "Military Stores".
