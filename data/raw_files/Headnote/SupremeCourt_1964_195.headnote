 The respondent made certain constructions on her land in the city of Jaipur. Those constructions were in variation of the plans approved by the Municipality. As they were completed in spite of an order by the President of the Municipal Board to stop unauthorised constructions, he ordered the matter to be compounded by the respondent paying a fine. No appeal was provided by the Jaipur Municipal Act against such an order, and so, a neighbour, who was affected by the constructions moved the State Government and the latter, acting under the proviso to S. 4(1) of the Rajasthan City Municipal Appeals (Regulation) Act, 1950, set aside the order of the President. The respondent then moved the High Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution and the High Court held that the order of the President was not subject to the revisional jurisdiction of the State Government. The State thereupon, appealed to the Supreme Court.
 HELD : The appeal should be allowed.
 The main purpose of the Act is to create a uniform forum for dealing with municipal appeals, that is, appeals lying under a municipal law to an authority other than a municipal authority, because such appeals, when provided for, lay to different authorities in different cities of the State of Rajasthan. Under s. 3 of the Act the appeal, if provided for, was to be disposed of by the Commissioner. The order of the Commissioner and the order of a municipal authority, where no appeal was provided for a.-, in the instant case, would be final subject to revision by the State Government under the proviso to s. 4(1) of the Act. It would not be proper, when the words of the statute are clear, to take the preamble and the long title into consideration and come to the conclusion that it could not have been intended to permit the Government to interfere in municipal affairs, especially when such an interpretation has the effect of omitting or deleting the words "order passed by a Municipal authority" in the proviso, when they have a meaning and significance in their normal connotation.
