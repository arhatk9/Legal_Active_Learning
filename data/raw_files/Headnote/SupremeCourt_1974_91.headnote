 Chapter VA was introduced in the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, 1888, by Maharashtra Act 14 of 1961. It consists of ss. 105A to 105H. Section 105A (d) defines unauthorised occupation. Under 9. 105B (p) the Commissioner, by notice served on the person in unauthorised occupation could order him to vacate within one mouth of the date of service of the notice. on any of the grounds mentioned in Clauses (a), (b) and (c) of that sub-section.
 Under sub-s. (2), before making such an order, the Commissioner a ball issue a notice to the persons concerned specifying the grounds on which the order of eviction is proposed to be made and to show cause against the proposed order of eviction. The person concerned can file a written statement, produce documents and is entitled to appear before the Commissioner by a lawyer. If, after hearing the person concerned the Commissioner is satisfied that the case falls under clauses (a). (b) or (c) of sub-@. (1) he issues a notice of eviction, and, if the person so ordered to vacate fails to comply with the order be, as well as any other person who obstructs eviction, can be evicted by force under sub-s. (3). Under sub-s. (6) the Commissioner may. in certain cases, in lieu of evicting the person cancel the order under sub-s. (1) and such person may continue in occupation. Under s. 105E the Commissioner, for the purpose of holding any inquiry under the Act. has the same powers as are vested in a civil court under the C.P.C. in respect of.
 (i) summoning and enforcing the attendance of any person and examining him on oath, (ii) requiring the discovery and production of documents. and (iii any other matter which may be prescribed by regulations under s.105H. Under s. 105F every order of eviction is appealable to the Principal Judge of the City Civil Court of Bombay or such other judicial officer of not less than 10 years standing as the Principal Judge may designate. The appellate Judge is given power to stay the enforcement of the order of Commissioner on conditions and is required to dispose of the appeal expeditiously. Section 105G provides that, subject to the result of the appeal, every order of the Commissioner or of the appellate Judge is final. Under s. 105H regulations may be made. inter alia, in respect of holding of inquiries and the procedure to be followed in appeals.
 The Bombay Government Premises (Eviction) Act, 1955, also lays down special procedure for eviction of persons from government premises which is more or less similar to Chapter V of the Municipal Act. The power to order the eviction is given to an authority not lower in rank than a Deputy Collector or an Executive Engineer Section 8A of the Act provides that no civil court shalt have jurisdiction to entertain any suit or proceedings in respect of eviction.
 There is no such provision in the Municipal Act but the proceedings in the instant cases arose before s. 8A was introduced in the 1955-Act by Maharashtra Act of 1969.
 The constitutional validity of Chapter VA of the Municipal Act and the provisions of the Government Premises (Eviction) Act. as it stood prior to its amendment by Maharashtra Act of 1969, was challenged on the Sound that they contravene Art. 14 on the basis of the decision of this Court in Northern India Caterers [1967] INSC 88; [1967] 3 S.C.R. 399, wherein it was held, by the majority of Judges that amongst occupants of public premises inter se there was discrimination in as much as the special procedure in the Punjab Public Premises and Land 2 (Eviction and Rent Recovery) Act, 1959, was more drastic and prejudicial than the ordinary procedure of a civil suit and that it was left to the arbitrary and unfettered discretion of the Government to adopt such special procedure against some and not against the others.
 
HELD (By Full Court) : The impugned provisions of the two Acts are not violative of Art. 14.
 (Per A. N. Ray. C.J., Palekar, Mathew and Alagiriswami, JJ.) (1) It could not be contended that the special provisions of law applying to government and public bodies are not based upon reasonable classification or that they offend Art. 14. [10 F-G] (2) The mere availability of two procedures will not vitiate one of them, namely, the special procedure. [23 B] Where a statute providing for more drastic procedure different from the ordinary procedure covers the whole field covered by the ordinary procedure as in Anwarali Sarkar's Case [1952] INSC 1; [1952] S.C.R. 284 and Surajmal Mohta's case [1965] 1 S.C.R. 448, without any guidelines as to the class of cases in which either procedure to is be resorted to, the, statute will be hit by Art. 14. But a provision for appeal may cure the defect. Also in such cases, if from the preamble and surrounding circumstances as well as the provisions of the statutes themselves, explained and amplified by affidavits, necessary guidelines could be inferred as in the Saurashtra Case [1952] INSC 11; [1952] S.C.R. 435 and Jyoti Pershads' case [1961] INSC 175; [1962] 2 S.C.R. 125, the statute will not be hit by the Article.
 Where the statute itself covers only a class of cases as in Haldar's case [1959] INSC 158; [1960] 2 S.C.R. 646 and Bajoria's case [1953] INSC 46; [1954] S.C.R. 30 the statute will not be bad. The fact that in such cases executive will choose which cases are to be tried under the special procedure will not affect the validity of the statute. [22 G-23 B] (3) In the present cases, the statutes themselves, in the two classes of cases, that is, premises belonging to the Corporation and the Government, clearly lay down the purpose behind them namely that they should be subject to speedy procedure in the matter of evicting unauthorised persons occupying them. The fact that the legislature considered that the ordinary procedure is insufficient or ineffective for evicting the unauthorised occupants and provided a special speedy procedure therefore, is a clear and sufficient guidance for the authorities on whom the duty of evicting such occupants and the power to do so has been conferred. [23 B-G] (4) Further, it would be extremely unreal to hold that an administrative officer would, in taking proceedings for eviction of unauthorised occupants of government and municipal property, resort to the procedure prescribed in the two Acts in some cases and to the ordinary civil court in others. In considering whether the officers would be discriminating between one set of persons and another, one has to take into account normal human behaviour. It is not every fancied possibility of discrimination but real risk that must be taken into account. Discrimination is not writ large on the face of the statute; it may be possible but highly improbable, and, if there is discrimination in actual practice the power of this Court can be invoked. [Z3 D-G] (5) Moreover, considering the object with which the special procedure has been enacted the procedures laid down by the two Acts are not so harsh or unconscionable as to suggest that a discrimination would result if resort to them is had in some cases and to the ordinary civil court in others.
 Even though the officers deciding the question are administrative officers there is ample provision in the Acts for notice of the grounds of eviction and opportunity to the person affected to file a written statement and produce documents. He can also be represented by a lawyer and the officer himself has power to enforce attendance of witnesses, to examine them on oath, and to order discovery and production of documents. 'There is also provision for appeal to the Principal Judge of the City Civil Court or a District Judge. It may be that a second appeal is not available to the affected person as when procedure before an ordinary civil court is followed, but the aggrieved party may resort to the High Court under either Art. 226 or 227 and this is not less effective than a second appeal.

 (6) The majority of the Court in the Northern India Caterers' case in ignoring the obligatory nature of the notice under s. 4 of the Punjab Act and discretionary power under s. 5 which was to be exercised after hearing the patty, were in error in proceeding on the basis of s. 5 alone and holding that it conferred arbitrary power on the Collector to resort to the power under the Act in the case of some and to a suit in the case of others. Under s. 4, if the Collector is of opinion that a person is in unauthorised occupation and has to be evicted he shall issue a notice to him to. show cause why an order of eviction should not be passed. But after considering the cause shown, evidence produced and after giving the person a reasonable opportunity of being heard the Collector may order eviction.
 Therefore, if he is of opinion that it is a case where a suit is more appropriate he may not order eviction, and then, it would be for the Government to institute the suit.
 The Collector has no discretion either to file a suit or to take proceedings under the Act. Nor can the Government order the Collector to pass an order of eviction in every case under s. 5 as the power under that section is the Collectors' statutory power. [23 H-24 D] Northern India Caterers Ltd. v.. Punjab [1967] INSC 88; [1967] 3 S.C.R. 399, overruled.
 (Per Khanna J) :(1) The simple fact that there are two forums with different procedures would not justify the quashing of the impugned provisions is being violative of Art. 14 especially when both procedures are fair and in con- sonance with the principles of natural justice. What is necessary to attract the inhibition of the Article is that there must be substantial and qualitative differences between the two procedures so that one is really and substantially more drastic and prejudicial than the other.
 A dogmatic and finical approach inapplying the Article should be avoided.[26 C-D] The impugned provisions provided for the giving of notice to the party affected; he has to be informed of the grounds on which the order for eviction is proposed to be made; he has to be afforded an opportunity to file a written statement and produce documents; and he can be represented by lawyers. The provision-, of the C.P.C. regarding summoning and enforcing attendance of persons and examining them on oath as also those relating to discovery and production of documents which are made applicable, provide a valuable safeguard. The aggrieved party has a right of appeal and the appeal lies not to an administrative officer but to a judicial officer of the status of a Principal Judge of the City Civil Court or a District Judge. If the appellate officer concerned acts beyond his jurisdiction his order would be liable to be assailed under Arts. 226 and 227 of the Constitution. Therefore, the procedure envisaged in the impugned provisions is not so onerous and drastic as would justify an inference of discrimination. [25 H-26 C] (2) It would thus appear that some of the infirmities from which the Punjab Act, which was struck down in the Northern India Caterer's Case 11967] 3 S.C.R. 399, suffered, are not present in the impugned enactments. Hence there are no sufficient grounds for overruling the view expressed by the majority in the Northern India Caterers Case. [25 D, 29E-F] This Court may, no doubt, in appropriate cases overrule the view previously taken by it but that should only be for compelling reasons. Necessity may sometimes be felt of ridding stare decision of its petrifying rigidity. Some new aspects may come to light and it may become essential to cover fresh grounds to meet the new situations or to overcome difficulties which did not manifest themselves or were not taken into account when the earlier view was propounded. Law. if it has to satisfy human needs and to meet the problems of life, must adapt it.;elf to cove with new situations. It has to be recognised that there is a continuous process of growth of law and one can retard it only at the risk of alienating law from life itself. There should not be much hesitation to abandon an untenable position when the rule to be discarded was, in its origin, the product 4 of institutions or conditions which have gained a new significance or development with the progress of years. It sometimes happen that the rule of law which grew up in remote generations may, in the fulness of experience, be found to serve another generation badly. The Court cannot allow itself to be tied down and become captive of a view which, in the light of the subsequent experience, has been found to be patently erroneous, manifestly unreasonable or to cause hardship or to result in plain iniquity or public inconvenience. [27 B-G] In Bengal Immunity Co. Ltd. v. State of Bihar, [1955] 2 S.C.R. 603 although this Court affirmed its power to overrule and depart from the view expressed in its previous judgments, it also stressed the importance of not lightly dissenting from previous pronouncements of this Court. A view which has been accepted for a long period of time should not be disturbed unless the court can say positively that it was wrong, or unreasonable, or that it was productive of public hardship or inconvenience. It has to be borne in mind that certainty and continuity are essential ingredients of rule of law, and certainty in law would be considerably eroded and suffer a serious set back if the highest court of the land readily overrules the view expressed by it in earlier cases even though that view has held the field for a number of years. In many cases which come up before this Court two views are possible and simply because the Court considers that the view not taken by the Court in an earlier case was a better view would not justify the overruling of the view taken in the earlier case. The law laid down by this Court is binding upon all courts in the country under Art. 141 and numerous cases all over the country are decided in accordance with the view taken by this Court. Many people arrange their affairs and large number of transactions also take place on the, faith of the correctness of the view taken by this Court. It would create uncertainty, instability and confusion if such a view is held to be not the correct law. [26 F-27 B; 28 E-G, 27 E- F] The Court has thus to keep the balance between the need of certainty and continuity and the desirability of growth and development of law. On the one band the need is to ensure that the judicial inventiveness shall not be desiccated or stunted and on the other it is essential to curb the temptation to lay down new and novel principles in substitution of well-established principles in the ordinary run of cases and the readiness to canonize the new principles too quickly before their saintliness has been affirmed by the passage of time. [27 F-H] It may be that the view expressed by the minority in the Northern India Caterers case appears to be preferable but that by itself would not show that a decision arrived at by the majority was plainly erroneous requiring to be over- ruled. It also cannot be said that the decision had given rise to public inconvenience and hardship. The legislature, in view of the majority decision in the case made necessary amendments in many of the enactments so as to bar the jurisdiction of the civil court in matters dealt with by those enactments, and no constitutional amendment was required to set right the difficulty experienced as a result of the majority decision. [29 F-H] (Per Bhagwati and krishna Iyer, JJ) . (1) It is not uncommon to find legislation according special treatment to Government or other public bodies, and such legislation has been upheld by this Court in numerous decided cases. But from that it does not follow that every law which gives differential treatment to government or other public bodies is necessarily immune from challenge on the ground of discrimination. To get out of the reach of the equality clause in Art. 14 it must appear that not only a classification has been made but also that it is one based on some real distinction bearing a just and reasonable relation to the object of the legislation and is not a mere arbitrary selection. [34 C-D, G-H, 3 5 A-B] In the present case, the speedy machinery for eviction of unauthorised occupants of public premises is justified in that it is in the interest of public that speedy and expeditious recovery of such premises from unauthorised occupiers is made possible through the instrumentality of a speedier procedure instead of the elaborate procedure by way of civil suit involving both expense and delay. There is thus a valid basis of differentiation and the constitutional validity of the impugned provisions in the two statutes cannot, in the circumstances, be assailed on the ground that they make unjust discrimination between occupiers of government or municipal premises and occupiers of other premises. [35 G36 C] 5 (2) Unlike the decision in Arizona Copper Co. v. Hammer [1919] USSC 189; (63 Law. Ed. 1058; 250 U.S. 400) which was concerned with a party having several rights to relief arising out of the same act, the present case is concerned with the existence of several remedies in enforcement of a single right to relief. The only right which is sought to be enforced by the Municipal Corporation and the Government is a right based on title given by the general law of the land and it is for the enforcement of this right that two alternative procedures are available to the Municipal Corporation or the Government. Therefore, it could not be urged by the res- pondents, on the basis of the Hammer case, that the constitutional guarantee under Art. 14 is not violated where the law gives a free choice of remedies to a person entitled to relief even if one remedy is more drastic and prejudicial than the other. If for determination and enforcement of a liability two alternative procedures are available, one more drastic and prejudicial than the other and no guiding policy or principle is laid down by the legislature as to when one or the other procedure shall be followed, so that, either procedure may be indiscriminately adopted against persons similarly situated, the law providing for the more drastic and prejudicial procedure would be violative of the equal protection clause.

 (3) The initiation of the special procedure provided in Chapter VA at the Municipal Act is with the Municipal Commissioner as he is to issue a notice under s. 105- B(3)but, so far as the ordinary procedure of a civil suit is concerned, it can only be filed by the Municipal Corporation with the previous approval of the Standing Committee. It could not however be contended, on this basis that the choice between the two alternative procedures is not vested in the same authority and that therefore there is no violation of Art. 14. [45 E-G] it is not necessary in order to incur the condemnation of the equality clause that the initiation of both procedures should be left to the arbitrary discretion of one and the same authority. What the equality clause strikes at is discrimination howsoever it results. To the person subjected to the more drastic and onerous procedure it is immaterial whether such procedure is put into operation by one or the other agency of the government or the public authority. It would be nothing short of hypertechnicality to say that action against him is not initiated by the Municipal Commissioner or the Collector. The constitutionality of a statutory provision cannot turn on mere difference of the hands that harm, though both belong to the Government or the Corporation for otherwise, it would be easy to circumvent the guarantee of equality and to rob it of its substance by a subtle and well manipulated statutory provision vesting the more. drastic and prejudicial procedure in a different organ of the government or public authority than the one in whose hands lies the power to initiate the ordinary procedure. One must look at the substance and not the form. [46 A-H] (4) Moreover, it is not correct to say that it is the Municipal Commissioner who initiates the special procedure set out in Chapter VA of the Municipal Act. When he issues notice under s. 105B (2) against an occupant he really acts on behalf of and for the benefit of the Municipal Corporation, whose right he seeks to enforce. Similarly the Dy. Collector or Executive Engineer acts on behalf of the Government Therefore, it is really the Municipal Corporation and the Government that avail themselves of the special procedure. [47 B-D] (5) It could not also be contended on behalf IS the respondents that even where two procedures are available against a person, one substantially more drastic and prejudicial than the other and there is no guiding principle or policy laid down by the legislature as to when one or the other shall be adopted. there would still be no violation of the equality clause if both procedures are fair. Such a contention may be relevant where the question is as regards a reasonableness of the restriction under Art. 19, But when the question is under Art. 14, mere fairness of the special procedure which is impugned as discriminatory is 6 not enough to take it out of its inhibition. What has to be considered is Whether there is equality before law; and therefore the question whether the two procedures are so disparate substantially and qualitatively as to lead to unequal treatment, has to be asked and answered. [47 E-48 C] (6) The challenge against the constitutional validity of Chapter V-A of tile Municipal Act and Government Premises Eviction Act must, however, be rejected. [53 G-H] No classification can be logically complete or precise.
 Life is not capable of being divided into water-tight divisions and categories. The legislature can therefore do not more than define broad categories and indicate the policy and purpose underlying the legislation and leave it to a stated authority to make selective application of the law in accordance with such policy and purpose. it is inevitable that when a special procedure is being prescribed for a defined class of persons such as occupiers of municipal or government premises, discretion-of course guided and controlled by the underlying policy and purpose of the legislature-must necessarily be left in the administrative authority to select occupiers of municipal or government premises to be brought within the operation of the special procedure. That would not be obnoxious to Art.
 14 because, in such a case, the discretion to make the selection would be a guided and controlled discretion and not an absolute and unfettered one. In such cases, the power given to the executive body would import a duty on it to classify the subject-matter of legislation in accordance with the objective indicated in the statute. The discretion has to be exercised in conformity with the policy to effectuate which the direction is given and it is in relation to that objective that the propriety of the classification would have to be tested. it is, therefore, not correct to say that merely because the Municipal Corporation or Government is not compellable to adopt the special procedure set out in the impugned provisions against all occupiers of municipal or government premises, but is vested with the discretion in the matter, the impugned provisions offend against Art. 14. It would indeed to be odd and certainly harsh and oppressive to the occupiers of municipal or government premises if the Municipal Corporation or Municipal Commissioner or Government were to be compelled to adopt the special procedure in all cases.
 The nature of the dispute, the complexity of the issue arising for consideration and the legal competence of the adjudicating authority to decide such questions will have to be weighed alongside with the need for speedy and expeditious recovery of municipal or government premises for public uses which is the basic policy and purpose underlying the legislation, and, the Municipal Corporation or Municipal Commissioner or Government would have to decide in accordance with the guidance furnished by these con- siderations, whether, in a given case, the special procedure should be adopted or the occupier of the municipal or government premises should be proceeded against under the ordinary procedure. There is thus clear guidance provided by the legislature as to when the special procedure should be adopted and when the case should be, left to be dealt with under the ordinary procedure and the impugned provisions do not suffer from the vice of discrimination.

 (7) It must also be constantly borne in mind, for otherwise it is likely to distort the proper perspective of Art. 14, that mere minor differences between the two procedures would not be enough to invoke the inhibition of the equality clause. What the equality clause is intended to strike at are real and substantial disparities, substantive or processor, and arbitrary or capricious actions of the executive, and, it would be contrary to the object and intendment of the equality clause to exalt delicate distinctions, shades of harshness and theoretical possi- bilities of, prejudice into legislative inequality or executive discrimination. (54 B-D] There is no formula by which it can be said that one procedure is substantially more drastic and onerous than the other. It does not follow that 7 merely because one procedure provides the forum of a civil court while the other provides the forum of an administrative tribunal that the latter is necessarily more drastic and onerous than the former. It is well known that a regular suit in the civil court has a long drawn out, expensive and escalating litigative system which often spells ruin to the ordinary man, and consequently, by contrast, a prompt and inexpensive instrument, though manned by administrative personnel untrained in the sophisticated court methodology and unaided by long and intricate arguments of counsel engaged on onerous terms, may be preferred by many in this country. The procedure of the civil court also suffers from many technicalities. It functions on the basis of adversary system of administration of justice which may bring about inequality where the opposing adversaries are not evenly balanced. It is quite possible that in certain types of cases people may receive better justice where judicial formalism is kept out and the procedure is made informal. The many-tiered system of appeals built into the judicial pyramid often results in a pyrrhic victory and leads to disenchantment with the end product of delayed justice. Therefore, whenever a special machinery is devised by the legislature entrusting the power of determination of disputes to another authority set up by the legislature in substitution of courts of law one should not react adversely against the establishment of such an authority merely because of a certain predilection for the prevailing system of administration of justice by courts of law. [54-155 G] In the present case, it is apparent that the special procedure set out in Chapter V-A of the Municipal Act is not substantially more drastic and prejudicial than the ordinary procedure of civil suit. The initial authority to determine the liability to eviction is no doubt the Municipal Commissioner who is the Chief Executive Officer of the Municipal Corporation and who may not be possessed of any legal training but s. 68 of the Municipal Act provides that this function may be discharged by any Municipal Officer whom the Municipal Commissioner may generally or specially empower and the Municipal Commissioner can authorise a Deputy Municipal Commissioner attached to the legal department of the Municipal Corporation to discharge this function. The determination of liability to eviction is therefore really, in practice, made by an officer having proper and adequate legal training. Then again, the occupant against whom the special procedure is set in motion would have a right to file his written statement and produce documents and he would also be entitled to examine and cross-examine- witnesses. The officer holding the inquiry is given the power to summon and enforce the attendance of witnesses, examinethem on oath and also require the discovery and production of documents.The occupant is entitled to appear at the inquiry by an Advocate. Thus, in effect and substance the same procedure which is followed in a civil court ismade available in the proceeding before the officer holding the inquiry. There is also a right of appeal against the decision of such officer to a senior and highly experienced judicial officer and not to a mere executive authority, namely, the Principal Judge of the City Civil Court or any other judicial officer of not less than 10 years standing. It is also open to the aggrieved party to bring up the matter before the High Court for examination under Art. 226 and 2227 even though a revision application against the appellate order is not provided for. The ultimate decision is, thus, by a judicial officer trained in the art and skill of law and not by an executive officer.
