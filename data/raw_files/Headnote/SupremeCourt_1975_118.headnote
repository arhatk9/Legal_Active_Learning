 Consequent upon the declaration of the invalidity of the Assam Taxation (in goods carried by Road or on Inland Waterways) Act, 1954, by the Supreme Court in Atiabari Tea Co. Ltd. v. The State of Assam and Ors. [1961] 1 S.C.R. 806, on the ground that prior sanction of the President was not taken, the Assam Legislature passed on April 6, 1961, the Assam Taxation (on goods carried by Road or on Inland Waterways) Act, 1961. This Act was to remain in force with retrospective effect from 24 April, 1954, upto 1 March, 1962. The respondents challenged the validity of the Act before the High Court of Assam in writ petitions and they applied for injunction restraining the appellants from taking any proceedings under the Act. Interim orders of injunction were passed on various dates. The appellants opposed the interim orders of injunction. A common order was passed by the Court on 18-9-1961 making the orders absolute and restraining the appellants from taking any proceedings under the Act, The order staving proceedings continued till the new Act was held ultra vires the Constitution by the High Court. On August 1, 1963, he High Court held the new Act to be ultra vires. On the same day the High Court granted certificate of fitness to appeal to this Court. On December 13, 1963, this Court in Khyeberi Tea Co. Ltd. & Anr v. The State of Assam, [1963] INSC 250; [1964] 5 S.C.R. 975, held the Act of 1961 to be valid. On the strength of the certificate granted by the High Court, the State of Assam filed an appeal in this Court on March 4, 1964. On October 28, 1964, this Court granted interim stay of the operation of the judgment of the High Court. On January 29, 1965, the interim stay granted by this Court was made absolute. On April 1, 1968, this Court accepted the appeals filed by the State.
 The first sub-section of section 7 requires every producer and dealer to furnish returns of manufactured tea carried in tea containers and jute carried in bales in such forms and to such authority as may be prescribed. The second sub- section states that in case of any producer or dealer who, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is liable to pay tax for any return period' or a part thereof, the Commissioner may serve within two years of the expiry of the aforesaid period, a notice in the prescribed form requiring him to furnish a return of goods carried and such producer or dealer shall thereupon furnish the return within the date and to the authority mentioned in the notice. Sub-section (2) of section 9 states that if the Commissioner is not satisfied that a return furnished under section 7 is correct and complete he shall serve on the producer or dealer a notice requiring him, on the date and hour and place mentioned therein, either to attend in person or to produce or cause to be produced any evidence on which he may rely in support of his return. Sub-section (4) states that if a producer or dealer fails to make a return as required by section 7 or having made the return, fails to comply with the terms of the notice issued under sub-section (2) of s.
 9, the Commissioner shall, by an order in writing, assess to the best of his judgment the producer or dealer and determine the tax payable by him on the basis of such assessment. It is provided that before making assessment the commissioner may allow the producer or dealer such 366 further time as he thinks fit to make the return or to comply with the terms of he notice issued under sub-section (2) of section 9.
 It is only after the State obtained interim order from this Court that notices were issued by the Superintendent of Taxes to the respondents for filing the returns for the- quarters mentioned in the writ petitions. The respondents- assessees challenged these demand notices in the High Court on the ground that the notices were illegal and beyond the jurisdiction of the State. The broad contention of the assessees was that the State could issue notices within two years from the expiry of the return period and none of the notices was within the time mentioned in the New Act, and therefore, the State had no jurisdiction to issue the notices. The State, on the other hand, contended that from 10 August, 1961 to 1 August, 1963 there was an order of the High Court staying all proceedings, and, therefore, it was not possible to issue any notice until the State was permitted by orders of this Court to commence proceedings.
 The High Court accepted the contention of the assessees.
 The High Court held that the notices were barred by limitation in terms of the provisions contained in s. 7(2) of the New Act. Each of the challenged notices was much beyond the date of expiry of two years from the date when return should have been filed. These appeals have been filed after obtaining special leave from this Court.
 Dismissing the appeals, HELD : Per A. N. Ray, C. J. and Y. V. Chandrachud, J.
 (i) The State cannot contend that it was impossible, to issue any notice within the period mentioned in s. 7(2) of the New Act. The State did not endeavor to obtain appropriate orders to surmount the difficulties by reason of the injunction against taking steps within the time contemplated in S. 7(2) of the New Act. The State is guilty of default. The State had remedies open to take steps by asking for modification of the order. The State had to assert the right that the State was entitled to demand taxes and the respondent was liable to pay the same. The State followed the policy of inactivity. Inactivity is not impossibility. The order of injunction is not to be equated with an act of God or an action of. the enemy of the State or a general strike. [374 B-D] (ii) If a return under s. 7(1) is not made, the service of a notice under s. 7(2) of the Act is the only method for initiation of valid assessment proceedings under the Act.
 The period of two years under s. 7(2) of the New Act is a fetter on the power of the authority and is not just a bar of time. No assessment can be legally made under s. 9(4) of the New Act without service of a notice under s. 7(2) of the New Act within two years in case where the assessee has not submitted any return under s. 7(1) of the New Act. [375-AB] The words "if a producer or dealer fails to make a return as required by s. 7" occurring in s. 9 of the New Act make it clear that s. 9 can come into operation only when there is a failure to Comply with the requirements of s. 7 and not the requirements only under sub-s. (1). Reference can be made to s. 11 of the New Act. Section 11 deals with escaped assessment. There is a time limit for initiating an escaped assessment under s. 11 of the New Act. The time limit is two years from the end of the return period. It is the scheme of the Act that the service of notice within two years of the return period is an imperative requirement for initiation of assessment proceeding as also reassessment proceeding under the Act. [375-CD] State of Assam & Anr. v. D. C. Chouadhuri & Ors., [1969] INSC 168; [1970] 1 S.C.R. 780, discussed.
 (iii) In the present case, the respondent cannot be said to have waived the provisions of the statute. There cannot be any waiver of a statutory requirement or provision which goes to the jurisdiction of assessment. The 367 origin of the assessment is either an assessee filing a return as contemplated in the Act or an assessee being called upon to file a return as contemplated in the Act.
 The respondents challenged the Act. The order of injunction does not amount to a waiver of the statutory provisions.
 The issue of a notice under the provisions of the Act relates to the exercise of jurisdiction under the Act in all cases. [378 D-F] The respondents were entitled to impeach the statute under which they were made liable. The, respondents have done no wrong. The respondents are not taking any advantage of any act of theirs. The State was entitled to resist the respondents. The State did so by contending that the Act was valid, but the State took no steps during the pendency of the litigation to take directions from the Court to serve notices of demand upon the respondents to keep alive the right of the appellants.

 Per- M. H. Beg J, (Concurring) The waiver, even where both sides have agreed to waive the operation of a statutory provision, cannot extend to a case in which the effect may be either to oust the jurisdiction conferred by statute or to confer a jurisdiction, which according to the statute is not there. In other words, if a notice under s. 7(2) of the Act is a condition precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction to make the best judgment assessment, it cannot be said that the doctrine of waiver will confer jurisdiction so as to enable parties to avoid the effect of violating a mandatory provision on a jurisdictional matter even by agreement. On the language of s. 11 of the Act, it is evident that in every case where tea or jute chargeable to tax escaped assessment for any period or has been under-asmssed the Commissioner must take action within two years of the ,expiry of the return period. It is this part of the Act which win operate as a bar to the jurisdiction of the Commissioner to tax any escaped assessment beyond two years of the return period. Therefore quite apart from the question whether on the mere language of s. 7(2) and s. 9(4), a failure to issue a notice under s.
 7(2) of the Act within the period constitutes a bar to proceedings under s. 9(4) of the Act, it cannot be said that a failure to issue such notice would not become a bar due to the clear provisions of s. 1 1 of the Act. This bar, at any rate, is against the exercise of jurisdiction to assess beyond the prescribed period. [389 E-F,392 E-G] Cape Brandy Syndicate v.I.R.C. [1921] 1 K.B. 66, 71 and State of Assam Anr. v.

 (Per K. K. Mathew and H. R. Khana, JJ. dissenting.) (i) The respondents obtained the orders of injunction from the Court which the Court would not have issued, had the Court known at the time that the Act was intra vires the powers of the legislature as it ultimately turned out to be by the decision of this Court. The Court issued orders of injunction on the has is of its view that the respondents has a prima facie case; but when ultimately this Court declared that the Act was valid, justice requires that the respondents should not be allowed to set up the contention that they were entitled to get the notices within the period during which the judgment of the High Court declaring the Act ultra vires remained in operation. In other words, the respondents, after having successfully prevented the Commissioner from issuing notices by virtue of the orders of injunction obtained by them from the High Court, should not be heard to say that they were entitled to notices as they themselves made it impossible for the Commissioner to issue the notices within the period by obtaining the orders of injunction. [382 G-H] (ii) Even assuming that the provision for issue of notice within the period specified in s. 7(2) was mandatory and was a condition precedent for the 368 liability to file the returns, the respondents could have waived the benefit of it and, in fact, they did waive it by their conduct. That apart, the principle of restitution requires that the party prejudiced by a wrong order of the Court should be put in the position which he or it would have occupied had the wrong order not been passed. [383-H] (iii) It was the orders of injunction and the order declaring the Act as ultra vires which made it impossible for the Commissioner to issue the notices within the period specified in s. 7(2).The respondents were bound to file the returns even though the notices were not issued to them within the period specified in s. 7(2). The liability to file the return was created by s. 7(1) and as the requirement of notice within the period specified in s. 7(2) could not have been insisted upon by the respondents, the authority empowered to make the assessment under s. 9(4) was competent to do so.
