 Delhi Cloth Mills Ltd., a public limited company having its registered in Delhi runs an enterprise called Shriram Foods and Fertilizer Industries, which has several units engaged in the manufacture of caustic soda, chlorine, hydrochloric acid, stable bleaching powder, superphosphate, vanaspati, soap, sulphuric acid, alum anhydrous sodium sulphate, high test hypochlorite and active earth. These various units are all set up in a single complex situated in approximately 76 acrea and they are surrounded by thickly populated colonies such as Punjabi Bagh, West Patel Nagar, Karampura, Ashok Vihar, Trinagar, Shastri Nagar and within a radius of 3 kilometres from this complex there is a population of approximately 200,000. The caustic chlorine plant was commissioned in the year 1949 and it has a strength of about 263 employees' including executives, supervisors, staff and workers.
 In the wake of the Bhopal gas tragedy realising the hazardous character of caustic chlorine plant of Shriram, the Labour Ministry of the Government of India commissioned "Technica", a firm of consultants, Scientists and Engineers of the United Kindgom who set out the areas of concern and potential problems, in their Report. Thereafter, the Delhi Administration constituted an Expert Committee under the Chairmanship of Mr. Manmohan Singh. This Committee made 313 various recommendations in regard to safety and pollution control measures with a view to minimising hazard to the workmen and the public.
 On December 4, 1985, a major leakage of oleum gas took place from one of the units of Shri Ram and this leakage affected a large number of persons, both amongst the workmen and the public and an Advocate practising in the Tis Hazari Court died on account of inhalation of oleum gas. This leakage resulted from the bursting of the tank containing oleum gas as a result of the collapse of the structure on which it was mounted and it created a scare amongst the people residing in that area. Hardly had the people got out of the shock of this disaster, when within two days, another leakage, though this time a minor one took place as a result of escape of oleum gas from the joints of a pipe. The immediate response of the Delhi Administration to these two leakages was the making of an order dated 6th December '85 by the District Magistrate Delhi, under sub-section (1) of section 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, directing and requiring Shriram within two days from the date of issue of the order to cease carrying on the occupation of manufacturing and processing hazardous and lethal chemicals and gases including chlorine, oleum, superchlorine, phosphate etc. at their establishment in Delhi and within 7 days to remove such chemicals and gases from the said place and not again to keep or store them at the same place or to appear on 17th December 85 in the Court of District Magistrate, Delhi to show cause why the order should not be enforced. In the meantime, the "Agarwal Committee" appointed by the Supreme Court visited the caustic chlorine plant and submitted a Report in which it pointed out various inadequacies in the pland and expressed the opinion that it was not possible to eliminate hazard to the public so long as the plant remained at the present location.
 Since there were conflicting opinions put forward in regard to the question whether the caustic chlorine plant should be allowed to be restarted without any real hazard or risk to the workmen and the public at large, another Expert Committee called "Nilay Choudhary Committee" was constituted by the Supreme Court, by its order dated 18th December 85.
 This Committee visited the caustic chlorine plant on December 28, 1985 and after considering Dr. Slater, Manmohan Singh Committee, Agarwal Committee and after hearing the parties 314 made a report setting out 14 recommendations which in its opinion were required to be complied with by the management in order to minimise the hazards due to possible chlorine leak. The Committee also pointed out that it was in agreement with the recommendations made in the Report of the Manmohan Singh Committee which were exhaustive in nature and obviously the recommendations made by it in its Report were supplementary recommendation in addition to those contained in Manmohan Singh Committee's Report.
 In addition to these Committees, the Lt. Governor of Delhi also appointed an Expert Committee called the "Seturaman Committee" which submitted its Report on 3rd January, 1986.
 While these proceedings were going on before the Court, an order dated 7th December 85 was issued by the Inspector of Factories, Delhi in exercise of the power conferred under section 40, sub-section (2) of the Factories Act, 1948, prohibiting Shriram from using caustic chlorine and sulphuric acid plants till adequate safety measures are adopted and imminent danger to human life is eliminated.
 Soon thereafter, on December 13, 1985 a show cause notice was issued by the Assistant Commissioner (Factories) of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, calling upon Shriram to show cause as to why action for revocation of its licence should not be taken under section 430, sub-section (3) of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 for violation of the terms and conditions of the licence. Shriram showed cause, by its letter dated 23rd December' 85, against the proposed cancellation of its licence but by an order dated 24th December' 85, the Assistant Commissioner (Factories) directed Shriram to stop industrial use of the premises at which the chlorine caustic plant is located. The result is that unless these two orders - one dated 7th December 1985 and the other dated 24th December 1985 - are vacated or suspended, Shriram cannot restart the caustic chlorine plant. Hence the Shriram's Writ Petition challenging the said two orders.
 Suspending the operation of the two orders ad-interim to enable Shriram to restart the plants for manufacture of caustic chlorine including its by products, the Court laid down as many as eleven conditions, and 315 ^ 
 HELD: 1. All Expert Committees are unanimous in their view that by adopting proper and adequate safety measures, the element of risk to the workmen and the public can only be minimised, but it cannot be totally eliminated. The general concensus of opinion of all the Expert Committees is that relocation of the caustic chlorine plant is the only long term solution, if hazard to the community is to be completely eliminated. Whether the caustic chlorine plant should be directed to be shifted or relocated at a place where there will be no hazard to the community and if so, within what time-frame, is a question which will require serious consideration and a National Policy will have to be evolved by the Government for location of toxic or hazardous industries and a decision will have to be taken in regard to relocation of such industries with a view to eliminating risk to the community likely to arise from the operation of such industries. [325 B-D; 329 E-F] 
 1.2 It is undoubtedly true that chlorine gas is dangerous to the life and health of the community and it escapes either from the storage tanks or from the filled cylinders or from any other point in the cause of production, it is likely to affect the health and well being of the workmen and the people in the vicinity. Both Agarwal and Manmohan Singh Committees are agreed to their opinion that chlorine is a hazardous gas and though smaller concentrations of chlorine in the air cause only an irritation and coughing, longer concentrations whether 25 parts per million (PPM) or 40 parts per million (PPM) are likely to cause serious danger to life. However, in view of the Report of yet another Expert Committee (consisting of Dr. Manmohan Singh, Dr. Sharma, Prof. P. Khanna & Shri Gharekhan) appointed for the purpose of ascertaining whether the various recommendations made in the earlier Reports were substantially complied with or not, and taking into consideration that even the restarting of the Vanaspati, refined oil plant and recovery plants like soap, glycerine and technical hard oil, not involving any health hazard, cannot be possible unless the caustic chlorine plant is also restarted and several other factors including the power of the Board to renew or not to renew consent orders under the Air Act and Water Act, the balance of convenience would tilt in favour of Shriram to be allowed to restart their plants subject to certain stringent conditions.

 1.3 Since cases involving issues of environmental pollution, ecological destruction and conflicts over natural resources are increasingly coming up for adjudication and these cases involve assessment and evolution of scientific and technical data, it might be desirable to set up Enviornment Courts on the regional basis with one professional Judge and two experts drawn from the Ecological Sciences Research Group keeping in view the nature of the case and the expertise required for its adjudication. There would of course be a right of appeal to this Court from the decision of the Environment Court. [345 H; 346 A-C]
