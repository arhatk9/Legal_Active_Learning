 The petitioner was granted a Sanad by Ijlas Thikana Khetri which was the highest court in. a native state. On the basis of the Sanad the petitioner practiced in another native State for some years and later joined service. In 1955 his application for recommencing practice was rejected by the High Court of Rajasthan on account of his not making an application before the appointed day in December, 1951.
 Later the petitioner applied to the Delhi State Bar Council for enrollment under s. 24(3) of the Advocates Act which was rejected. Sub-section 3 to section 24 says that a person who has for at least three years been a vakil or a pleader or a mukhtar or was entitled at any time to be enrolled under any law as an Advocate of a High Court (including a High Court of a former part B State) may be admitted as an advocate on a State roll.
 Dismissing the appeal.
 
HELD : On the material placed before the Delhi Bar Council for the purpose of the petitioner's enrolment it could not be held that the decision of the Bar Council was incorrect.
 If the petitioner were actually qualified under the Act for enrolment as an advocate and had been wrongfully refused enrolment by the authorities the question of infringement of his fundamental rights under Article 19(1)(g) would have arisen. [912 D-E] Admittedly the petitioner did not come under the first part of sub-section 3(a) of section 24 of the Advocate Act since he was neither a vakil nor a pleader nor a mukhtar. The Sanad on which he relied upon did not show under what law it was issued. Further, Thikana Khetri was not one of the covenanting States of the United State of Rajasthan. [811 E] The petitioner had not taken any steps in accordance with the law to get himself enrolled under the Bar Council Act or any other Act entitling him for enrolment; nor did he pursue the matter further in that behalf when his application had been rejected by the High Court under s. 49 of the Rajasthan High Court Ordinance (15 of 1949) [812 D]
