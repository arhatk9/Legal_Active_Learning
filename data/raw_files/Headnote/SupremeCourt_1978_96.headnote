 A suit for partition and possession was filed by the original respondent No. 2 herein against respondent No. 4 (Defendant No. I in the Suit), defendants 2 to 7 being co- sharers and defendants 8 to 14 being tenans in possession.
 The Trial Court passed a preliminary decree on 13-12-1954 by which each branch got 1/7th share. The said preliminary decree was confirmed by the High Court on 16-1-1963. In accordance with the law prevalent in the Karnataka State, an execution case under Section 54 r/w Order XX rule 18/Order XXI rule 35 C.P.C. being LD 117/56 was filed by the plaintiff-decree holder and the appellants' predecessor-in- interest i.e. (defendants 5 and 6 ) in the Court which had passed the preliminary decree for final partition and possession of the same had to be made and given by the Collector. In this execution case respondent No. I herein was impleaded as judgment debtor No. 20 because, during the pendency of the Suit in or about the year 1948, he had been inducted as a lessee of a portion of the suit properties in R.S. No. 61/1 and R.S. No. 61/2 situated in village Yattinahalli in Ranebennur Taluk of Dharwar district. The effect of impleading respondent No. 1 as a judgment debtor was as if he was impleaded as a party to the suit before final partition. On May 29, 1961, the Executing Court directed the Collector to partition the suit property and to give possession of their respective allotted lands to the various co-sharers including the appellants. Respondent No.
 1 did not object to the claim. Neither did he carry any appeal against the said orders. The Collector made the final allotment of the various lands to the different co- sharers. The disputed land over which respondent No. 1 had been inducted by respondent No. 4 was allotted to the share of the predecessors-in-interest of the appellants some time after 29-5-1961 and before 29-5-1965.
 On 29-5-1965, in pursuance of the direction of the Execution Court and the Collector, the Tahsildar went to effect the delivery of possession but proposed to deliver only symbolical possession of the disputed land and declined to deliver actual possession, as he found respondent No. I to be in actual cultivating possession of it. The Execution Court was moved in the matter and. by its order dated 8-6- 1965, it directed the Tahsildar to deliver actual possession. On an appeal by respondent No. 1 in C.A. 104 165 the said execution orders of the Tahsildar was confirmed resulting in Execution Second Appeal by Respondent No. 1 in E.S.A. 86/65 before the High Court. The High Court made 790 certain conditional orders of ad-interim stay. The conditions were not complied with by respondent No. I.
 Thereupon the appellants made an application again to the Execution Court for directing actual delivery. The first respondent contested the application on the ground that he being the tenant of the land had made an, application under the Mysore Land Reforms Act, 1961 which had come into force on October 2, 1965 seeking a declaration that be was a tenant within the meaning of that Act and obtained a stay.
 The Execution Court by its order dated 8-8-1967 rejected the plea and again directed the Tahsildar to deliver actual possession and this order was confirmed by the First Appellate Court in C.A. 34/67. Execution Second Appeal No.
 78/67 was filed by respondent No. I in the High Court on 21- 9-1967. The High Court disposed of both the E.S.A. 86/65 and E.S.A. 78/67 by a common judgment and allowed the appeals. The High Court held that respondent No. 1, in view of the provisions of the Karnataka Act, cannot be evicted and no actual delivery of possession can be given against him unless the requirements of the said Act was followed :
 Dismissing the appeals by special leave, the Court Per Untwalia, J. (On behalf of R. S. Sarkaria J. as well) 
HELD :1. Civil Court's jurisdiction is barred under section 132 of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act, which is in pari materia with Section 85 of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948. Section 133 corresponds to Section 85A of the Act. The saving sub-section IA, inserted by Act 14 of 1965 in Section 142 extended the protection of the eviction of the Mysore Act against eviction and provided that an agriculturist shall not be liable to be evicted from land in respect of which he could be deemed to be a tenant except in accordance with the provisions of the Karnataka Act.

2. The facts of the present case do attract the provisions of the Mysore Tenants (Temporary Protection from Eviction) Act, 1961 and subsequently the Karnataka Land Reforms Act.
 The first respondent was a tenant under the fourth respondent within the meaning of Section 2(18) of the Bombay Act. He had therefore, the protection of the Bombay Act.
 Later he got the protection under Section 2(e) of the Mysore Act and subsequently, the protection continued even under the Karnataka Act. The question which falls for decision in these appeals is not one as to the applicability of any of the three Acts to the land in dispute but squarely (1) it is a question as to whether the claim of the first respondent that he became a tenant under the appellants also is tenable under the various Act. Thus on the facts of the case the decision of this Court in Kulkarni's case applies on all fours. [802 A-C] Bhimji Shankar Kulkarni v. Dundappa Vithappa Adapudi and Anr. [1965] INSC 129; [1966] 1 SCR 145; followed.
 
3. The argument that though the respondent No. 1 might have been inducted as a tenant by respondent No. 4, but as soon as, the land was allotted to the share of the appellants he ceased to be in lawful possession of the land and in view of the well settled position of law with reference to Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act he could not be a 'tenant' or 'deemed tenant' under the appellants within the meaning of the Bombay Act or Karnataka Act is not correct. A question arose during the pendency of the suit and the execution proceeding whether on the final allotment of the land to the appellants, respondent No. 1 had ceased to be a tenant and had become a trespasser in view of 791 section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act. The appellants may have a good case on merits. But there does not seem to be any escape from the position that the adjudication of the question aforesaid fell squarely and exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Revenue Authorities and the Civil Court had no jurisdiction to decide it. It was not a case where there was no dispute of the fact that respondent No. 1 was a tenant or vice versa. Nor was it a case where dispute had cropped up inter se between two persons both claiming to be the landlord of the land or between two persons both claiming to be the tenant of the land. The dispute was whether respondent No. 1 had become the tenant of the appellants or not. [802 D-H, 803 A] Bhimappa Venkappa Kerisa v. Basavalingayya, I.L.R. 1958 Mysore, 197; Ramdas Popat Patil v.

1. The exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is not to be lightly inferred. Such exclusion must be explicitly expressed or clearly implied. In order to determine whether the jurisdiction of the Civil Court was expressly or by necessary implication excluded the provisions of the relevant enactments will, have to be considered. [806 A-D] Secretary of State v. Mask Co., 67 I.A. 622, Dhulabhai v.

 reiterated.
 
2. The Karnataka Land Reforms Act as well as the earlier enactments were made for the purposes of introducing agrarian reforms, conferment of ownership on tenants, ceiling on land holdings and for certain other matters referred to in the Act. Any dispute arising under the provisions of the Act and relating to disputes between landlord and tenant will be within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal constituted under the Act. [808 A-B] By Section 132 of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1961, the jurisdiction of the Civil Court to settle, decide, to deal with any question which is under the Act required to be decided by the authorities set up by the Act is taken away.
 Under Section 112 B which enumerates the duties of the Tribunal it is clearly the duty of the Tribunal to determine whether a person who claims to be a tenant is an agriculturist, whether he cultivates personally the lands, whether he holds, the lands from a landlord, whether he is a deemed tenant under section 4, whether he is entitled to protection from eviction from any land under the Karnataka Tenants (Temporary Protection from Eviction) Act, 1961, whether he is a permanent tenant and whether he is a protected tenant. In this connection it is necessary to note the definition of landlord in section 2(21) which means a person who has leased the land to a tenant and includes person entitled to receive the rent from a tenant. It is also the duty of the Tribunal to determine whether the tenant is holding the land on lease from a landlord. [807 B, F-H] Asa Ram and Anr. v. Mst. Ram Kali & Anr., [1958] S.C.R. 986 referred to.
 
3. Sub-section 2(a) of Section 133 of the Karnataka Act is applicable to suits only and does not indicate that the provisions are applicable to execution proceedings or in appeals before Civil Courts. The jurisdiction of the Civil Court is taken away only in respect of the decisions of the issues in suits that are required to be referred to the Tribunal under Section 133 and the Civil Court shall stay the suit. On receipt of a communication from the Tribunal, the Civil Court has to proceed with the trial of the suit and dispose it of according to law. In the absence of express provision, when an issue has been 792 referred by the Civil Court to the Tribunal and is received,back and a decree passed in the suit, the provision of the Civil Procedure Code regarding appeals and revisions will be applicable. In such circumstances the appellate Court will have to consider the correctness or otherwise of the issue that has been decided by the Tribunal. Section 4(1) of the Mysore Act which is similar to section 133(2) of the Karnataka Act provided for stay of execution in suits, proceedings and execution of decrees or orders and other proceedings for the eviction of tenant. In applying section 133, therefore, the questions that have to be considered are, whether the sub-section is applicable to execution proceedings and in appeals before Civil Courts. [808 F-H, 809 A-B] In the instant case, as the respondent took the plea that he is protected under the Mysore Land Reforms Act, 1961, the question as to what extent the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is barred ought to have been gone into by the High Court. It is unfortunate that the High Court considered it unnecessary to consider the various questions in the Second Appeals in view of the decision of this court in Bhimaji Shanker Kulkarni v. Dundappa Vithappa Udapudi and Anr., [1965] INSC 129; [1966] 1 S.C.R. 145. The only other ground on which the appeals were dismissed was that under section 142(1-A) of the Mysore Act corresponding to section 22 of the Karnataka Act, the 1st respondent was entitled to protection. The protection is available only when the land is held by a person as a tenant. [810 B-D] Bhimaii Shankar Kulkarni v. Dundappa Vithappa Udapudi and Anr. [1965] INSC 129; [1966] 1 S.C.R. 145; Dhondi Tukkaram v. Hari Dadu I.L.R. (1953) Bom. 969; explained.
 
4. If in law the sharer in possession could not enter into any transaction obviously affecting the rights of the parties the defendant cannot claim any right and therefore, will not be a tenant. The question to be considered in such circumstances is whether an issue that the defendant is a tenant arises at all. [811 G-H, 812 A] 
5. The Civil Court has inherent power to decide the question of its own jurisdiction although as a result of an inquiry it may turn out that it has no jurisdiction. Even though the defendant may plead that he is a tenant, the Court must be satisfied that an issue whether the defendant is a tenant or not arises before it could be referred for determination by the Tribunal and the question of jurisdiction will not be decided mainly on the plea of the defendants.

6. In the instant case (a) It was incumbent On the High Court to decide the several questions that arise for consideration. The plea of the appellants that the decisions of the Civil Courts directing the 1st respondent to deliver the possession to the appellant have become Anal and was no more available to him to be raised under the Karnataka Land Reforms Act also falls for decision. Equally, the plea that the questions that arise in the appeals are not within the competence of the Tribunal, also ought to have been gone into. Before referring the issue to the Tribunal the High Court ought to have come to a conclusion that on the facts of the case the issue as to whether the 1st respondent is a tenant has arisen and has to be decided by the Tribunal. [816 D-E] (b) The High Court ought to have also considered whether any restriction on the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts placed under the Act is applicable to the 793 High Court also. The jurisdiction of the Civil Courts is not entirely barred as the Act only provides for reference of certain issues for decision before the Revenue Tribunal and after receipt of the finding of such issues to record a judgment on such finding. The appeal to the Civil Courts according to the Civil Procedure Code and the jurisdiction of the High Court in hearing appeals and revisions under certain circumstances have not been excluded. [816 F-G] [In view of the statement at the bar that during the pendency of these appeals in this Court that the Land Tribunal dismissed R. C. 37/66 filed by the respondent seeking declaration that he is a tenant in holding and that he is not a tenant, the court ordered (a) that actual delivery of possessions would be delivered to the appellants, if the question has already been finally decided in favour of the appellants (b) If not the revenue authorities should decide as quickly as possible and if the decision goes in favour of the appellants no time should be lost in giving actual delivery of possession to them and if per chance, the decision goes against them only symbolical possession be given.]
