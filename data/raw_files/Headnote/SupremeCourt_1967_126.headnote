 The respondent had established a factory in Bombay which was closed in April 1957. In July 1957, the ex-workers of the factory combined together to form five partnerships and by agreements of leave and licence, the respondent gave in their use the factory premises and the machinery in-stalled there. He himself did not join any of the five part- nerships. The licensees were to pay a fixed sum for the use of the premises and the machines.
 By a notification on September 29, 1960, the State Government specified the premises where the five partnerships were working as a factory under s. 85 of the Factories Act, 1948, thus applying the provision of the Act to the premises. On November 10, 1959 five separate com- plaints were filed against the respondent, whereby it was alleged that he was the owner and therefore an occupier under the Act of the Factory where the workmen were working under an agreement with him within the meaning of s.
 85(1)(ii) and that he had failed to take out five licences under Rule 3A of the Bombay Factory Rule, 1950. The respon- dent contended that the Act did not apply to him as he had no control over the five firms and he was not in a position to enforce the provisions of the Factories Act. The trial Court 'held that the respondent had become an occupier by reason of the notification of September 29, 1960 so that he was bound to obtain licences under Rule 3A, and he was fined for his failure to do so. The High Court however, allowed an appeal against the order of the trial Court.
 On appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The respondent was not an 'Occupier' of a factory within the meaning the definition in s. 2(n) of the Act as he did not have ultimate control over the affairs of the five firms running the factory and the High Court had rightly held that s. 85(1)(ii) did not cover the present case. [S 11 D-E] The condition precedent for a notification under s.
 85(1)(ii) is that the persons working in a factory (a) work with the permission of, or, (b) under an agreement with the owner. The section does not contemplate a case where the owner hands over the factory on rent and the workers work without his permission and not under an agreement with him. The High Court had considered the agreements between the respondent and the workers and come -to the conclusion that the partnerships were independent of the control of the owner and the workers could not be said to be working with his permission or under agreement with him; they had formed themselves into partnerships, taken the factory premises on 809 leave and licence and started their own business. In these circumstance-,, the conditions for the notification under s.
 85(1)(ii) did not exist. [811F81 --A] The respondent was not liable as -,in owner under s. 93 (3) (ii) of the Act is the machinery and plant had been specifically entrusted to the custody or use of the five partnerships. [812F]
