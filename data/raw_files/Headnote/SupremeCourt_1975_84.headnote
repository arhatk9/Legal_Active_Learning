 The order of detention dated 6-7-1974 passed by the District Magistrate of Keonjhar, Orissa, recited that the District Magistrate was satisfied that with a view to preventing the petitioner from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the com- munity, it is necessary to make the order under Section 3 read with Section 5 of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act. The first ground related to sale by him of two tyres without authority and cash memo. The second ground related to the disposal of the 140 out of 149 tyres in contravention of law.
 Dismissing the- Writ Petition, challenging the detention and also the Special Leave Petition directed against the order of the Orissa High Court, 
HELD : (i) As the Manager of the United Commercial Company, the petitioner was certainly not a licensed dealer. The 149 tyres had been obtained by the company for actual use on the trucks but most of them had, apparently, been disposed of in what is known, as the 'black market'. The provisions relating to licensed dealers did not warrant such sales which were struck by the provisions of clause 2 of the Orissa Automobile Tyres and Tubes Control Order, 1973. The petitioner had not been detained for any irregularity or illegality committed as a licensed dealer, bout as a person who seemed to have been diverting tyres from their pretended use, to sales in "black market". He was unable to repel the allegation regarding the sale of two tyres. [55F; 56A] Debu Mahto v. State of West Bengal, A.T.R. 1974, S.C. 816 and Messrs Pusparaj & Co. and Ors. v.

 (ii)It cannot be said that the impugned detention order is either arbitrary or not connected with the purpose for which a detention may be ordered under s. 3(1)(a)(iii) of the Act.
