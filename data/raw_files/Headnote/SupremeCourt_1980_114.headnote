 The appellants-plaintiffs who were minors entered into an agreement on 30-9-1961, through their mother and guardian with the respondent to purchase a house for a sum of Rs.
 11000/-. A sum of Rs. 1000/- was paid as earnest money and the balance was to be paid at the time of the registration of the sale deed. Since the respondent did not carry out his part of the agreement, the appellants filed a suit for specific performance of the contract on 28-3-1962 in the Court of Additional District Judge, Gwalior. The suit was decreed on 15-4-1966. The appellants deposited Rs. 10,500/- the balance of the price on 13-7-1966. The respondent appealed to the High Court against the judgment and decree of the trial court which allowed the appeal and dismissed the suit holding that as the contract was entered into on behalf of the minors a decree for specific performance could not be granted for want of mutuality.
 Allowing the appeal by special leave, the Court ^ 
HELD : 1. The contract entered into by the guardian on behalf of the minors is enforceable. [1108 E] 
 2. A minor has no legal competence to enter into a contract or authorise someone else on his behalf to enter into a contract. But under the Hindu Law, the natural guardian is empowered to enter into a contract on behalf of the minors and the contract would be binding and enforceable if the contract is for the benefit of the minor.

 3. After the passing of the Hindu Minority Act, 1956, the guardian of a Hindu minor has power to do all acts which are necessary or reasonable and proper for the benefit of the minor's estates. The guardian is entitled to act so as to bind the minor if it is necessary or reasonable and proper for the benefit of the minor. The power thus conferred by the Act is in no way restricted than that was recognised under the Hindu Law. Here, it is quite strange that the respondent should plead that the transaction is not for the benefit of the 1105 minor when the minor is convinced it is in his benefit and that it is worth pursuing the litigation upto Supreme Court.
 [1107 G-H, 1108 A-B] 
 4. The guardian by the contract for purchase of property does not bind the minor by his personal covenant.
 As it is within the competence of the guardian, the contract is entered into effectively on behalf of the minor and the liability to pay the money is the liability of the minor under the Transfer of Property Act. [1108 D-E]
