 The respondent while working as an assistant cashier of the appellant-bank, received Rs. 4,100/- but denied having received that amount and stated that he was paid only Rs.
 4,000/-. He was suspended and charge-sheeted for giving false statements to the manager. An enquiry was held. The enquiry officer found that the charges framed against the respondent had been proved and he recommended that he should be-discharged from service of the bank. The bank agreed to discharge him. Before passing the actual 404 order of discharge against the respondent, the bank applied under s. 33(2)(b) of the Industrial Disputes Act for approval of the action proposed to be taken against the respondent. The respondent was however, actually discharged after this application was made. The Labour court refused to approve the action of the bank, holding on the basis of Strawboard Manufacturing Co's case that such approval should have been sought after the actual discharge had been made.
 Held:(1) It was immaterial under s. 33(2)(b) of the Industrial Disputes Act whether the application for approval of the discharge of the workman was made before or after the actual order of discharge.
 (2)The Strawboard Manufacturing Co.'s case lays down that the application for approval can be made after the action has been taken and when this happens the employer is required to fulfill the three conditions as laid down in the proviso to s. 33(2)(b), namely, (i) the dismissal or discharge of employee (ii) payment of wages and (iii) the making of the application, as parts of the same transaction.
 Strawboard Manufacturing Co. v. Govind, [1962] Supp. 3 S.C.R. 618, explained.
 (3)There is nothing in principle against the employer making an application under S. 33(2)(b) of the Act for approval of the proposed action before the actual action is taken.
