 An exporter exporting goods outside India is required to furnish a declaration under section 12(1) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947 affirming that the full export value of the goods had been or would be paid in the prescribed manner. Sub-section (2) of this section provides that no person entitled to sell the said goods shall do so or refrain from doing anything which has the effect of securing that .... (b) "payment for the goods is made otherwise than in the prescribed manner or does not represent the full amount payable by the foreign buyer in respect of the goods." An Export Promotion Scheme for textile goods and handicrafts promulgated by the Government of India envisaged the issuance of import licences to the exporters solely on the basis of the declared value of the exported goods. On receiving the import licences the exporters were able to sell them at a profit ranging from 200 to 300 per cent of their face value. This encouraged the exporters to prepare invoices showing the value far above the market or contractual price for obtaining import licences for the inflated amounts.
 Against the invoice value of Rs. 21.97 lakhs, one of the appellants received only Rs. 1.01 lakhs, while against the invoice value of Rs. 17.06 lakhs in the case of goods exported by the other appellant the amount repatriated was Rs. 38,000 odd. Both the appellants pleaded guilty to the charge levelled against them.
 Finding them guilty under section 12(2) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, the Director imposed a penalty of Rs. 3 lakhs on each of them.
 In a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution the High Court quashed the order on the view that there would be contravention of section 12(2)(b) only when the foreign buyer was under an obligation to pay a certain sum of money and there was non-payment of that amount or part thereof in consequence of something done by the exporter and that if the contractual value of the goods had been realised by the exporter, he could not be held guilty of any contravention merely by reason of fact that he had shown an inflated price in the invoice and thus received undeserved benefit in the form of import licence.
 1093 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD : The expression "full amount payable by the foreign buyer in respect of the goods" occurring in clause (b) would mean merely the total amount which is due from the foreign buyer in respect of the goods actually exported, and what would be due from a foreign buyer has to be merely the price which he has agreed to pay and not any fanciful, un- real or inflated price which the exporter may choose to falsely incorporate in the invoice with any ulterior motives. The foreign buyer cannot be held to be liable to pay any amount over and above the price which he has promised to pay for the goods received by him and any difference between that price and the price given in the invoice can, therefore, not have the attribute of having become payable by him. If the price agreed upon had been paid to the exporter, clause (b) does not come into operation. [1096 F-G]
