 Dismissing the special leave petition, the Court ^ 
 HELD: 1. The conviction being one under Section 302 I.P.C., the sentence awarded namely, one of life imprisonment, is beyond interference. [2A] 
 2. One of the principal purposes of punitive deprivation of liberty, constitutionally sanctioned, is decriminalization of the criminal and restoration of his dignity, self-esteem and good citizenship, so that when the man emerges from the forbidden gates he becomes a socially useful individual. [2C-E] 
 3. Long prison terms do not humanise or habilitate but debase and promote recidivism. Life imprisonment means languishing in prison for years and years. Such induration of the soul induced by indefinite incarceration hardens the inmates, not oftens their responses. [2B] Therefore, the Court issued the following directions designed to make the life of the sentence inside jail restorative of his crippled psyche: (a) despatching the two prisoners to one of the open prisons in U.P., if they substantially fulfil the required conditions; (b) being agriculturists by profession they be put to use as agriculturists, whether within or without the prison compass or them small wages; (c) by keeping the prisoners in contact with their family them small wages; (c) by keeping the prisoners in contact with their family (i) by allowing members of the family to visit them and (ii) by permitting the prisoners under guarded conditions at least once a year, to visit their families and (d) the prisoners to be released on parole for two weeks, once a year, which will be repeated throughout their period of incarceration provided their conduct, while at large, is found to be satisfactory.
