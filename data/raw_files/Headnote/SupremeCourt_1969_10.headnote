 Kendu tree is a wild growth and its leaf is used mainly in the manufacture of bidis. To regulate trade in Kendu leaves and prevent exploitation of growers and pluckers the respondent-State adopted diverse measures. In 1961, the Orissa Kendu Leavs (Control of Trade) Act, 1961, was enacted. By s. 3 of the Act no person other than the Government, an authorised officer of the Government, or an agent appointed by the Government shall purchase or transport Kendu leaves; and under- s. 4 the Government is, authorised to fix the price at which the leaves shall be purchased from the growers by the officer or agent of the Government. Section 10 provides that the Kendu leaves purchased shall be sold or disposed of in such manner as the Government may direct, and under s. II, at least one half of the net profits derived by the Government is to be paid to Samitis and Gram Panchayats. A grower of Kendu leaves chal- lenged ss. 3 and 4 and r. 7(5) made under the Act as infringing his fundamental rights under Arts. 14 and 19(1)(f) and (g). This Court, in Akadasi Padhan v. State of Orissa, [1963] Supp. 2 S.C.R. 691, held that ss. 3 and 4 did not infringe Art. 19(6) (ii), but that the State was in- competent to implement the provisions of the Act and give effect to its monopoly, because, the agents appointed were not really agents of the Government but were authorised to carry on trade in the leaves purchased not on behalf of the Government but on their own account, and that it thus gave rise to a monopoly in favour of the agents which was not protected by Art. 19(6) (ii) since the law cannot be used by the State for the private benefit of agents. Thereafter, the State made some changes in the implementation of its monopoly. In 1966, it invited tenders from persons desirous of purchasing Kendu leaves purchased by the officers and agents of the Government. During the years 1966 and 1967, the prices of Kendu leaves ruled very high and when sales were effected by public auction, prices considerably in excess of those at which tenders were accepted were realised. Early in 1968, the State evolved another scheme under which, the State offered to renew the licences of those traders who in the State's view had worked satisfactorily in the previous year and had paid the amounts due from them regularly' The scheme was objected to, and realising that, the scheme arbitrarily excluded many persons interested in the trade, and hence was objectionable, the Government decided to invite offers for advance purchases of Kendu leaves but restricted the invitation to those individuals who had carried out the contracts in the previous year without default and to the satisfaction of the Government, that is, the existing contractors were given the exclusive right to make offers to 375 purchase Kendu leaves. This new method of offering to enter into agreements for advance purchases of Kendu leaves by private offers in preference to open competition, was challenged by writ petitions in the High Court as violative of the petitioner's fundamental rights under Arts. 14 and 19(1)(g).
 The High Court held that under s. 10 of the Act the Government could dispose of the leaves in such manner as it thought fit, that the only question for the Court was whether in adopting the new scheme of offering to enter into advance purchase contracts by private negotiation the Government had acted bona fide, and that the petitioners failed to show that in exercising its discretion the Government acted arbitrarily or without bona fides.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The validity of a law by which the State assumed the monopoly to trade in a given commodity `as to be judged by the test whether the entire benefit arising therefrom is to enure to the State, and the monopoly is not used as a cloak for conferring private benefit upon a limited class of persons. The monopoly of purchasing Kendu leaves under S. 3 may be held to be valid if, it be administered only for the benefit of the State. Similarly,, the right to sell or dispose of Kendu leaves by the State under s. 10, in such manner as the Government may direct, would be valid if it be exercised in public interest and not to serve the private interests of any person or class of persons. The profit resulting from the sale must be for the public benefit and not for private gain. Section 11 also emphasises the concept that the machinery of sale or disposal of the leaves must also be geared to serve the public interest. if the scheme of disposal creates a class of middle men who could purchase from the Government at concessional rates and earn large profits disproportionate to the nature of the,service rendered or duty performed by them, it cannot claim the protection of Art. 19(6) (ii) as it is not open to the Government to create a monopoly in favour of third parties from its own monopoly. [383 385A-D] In the present case, the right to make offers being open to a limited class of persons it effectively shut out all other persons carrying on trade in Kendu leaves as well as new entrants into the trade. Both the schemes, evolved by the Government, namely the one of offering to enter into contracts with certain named licencees, and the other of inviting tenders from licencees who had in the previous year carried out their contracts satisfactorily gave rise to a monopoly in the trade in the leaves to certain traders and singled out other traders for discriminating treatment.
 Therefore, they were violative of the fundamental right of the petitioners under Arts. 14 and 19(1)(g) and as the 'schemes were not 'integrally and essentially' connected with the creation of the monopoly they were not protected by Art. 19(6) (ii). [384 E-H; 385 B-D] (a) If the only anxiety of the Government was to ensure due performance by those who submitted tenders, Government could devise adequate safe guards. But the classification based on the circumstance that certain existing contractors had carried out their obligation in the previous year ,regularly and to the satisfaction of the Government is not based on any real and substantial distinction bearing a just and reasonable relation to the objects sought to be achieved namely, the effective execution of the monopoly in public interest, the prevention of exploitation of pluckers and growers of Kendu leaves, or the securing of the full benefit from the trade, to the State. [384G-H; 386B-D] 376 (b) The scheme could not be supported on the ground that it imposed reasonable-restrictions, within the meaning of Art.
 19(6), on the fundamental rights of traders to carry on business in Kendu leaves. [38SC-D] (c) The plea that the action of the Government was bona fide cannot be an effective answer, because, the Government had not considered, the prevailing prices of Kendu leaves about the time when offers were made, the estimated crop, the conditions in the market, offers of higher prices and the likelihood of offerors of higher prices carrying out their obligations and whether it was in the, interests of the State to invite tenders in the open market from all persons irrespective of their having taken contracts in the previous year. [385H; 386A-B] (d) It could not also be said that the Government merely committed an error of judgment in adopting the impugned scheme. It is not a case of the Government erring in the exercise of its discretion, but the action of the Government was itself not valid. [386 B-D]
