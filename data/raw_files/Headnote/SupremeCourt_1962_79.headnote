 The appellant carried on the business of generating and supplying electricity in the town of Fazilka in accordance with the terms of a license for fifteen years. Clause 9(a) of the license gave the Government an option to acquire the undertaking on expiration of fifteen years from the date of the license. The said option was in accordance to sub. s.
 (1) of s. 7 of the Electricity Act, 1910. The Government of Punjab exercised its option and acquired the undertaking on a payment which was in excess of the written down value of the building, machinery and plant of the undertaking. For the assessment of the appellant for the relevant year, the Income-Tax Officer computed such excess realisation over the written down value as did not exceed the difference between the original cost and the written down value and held the said sum as taxable in the hands of the appellant by reason of the provisions in s. 10(2) (vii) of the Income Tax Act.
 The appellant contended that no part of the excess was taxable since the undertaking had not been voluntarily sold, but had been compulsorily acquired by the Government ; and on a proper construction of the Electricity Act and the rules made thereunder, this so-called sale was really a compulsory acquisition of property and not a sale as legally understood.
 Held, that from the provisions of the Electricity Act, 1910, read alongwith the rules made thereunder, it is manifest that the condition as to the option of purchase either by the local authority or Government. is the result of an agreement between the applicant who had applied for license and the Government who granted the license.
 The true scope and effect of s. 7 of the Electricity Act is that it is an enabling section and merely provides for the option of purchase to be exercised on the expiration of a certain period agreed to between the parties, and s. 10 of the Act 497 further provides that in an appropriate case Government may even forego the option. The scheme of the Electricity Act as indicated by the relevant provisions thereof and the rules made thereunder, shows beyond any doubt that the option of purchase is the result of a mutual agreement between the parties, the applicant for the license on one hand and the Government on the other.
 Held, further, that s. 7 does not provide for a compulsory purchase or compulsory acquisition without reference to and independent of any agreement by the licensee. The expression "compulsory purchase" in the second proviso to sub-s. (1) of s. 7 is another enabling provision which enables a part to specify in the license such percentage as should be added to the value of the building, plant and machinery etc. when the option is exercised, notwithstanding the use of the expression "compulsory purchase" in the said second proviso, there is no compulsory purchase or compulsory acquisition in the sense in which that expression is ordinarily understood.
