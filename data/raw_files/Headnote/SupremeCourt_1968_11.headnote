 An unsuccessful candidate for election to. the Mysore Legislative: Assembly for a scat reserved for a member of the Scheduled Tribes, filed an election petition on the ground that the other three candidates belonged to the Bedar caste, which is not a tribe specified in Part VIII, para 2 of the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order, 1950. The appellant-the successful candidate asserted that he was a Nayaka (which is mentioned at item No. 13 in Part VIII (2) of the Order) and Nayakas are also called Bedars. The High Court held that there was no Nayaka in this area and that the appellant was a Bedar. Allowing the appeal, this Court, 
HELD : The Presidential Order showed that Naikdas or Nayakas are to be found -not only in the districts of Mysore but also in Maharashtra and Rajasthan. This tribal community was therefore, quite widespread and it was not possible to say that there was no Nayaka in the district to which the appellant belonged. Even if he was the solidary Nayaka he would be covered by the Presidential order and would be entitled to stand for the reserved seat for the tribal communities mentioned in the Presidential Order. He claimed to be a Nayaka and this claim was upheld by the Returning Officer. [810 G] Once the nomination paper was accepted the burden must be assumed again by the party challenging the fact that a candidate belonged to a particular community. If prima facie evidence had been lead by the election petitioner the burden might have shifted to the candidate but as he ,led no evidence whatever he must obviously fail. [809 H; 810 A] The election petitioner could have proved by positive evidence that the appellant was a Bedar. That would have proved that he was not a Nayaka. To establish the fact evidence was required to show the characteristics, such as customs of marriages, births, deaths, worship, dress, occupation and the like which distinguish a Bedar from a Nayaka. Evidence was also possible to show that the appellant was received in the Bedar community. This was capable of being proved by showing inter-marriage, interdining. community of worship, residence in a particular place and the like. Such facts would have led to the drawing of an inference one way or the other. A bare assertion by the election petitioner that the appellant is a Bedar does not suffice to displace the acceptance of the nomination paper or the claim of the appellant that he is a Nayaka.
