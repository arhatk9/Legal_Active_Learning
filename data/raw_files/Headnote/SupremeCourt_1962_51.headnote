 The respondents were a firm carrying on the work of solicitors in Bombay. For the years 1956 and 1957 a claim for bonus was made against them by their employees. Before.
 the Industrial Tribunal to which the dispute was referred by the State Government for adjudication under the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, the respondents contended that the profession followed by them was not an industry within the meaning of s. 2(j) of the Act, that the dispute raised against them was not an industrial dispute under the Act, and that, therefore, the reference made by the Government was incompetent.
 Held, that the work of solicitors is not an industry within the meaning of s. 2(j) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, and that, therefore, any dispute raised by the employees of 158 the solicitors against them cannot be made the subject of reference to the Industrial Tribunal.
 The distinguishing feature of an industry is that for the production of goods or for the rendering of service, co- operation between capital and labour or between the employer and his employee must be direct. A person following a liberal profession does not carry on his profession in any intelligible sense with the active co-operation of his employees, and the principal, if not the sole, capital which he brings into his profession is his special or peculiar intellectual and educational equipment. Consequently, a liberal profession like that of a solicitor is outside the definition of "industry" under s. 2(j) of the Act.
