 The respondent, claiming to be the cultivating tenant of the appellant, filed an application before the Revenue Court under ss. 3(3) of the Madras Cultivating Tenants Protection Act, 1955, praying for a declaration that the amount deposited by him in the Court represented the correct amount of rent due from him to the appellant. The appellant denied that the respondent was his cultivating tenant. The Revenue Court held that the respondent was not the appellant's cultivating tenant. The High Court in a revision petition under s. 6B of the Act read with s. 115 of the Civil Procedure Code, held that the respondent was a cultivating tenant of the appellant and that the amount deposited represented the correct amount due from him to the appellant.
 In appeal to this Court the appellant contended that the High Court had no jurisdiction, in revision, to set aside the finding of the Revenue Court that the respondent was not the appellant's cultivating tenant.
 
HELD : The Revenue Court under the Act can exercise its jurisdiction only if a relationship of landlord and cultivating tenant exists between the contending parties.
 If its jurisdiction is challenged it must enquire into the existence of the preliminary fact and decide if it has jurisdiction. if by an erroneous decision on a question of fact or law touching its jurisdiction a subordinate court assumes a jurisdiction not vested in it by law or fails to exercise a jurisdiction so vested, its decision is not final and is subject to the revisional jurisdiction of the High Court. Therefore, the High Court had power to enquire into the correctness of the Revenue Court's decision, and on finding hat the tenancy existed and that the Revenue Court had erroneously refused to exercise the jurisdiction vested in it by s. 3 (3), the High Court could set aside that decision under S. 11 (b) of the Civil Procedure Code read with s. 6B of the Act.
