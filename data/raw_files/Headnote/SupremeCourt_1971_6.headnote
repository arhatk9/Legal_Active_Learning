 Certain plots in a Municipality were acquired under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, and the predecessor of the appellants and the predecessor of the respondents, each claimed the compensation. amount on the basis of title. The matter was referred to the Court of the District Judge. The claim of the predecessor of the respondents was dismissed for default and the claim of the predecessor of the appellants was therefore upheld. Certain other plots pertaining to the same title and interest were later .acquired and the question arose as to whether appellants or respondents were entitled to the compensation. Since the test of res judicata is the identity of title in the two litigations and not the identity of the actual property involved, the appellants pleaded that the earlier decision by the District Judge operated as res judicata.
 
HELD : The earlier decision did not operate as res judicata against the respondents inasmuch as the matter was not heard and finally decided on merits after contest. If a matter was heard and finally decided on merits, then such a decision operates as res judicata, even though an appeal against the decision was dismissed on a preliminary ground such as limitation default in printing, or default of appearance, because, it amounts to the appeal having been heard and finally decided on the merits whatever might have been the ground of dismissal of the appeal, and has the effect of confirming the decision of the trial court on merits. But if there had been no contest, no hearing and final decision by any court, at any stage, the decision would not operate as res judicata. [350 A-E] Rai Lakshmi Dasi & Ors. v.
