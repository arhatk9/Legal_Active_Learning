 In October 1963, the respondent was the special correspondent of the appellant company and was entitled to car allowance, free telephone and free newspapers in addition to his basic salary and dearness allowance. On October 8, he tendered his resignation which was accepted on October 21, with effect from the latter date. On October 23, he accepted employment with another Newspaper and thereafter claimed compensation for leave due to him. On November 11, the respondent received a letter from the appellant that the appellant company's rules did not permit any such compensation where an employee had resigned, that in the absence of a proper notice by the respondent there was no termination of his employment and that therefore his acceptance of other employment was in contravention of his conditions of service. On November 21, therefore, the respondent went to the appellant's office, received the letter dated October 21 accepting his resignation, the statement of his account and a cheque for Rs. 2810.47 P. in 'full and final settlement of his claim. The statement of account showed that no compensation for leave due to him was paid and further that in calculating the gratuity payable to him, the, monetary value of free telephone, free newspapers and car allowance were not included as part of his wages.
 The respondent wrote immediately, on the same day, to the appellant setting out the circumstances in which he received the cheque and acceptance of his resignation. According to him he wanted to specify that the full and final settlement did not include compensation for one month's leave; and that the acceptance of his letter 'of resignation was withheld and given to him only after he accepted the cheque for Rs.
 2810.47 P. 'in full and final settlement of his claims'. On December 5, the appellant replied stating that the respondent's claim for leave compensation was not admissible under the company's rules and in view of the final settlement the matter may be closed. The respondent's claim was thereafter referred to the Labour Court. In his statement of claim, the respondent claimed, (a) gratuity on the basis that his monthly wages included the car allowance and Rs. 50, being the estimated value of the benefit of a free telephone and newspapers and (b) one month's wages as compensation for the month's leave, in all Rs. 6000.34 P. He did not deduct the amount of Rs. 2810.47 P. as he had not encashed the cheque for that amount. The Labour Court decreed part of the respondent's claim.
 In appeal to this Court, on the question : (1) Whether the respondent, not being in the appellant's employment at the time he filed his claim in the Labour Court, was not entitled to avail himself of the provisions of the Working Journalists (Conditions of Service) and Miscellaneous Pro- vision Act, 1955; (2) Whether the respondent, having signed the receipt in full settlement of his claim was estopped from making claims in respect of his leave for one month, the car allowance, and the estimated benefit of the free telephone and newspapers; and (3) Whether the monetary value of the free telephone and newspapers and the car allowance would be 182 included as part of his wages for calculating gratuity, 
HELD : (1) Since the definition of 'an employes in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and the C.P. & Berar Industrial Disputes Settlement Act (23 of 1947), were, in language, similar to the one used in Working Journalists (Conditions of Service) and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, the decision in Western India Automobile Association v.
 Industrial Tribunal, [1949] F.C.R. 321 and Central Provinces Transport Services Ltd. v. Raghunath, [1956] INSC 66; [1956] S.C.R. 956, interpreting the word 'employee,' in those two Acts, would be authorities for the view that an ex-employee would 'also be a working journalist. There is no conflict of opinion between these two decisions and the decision in Dharangadhara Chemical Works Ltd. v. State of Saurashtra, [1956] INSC 74; [1957] S.C.R. 152 and Workmen v. The Management of Dimakuchi Tea Estate, [1958] INSC 3; [1958] S.C.R. 1156. Even assuming there is some conflict the definitions of a 'newspaper employee' and 'working journalist' being subject to a context to the contrary, the, benefit of ss. 5 and 17 of the Working Journalists Act is available to an ex-employee, though he has ceased to be in the employment of the particular newspaper establishment at the time of his application for gratuity. The only requirement is that the claim in dispute must be one which has arisen or accrued whilst the claimant was in the employment of the person against whom it is made.
 Therefore, the respondent was entitled to maintain his application. [189 E-F; 192 B-H] Dharangadhara Chemical Works Ltd. v. State of Saurashtra, [1956] INSC 74; [1957] S.C.R. 152 and Workmen v. The Management of Dimakuchi Tea Estate, [1958] INSC 3; [1958] S.C.R. 1156, explained.
 (2)(a) Assuming the technical rule of estoppel set out in s. 115 of the Evidence Act is applicable to industrial adjudication, the rule could not be invoked against the claim for compensation for the leave period. The letter of the respondent dated 21st November and the appellant's reply dated 5th December show that the respondent was always making the claim and never gave it up and that the company's case was also not that the respondent gave, up the claim, but that the appellant company's rules did not permit such compensation. The appellant did not produce any such rules before the Labour Court and a belated referernce to any such rule in this Court could not be permitted without opportunity to the respondent to controvert it. [193 D; 194 E] (b)Under s. 115 of the Evidence Act, the representation which estops a person making it from acting contrary to it is one on the belief of which the, other person acts in a manner he would not have done but for it and on believing it to be true,. But such a conclusion could not be drawn in face of the uncontradicted statements in the letter of the respondent dated 21st November that the management would not give him the letter of acceptance of his resignation unless he signed the receipt in full settlement of all his claims.
 When he received the letter dated November 19, the respondent could not rest content without jeopardizing his interests on the mere oral intimation of acceptance of his resignation and so be went to the appellant's Office to secure the written acceptance. He was then told that it would not be given unless he passed a receipt in full settlement of his claim and he signed the receipt under the stress of circumstances. [195 H-196 B] (3)Under s. 2(rr) of the Act, 'wages' means all remuneration capable of being expressed in terms of money payable to a workman in respect of his employment or work done in such employment and includes, inter alia, such allowance as the workmen is for the time being entitled to.
 The car allowance and benefit of free telephone and newspaper cannot be said 183 to be remuneration payable in respect of employment or work done in, such employment. Neither the car allowance nor the benefit of the telephone was given to the respondent in respect of his employment or work done in such employment as they were not restricted to the employment or the, work done by him as special correspondent. He was entitled to them whether he used them or not in connection with his employment or his work as a special correspondent. They would however fall under the inclusive part of the definition as 'allowances'. Since they were allowed to him to directly reduce the expenditure which would otherwise have gone into his family budget, they were items relevant in the fixation of fair wages and were properly regarded as part of the respondent's wages. Therefore, they should be taken into consideration for the calculation of gratuity payable to him. [196 H; 197 F-H] Hindustan Antibiotics Ltd. v. Workmen, [1966] INSC 199; [1967] 1 S.C.R. 652 674-675, followed.
