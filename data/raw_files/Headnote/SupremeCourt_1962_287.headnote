 The respondents, who were manufacturers of Vegetable products known as Vanaspati, were assessed to excise duty under item 23 of the First Schedule to the Central Excises and Salt Act,' 1944. on what the taxing authorities called the manufacture of refind oil from raw oil 'Which according to them fell within the description of 'vegetable non- essential oils, all sorts, in or in relation to the manufacture of which any process is ordinarily carried on with the aid of power". The common case made by the respondents in their petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution challenging the imposition was that for the purpose of manufacturing Vanaspati they purchased groundnut and til oil from the market and subjected them to different processed before applying hydrogenation to produce Vanaspati and that nothing that they produced at any stage was covered by that item. Affidavits by experts were filed by both the parties and the High Court found in favour of the respondents and allowed the petitions. The Union of India appealed. It was urged on its behalf that before finally producing Vanaspati the respondents produced at an intermediate stage what was known as refined oil' in the market and although they might not sell it and although Vanaspati, when produced, was liable to excise duty under another item, that could not affect their liability.
 Held, that excise duty being leviable on the manufacture of goods and not on their sale, the petitioners would no doubt be liable if they produced refined oil', as known in the market, at an intermediate stage. But it was clear that there could be no ,refined oil' as known in the market without deodorisatio,n according to the specification of the Indian Standards Institute and the affidavits of the experts. Since, however, the process 587 of, deodorisation was admittedly applied in the respondents'. factories only after hydrogenation was' complete,' they could not said to produce 'refined oil' at any stage.
 Nor could the respondents be held to manufacture kind of non -essential vegetable oil'. Processing- cannot be equated to manufacture' which means bringing into existence a new substance.
 The Legislature by defining the word 'manufacture' in s.2(f) of the Act did not intend to make the 'mere processing of goods liable to duty.
 The words "all sorts" in item 23 are intended only-,Po make it clear that vegetable non-essential oils. whether raw or refined, from whatever raw material produced, will be liable to excise duty.
