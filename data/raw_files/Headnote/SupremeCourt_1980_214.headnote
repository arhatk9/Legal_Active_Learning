 Maintaining the conviction, allowing the appeals as to sentence and releasing the accused on Probation the Court ^ 
 HELD: Sentencing an accused person is a sensitive exercise of discretion and not a routine or mechanical prescription acting as hunch. The social background and the personal factors or the crime-doer are very relevant, although in practice Criminal Courts have hardly paid attention to the social milieu or the personal circumstances of the offender. Even if Section 360 Criminal Procedure Code is not attached, it is the duty of the sentencing court to be activist enough to collect such facts as have a bearing on punishment with rehabilitating slant. The Bench must fulfil the humanising mission of sentencing implicit in such enactment as the Probation of offenders Act. [1279 H. 1280 A-D]
