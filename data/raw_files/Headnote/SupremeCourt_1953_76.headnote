 The Supreme Court has no power under section 527 of the Criminal Procedure Code or under any other provision of law to transfer from a High Court,. proceedings which that High Court has initiated for contempt of itself, to another High Court.
 Section 527 of the Criminal Procedure Code does not apply to such a case as the power of a High Court to institute proceedings for contempt of itself and to punish the contemner where necessary, is a special jurisdiction which is inherent in all courts of record and section 1 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code excludes such special jurisdictions 'from its scope.
 It-is desirable, on general principles of justice, that a judge who has been personally attacked should not as far as possible bear a contempt matter which, to that extent, concerns him personally.
