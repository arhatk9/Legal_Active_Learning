 The appellant-management served on the respondent a charge sheet to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against him for his misconduct in lodging a false complaint to the police against some of the officers of the appellant, and, after inquiry, dismissed him. The industrial dispute regarding the dismissal of this workman and some others was referred to the Labour Court which upheld the orders of dismissal. The Labour Court also rejected the plea that the orders of dismissal were passed during the pendency of conciliation proceedings and were therefore illegal, on the ground such pendency was not established. The High Court in a writ petition. filed by the respondent, held that it was necessary for the Labour Court to first go into question whether or not there was v conciliation proceeding pending at the date of the dismissal order with a view to find out whether the impugned order of dismissal was passed in contravention of s. 33(2)(b) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, and remitted the matter back to the Labour Court for deciding the question after giving an opportunity to the respondent.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD: (1) Section 33(2)(b) of the Act relates to the dissssal, discharge etc. of a workman for any misconduct not connected with an industrial dispute during the pendency of a conciliation proceeding before a conciliation officer or Board or of 'any proceeding before a Labour Court or Tribunal, and prohibits such- discharge or dismissal unless he has been paid wages for one month and an application has been made by the employer to the authority before which the proceeding was pending for approval of such action.
 Section33-Aenables a workman who has been punished by dismissal or discharge etc., to make a complaint in writing to a Labour Court, Tribunal, or National Tribunal when an employer contravenes the provisions of s. 33 during the pendency of the proceedings before a Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal. If such a complaint is made the Labour Court or Tribunal is to adjudicate upon the complaint as if it were a dispute referred to or pending before it and in accordance with the provisions of the Act submit its award to the appropriate Government; that is, the workman does not have to wait for a reference of an industrial dispute but can himself prefer his complaint which is 267 to be treated as a dispute under s. 10, and it would be the duty of the Labour Court to examine the merits of the case in the light of the principles formulated in the Indian Iron Steel Company case[1957] INSC 85; , [1958] S.C.R. 667. These sections do not require that as soon as the Labour Court or Tribunal finds that there has been a violation of s. 33 it should award reinstatement. [272C-H; 273A] (2) It has not been alleged in this case that conciliation proceedings were pending before the Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal as envisaged in s. 33A. Assuming that there was a conciliation proceedings before the labour officer, s. 33A would not be attracted. [273B-C] (3) The Tribunal rightly refused to go into the question of the pendency of any council on proceeding; because, even if there was any such proceedings, it would make no difference to the result of the case. The Labour Court would still have to consider whether the employer's action was justified and would have to be satisfied that the allegations about want of good faith or victimisation or unfair labour practice were baseless, that the inquiry was not vitiated by basic effort or violation of any principles of natural justice, and that the order of dismissal was not perverse.
 [274D-F] In the present case, the Labour Court held on the material before it-the lodging of the complaint was not disputed, that the allegations were false was not denied and the humiliation to the officers was not contradicted that the respondent's action was subversive of discipline which merited dismissal. [274G-H; 275F-H] Indian Iron and Steel Co. Ltd. v. The Workmen, [1958] S.C.R.
 667, Punjab National Bank Ltd. v. Its Workmen, [1959] INSC 121; [1960] 1 S.C.R. 806 and Rodrick V. Karam Chand Thapar and Anr. [1963] 1 L.L.J. 248 (S.C.) referred to.
