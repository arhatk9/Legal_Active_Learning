 The appellant was in possession of the field under a sale deed executed by his mother in his favour till the day prior to the incident. When he went to the field, he saw the deceased and his companions ploughing the field. He asked them to unyoke the bullocks. On refusal he assaulted the unarmed deceased with a stick on the head while he was sitting on the ridge, which resulted in his death.
 The Trial Court acquitted the appellant giving him the benefit of the right of private defence to person and property. The High Court in appeal, reversed the finding of the Trial court holding that he had no such right and convicted the appellant under Section 302 and sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment for life.
 Dismissing the appellants' appeal, this Court, HEAD : 1. A rightful owner in peaceful possession of his land is entitled to defend his property against any person or persons who threaten to dispossess him. The law does not except any cowardice on his part when there is real and imminent danger to his property from outside sources.
 Thus a rightful owner is entitled to throw out, by using such force as would in the circumstances of the case appear to be reasonably necessary, any person who tries to invade his right to peaceful possession of his property. But if the trespasser has settled in the possession of the property, the course which the rightful person must adopt is to recover possession in accordance with law and not by force.
 In such a case the trespasser would be entitled to defend his possession even against a rightful owner if the latter tries to evict him by use of force. [196B-C] 192 
 2. The appellant had a right to confront the prosecution party which was guilty of criminal trespass and could have used reasonable force to clear the encroachment, but he could not use it as a pretext or excuse to settle the old dispute regarding the title to the land. He clearly abused the right and in the guise of protecting his property he attacked an unarmed person who was sitting at distance by inflicting heavy blows on the vital part of his body, namely, the skull, causing multiple fractures. The deceased had not offered any resistance, he was unarmed and was in sitting posture when the blows were hit giving him no chance even to run away. The appellant abused the right arising out of the trespass to kill the deceased. This was a case of intentional murder and not something done in the exercise of right to protect the property. [197B-D] 
 3. In the instant case, the appellant inflicted more than one blow on the deceased on seeing him on his land.
 There was no grave or sudden provocation as urged by counsel for the appellant. The medical evidence clearly shows that the blows were vicious and on the head resulting in the fractures of the parietal bone. In such circumstances, the case cannot fall either under Section 304 Part I or part II, IPC. The appellant will surrender to his bail and serve out the remaining part of his sentence. [197E-G]
