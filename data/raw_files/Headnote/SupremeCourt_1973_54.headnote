 The appellant-Government passed an order revising minimum wages in the Bidi industry. It was based on the recommendation of a Committee of six members consisting of persons representing employers and employees and the Chief inspector and Deputy Chief Inspector of Factories. Section 9 of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, requires that the Committee shall consist of an equal number of representatives of the employer and the employees and of independent persons not exceeding one third of its total number. On the question whether the two Government officials could be regarded as independent persons, 
HELD : The mere fact that they happened to be Government officials or Government servants will not divest them of the character of independent persons. [761C] The language of s. 9 does not contain any indication that persons in the employment of the Government would be excluded from the category of 'independent persons'. These words have essentially been employed in contradistinction to representatives of employers and employees. In other words, apart from the representatives of employers and employees there should be persons who should be independent of them.
 [76OG-H] Further, the presence of high government officials, who may have actual working knowledge about the problems of employers and employees can afford a good deal of guidance and assistance in formulating the advice which is to be tendered. It may be that in certain circumstances such persons may cease to have an independent character if the question of fixation of minimum wages in an employment in which the appropriate Government is directly interested, arises. It would therefore depend upon the facts of each particular case whether the persons who have been appointed could be regarded' as independent or not. It is not correct to say that a Government official will have a bias or that he may favour the policy which the appropriate Government may be inclined to adopt. be,cause, when he is a member of an Advisory Committee he is expected to give an impartial and independent advice and not merely carry out what the Government may be inclined to do. Government officials are responsible persons and are capable of taking a detached and impartial view.
