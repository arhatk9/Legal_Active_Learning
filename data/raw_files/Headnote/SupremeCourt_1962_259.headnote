 A scheme for operating a motor transport service on the Jaipur-Kotah route by the State Roadways was published in the Government Gazette. 61 private operators on the route filed objections to the scheme. The Legal Remembrancer heard the objections and rejected them. The scheme was approved by the State Government and was published. Some of the .operators moved the High Court for a writ quashing the scheme. The High Court allowed the petition, set aside the scheme and directed the Legal Remembrancer to rehear the objections. The Legal Remembrancer sent individual notices by registered post to the 61 operators fixing the date of hearing and also published the notice in the Gazette.
 Notices were delivered to 13 operators and 39 were returned unserved. The Legal Remembrancer heard the objections and approved the scheme, which was then published in the Gazette. The Regional Transport Authority issued an order declaring that the Roadways shall operate on the route and cancelled the permits of the private operators. The Roadways, commenced operating without permits but subsequently they were granted permits. The appellants moved the High Court for a writ to quash the scheme but the High Court rejected the application. The appellants appealed to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court; one of them filed a petition for a writ alleging that his right to carry on business was infringed. The appellants contended that the proceedings before the Legal Remembrancer were illegal as notices were not served upon all the operators, that r.7(4) which provided that on the publication of the notice in the Gazette it shall be presumed that all the parties concerned have been duly intimated was illegal and that the plying of the vehicles by the Roadways without obtaining permits infringed 100 the fundamental rights of the appellants to carry on their Held, that the appellants were duly served with the notice of hearing of the objections before the Legal Remembrancer, and if they failed to appear before him to press their objections they could not challenge the scheme after it was duly published and had become final. The Legal Remembrancer was of the opinion that even those operators who had not been personally served had notice of the hearing. The opinion' of the Legal Remembrancer was based upon evidence and he did not rely upon the presumption under r.7(4). The High Court had also held that the objectors were duly served and the Supreme Court, according to its settled practice, did not interfere with such findings.
 Held, further, that no fundamental right of the appellants was infringed. Once a scheme was legally and properly made and published, the permits' of the private operators on the route could be lawfully cancelled and they Would not be entitled to challenge the plying of the vehicles by the State Roadways with or without permits. Since the permits of the appellants were lawfully cancelled their rights Were extinguished and they had no fundamental rights which could be infringed.. On the finalisation of the scheme the Regional Transport Authority had no option but to grant permits to the State Roadways.
