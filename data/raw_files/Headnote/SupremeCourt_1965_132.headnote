 The names of the predecessors of the appellants were recorded as mortgagees in the villages records in respect of a property, owned by persons who later migrated to Pakistan.
 The Custodian of Evacuee Property issued a notice under s.
 7(1) of the Administration of Evacuee Property Act, 1950 to these persons and the predecessors of the appellants stating that the predecessors of the appellants were in illegal possession of the property and to show cause why the property should not be declared as evacuee property. The notice was affixed at a conspicuous place in the village.
 It could not be served on the predecessors of the appellants who had died long before the issue of the notice. Since no objections were filed, the Custodian declared the property as evacuee property. No action was also taken to separate the interest of the evacuees from those of the mortgagees under the Evacuee Interest (Separation) Act. The appellants filed a writ petition in the High Court for quashing the later order declaring the property as evacuee property and to restrain the respondent to interfere with their possession. The High Court dismissed the petition holding that issue of the notice to the predecessors of the appellant, was sufficient compliance tinder s. 7(1) of the Act. In appeal to this Court.
 
HELD : The Custodian can form his opinion about any property having become evacuee proPerty on the basis of information available to him, and issue notice to persons interested also on the basis of such information. He is not expected to hold a general. inquiry of the persons interested in the alleged evacue property. lie had complied with the requirements of s. 7(1) of the Act to give notice to the predecessors of the appellants who resided at -some other place and about whom he could have no knowledge whether they were alive or not. The notice was,however, ineffective and not good as the predecessors of the appellants had died long before. [165 D-H] Abdul Hokim Khan v. The Regional Settlement Commissioner, [1961] INSC 110; [1962] 1 S.C.R. 531, followed.
 The impugned order did not affect the rights of the appellants, if any as mortgagees. The non-issue of the notice to the appellants therefore was of no consequence as the order subsequently passed without the issue of the notice to them did not affect their interest. By virtue of the latter order, the rights of the evacuees in the property suit vested in the Custodian and those right:, consisted of the rights of equity of redemption. This means that the Custodian held the property subject to the mortgagee rights, if any, of the appellants. [166 A-B, E-F] So long as proper action under the Evacuee Interest (Separation) Act was not taken to separate the interest of the evacuees and the appellants 164 who claimed to be the mortgagee the Custodian could not take any action against the appellants or their tenants who were said to be in possession of the property in suit.
