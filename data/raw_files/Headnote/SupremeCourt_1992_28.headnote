 The first appellant and her sister succeeded to the suit premises on the death of their father. Respondent No.
 2 was the tenant in the premises. The first appellant who was managing the property on her behalf as also on behalf of her sister, who was residing elsewhere, instituted a suit for eviction of Respondent No.2 on the ground of non-payment of rent. She did not join her sister as co-plaintiff. The defendant-Respondent No. 2 took the plea that his wife was the tenant and that she had already deposited the rent under Section 30 of the U.P. Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent and Eviction) Act, 1972. The trial court rejected the defence and decreed the suit. On an appeal by the defendants, the High Court reversed the decree and dismissed the suit for non-joinder of the plaintiff's sister.
 The present appeal, by special leave, is against the High Court's order. The appellant contended that the expression `land-lord' in Section 3(j) of the Act was not limited to denote the owner of the house, but should be understood in a wider sense to include a person to whom rent is payable, as also, the agent of such a person, such as the plaintiff-appellant in the instant case.
 Allowing the appeal, this Court, 
 HELD: 1. Since appellant No. 1 was entrusted with the management 357 of the house as her sister was staying with her husband elsewhere and it was appellant No. 1 who had inducted the respondent No.2 in the premises as a tenant, it was not open to the tenant-respondent to question her authority. If he was desirous of contesting the factual aspect, it was essential for him to have raised the issue of non- maintainability in his written statement which was not done.
 In reversing the decree passed by the trial court the High Court committed a serious error in not appreciating this position. [358 F-H] 
 2. Much significance cannot be attached to the aspect as to whether the husband became defaulter or not when the wife had already offered to pay the rent, in view of the importance of the issue in the proceeding under Section 12 of the U.P. Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent and Eviction) Act, 1972. In that background the parties went to trial and led their full evidence on the point and the trial court dealt with the dispute thoroughly and recorded a finding in favour of the appellants which has been confirmed by the High Court. The respondent, therefore, cannot be allowed to reopen this question. [359C-D]
