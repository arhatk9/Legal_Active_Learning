 The appellant was running two stalls-a tea stall and a refreshment stall-at a railway station. They were allotted to him by the Railway administration under two separate identical agreements of different dates, which provided that the appellant was to run the stalls in accordance with the directions of the Railway administration and among other terms for termination of the agreements, they were also terminable by one month's notice on either side without assigning any reason. As the appellant had committed certain irregularities in running the stalls, a fine was, imposed on him in terms of the agreements. Since the fine was not paid he was given notice to vacate and when he failed to do so, the agreements were terminated, and possession was sought to be secured through the Magistrate under s. 138 of the Indian Railways Act. The appellant moved the Sessions Court and High Court on revision but without success, In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) In view of the fact that the terms of the agreements which govern the parties expressly reserve to the Railway administration extensive power of directing and regulating the appellant's work and also of controlling the manner of doing the work, which is necessary for affording 'amenities to the travelling public, the appellant would be a railway servant as defined in s. 3(7) read with s. 148(2) of the Indian Railways Act, against whom action can be taken under s. 138. [S. L. Puri v. Emperor, A.I.R. 1937 Lahore 547 and R. L. Mazumdar v. Alfred Ernest, A.I.R. 1959 Cal.
 64, approved.] [655 D-F] (2) By reason of being a railway servant the appellant did not automatically become entitled to the protection afforded to Government servants by Art. 311 of the Constitution. He was neither a member of the civil service as contemplated by this Article nor was he dismissed, re-moved or reduced in rank so as to attract Art. 311(2). His rights are confined to the terms of the written agreements and if he considered that they had been wrongfully terminated, he could challenge such termination in civil courts under the law. [654 E-G] (3) The express terms of the appellant's agreements exclude the heritable character of his right which is only a contractual right of a bare licensee subject to the terms of the agreement. No right outside these can be claimed by him. The fact that the appellant. was allotted the stalls in order to rehabilitate him as a displaced person from Pakistan cannot over-ride the terms of the agreements and absolve him of his obligations thereunder and permit him to avoid the consequences of the alleged breaches of agreements on his part., [655 B-D, G-H] 651 (4) Merely because a judicial Magistrate passed the order under s. 138, Indian Railways Act, five days after the dismissal of the appellant's. application under Art. 226 of the Constitution by the Gujarat High Court does not establish malice on the part of the Magistrate. [656 A-B] (5) The relationship of master and servant is characterised by agreement of service, express or implied, and whether or not a given agreement is one of service is a question of fact depending on its terms considered as a whole.
