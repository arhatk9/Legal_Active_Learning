 Section 13(2)(iii) of the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act, 1949 provides that if a tenant has committed such acts as are likely to impair materially the value of utility of the building or rental land the Rent Controller may make an order evicting the tenant. A decree of eviction was passed against the appellant-tenant under this provision. The finding recorded by the Rent Controller was that he had constructed a wall in the varandah of the demised premises and put up a door without permission of the landlord as a result of which the flow of light and air had been stopped and consequently the value of the demised shop had been im- paired and utility of the building was impaired. The decree of Rent Controller was confirmed by the Appellate Authority as well as by the High Court.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that Section 13(2) gave discretion to the Rent Controller to order eviction while in the cases covered under Section 13(3) it was made mandatory to direct eviction of the tenant. Therefore, the Rent Controller had to inde- pendently consider and exercise discretion vested in him keeping in view the proved facts to decree ejectment. It was for the landlord under the circumstances to prove such facts which warranted the Controller to order eviction in his favour and since he had not proved such facts, the Court had committed illegality in granting the decree of ejectment.
 641 Dismissing the appeal, this Court, 
HELD:1. If the tenant had committed such acts as are likely to impair materially the value or utility of the building, he is liable to ejectment. The impairment of the value or utility of the building is from the point of the landlord and not of the tenant. [643 A-C] 2.By constructing the wall, whether the value or utility of the building has materially been impaired is an inferential fact to be deduced from proved facts. In the instant case, the proved facts are that the appellant had constructed the wall and put up a door therein without the consent of the landlord. Consequently, the flow of the air and light has been stopped. He removed the fixtures. From these facts it was inferred that the value or utility of the building has been materially affected. Therefore, it is a finding of fact of which the Court cannot evaluate the evidence and upset that finding. [643 D-E, 642 E] 3.Undoubtedly the statute, on proof of facts, gives discretion to the Court, by Section 13(2) and made mandatory in cases covered by Section 13(3), to order eviction. In a given set of facts the Rent Controller, despite finding that the tenant committed such acts which may impair the value or utility of the building yet may refuse to grant the relief of eviction. It is for the tenant to plead and prove that the circumstances are such. as may not warrant eviction and then the burden shifts on to the landlord to rebut these facts or circumstances. Then the Rent Controller is to weigh pros and cons and exercise the discretion. No such attempt was made by the appellant. So no fault can be laid at the Rent Controller's failure to exercise the discretion.
 [643 G-H, 644 A-B] Om Parkash v. Amar Singh & Anr., A.I.R. 1987 S.C. 617, held inapplicable.
