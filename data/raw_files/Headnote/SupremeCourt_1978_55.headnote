 The Commissioner of Dhanbad Municipality, instituted a suit against the appellant and respondents 2 to 5, for the recovery of holding tax and latrine tax, as arrears of Municipal Taxes for the first quarter of 1950-1951 to the third quarter of 1953-54, in respect of a 'holding' owned by them. The Trial Court dismissed, the suit inter alia on the ground that during a general revision of assessments u/s 106 of the Bihar and Orissa Municipality Act, in 1950-51, the Dhanbad Municipality had failed to revise the original assessment of the defendants holding and had thereby committed a breach of the mandatory provisions of S. 106.
 The old assessment on the basis of which the demand had been raised, had lapsed and there being no revised assessment of the holding, the Municipality was not entitled to realise any tax from the defendants with effect from April 1, 1950.
 The High Court allowed an appeal by the Commissioners of Dhanbad Municipality, but granted a certificate u/Art.
 133(1)(b)(c) of the Constitution.
 Dismissing the appeal the Court, 
HELD : 1. The language of S. 106 is flexible enough to enable the Commissioners to leave out for some good reason, any holding from the revision of the valuation and assessment lists. The word "ordinarily", tones down the force of "shall" which immediately precedes it, and indicates that the requirements with regard to revision of the assessment in every five years and to include all the holdings, are not absolute but only directory, and can be departed from in extraordinary circumstances, or in the case of particular holdings for good reasons. [409 C-D] 
2. In the case of a holding which is excluded from the quinquennial revision of assessments, the old valuation and assessment list do not lapse, but continue to remain in force till they are altered or amended in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Act, and when a new list is completed, then till the 1st day of April following such completion is reached.
