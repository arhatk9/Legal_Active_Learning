 In his election petition the appellant contended that the second respondent who in fact belonged to the Hindu Reddy community contested the election from the reserved constituency falsely claiming that he belonged to the Scheduled Tribe Konda Ready community and that by virtue of section 100(1) (c) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 the election was void. It was also contended that at the time of the scrutiny of the nomination papers the appellant had raised this objection but that the Returning Officer, without holding a proper enquiry, rejected the objection relying upon a certificate of the Tehsildar that the second respondent belonged to the Scheduled Tribe Konda Reddy community. The high Court rejected the election petition and upheld the election.
 Allowing the appeal (by the Court) ^ 
 HELD: There is no dispute that the Konda Reddy community is a Scheduled Tribe community. On the evidence available on record it is impossible for any Court to reasonably conclude that the second respondent belonged to the Konda Reddy Scheduled Tribe community. In fact, he belonged to the Hindu Reddiar community, which is not a Scheduled Tribe community. Therefore, his election from the reserved constituency was void under section 100(1)(c) of the Act.

 With the laudable object of promoting the educational, economic and social advancement of the Backward Classes and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes the Government had been awarding scholarships, hostel accommodation and other facilities, making reservation of seats in Professional Colleges and institutions of higher learning and for appointments to Government and quasi Government jobs. But not infrequently, false certificates are obtained by others to obtain these benefits thus depriving the persons for whose advantage these benefits are created. The false claim in this case which escaped the scrutiny of even the High Court had to be negatived only after considerable effort and expenditure on the part of those who wish to lay bare the facts. The same kind of scrutiny and contest could not be expected from students and 11 candidates belonging to Backward Classes, Scheduled castes and Scheduled Tribes when these benefits are sought on false certificates. So long as the benefits are continued for these classes, the Government machinery must exercise strict scrutiny. The Government must stop any fraud which may be committed on it as well as these classes of people by taking appropriate steps in regard to grant of certificates, while at the same time ensuring that persons belonging to these classes obtain the requisite certificates without difficulty from the authorities empowered to issue the same.
