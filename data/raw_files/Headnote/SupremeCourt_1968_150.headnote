Shortly thereafter the appellant filed his nomination paper for a seat to the State Legislative Assembly, which was rejected. The appellant filed an election petition for setting, aside the election of the respondent on the ground that the appellants nomination paper was improperly rejected. The High Court rejected the petition.
 HELD : The appellant was rightly disqualified.
 (i) The contract was not wholly performed by the appellant.
 Unless he proved that he had completed the contract or showed that there was determination by mutual assent of the contract, the appellant could not claim that there was no subsisting contract at the date of the filing of the nomination paper. The conduct of the appellant in writing the two letters suggested that he did not treat the contract as cancelled, nor there was any clear evidence to show that the authorities bad treated the contract as cancelled. [356 C-E] (ii) The contract resulting from the acceptance of his tender though not enforceable by suit against the State Government, because it did not comply with Art. 299 of the Constitution must still be regarded as disqualifying the appellant under the Representation of People Act from standing as a candidate for election to the State Legislature.
