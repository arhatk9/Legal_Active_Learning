 The cultivating tenant of land belonging to the appellant died leaving his widow and daughter as his heirs. The respondent, who was the daughter's husband and the holder of a power of attorney from the heirs, filed an application before the Sub-Collector, under s. 3(3)(a) of the Madras Cultivating Tenants Protection Act, 1955, for depositing arrears of rent on behalf of the heirs. The appellant objected on the ground that neither the wife nor the daughter was a cultivating tenant under the Act, as they were not personally cultivating the land; but the Sub- Collector overruled the objection and directed the respondent to deposit the arrears. The appellants revision petition to the High Court was dismissed.
 In the appeal to this Court, on the question as to whether the respondent was rightly allowed to deposit the arrears.
 
HELD : The orders of the Courts below should be set aside and the matter remitted to the Sub--Collector for deciding as to whether the respondent was putting in physical labour in the cultivation of the land. [453 E] A son-in-law can be regarded as a member of the family, and therefore, though the heirs of the cultivating tenant were not themselves exerting their physical labour, if the respondent was doing so, the heirs could be regarded as cultivating tenants under s. 2(a) and (ee) of the Act. But as there was no finding as to the nature of work which the respondent was doing, the matter should be remitted to the Sub-Collector for a decision. [452 G-H; 453 A-B, D]
