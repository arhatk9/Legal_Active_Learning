 The assessee was a Hindu undivided family. Its manager was a partner in a firm and the family was entitled to his share of the profits. The partnership agreement provided that the accounts of the firm should be adjusted every calendar year, that is, on the 31st December of each year. On November 12, 1955, by a deed of partition, the family and its property were divided and it was declared that the manager became exclusively entitled to the profits in the partnership from 1st January 1955. In proceedings for assessment for 1955- 56, the corresponding previous year for the assessee being 27th October 1954 to 14th November 1955, the assessees contended that the share in the profits of the partnership should not be included in its taxable income because (i) under the partition deed the profits belonged to the quondam manager exclusively from 1st January 1955 and, (ii) since the partnership made up its accounts at the end of the calendar year, the assessee had no interest in the share of the profits which accrued exclusively to its quondam manager at the end of the year. The Income-tax Officer rejected the contentions. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the Appellate Tribunal held that since there was a disruption in the family only on 12th November 1955, the profits had to be apportioned between the assessee and its manager. The High Court on a reference, held in favour of the assessee accepting the second contention. The Commissioner appealed to the Supreme Court.
 
HELD : The profits accrued to the quondam manager only on 31st December 1955, though they were the result of transactions spread over the entire period of the calendar year 1955. Since on that date the assessee had, because of the partition deed, no interest in the profits or any part thereof, the assessee was not liable to pay any tax on those profits. 1766 C-D; 769 D-E] In the gross receipts of a business day after day or from transaction to transaction lie embedded or dormant profit or loss. On such dormant profits or loss, undoubtedly, taxable profits, if any, of the business Will be computed. But dormant profits cannot be equated with accrued profits charged to tax under ss. 3 and 4 of the Income-tax Act, 1922. The concept of accrual of profits of a business involves the determination by the method of accounting at the end of the accounting year or any shorter period determined by law; and unless a right to the profits comes into existence, there is no accrual of profits. In the case of a partnership, where, by a covenant binding between the parties, the accounts are to be made at stated intervals, the right of a partner to demand his share of the profits does not arise until the contingency under the covenant which gives rise to that right, has arisen.
