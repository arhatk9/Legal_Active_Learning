 Sealed tenders were submitted to the Chief Engineer of the P.W.D. of the respondent-State for a certain construction.
 The tender submitted by the appellant was the lowest unconditional tender, whereas that of the third respondent, though lower in amount was a conditional tender. None of the tenders was accepted by the Chief Engineer. Instead, he wrote to the third respondent asking him if he would withdraw his conditions, and wrote to the other tenderers asking them if they would undertake the work at the lowest amount, that is the amount tendered by the third respondent.
 The replies were to be submitted within a week of the receipt of the letters by the tenderers, but the third respondent submitted his reply. withdrawing his conditions, beyond that time. The appellant wrote that his tender being unconditional should have been accepted. The Chief Engineer again wrote to the appellant asking him to send a categorical reply and the appellant 'replied that he was not prepared to reduce the amount. The third respondent wrote thereafter asking for a higher payment, and so, the Major Irrigation Projects Control Board, which was the final accepting authority, directed that fresh negotiations should be opened with all the tenderers. The Chief Engineer therefore again called for tenders and wrote to all the tenderer% if they were prepared to reduce the amounts. The appellant did not send any revised quotations but protested against the action taken by the Chief Engineer. As the offers made by the others in their second tenders were not advantageous to the Government, the Chief Engineer called a meeting of all the tenderers and asked them if they were prepared to make further reductions. 'MO appellant and some other tenderers stated that they had no further reduction to make, two of the tenderers said that they would write later, while the third respondent wrote immediately reducing the amount of his tender. The Chief Engineer made a report to the Technical SubCommittee which made its recommendations to the Board and the Board accepted the third respondent's final tender.
 The appellant filed a writ petition challenging the grant of the contract to the third 'respondent on the grounds that :
 (1) the rules in the Mysore Public Works Department Code were not followed; and (2) there was a violation of Art. 14 because, (a) the Chief Engineer accepted the first offer of the third respondent beyond the prescribed period of one week, and (b) the Chief Engineer favored the third respondent by entering into secret negotiations with him.
 The High Court dismissed the petition.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (i) There is no statute nor any Article of the Constitution which confers any authority on the State Government to issue rules in matters with which the Code was concerned. Article 162 of the Constitution only provides that the State Government can take executive action in all matters in which the legislature of the State can pass laws.
 But 637 the Article by itself does not confer any rule making power on the State Government. Therefore, the instructions in the Code were mere administrative instructions and even if there was a breach thereof the appellant had no right to apply to the Court for quashing orders in breach of such instructions. [643B-E] (2) There was no discrimination by the Chief Engineer.
 (a) The period of seven days fixed by the Chief Engineer for sending the reply was not a period of' limitation, no other tender's reply was rejected an that ground, and even the appellant was given extended time to reply, showing that the period was not meant to be rigid. [644A-C] (b) There was no evidence of any secret negotiations between the chief Engineer and the third respondent. [644G]
