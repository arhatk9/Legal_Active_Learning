 Persons in opposition when the Congress Party was in power in the Bihar State formed the Government on the voting out of office of the Congress Ministry. As soon as the succeeding ministry took over, the Governor announced institution of an inquiry into the conduct of the appellants who were ministers in the Congress Ministry, and a notification ordering the enquiry was issued. The notification was issued by the Governor, after 5 years of his entering upon the office. The appellants unsuccessfully filed a writ petition in the High Court. In appeal to this Court, the appellants contended that (i) the Governor's term having come to an end under the Constitution, he was functus officio and could not order the inquiry : (ii) power could not be exercised by the succeeding Ministry to institute inquiry into the conduct of the Ministry that goes out and (iii) the inquiry was the result of malice and political vendetta and the grounds were false and scurrilous.
 HELD : The appeal must fail.
 (i) The proviso to Art. 156(3) contemplates that the Governor is to continue to hold office 'notwithstanding the expiration of his term'. The effect of these words is to exclude all questions of the legality of the holding of office by a Governor after the expiry of his term. There must always be a Governor under Art. 153 and the interregnums is avoided by the proviso. There will immediately be an interregnums, if after the term is over, the Governor designate declines the office. No doubt the provisions of Art. 160 may be resort-ad to but even that may not be sufficient to prevent an interregnums. Therefore, a person once appointed a Governor continues to hold that office till his successor enters upon his office. The successor may be appointed under Art. 155 or an order may be made under Art. 160. There may be cases in which neglect to appoint a Governor soon may lead to an inference of failure to act under the Constitution and it may require further examination as to the remedy in such cases. [392 D-H] (ii)When a Ministry goes out of office, its successor may consider any glaring charges and may, if justified, order an inquiry. Otherwise, each Ministry will become a law into itself and the corrupt conduct of its Ministers will remain beyond scrutiny. [393 C] Shri P. V. Jagannath Rao v. State of Orissa, [1968] 3 S.C.R.
 789 followed.
 (iii)Without saying anything as to their merits. the charges were specific, and details and particulars of -each charge had been stated. The charges were such that an enquiry could be ordered. Whether they are true or false is another matter which ought to be gone into by the Commission.
 Public life of persons in authority must never admit of such 388 charges being even framed against them. If they can he made then an enquiry whether to establish them or to clear the name of the person charged is called for. [393 H-394 C], Whether the action was malafide or not could only be decided if it could be held that the allegations were false. The Court was not enquiring into the charges. [394 E]
