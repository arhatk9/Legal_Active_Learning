 The appellants in Civil Appeals No. 2627 & 2628 of 1977 joined superior Civil service of the erstwhile Indian State of Hyderabad in the year 1945 and 1942 respectively. At that time their conditions of service were governed by the Hyderabad Civil Services Regulations promulgated in obedience to the Nizam's Firman. Regulation 6 of these Regulations inter alia provided that an officer's claim to pension was regulated by the rules in force at the time when the officer retired, Regulation 313(b) provided that the maximum pension ordinarily admissible would be Osmania Sikka (O.S.) Rs. 1,000 a month. 'The erstwhile Indian Slate of Hyderabad had its own currency known as The "Osmania Sikka" denominated in short as "O.S." and the phrase " O.S." Rs.
 1000 a month" which occurred in clause (h) of Regulation 313 meant Osmania Sikka Rs. 1000 a month. The Government of India currency was known as Indian Government currency" and denominated in short as "I.G. currency". The standard rate of exchange was 7 O.S. rupees for 6 I.G. rupees.
 Under clause (22) of section 2 of the Hyderabad General Clauses Act (No. III of 1308 F.), as it then stood, 'rupee" meant a rupee in the O.S. Currency.
 On the coming into force of the Constitution of India on January 26, 1950, Hyderabad became a part of the territory of India. Consequently the Hyderabad Currency was demonetized with effect from April 1, 1953 and the Hyderabad Currency Demonetization (Consequential and Miscellaneous Provision ) Act, 1953 (Hyderabad Act No. I of 1953) was enacted. Section 2 of the Demonetization Act provided that references in any Hyderabad law, regulations Etc. which immediately before the commencement of this Act were in force in 909 the Hyderabad State shall be construed as if references therein to any amounts in the O.S. Currency were references to the equivalent amounts in I.G. Currency according to the standard rate of exchange. By the Demonetization Act, clause (22) of section 2 of the Hyderabad General Clauses Act was substituted by a new clause which provided that rupee means a rupee in I.G. Currency and fractional denominations of a rupee shall be construed accordingly In 1954, in exercise of the powers under Article 309 of the Constitution the Rajpramukh of the State of Hyderabad promulgated the Hyderabad Civil Services Rules. Rule 4 of these Rules provides, inter alia, that Government servant s claim to pension would be regulated by the rules in force at the time when the Government servant retires. Rule 299 provides for pension Clause (b) of Rule 299 provides that the maximum pension ordinarily admissible will be Rs. 1000 a month. Rule 299 was later renumbered as sub-rule (1) and a new sub-rule (2) was added which is not relevant. By a notification dated February 3, 1971, the Governor of Andhra Pradesh amended clause (b) of sub-rule (1) of rule 299 of the Hyderabad Civil Services Rules and substituted Rs.
 857.15 for the expression Rs, 1000.
 After the passing of the States Reorganization Act, 1956 the services of the two appellants were transferred to the State of Andhra Pradesh under section 115 of the States Reorganization Act. The two appellants retired in April 1972 and April 1973 respectively. At the time of their retirement, the appellants pension was fixed at Rs. 683.11 per month and Rs. 857.15 respectively on the basis that the amount of maximum pension admissible under clause (b) of Rule 299(1) of the Hyderabad Civil Services Rules as amended by notification dated February 3, 1971 was Rs. 857.15. The appellants thereupon filed two writ petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution in the High Court challenging the said amendment made to clause (b) of Rule 299(1) inter alia on the ground that under the proviso to sub-section (7) of section 115 of the State Reorganization Act, 1956 the amendment required the previous approval of the Central Government which had not been obtained. A single Judge of the High Court allowed both the writ petition and issued a writ of mandamus in each of them directing the State of Andhra Pradesh to fix the pension on the basis that the maximum pension admissible under the said rule 299(1)(b) of the Hyderabad Civil Services Rules was Rs. 1000 per month and not Rs. 857.15 per month. In the appeals filed by the State a Division Bench of the High Court by a common judgment held that the amendment was valid as the letter dated April 28, 1973 from the Joint Secretary to the Government of India, to the Secretary to the Government of Andhra Pradesh was in the nature of a previous approval given by the Central Government within the meaning of the proviso to sub-section (7) of section 115 of the State Reorganization Act, 1956, to the impugned amendment to the clause (b) of Rule 299(1) of the Hyderabad Civil Services Rules. Hence these appeals.
 The Appellants contended that the letter dated April 28, 1973, from the Joint Secretary to the Government of India, did not amount to the previous approval of the Central Government to the amendment made by the State Government to clause (b) of Rule 299(1) and the amendment was, therefore, invalid and inoperative.
 910 The Respondent contended that irrespective of the amendment made in clauses (b) of Rule 299(1) by The notification dated February 3, 1971, the maximum pension actually admissible under the clause (b) was only Rs. 857.15 in as much as the sum of Rs. 1000 mentioned in the clause (b) prior to its amendment was not Rs. 1000 in Government of India Currency but in the former Hyderabad Currency, namely, Osmania Sikka, and that the Letters "O.S." which denominated Osmania Sikka in short were omitted from the said Rule 299(1)(b) by an inadvertent printing error.
 Allowing the appeals, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The Appellants are entitled to receive pension on the basis that the maximum pension admissible under clause (b) of sub-rule (1) of Rule 99 of the Hyderabad Civil Services Rules is Rs. 1000 per month in Government of India Currency and not Rs. 857.15 per month in that Currency. [928 F] 
 2.1 The first question is whether the omission of the description "O.S." before Rs. 1000 a month in clause (b) of Rule 299 was the result of an in advertent printing error as contended by the Respondent or was a departure deliberately made from what was provided in clause (b) of regulation 313 in order to provide higher pension to Government servants in superior service. In this connection it is pertinent to note that the Rules were made after the erstwhile Indian State of Hyderabad had become a part of the territory of India and after the Demonetization Act had been enacted and had come into force and clause (2) of section 2 of the Hyderabad General Clauses Act (which defined the term rupee ) substituted by a new clause by that Act. After the Demonetization Act there could be no question of any Act or Rules providing for any payment in Osmania Sikka. The word rupees in clause (b) or Rule 299 can, therefore, only refer to rupees in I.G. Currency and not to rupees in O.S.
 Currency. It is pertinent to point out that the Rules were not a mere reproduction of the Regulations. The arrangement of the Rules is in several respects different from the arrangement of the Regulations. There is no where any amount mentioned in the Rules of O.S. Currency nor are the different amounts mentioned in the Rules the exact equivalent in I.G. Currency of the amounts in O.S. Currency mentioned in the Regulations. It is also significant that Regulation 308 provided that a pension was ordinarily fixed in the current coin of the Hyderabad State even though it might have to be raid to persons residing outside the Hyderabad State, and that in special cases it might be fixed in Government of India Currency subject to the condition that the maximum of O.S. Rs 1000 per mensem fixed in clauses (b) of Regulation 313 was not exceed ed under any circumstances. The note to Regulation 308 stated that a pension transferred to India might be converted from the current coin of the Hyderabad State Indian Government Currency under the principle laid down in the said Regulation. In the Rules, there is no provision corresponding to Regulation 308. If there is any doubt (assuming that there can be any), it is most easily resolved by referring to the Preface to the Eight Edition of the Hyderabad Civil Services Rules Manual, which for the first time published the Rules in a book form. In paragraph 3 of the said Preface, the Secretary to Government, Finance Department, Hyderabad, has expressly stated: The figures for amounts of rupees and annas mentioned in the rules are all in Indian Government Currency. There can thus be no scope for any argument that the sum or 911 Rs. 1000 mentioned as being admissible for maximum pension in clause (b) of Rule 299 was Rs. 1000 in Indian Government Currency and not in Osmania Sikka. [921 D-H; 922 A-D] 
 2.2 Moreover, the question whether in clause (b) of Rule 299(1) the sum of Rs. 1000 is mentioned in Government of India Currency or in O.S. Currency has been finally decided and it is not open to the Respondent to reagitate this question because in Daulat Rai & Ors. v. State of Andhra Pradesh Writ Petition No. 3318 of 1969, in which a single Judge of Andhra High Court held that there was no error in mentioning Rs. 1000 in clause (b) of Rule 299(1).
 This was confirmed in State of Andhra Pradesh v. Daulat Rai and Ors Letters Patent Writ Appeal No. 568 of 1970, decided on 24.9.1970. Against This decision the Special Leave Petition filed in the Supreme Court was dismissed. This point was also not taken by the Respondent in the High Court and for the reason also it is not open to the Respondent to urge it before this Court. [923 B-E] C 
 3. The second question is of the validity of Government Notification dated February 3, 1971, amending Clause (b) of sub-rule (1) of Rule 299. Pension is a condition of service as already held by this Court in State of Madhya Pradesh v.
 Shardul Singh. The proviso to sub section (7) of section 115 of the States Reorganization Act provides that the conditions of service of a government servant shall not be varied to his disadvantage except with the previous approval of the Central Government. The Respondents contention is that letter dated April 28, 1973 from the Government of India amounts to previous approval of the Central Government. By letter dated March 13, 1973 the Government of India was requested to accord approval to the said amendment if it considered it necessary so to do. But its reply dated April 12, 1973, the Government of India categorically stated that the amendment did not require its prior approval under section 115 and, therefore, did not give any approval to the said amendment, To equate the not giving of approval with a prior approval satisfying the requirements of the proviso to sub-section (7) of section 115 appears to US to be a contradiction in terms as also to say that a letter written on April 28, 1973 was a prior approval given to an amendment which was made more than two years ago earlier on February 3, 1971. The statement made in the letter dated March 13, 1973, that by the said amendment the conditions of service were not being varied was incorrect because by the said amendment the maximum pension of Rs. 1000 per month in I.G.
 Currency was being reduced to the equivalent in that Currency of O.S. Rs. 1000 per month, namely, to Rs. 857.15 per month, and that too with retrospective effect from the date of the coming into force of Rules, namely, October 1, 1954. For such an amendment the previous approval of the Central Government was required by the proviso to sub- section (7) of section 115. Such approval was not given and the amendment made by the said Notification was, therefore, invalid and inoperative so far as it concerned persons referred to in sub-section (1) and (2) of section 115 of the States Reorganization Act. [923 F; 925 E; 927 C-G] State of Madhya Pradesh and Others v. Shardul Singh [1070] 3 S.C.R. 302 at p. 306, referred to.
 4, There is no substance in tho Respondent's s contention that the appel- 912 lants had waived their right to receive pension on the basis that the maximum pension admissible under clause (b) of Rule 299(1) ii Rs. 1000 and were therefore, estopped from claiming pension on that basis. This point was never taken in the High Court. Further, apart from the fact that there cannot be any waiver of the right to receive Pension payable under the Rules made in that behalf there is no factual basis whatever for this contention.
