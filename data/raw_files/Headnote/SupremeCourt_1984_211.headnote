 At one time all holders of supervisory posts in the office of the Accountant General, West Bengal were required to pass the Subordinate Accounts Service Examination before crossings the age of 45 years. In 1966, for improving the working of the office of the Civil Accountants General, a scheme was framed by an office order No. TM 96 dated June 8, 1966. The scheme provided that passing the Subordinate Accounts Service Examination would not be a necessary qualification for holding supervisory posts where the work involved was entirely of an accounting-cum-administrative nature and the knowledge of rules and accounts of a very high standard was not required. To be eligible for promotions the Upper Division Clerks and Selection Grade Clerks should have put in not less than 20 years of service in the Upper Division Clerical Cadre and should have exhausted all chances of appearing in the Subordinate Accounts Service examination or by reason of being over 45 years of age were no longer eligible to appear at the Subordinate Accounts Service Examination. The appointments were temporary and the appointees were not eligible for further promotion. A number of appointments were made under the scheme. The appellants challenged the appointments on the ground that in confining the zone of eligibility to Upper Division Clerks who had not passed the Subordinate Accounts Service Examination the scheme brought about an invidious discrimination which was violative of Arts. 14 and 16 of the Constitution. A single Judge of the High Court quashed the scheme. An appeal filed by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India was allowed by a Division Bench of the High Court Hence this appeal by special leave. G Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: The scheme was intended to provide a separate avenue of promotion for those Upper Division Clerks who had put in 20 years of service or more in their cadre and who had exhausted all their chances of appearing at the 46 Subordinate Accounts Service Examination for promotion to supervisory posts, or who having crossed the age of 45 years, were no longer eligible to appear at the Examination.
 These indicia distinguished that category of Upper Division Clerks from others. If the scheme had been thrown open to Upper Division Clerks who still enjoyed the possibility of recruitment to the Subordinate Accounts Service, the intent underlying the scheme would have been defeated. The appellants, although senior in length of service to the respondents promoted under the scheme, were still eligible to appear in the Subordinate Account Service Examination and the opportunity of advancement in their regular promotional channel was still available to them. Those promoted under the scheme were not entitled to further promotion to any higher post. The impugned scheme follows a clearly defined classification having a reasonable nexus to the object of the classification. Those who fall outside the scheme cannot complain of discrimination, for intelligible differential exist between those included within the scheme and those outside it. The framing and implementation of such a scheme falls within the scope of administrative policy, and having regard to the object underlying the scheme as well as its careful definition there is no basis for complaint by the appellants.
