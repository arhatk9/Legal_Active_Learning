 The respondent served a notice on the Secretary U.P.
 Government, for settling his outstanding claims to enable him to seek voluntary retirement. But the Governor by his order, compulsorily retired him from service with immediate effect. Aggrieved by the order of the Governor, the respondent directly riled a writ petition in the High Court.
 The same was dismissed on the ground that the respondent bye-passed the alternate remedy available to him. The respondent riled another writ petition in the High Court which was heard by the Single Judge, was, bye-passing the order of the Division Bench allowed the writ petition and quashed the impugned order the directed the U.P. Government to treat the respondent as having retired voluntarily.
 Challenging the said order, the appellants have contended that the Single Judge could not have over-ruled the preliminary objections raised on behalf of the appellants;
 that since the Division Bench of the same High Court dismissed the Petition of the respondent for not exhausting the alternate remedy available, the Single Judge had no jurisdiction to entertain that writ petition; that respondent's issuance of a notice to the Government seeking permission for the voluntary retirement in the meantime was untenable; and that the view of the Single Judge that a departmental disciplinary enquiry pending against the respondent inhibited the Government from compulsorily retiring him was also untenable.
 Allowing the appeal this Court, 
HELD : 1.1. That when a Judge of a Single Judge Bench of a High 879 Court is required to entertain a second writ petition of a person on a matter, he cannot, as a matter of course, entertain such petition, if an earlier writ petition of the same person on the same matter had been dismissed already by another Single Bench or Division Bench of the same High Court, even if such dismissal was on the ground of laches or on the ground of non-availing of alternate remedy. [889D] 1.2. This judgment should not be understood as coming in the way of the respondent in approaching the U.P. Public Service Tribunal for necessary relief in the matter, if he is so entitled.
