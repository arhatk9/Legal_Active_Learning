 M was a partner in two firms registered under the Indian Income Tax Act. He submitted returns for assessment of Income Tax for the years 1946-47 and 47-48 with regard to both the firms showing losses. The assessment of one of the firm for the year 1946-47 and 47-48 was completed on 31.10.50 and of the other for the year 1947 48 on 30.6.51 whereby the losses calculated were less than claimed by M before the Income Tax Officer. On receipt of intimation of the orders passed in the assessments of the two firms the Income Tax officer issued on May 4, 1953, notice to M to show cause why the assessment for the year 1946.47 and 47-48 should not be rectified under s. 35 of the Act. M replied that he had no objection if the assessment was completed according to law. On 27.3.54 the Income-tax Officer revised the assessment in respect of the two years after taking into account the share of the losses as computed in the assessment of the two firms. M died on 17.4.54 and his son H applied to the Commissioner of Income Tax for revision of the orders. The Commissioner held that s. 35 was properly invoked for rectification of the assessment. The High Court of Madras on a petition moved by ordered that a writ of certiorari to issue quashing the order. The Commissioner of Income-tax came up in appeal.
 ^ Held, that s. 35 (1) of the Income Tax Act empowers the Income Tax Authorities to rectify mistakes apparent from the record of certain orders passed by them. But if the law does not authorise the Income Tax Officer to rectify the assessment, assent could not validate what was unauthorised.
 Held, further, that for the purpose of assessment an individual and a firm are distinct entities; and even if an individual is a partner of a firm, a mistake discovered because of something contained in the assessment of the firm is not a mistake apparent from the record of assessment of the individual partner.
 717 Held, also, that the Legislature has given to cl. (5) of s. 35 which was incorporated with effect from April 1, 1952, a partial retrospective operation. The provision enacted by cl. (5) is not procedural in character, it affects vested rights of the assessee. Therefore in the absence of compelling reasons the court would not be justified in giving a greater retrospectively to the provision than is warranted by the plain words used by the Legislature. Clause (5) of s. 35 does not purport to amend cl. (1) of the same section.
 It confers additional power of rectification upon the Income Tax Authorities; and that power cannot be exercised in respect of assessment of firm which have been completed before the date on which the power was invested.
