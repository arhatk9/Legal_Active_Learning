 The respondent, the executive trustee of the Consumer Education & Research Centre Ahmedabad, after undertaking research into the working of the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) published and circulated a study paper titled "A fraud on policy holders-a shocking story" portraying the discriminatory practice adopted by the LIC which adversely affected the interest of a large number holders. The underlying idea was to point out that unduly high premiums were charged by the LIC from those taking out life insurance policies thereby denying access to insurance coverage to a vast majority of people who cannot afford to pay the high premiums. A member of the LIC prepared a counter to the respondent's study paper and published the same as an article titled `LIC and its policy holders' in the "Hindu", a daily newspaper, challenging the conclusions reached by the respondent in his study paper. The respondent prepared a rejoinder `Raw deal for policy Holders' which too was published in the same newspaper.
 Thereafter, the LIC published its member's article which was in the nature of a counter to the respondent's study paper in its magazine `Yogakshema'. On the respondent learning about the same, he requested that in fairness his rejoinder which was already published in the Hindu should also be published in the said magazine to present a complete picture to the reader. The LIC refused his request on the ground that their magazine was an in-house magazine circulated amongst subscribers who were policy holders, officers, employees and agents of the Corporation and it is not put up in the market for sale to the general public.
 The respondent filed a writ petition in the Gujarat High Court which came to the conclusion that the LIC's stand that the magazine was an in-house magazine was untenable because it was available to anyone on payment of subscription; and it invited articles for publication therein from members of the public. Assuming that the magazine was an in-house magazine the corporation, which was a State within the meaning of Article 12, cannot under the guise of publication of an in-house magazine violate the fundamental right of the respondent. Accordingly, the High Court held 597 the refusal by LIC to publish respondent's rejoinder was arbitrary and violative of Article 14 and 19(1)(a). Against the decision of the High Court this appeal is filed.
 In the connected appeal the respondent produced a documentary film on the Bhopal Gas Disaster titled "Beyond Genocide" which was awarded the Golden Lotus, being the best non-feature film of 1987. At the time of the presentation of awards the Central Minister for Information 
 short films would be telecast on Doordarshan. The respondent submitted his film to Doordarshan for telecast but Doordarshan refused to telecast the same on the grounds that (i) the film was out dated (ii) it had lost its relevance (iii) it lacked moderation and restraint (iv) it was not fair and balanced (v) political parties have raised various issues concerning the tragedy and (vi) claims for compensation by victims were sub-judice.
 The respondent filed a writ petition challenging the refusal to telecast his film on the ground of violation of his fundamental right under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution and for a mandamus to Doordarshan to telecast the same. The Union of India contested the petition by stating that although a decision was taken to arrange a fixed fortnigtly telecast of award winning documentaries, no decision was taken to telecast all national award winning documentaries; that the parameters applied for selection of a film for national award were not the same as applied by the Film Selection Committee of Doordarshan for selection of a film for telecast; and the respondent's film which was previewed by a duly constituted Screening Committee was not found to meet the requirements for telecast on Doordarshan.
 The High Court held that no restriction could be placed on the fundamental right guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution save and except by law permitted by Article 19(2); that the respondent's right under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution obligated Doordarshan to telecast the film since the guidelines or norms on which the refusal was based executive in character and not law within the meaning of Article 19(2) of the Constitution. Accordingly, it directed Doordarshan to telecast the film, "Beyond Genocide" at a time and date convenient to it keeping in view the public interest and on such terms and conditions as it would like to impose in accordance with law.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended for Doordarshan, (i) that 598 sub-section (2) of Section 5B of the Cinematograph Act, 1952 empowers the Central Government to issue directions setting out the principles which shall guide the authority competent to grant certificates under the Act in sanctioning films for public exhibition and since the exemption granted to Doordarshan under Section 9 of the Act from the provisions relating to certification of films in Part II of the Act and Rules made thereunder by notification dated 16th October, 1984 is subject to the condition that while clearing programmes for telecast Doordarshan shall keep in view the film certification guidelines issued by the Central Government under Section 5B of the Act, the guidelines clearly have statutory favour and would, therefore, fall within the protective umbrella of Article 19(2);(ii) the High Court completely misdirected itself in not appreciating that these norms were fixed keeping in mind the requirement of Section 5B of the Act which section was consistent with Article 19(2), therefore the High Court was wrong in brushing them aside as mere departmental executive directions.
 Dismissing the appeals, this Court 
 HELD: 1. A constitutional Provision is never static, it is ever evolving and ever changing and, therefore, does not admit of a narrow, pedantic or syllogistic approach. The Constitution makers employed a broad pharaseology while drafting the fundamental rights so that they may be able to cater to the needs of a changing society. Therefore, constitutional provisions in general and fundamental rights in particular must be broadly construed unless the context otherwise requires. The scope and ambit of such provisions, in particular the fundamental rights, should not be cut down by too astute or too restricted an approach. [606E, 607E-F] Sakal Paper (P) (Ltd. v.

 2. The words `freedom of speech and expression ' must be broadly construed to include the freedom to circulate one's views by words of mouth or in writing or through audio-visual instrumentalities. therefore, includes it the right propagati one's the views through the print media or 599 through any other communication channel e.g. the radio and the television. The print media, the radio and the tiny screen play the role of public educators, so vital to the growth of a healthy democracy. Every citizen of this free country, therefore, has the right to air his or her views through the printing and/or the electronic media subject of course to permissible restrictions imposed under Article 19(2) of the Constitution. The right extends to the citizen being permitted to use the media to answer the criticism levelled against the view propagated by him. [607 G-H, 608 A,E] Romesh Tappar v.

 3. No serious exception can be taken to the approach which commended to the High Court. The LIC is a State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution. It is created under an Act, namely, the Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956, which requires that it should function in the best interest of the community. The community is, therefore, entitled to know whether or not this requirement of the Statute is being satisfied in the functioning of the LIC. The respondent's effort in preparing the study paper was to bring to the notice of the community that the LIC had strayed from its path by pointing out that its premium rates were unduly high when they could be low if the LIC avoided wasteful indulgences. The endeavor was to enlighten the community of the drawbacks and shortcomings of the corporation and to pin-point the areas where improvement was needed and was possible. By denying information to the consumers as well as other subscribers that LIC cannot be said to be acting in the best interest of the community.

 4. By refusing to print and publish the rejoinder the LIC had violated the respondent's fundamental right. The rejoinder to their acticle is not in any manner prejudicial to the members of the community nor it is based on imaginery or concocted material. It does not contain any material which can be branded as offensive, in the sense that it would fall within anyone 600 of the restrictive clauses of Article 19(2). That being so on the fairness doctrine the LIC was under an obligation to publish the rejoinder since it had published its counter to the study paper. [614-C, 613-D, 612A, 613-E] 
 5. The LIC' s refusal to publish the rejoinder in its magazine financed from public funds is an attitude which can be described as both unfair and unreasonable; unfair because fairness demanded that both view points were placed before the readers, however, limited be their number, to enable them to draw their own conclusions and unreasonable because there was no logic or proper justification for refusing publication. A monopolistic state instrumentality which survives on public funds cannot act in an arbitrary manner on the specious plea that the magazine is an in- house one and it is a matter of its exclusive privilege to print or refuse to print the rejoinder. [613 B-D] 
 6. A wrong doer cannot be heard to say that its persistent refusal to print and publish the article must yield the desired result, namely to frustrate the respondent. The Court must be careful to see that it does not, even unwittingly, aid the effort to defeat a party's right. However, in order that the reader knows and appreciates why the rejoinder has appeared after such long years it is directed that the LIC will, while publishing the rejoinder print an explanation and an apology for the delay.
 [614 C-D] 
 7. Speech is God's gift to mankind. Through Speech a human being conveys his thoughts, sentiments and feeling to others. Freedom of speech and expression is thus a natural right which a human being acquires on birth. It is, therefore, a basic human right. Thus freedom to air one's views is the life line of any democratic institution and any attempt to stifle, suffocate or gag this right would sound a death-knell to democracy and would help usher in autocracy or dictatorship. Efforts by intolerant authorities to curb or suffocate this freedom have always been firmly repelled.
 More so when public authorities have betrayed autocratic tendencies. [605G, 608-B, 611E] Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), referred to.
 
 8. The feedom conferred on a citizen by Article 19(1)(a) includes the freedom to communicate one's ideas or thoughts through a newspaper, a magazine or a movie.
 Although movie enjoys that freedom it must be remembered that movie is a powerful mode of communication and has the 601 capacity to make a profound impact on the minds of the viewers and it is, therefore, essential to ensure that the meassage it conveys is not harmful to the society or even a section of the society. Censorship by prior restraint, therefore, seems justified for the protection of the society from the ill-effects that a motion picture may produce if unrestricted exhibition is allowed. Censorship is thus permitted to protect social interests enumerated in Article 19(2) and section 5B of the cinematograph Act. But such censorship must be reasonable and must answer the test of Article 14 of the Constitution. [623 E-G] 
 9. Once it is recognised that a film-maker has a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(a) to exhibit his film, the party which claims that it was entitled to refuse enforcement of this right by virtue of law made under Article 19(2), the onus lies on that party to show that the film did not conform to the requirements of that law, in the present case the guidelines relied upon. [620 D-E] 
 10. The respondent had a right to convey his perception of the gas disaster in Bhopal through the documentary film prepared by him. The film not only won the Golden Lotus award but was also granted the 'U' Certificate by the censor. It is an appraisal of what exactly transpired in Bhopal on the date the gas leak occurred. Therefore, the respondent cannot be accused of having distorted the events subsequent to the disaster. [624 E-F] Merely because it is critical of the State Government is no reason to deny selection and exhibition of the film.
 So also pendency of claims for compensation does not render the matter sub-judice so as to shut out the entire film form the community. In fact the community was keen to know what actually had happened, what is happening, what remedial measures the State authorities are taking an what are the likely consequences of the gas leak. To bring out the inadequacy of the State effort or the indifference of the officer, etc,. cannot amount to an attack on any political party its the criticism is genuine and objective and made in good faith. If the norm for appraisal was the same as applied by the censors while granting the 'U' Certificate, it is difficult to understand how Doordarshan could refuse to exhibit it. It is not that it was not sent for being telecast soon after the disaster that one could say that it is outdated or has lost relevance. [624 G-H, 625 A-B] 602 In the circumstances it cannot be said that the film was not consistent with the accepted norms. Doordarshan being a State controlled agency funded by public funds could not have denied access to the screen to the respondent except on valid grounds. [625-C] K.A. Abbas v.
