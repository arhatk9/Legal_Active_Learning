 The appellant challenged the election of the first respondent on the grounds: (1) that during the election campaign statements were made at a public meeting that the appellants had misappropriated money, that statements were published in a weekly referring to the appellant as a corrupt candidate, that the statements were made with the first respondent's approval, that the statements were false and the respondent either believed them to be false or did not believe them to be true, and that by publishing the false statements in relation to the personal character or conduct of the appellant the first respondent appellant was guilty of a corrupt practice under s. 123 (4) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. (2) That the respondent purchased petrol worth about Rs. 2,000 and if that amount was added to the admitted expenditure it would show that the respondent had incurred election expenses in excess of the limit prescribed by s. 77 of the Act read with r. 90 of the Election Rules. (3) That the respondent was a Chairman of the Board of Directors of an Electric Supply Company which generated and supplied electricity to the State Government under a contract, and therefore he was disqualified on the ground that he had a subsisting contract with the State within the meaning of s. 9(A) of the Act.
 The election petition was dismissed by the High Court.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD: (1) The appellant had himself admitted on oath as a witness that a complaint was filed against him for embezzlement. The complaint was pending in the criminal court at the time of the election. A charge was also framed in those proceedings. The charge and complaint are relevant and there is no provision of law which makes the order framing the charge or the complaint inadmissible in evidence.
 There was thus enough material to show that the statements relating. to the appellant were not founded on mere suspicion or that they were the result of a pure conjuncture or guess. Hence, the appellant had failed to discharge the burden laid on him under s. 123(4) of the Act to prove that the impugned statements were not only false but in addition that the respondent and his agents published them either believing them to be false or not believing them to be true.
 [827A] Dr. Jagjit Singh v. Giani Kartar Singh, A.I.R. 1966 S.C.
 773, followed.
 (2) The charge that he incurred election expenses beyond the prescribed limit must fail for want of evidence connecting this item of expenditure with the election.
 823 (3) Section 9A of the Act only covers contracts which have 'been entered into by a person in the course of his trade or business with the appropriate Government for the supply of goods to or for the execution of any works undertaken by that Government. In the present case, the contract to supply electricity by the Electric Supply Company could by no means be considered to be a contract entered into by the respondent in the course of his trade or business merely because he was at the relevant time a Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, because the business of a company could not be described as a trade or business of the Chairman of its Board of Directors.
