 The appellant's factory was sold by auction in execution of a decree and was purchased by the respondents.
 The appellant challenged the sale on the allegation that one-fourth of the sale-proceeds was not paid to the Amin immediately after the auction and thus 0. 21 R. 84 had not been complied with. The evidence produced by the respondents showed that they had paid the required amount to the Amin after the latter had consulted the Munsif on the same day. The Civil Judge disbelieving the respondents' version held the sale to be a nullity and ordered a re-sale.
 The High Court however decided in favour of the respondents and rejected the appellant's legal contentions that (i) the order of the Civil Judge being interlocutory was not appealable and (ii) that 0. 21 R. 90 was not applicable. On appeal by Special Leave to this Court, 
HELD : (i) The sale had been declared to be a nullity and there was thus no question of material irregularity having been committed. 0. 21 R. 91 therefore did not apply. [304 A] (ii) The order of the Civil Judge however finally determined the question whether the sale was a nullity. After that no question was left to be decided as between the judgment- debtor and the auction purchaser. The order was therefore not an interlocutory order but a final order determining the rights of the parties. It fell within the definition of a decree under s. 2(2) read with s. 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure and was appealable under s. 96 of the Code. [307 G; 305 A] Case law considered.
