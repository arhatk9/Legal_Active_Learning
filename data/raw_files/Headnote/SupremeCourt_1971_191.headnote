 The Order compulsorily retiring the respondent, a head constable, made reference to a letter,, dated March 16, 1962 of the Police Head Quarters approving a proposal by the Superintendent of Police, dated February 14, 1962, for the compulsory retirement of the respondent. The proposal had mentioned that the respondent was "considered to be a bad lot incorrigible and no longer useful". The respondent filed a suit for a declaration that the Order was illegal since the procedure under Art. 311 of the Constitution and r. 55 of the Civil Service Regulations was not followed.
 The trial court dismissed the suit. In appeal the Civil and Sessions Judge came to the conclusion that the proposal dated February 14, 1962, formed the necessary adjunct to the order leading to compulsory retirement and passed a decree in favour of the respondent. The High Court confirmed the decree.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD: In ascertaining whether an order of compulsory retirement is one of punishment it has to be seen whether in the order there is any element of charge or stigma or imputation or any implication of misbehaviour or incapacity against the officer concerned. Where the authorities can make an order of compulsory retirement for any reason and no reason is mentioned in the order it cannot be predicated that the order of compulsory retirement has an inherent stigma in it. Unless it is established from the order itself that a charge or imputation against the officer is made the condition of the exercise of the power or that by the order the officer is losing benefits already earned, the order cannot be said to be one for dismissal or removal or in the nature of penalty or punishment. [189 B; 192 D, E] In the present case the order of compulsory retirement does not suffer from any such vice nor can it be, on the facts found, said to have been passed on account of malice. The High Court fell into the error of holding that the order contained stigma by going behind the order of retirement and also by misreading the proposal dated February 14, 1962 in the manner not warranted by the letter itself containing a mere proposal for compulsory retirement. Only the proposal was sent for approval. The order cannot be stated to sustain the plea of punishment by extracting opinions- expressed by the authorities in regard to the officer in the past.
