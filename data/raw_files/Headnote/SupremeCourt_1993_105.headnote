 The Andhra Pradesh State Electricity Board granted rebate of 25 per cent in demand and energy charges for High Tension industries and asked the Director of Industries to identify the industries which would be eligible for the rebate. By its order dated July 13, 1976 the State extended the rebate to certain industries. The Board also issued order extending the concession to the notified industries for a period of three years from the date of their going into regular production. By an order dated August 23, 1985, the concession already granted was extended for two more years, i.e. a total of five year. However, by its order dated December 8, 1987 the Board withdrew the concession. The State Government also issued similar order dated July 27, 1989 withdrawing the rebate. The respondent-company which established a Ferro Chrome industry and commenced production on regular basis on August 11, 1990 claimed concession but the same was refused by the Board on the ground that the said concession had already been withdrawn. 'Me company filed a writ petition before the Andhra Pradesh High Court seeking a declaration that it was entitled to rebate as declared by the State Government in its letter dated August 23, 1985. A Single Judge of the High Court allowed the petition on the ground that the respondent-company having acted upon the representation made by the Board and the State Government the doctrine of promissory estoppel was attracted and as such the Board and the State Government were bound to grant rebate for a period of five years. The writ appeal preferred by the Board was dismissed by a Division Bench of the High Court. The Electricity Board riled an appeal in this Court.
 Allowing the appeal and setting aside the judgment of the High Court, this Court, 115 
HELD- 1. The High Court was not justified in applying the doctrine of promissory estoppel to the facts and circumstances of this case.

2. Only those industries were entitled to the benefit of the incentive who fulfilled the requirements during the period the incentive was operative The promise or representation made by the Board In Its letter dated July 13, 1976, if any, was directly linked with the date of commencement of production by the company. It is not disputed that the respondent-company commenced production on commercial scale on August 11, 1990. The incentive was withdrawn by the Board on December 8, 1987 and by the Government on July 27, 1989. Whichever date Is taken into account the company was not entitled to the incentive as it had not commenced production tin or before either of these two dates. [119A-B, D] 2.1. Even if it is assumed that a promise or representation was made by the Board the doctrine of promissory estoppel is not attracted in this case as the company failed to act upon the said representation. Therefore, the assumption entertained by the High Court that once the company started the process or setting up an industry and had incurred expenditure, the Board was bound to keep its incentive open for the company till it started production is not correct.
