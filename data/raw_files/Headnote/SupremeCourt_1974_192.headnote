 Section 17(2) of the Gujarat Panchayata Act, 1961, provides that the normal term of a panchayat is 5 years from the date of its first meeting and that the term could be extended by the State Government by a period not exceeding one year in the aggregate.
 The 5-year term of the Taluka Panchayats and the District Panchayats in the appellant-State were due to expire on February 28, 1973 and March 31, 1973 respectively. They were extended first upto August 31, 1973 and September 30, 1973 and then upto February 28, 1974 and January 1974.
 Widespread disturbances broke out in the State and the Governor promulgated an Ordinance by which the State Government was given power to extend the terms of panchayats for 2 years instead of one. On February 9, 1974, the State Ministry resigned and the President of India assumed all functions of the State Government. The terms of the panchayat were extended upto 31st March 1974.
 The State legislature was dissolved on March 15, 1974 and Parliament passed the Gujarat State Legislature (Delegation of Powers) Act, 1974. Under a. 3 of this Act, the President enacted Gujarat Panchayats (Amendment) Act, 1974 which in- serted s. 303A in the 1961 Act. On March 31, 1974, the Government issued a notification under s. 303A, that whereas the State Government is satisfied that a situation exists by reason of disturbances whereby it is not expedient to hold elections for the reconstitution of the panchayats, the State government orders that all the powers and duties of taluka panchayats should be exercised by the Taluka Development Officer and of the District panchayats by the District Development Officer.
 The respondents who are presidents of panchayats successfully challenged the notification in the High Court, on the basis that the condition precedent to the exercise of the power under the section was not satisfied.
 Allowing the appeal to the Court, 
HELD : (1) An analysis of s. 303A(1) shows that before a declaration could be made thereunder, two requirements must be fulfilled : (a) existence of a situation by reason of disturbances in the State; and (b) the satisfaction of the State government relatable to such a situation, that it is not expedient to hold elections for the reconstitution of a panchayat after the expiry of its term. The first requirement is an objective fact, which, if disputed, must be established objectively as a condition precedent to the exercise of the power; and the second is an opinion or inference drawn from that objective fact. It is a matter of subjective satisfaction of the government and is not justiciable. Once a reasonable nexus between such satisfaction and the facts constituting the first requirement is shown, the exercise of the power by the government, not being colourable or motivated by extraneous considerations, is not open to judicial review. [335H-336B] (2) If the language of a statute is susceptible of two constructions, the one fulfils the object is to be preferred to the alternative which frustrates it. [337H] (3) In view of the particulars stated in the Counter- affidavit it is clear that the disturbances in the State continued throughout March 1974. Assuming that the disturbances abated after the dissolution of the Assembly on March 15, 1974 the 331 abnormal situation, which was the direct result of the disturbances must have continued to exist throughout March 1974. The section speaks of the existence of a Situation 'by reason of' disturbances. The expression indicates that the 'disturbances' and the 'situation' must be proximately connected as cause and effect. it is sufficient if the situation is the immediate outcome of the disturbances and that it subsists. [336G-H] (4)The phrase 'to hold elections', understood in a wide sense, will include all steps such as delimitation of the constituencies, the compilation of electoral rolls etc which are a necessary preliminary to the actual conduct of elections, whereas in a restricted sense, it would cover only the actual holding of elections. The word 'expedient has also several shades of meaning. It could not be contended for the respondents that the phrase should be understood in the restricted sense, that is, that power under s. 303A is exercisable only after the completion of preparatory steps preliminary to the holding of an election, and that since that stage had not yet been reached in the present case, the power could not be exercised. Section 303A has been designed to enable the Government to get over a difficult situation surcharged with dangerous potentialities and hence the Court must construe the expression therein, in keeping with the context and object of the provision, in their widest amplitude, and eschew an interpretation which attenuates the power or impairs its efficacy. The statute places no fetter on the discretion of the government in the exercise of the power. [338B-E, G] (5) Further the Court cannot sit in appeal over the opinion of the State Government as to the inexpediency of holding elections. All that the Court could enquire was, whether the condition precedent, which is, an objective fact to the exercise of the power existed. [338E-F] (6)The respondents could not also contend that the impugned notification is not relatable to the situation existing by reason of the disturbances and that the power wag exercised for an extraneous reason, namely, that the terms of the pan- chayats were expiring on March 31, 1974, because;
 (a)the reference to the ter= of the panchayats in the impugned notification is only the recital of a feet which constituted another facet of the situation arising out of the disturbances; [339B-C] (b)the real and dominant reason for the exercise of the power is contained in the 2nd paragraph of the notification namely, the existence of a situation by reason of the disturbances; and [339B-C] (c)the counter-affidavit on behalf of the appellant pleaded that the disturbances continued also in March 1974 and that it was not expedient in the circumstances to hold elections and that the efforts made by the government to hold elections were thwarted by the supervention of the disturbances. [339D-E] (7)The purpose of s. 17(2) is to ensure the continuity of the panchayats, where as the object of 8. 303A is to confer powers regarding dissolution of panchayats in special situations. Therefore, even if the Government had the power under S. 17(2) to extend the terms of the panchayats, beyond March 31, 1974, it could not be said in the circumstances of the case that in choosing to act under s. 303A government acted maliciously. In the counter-affidavit on behalf of the government, it wag stated that one of the demands of the agitators was that the terms of the panchayats should not be extended further, This weighed with the government in deciding that it was not politic in the then prevailing conditions to extend the terms of the panchayats. Thus the government exercised its powers under s. 303A only because of the peculiar situation arising out of the disturbances.
