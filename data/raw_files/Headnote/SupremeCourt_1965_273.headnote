 The respondent company, incorporated in 1939 in the erstwhile State of Bhopal, was exempted under an agreement with the Ruler from taxation under the Bhopal Income-tax Act for a period of ten years which ended on October 31, 1948.
 After the merger of the State with India in 1949 the company became liable to assessment under the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922. The Taxation Laws (Merged States) (Removal of Difficulties) Order, 1949 provided in Paragraph 2 that in computing depreciation allowance all depreciation "actually allowed" under the relevant law of a merged State shall be taken into account. Accordingly the Income-tax Officer in making assessments for the years 1952-53 and 1953-54 on the respondent company allowed depreciation on the original cost of the assets. However on the decision of the Bombay High Court in Dharangdhara Chemical Works Ltd. (IT. Reference No. 60 of 1956) coming to his notice he recomputed the depreciation allowable to The company for the, said years 4952-53 and 1953-54 by taking into account the depreciation that would have been allowed to the company under the Bhopal Income-tax Act if it had not been exempted from the 'assessment under the said Act. The order of the Income-tax Officer was reversed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner who held that depreciation which had never been allowed could not be taken into consideration. The Tribunal in appeal, and the High Court in reference took the same view.
 Subsequent to the High Court's judgment the Taxation Laws (Merged States) (Removal of Difficulties) (Amendment) Order, 1962 was passed which added an Explanation to Paragraph 2 of the 1949 Order By this Explanation it was said that the expression "all depreciation actually allowed under any laws or rule& of a merged State" meant and shall be deemed always to have meant that in cases where income had been exempted from tax under any laws or rules in force in a merged State or under any agreement with a Ruler, the depreciation that Would have been allowed had the income not been so exempted.
 In appeal to this Court against the High Court's judgment the Revenue contended : (1) The expression 'actually allowed under any laws or rules of a merged State' occurring in paragraph 2 of the 1949 Order meant depreciation allowable under the provisions of the said laws or rules. (2) The 1962 Order which explained the expression 'actually allowed' to mean the depreciation that would have been allowed had the income not been exempted by the Ruler was retrospective because it contained the words 'shall be deemed always to have meant', and in view of this Explanation the Income-tax Offier's order was right. Because the 882 1962 Order came up for consideration for the first time in this Court the respondent was allowed to challenge it on various grounds.
 
HELD : (i) The High Court was right in its view that the expression actually allowed' in the 1949 Order is unambiguous and connotes the idea that the allowance was actually given effect to. [887 E] (ii)The Explanation added by the 1962 Order however retrospectively changed the meaning of the expression 'actually allowed' and the Revenue was entitled to rely on it. Applying the 1962 Order to the facts of the present case it was clear that the correct basis for computing the written down value of the depreciable assets for the relevant period was the one adopted by the Income-tax Officer. [890G] (iii)The 1962 Order could be taken into consideration by this Court although it was not in existence when the High Court answered the reference. The question referred to the High Court was of sufficient amplitude to include a discussion of the amendments made retrospectively in the Taxation Laws (Merged States) (Removal of Difficulties) Order, 1949.[890 F] Commissioner of Sales-tax, U.P. v. Bijli Cotton Mills Hathras, [1964] INSC 83; [1964] 7 S.C.R. 383; A.I.R. 1964 S.C. 1594, applied.
 (iv)The respondent could not be allowed to raise the question whether the 1962 Order was ultra vires because of the, decision of this Court in Venkataraman's case. [889 A] K. S. Venkataraman v. State of Madras, [1966] 2 S.C.R.
 229.
 (v)The respondent could not claim that the 1962 Order did not apply to it on the ground that no income-tax being payable by it, it was not an assessee. The definition of 'assessee' must mean a person by whom income-tax is payable under the Bhopal Act. If it had not been for the agreement with the Ruler the respondent would have been liable to pay tax. [889 H] (vi)There was no force in the respondent's contention that the 1962 Order was not retrospective and did not apply to assessments made before it came into force. The terms of the Order are plain and if it is deemed as directed by the Order, that the expression 'actually allowed under the laws or rules of a merged State' should have the meaning ascribed to it by the Explanation, as from December 3, 1949, when the Taxation Laws (Merged States). (Removal of Difficulties) Order, 1949 came into force, the Explanation must apply to the assessments for the years 1952-53 and 1943-54. [890 B-C]
