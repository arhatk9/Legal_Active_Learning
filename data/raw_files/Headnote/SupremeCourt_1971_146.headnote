 The appellants were charged along with five others for the offences of murder and attempt to murder. Five accused persons were acquitted by the trial court Four of the appellants were convicted by the trial court, the conviction being upheld by the High Court. The fifth appellant was acquitted by the trial court but convicted by the High Court in an appeal by the State. In appeal by special leave it was contended before this Court; (i) that the conviction of the appellants could not be sustained on the evidence; (ii) that the High Court in reversing the judgment of acquittal by the trial court against one of the appellants had not followed the principles laid down by this Court; and (iii) that the Additional Government Advocate was not authorised to present the appeal against acquittal in the High Court because such appeal was not a 'case.
 
HELD: (i) Under Art. 136 of the Constitution this Court does not normally re-appraise the evidence for considering the credibility of the witnesses. Unless the trial is vitiated by some illegality or irregularity of procedures or their is some violation of the rules of natural justice resulting in unfair trial, or unless the judgment has resulted in gross miscarriage of justice, this Court does not as a rule proceed to evaluate the evidence for coming to its own independent conclusion. No such infirmity had been made out by the appellants' counsel in the present case.
 [736 F] (ii) The appellants counsel was also unable to show that the High Court in reversing the judgment of the trial court against one of the appellants had failed to observe the principles laid down by this Court. [737 H] Samwat Singh & Ors. v State of Rajasthan, [1961] 3 S.C.R.

 (iii) The Additional Government Advocate who presented the appeal againstacquittal in the High Court was notified as Public Prosecutor for the HighCourt in respect of cases arising in the State of Madhya Pradesh. The case resulting inthe acquittal of the accused persons would clearly be a case arising in the state and within the contemplation of the notification. Reading s. 4(1)(t) Cr. P.C. which defines 'public prosecutor' together 732 with s. 492 Cr. P. C. under which the State Government is empowered to appoint Public Prosecutors, the Additional 'Government Advocate when appointed' as a Public Prosecutor for the High Court in respect of cases arising in the State of Madhya Pradesh must be held to be a Public Prosecutor lawfully empowered to present appeals in the High Court against' orders of acquittal.
