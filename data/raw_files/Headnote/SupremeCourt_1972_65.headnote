 The facts of the appeals are similar and the facts of C.A.
 No. 314 are as follows :
 The respondent was a permanent Kanungo who was promoted to officiate as Naib Tehsildar under paragraph 37(ii) of the Standing Order No. 12, passed by the second appellant. He was reverted from the officiating post for the reason that he did not pass the departmental examination of Naib Tehsildar within the period prescribed by the Standing Order.
 The respondent contended in the writ petition that he was entitled to continue in the post of Naib Tehsildar until a qualified person became available that since he was promoted under para 37(ii) of the Standing Order, passing of departmental examination was not necessary to officiate in the post of Naib Tehsildar, that junior Kanungos were retained in the posts of Naib Tehsildar by which the respondent had lost his seniority in the substantive rank of Kanungo and hence the reversion amounted to a reduction in rank within the meaning of Art. 311(2) of the Constitution and retention of juniors in the post of Naib Tehsildar was violative of Arts. 14 and 16 of the Constitution.
 The Judicial Commissioner, decided the case in favour of the respondent and held that the reversion of the respondent was attended with penal consequences and since he was not given a reasonable opportunity of making representation agaist the order, the order was bad and the order was accordingly quashed, Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) Appointment to a post on an officiating basis, is, from the nature of employment, itself of a transitory character and in the absence of any contract or specific rule regarding the condition of service to the contrary, the implied term of such an appointment is that it is terminable at any time. the Government servant so appointed acquires no right to the post. But if the order entails or provides for forfeiture of his pay or allowance etc. or stoppage or postponement of his future chances of promotion, then that circumstance would indicate that in form the Government had purported to exercise its undoubted right to terminate the employment, but in truth and reality, the termination was by way of penalty. r 863D] Parshotam Lal Dhingra V.

 Further, by the mere fact that some of the juniors were allowed to continue in the post of Naib Tehsildar on an officiating basis, it could 661 not be, said that the respondent lost his seniority in his substantive rank of Kanungo. [863H] (ii) Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution are also not violated in the present case because the junior persons were retained in their offlciating capacities either because they had passed the departmental examination or because they had been exempted from passing that examination. In any case, the respondent was not similarly situated with his juniors and therefore, there was no discrimination to attract the Articles. [864-C]
