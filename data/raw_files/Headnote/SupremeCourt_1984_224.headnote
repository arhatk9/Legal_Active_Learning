 The appellants, landlord, filed an eviction suit against the respondent in the year 1967 for possession of some house property situate in Mauza Memari in West Bengal, on the ground of non-payment of arrears of rent and the requirement of the accommodation for demolition to enable the appellants to construct separate houses for their own business. The suit was decreed by the trial Court in 1969.
 The respondent filed an appeal before the first appellate court. During the pendency of the appeal, the West Bengal Government extended the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act 1956 to Memari in which the property is situate. Sub-s.(l) of section 13 of the Act provides that no order or decree for the recovery of possession shall be made by any court in a land lords's suit against the tenant except on certain enumerated grounds. Sub Section 6 provides that no suit or proceeding for the recovery of possession on any of the grounds mentioned in sub-section 1, except the grounds mentioned in clauses (j) and (k) can be filed by the landlord "unless he has given to the tenant one month's notice expiring with a month of tenancy". The first appellate court dismissed the appeal. In a second appeal by the respondent before the High Court, he urged that the appeal would necessarily be governed by the changed law. On the other hand, the appellants contended that the Act could not be invoked in a case where the trial court had already decreed the suit under the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act. The High Court while allowing the appeal held that the first appellate court was bound to take into account, the change of law an(l to extend its benefit to the tenant and consequently to set aside the decree of the trial court and dismiss the suit, and since the notice for eviction served by the appellants on the respondent did not comply with the requirements of sub-section 6 of section 13, the suit was incompetent.
 Dismissing the appeal, by the appellant, ^ 
 HELD; (1) It is wall settled that when a trial court decrees a suit and the 203 decree is challenged by a competent appeal, the appeal is considered as a continuation of the suit, and when the appellate decree affirms modifies or reverses the A decree on the merits, the trial court decree, is said in law to merge in the appellate decree. and it is the appellate decree which rules. Therefore, reference to the word decree in 5.13(1) is intended to the decree which disposes of the suit finally, and thus sub-s.(l) of s.13 of the Act can be invoked by a tenant during the pendency of an appeal against a trial court decree. [1205H; 206A-B] (2) Sub-sec.(l) of s.13 directs the court not to make any order or decree for possession subject, of course to the statutory exception. The object of the section is to protect the possession of the tenant, subject to the exceptions specified in the sub-section, and that protection is ensured if the Court construes the sub-section to mean that, subject to those exceptions, no effective or operative order or decree can be made by the Court in a landlord's suit for possession against a tenant. The legislative command in effect deprives the court of is unqualified jurisdiction to make such order or decree. It is true that when the suit was instituted the court possessed such jurisdiction and could pass a decree for possession. But it was divested of that jurisdiction when the Act was brought into force. The language of the sub-section makes that abundantly clear, and regard must be had to its object.
 Therefore, a change in the law during the pendency of an appeal has to be taken into account and will govern the rights of the parties even though the suit may have been instituted, before the Act came into force. In the instant case, there is no dispute that the around mentioned in cls.(j) and (k) do not come into play and since there was no compliance with the requirement of sub-s.6 of s.13 the suit was incompetent.
