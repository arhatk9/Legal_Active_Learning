 The appellants retrenched 6 of their workmen and the dispute was referred to the Labour Court for adjudication. The Labour Court by its Award held that the non-employment of the workmen was justified and no relief was granted to the workmen. Against this award, the workmen filed a Writ Petition (No. 209 of 1964) and the learned single Judge of the High Court set aside the Award of the Labour Court, and held that the non-employment of the workmen was unjustified.
 He remitted the matter for 'fresh disposal'. The appellants appealed against the said order by Writ Appeal No. 113 of 1967, before a Division Bench of the said High Court. The Division Bench dismissed the appeal ex-parte with the obser- vation that the judgment of the learned single Judge amounted to a quashing of the Award, and release of the proceedings for fresh and proper determination by the Labour Court, for carefully ascertaining the facts and applying the true principles of Industrial Law applicable to such cases of retrenchment". The matter, therefore, went back to the Labour Court for 'fresh disposal'; but when the appellants attempted to reagitate ,.he matters in controversy, the workmen objected.
 While the matter was pending before the Labour Court, the workmen moved a petition (CMP No. 7125/67), seeking clarification of the judgment of the learned single Judge, who by his order clarified his earlier judgment by saying that he had remitted the matter to the Labour Court only for the purpose of determining what relief could be given to the retrenched employees and that the Labour Court could not reopen the matter afresh. The attention of the learned Judge was drawn to the observation made by the Division Bench of the High Court, but he took the view that the appeal having been dismissed by the Division Bench, his original judgment stood and that the management might, if it so chose, file a review application before the Division Bench.
 Accordingly, the appellants filed an application for review of the order passed by the Division Bench. The Bench dismissed the revision petition with the observation that the learned single Judge had not expressed any final conclusion. Further, the order passed by the Division Bench was prima facie in favour of the employer-organisation.
 Therefore, the employer-organisation could not ask for a review of the order favorable lo them.
 Thereafter, the Labour Court, by its Award dated May 25, 1968, held that the retrenchment of the workmen was justified and observed that the powers of the High Court in hearing writ petition are limited, only to remitting a case for Labour Court for fresh disposal in its entirety and that observations to the contrary are mainly obite dicta.
 Further, following the Appellate Court's observations, the whole matter was at large.
 933 Against this Award, the workmen filed another writ petition (No. 123 of 1969) and a Division Bench quashed the award of the Labour Court and remitted the matter with the direction that it ought not go into the merits of the case, but dispose of the matter only in respect of proper reliefs to be given to the petitioner. The learned Judges took the view that the workmen were not bound by the ex-parte observations made by the division bench earlier and that the order of the learned single judge must be treated as final and therefore, the Labour Court was bound to give effect to that order., The correctness of this judgment was challenged before this Court.
 
HELD:(i) The order of the Division Bench passed in Writ appeal No. 113 of 1967 is set aside as being in violation of the principles of natural justice. This order cannot bind the workmen as it was passed ex-parte. [937 E] (ii) The clarification order passed by the learned single Judge in C.M.P. No. 7125 of 1967, in face of the appellate order is wrong. The learned judge had no jurisdiction to issue a clarification which was inconsistent with the view taken by the appellate Court. The appellate order was binding on the learned single Judge. [938 D] (iii) The second award of the Labour Court dated May 25, 1968 is also set aside as that award could not have been given without the High Court considering the legality of the judgment of the learned single judge. Therefore, the judgment of the High Court dated July 7, 1970, passed in writ petition No. 122 of 1969, which was filed against the second award, must also be set aside.
 (iv) What remains in the field is (a) the first awards of the Labour Court dated June 14. 1963 and (b) the judgment of the Hon'ble Single Judge heard in writ petition No. 209 of 1964. Writ appeal No. 113 of 1967 is revived and the High Court will dispose of that appeal on merit after issuing notice thereof to the respondents.
