 A suit was filed by the appellants to challenge the imposition of a rate by the Municipal Corporation of Ahmedabad on vacant lands situate within the municipal limits. The rate was levied under section 73 of the Bombay Municipal Boroughs Act, 1925, read with Explanation to s. 75 of the Act. The Municipality framed rule 350-A for rating open lands which provides that the rate on the area of open lands shall be levied at 1 per centum on the valuation based upon capital. The contention of the appellants was that reading ;the two rules together, the rate was levied at a percentage of the capital value of open lands and that the municipality could not do. Rule 350-A read with rule 243 was ultra vires .is. 73 and 75 inasmuch as it permitted the fixation of rate at a percentage of capital value and that was not permitted by the Act. The word "rate" Used in s.73 had acquired a special meaning by the time the Act came to be passed and meant a tax on the annual value of lands and buildings and not on their capital value. It was also contended that if the Act permitted the levy of a rate on a percentage of capital value of the lands and buildings, that was ultra vires the Provincial Legislature. It was further contended that the assessment based on rule 350-A read with rule 243 was ultra vires and the assessment list prepared pursuant to the said rule was illegal and void The trial court held that rule 350-A read with rule 243 was illegal and void and beyond the authority given to municipality under s. 73 of the Act. The trial Court granted the relief claimed by the appellants. The High Court reversed the order 609 of the trial court and the appellants came to this court after getting a certificate.
 Held (Sarkarj., dissenting), that rule 350-A read with rule 243 is ultra vires. 73 of the Bombay Municipal Boroughs Act, 1925, read with Explanation to s. 75. The assessment list for the year 1947-48 published by the municipality for levying the said tax in so for as it was prepared under rule 350-A is illegal, ultra vires and void. The municipality was restrained from recovering the said tax on the open lands from the appellants.
 The word "rate" had acquired a special meaning in English legislative history and practice and also in Indian legislation where that word was used and it meant a tax for local purposes imposed by local authorities. The basis of the tax was the annual value of the lands or buildings on or in connection with which it was imposed, arrived at in one of the three ways, namely, (1) actual rent fetched by land or building where it is actually let, (2) where it is not let, rent based on hypothetical tenancy, particularly in the case of buildings, and (3) where either of these two modes is not available, by valuation based on capital value from which annual value has to be found by applying a suitable percentage which may not be the same for lands and buildings. When in 1925, s. 73 (1) of the Act while specifying taxes which could be imposed by a municipal borough, used the word ,rate' on buildings or lands situate within the municipal borough, the word 'rate' must have been used in that particular meaning which it had acquired in the legislative history and practice both in England and India before that date. The use of the word 'rate' in cl. (i) definitely means that it was that particular kind of tax which in legislative history and practice was known as a rate' which the municipality could impose and not any other kind of tax.
 That though mathematically it may be possible to arrive at the same figure of the actual tax to be paid as a rate whether based on a capital value or based on annual value, the levying of the rate as a percentage of the capital value would still be illegal for the reason that the law provides that it should be levied on the annual value and not otherwise. By levying it otherwise directly as a percentage of the capital value, the real incidence of the tax is camouflaged and the electorate not knowing the true incidence of the tax may possibly be subjected to such heavy incidence as in some cases may amount to confiscatory taxation.
 Per Sarkarj.-Rate is the name given to an impost levied by a local authority to raise funds for its expenses irrespective 610 of the basis on which it is levied. There is no authority for the proposition that the word rate' has acquired a technical meaning indicating a levy on the basis only of yearly value of property. Such authority is not furnished by the fact that in England in all rating statutes the yearly value has always been adopted as the basis of valuation for calculating rates. The English text books on rating only stated that in England in fact the rating statutes always based on rates on yearly value. In our country, legislatures have used both the words tax' and ,rates' to indicate the impost by a local authority and in some cases have permitted a local authority to levy a "property tax" at a percentage of its capital value.
 The word rate' in s. 73 of the Bombay Municipal Boroughs Act, 1925 which authorises a Municipality to impose a rate on lands cannot be understood in any technical sense. This view is supported by the explanation in cl. (a) of s. 75 of the Act which provides that rules may be made specifying that the rate authorised by s. 73 may be levied on the basis of the capital value of land. There is nothing to indicate that in the explanation the words "capital value" had been used only for the purpose of finding out the annual value from it and not to form by itself the basis of the valuation on which the rate is to be imposed.
 Rule 350-A framed under s. 75 of the Act read with r.
 253 specifying that the rate on the land shall be levied at one per cent of the capital value of land is not ultra vires the Act.
 The Act imposes a tax on lands and is within item 42 of List 11 of the Government of India Act, 1935. The fact that it authorised that tax being quantified on the basis of the capital value of the land subjected to it does not take it out of that item and place it under item 55 of List I dealing with "taxes on capital value of the assets" which only the Central legislature can levy. The identification of the subject-matter of the tax is to be found in the charging section only and the charging section in the present case is s. 73 and the subject-matter which it taxes is land and not the capital value of it. The subject-matter of taxation is something different from the measure provided for quantification of the tax and one has no effect on the other. Nothwithstanding the measure of the tax being based on the capital value, the tax in the present case is nonetheless a tax on land.
