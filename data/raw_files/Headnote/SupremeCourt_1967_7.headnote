 Section 37 of the Madras Forest Act, 1900, gave power to Government to make rules regulating the transit of forest produce. Rule framed thereunder prohibited the removal of forest produce without permit. After the promulgation of the Constitution in 1950 two provisos were added to the said rule the first of which prohibited the issue of permits allowing forest produce to be removed between sun-set and sunrise, while the second permitted such removal between sun-set and 10 p.m. on certain conditions. The respondent who was a forest contractor filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging the validity of the provisos on the ground that they were beyond the rule making power under s.
 37 of the Madras Forest Act and were restrictive of his freedom of trade and commerce declared by Art. 301 of the Constitution. The petition was allowed and the State appealed.
 
HELD : (i) Power to impose restrictions of the nature contemplated by the two provisos to r. 2 is not to be found in any of the clauses of sub-s. (2) of s. 37. By sub-s. (1) the State Government is invested with the power to regulate transport of forest produce "in transit by land or water." The power which the State Government may exercise is however power to regulate transport of forest produce, and not the power to prohibit or restrict transport. Prima facie, a rule which totally prohibits the movement of forest produce during the period between sun-set and sunrise is prohibitory or restrictive of the right to transport forest produce. A rule regulating transport in its essence permits transport, subject to certain conditions devised to promote transport:
 such a rule aims at making transport orderly so that it does not harm or endanger other persons following a similar vocation or the public, and enables transport to function for the public good. [364 G-H; 365 A] Automobile Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd. v. State of Rajasthan, [1963] 1 S.C.R. 491, relied on.- If the Provisos are in truth restrictive of the right of transport of the forest produce, however good the grounds apparently may be for restricting the transport of forest produce., they cannot on that account transform the power conferred by the provisos into a power merely regulatory.
 [365 H] (ii) Article 301 in terms prohibits the imposition of any restriction on trade, commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of India and 361 362 by the enactment of the two provisos clearly restriction is imposed on the freedom of trade. The provisos to the rule must therefore be deemed to be invalid as infringing the guarantee under Art. 301 of the freedom of trade commerce and intercourse. [366 C-D] The provisos were not protected by Art. 305. Section 37 which conferred power to make rules was "existing law" within the meaning of that expression in Art. 305., but the rules made in exercise of that power after the Constitution cannot be deemed to be "existing law". The mere fact that there was authority in the State under a pre-Constitution Act to make rules which may impose restrictions on trade, commerce and intercourse, but which was not exercised, will not make the rule made in exercise of the authority after the Constitution "existing law" within the meaning of the Constitution. [366 G] Kalvani Stores v. State of Orissa, [1965] INSC 186; A.I.R. (1966) S.C. 1686, relied on.
 Kasi Prasad v. Sate of Orissa, A.I.R. (1963) Orissa 24, disapproved.
 Article 304 which is an exception to Art. 301 had no application to the case because that Article saved certain laws from the operation of Art. 301 if the law was passed by the Legislature of a State,. The provisos to s. 2 were not made by the Legislature of the State; they were made by the Executive Government in exercise of delegated authority.
 Moreover they had not been shown to be reasonable restr iction on the freedom of trade commerce and intercourse imposed in the public interest so as to satisfy the terms of Art. 304(b). [367 D-E]
