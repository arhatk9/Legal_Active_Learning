 The appellant was the Mahant of a Gurdwara which was maintained for a seat known as. Nirmala Sadhus and was registered as one of the branches of the principal institution of Nirmala Sadhus. All its Mahants, including the appellant were Nirmala Sadhus. The institution owned land,. which was donated to it by the inferior owners of the village. It also Tan a free kitchen for providing food for visitors. The respondents, who were Sikhs filed a suit under S. 92, Civil Procedure Code, for the removal of the appellant from his office. They sought to establish that they had such interest in the public trust as would entitle them to institute the suit, by showing : (1) that they had interest in the trust property in their capacity as representatives of the owners of the land, and as the representatives of the residents of the village; and (2) that the institution was a Sikh. Gurdwara meant for all persons following the Sikh faith.
 The trial court dismissed the suit, but the High Court decreed it.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD: (1) The respondents who were merely Lambardars and residents of the village, bad, in those capacities, no such interest as would entitle them to institute the suit. [743 G] The mere capacity as Lambardars did not entitle them to claim that they were representatives of the inferior owners of land, when they themselves were not inferior owners of any land, nor successors-in-interest of any inferior owners who donated the land. [742 F-G] The free kitchen was not being run for the general residents of the village who could, as of right, claim to be fed therein. Nor did the residents of the village have any clear interest in the particular trust entitling them to file such a suit, and mere residence in the village did not.
 create such an interest. [743 A-B] Vaidyanatha Ayyar v. Swaminatha Ayyar, 51 I.A. 282, applied.
 (2) The Nirmala Sadhus, though they started as a section of Sikhs, became later followers of Vedanta philosophy, adopted the customs of Hindu Sastras, the dress of Indian faqirs, and worshipped at Samadhis. Therefore they could not be regarded as Sikhs at all, and the respondents, who were Sikhs could not be held to have such an interest in the trust as would entitle them to file the suit. [745 E, H; 746 A-D; 747 B-C] Hem Singh v. Basantdas, Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee v. Ram Parshad, 63 I.A. 180, referred to.
