 Before Rao was appointed as Additional District and Sessions Judge tinder Rule 9 of the Punjab Superior Judicial Services Rules 1963, he was functioning as a District Attorney. He assumed charge and completed two years of probation. On the receipt of the complaint against him, the High Court entrusted to Justice Gurnam Singh an enquiry into the complaint. Rao was transferred to Ambala and later to Karnal as District and Sessions Judge. The High Court considered the report of Justice Gurnam Singh who came to the conclusion that the charges against Rao were not substantiated. On 19 April, 1973 the High Court promoted Rao as permanent District and Sessions Judge, with effect from March 30, 1973. The Government on the same day wrote to the High Court, saying that the view of the High Court about competency to confirm District and Sessions Judges was legally untenable. The High Court was requested to reconsider the matter and the issuance of notification confirming Rao was withheld. On 4 May, 1973 the High Court confirmed Rao as District and Sessions Judge with effect from July 7, 1972 on which date he completed the period of probation. On May 26, 1973 the Government wrote to the High Court stating that the Government did not recognise the order of confirmation issued by the High Court. The Government further said that Rao would be deemed to be under extended period of probation. The Government said that the High Court would be well advised to review their earlier decision and send the requisite record without any further delay. On .1 )tine, 1973 the Government wrote to the High Court saying that the Government were of opinion that in view of the probationary period of Rao having been found to be unsatisfactory he was not fit to be retained on the post of District/Additional District and Sessions Judge and should be reverted to his substantive post of District Attorney. The Government further requested the High Court that the matter might be placed before the Judges immediately so that the views of the High Court would be available to the Governor before the High Court went into vacation. On 2 June, 1973 the High Court replied that the matter was under consideration of the Judges and their views would be communicated to the State Government early. The vacation commenced on 2 June, 1973. On 12 June, 1973 the Government wrote to the High Court saying that if the views of the High Court were not received, the State Government would have no alternative but to take a final decision. On 14 June, 1973 the High Court wrote to the Government that reply would be sent after the reopening of the High Court.
 The High Court.reopened on 15 July 1973. On 21 June, 1973 the Governor wrote a note approving action proposed by the Council of Ministers. There was a gazette notification reverting Rao from the post of District and Sessions Judge.
 Ambala to his former most of District Attorney Rao challenged the order of the (governor in an application under Article 226 in the High Court.
 The High Court held that the order of confirmation of District/Additional District & Sessions Judge on probation has to be passed by the Governor in consultation with the High Court and in this view of the matter the order of confirma- 423 SCI/75 366 tion of Rao passed by the High Court was ineffective. The allegation that the orders were the result of the mala fides has not been substantiated. The orders were invalid because they were based on an enquiry conducted by the Director, Special Enquiry Agency, otherwise than through or with the concurrence of the High Court and as such were violative of Article 235. The impugned orders were passed without effective consultation with the High Court and were violative of Article 233 of the Constitution. Appeals have been preferred to this Court by the State as well as by Rao.
 The High Court has also preferred an-appeal.
 
HELD (i) The confirmation of persons appointed to be or promoted to be District Judges is clearly within the control of the High Court. When persons are appointed to be District Judges or persons are promoted to be District Judges the act of appointment as well as the act of promotion is complete and nothing more remains to be done.
 Confirmation of an officer on successful completion of his period of probation is neither a fresh appointment nor completion of appointment. Such a meaning of confirmation would make appointment a continuing process till confirmation. Confirmation of District Judges is vested in the control of the High Court for the reason that if after the appointment of District Judges the Governor will retain control over District Judges until confirmation there will be dual control of District Judges. The High Court in that case could have control over confirmed District Judges and the Governor would have control over unconfirmed District Judges. That is not Article 235. [378 G-H] (ii) The Governor has power to pass an order of dismissal removal or termination on the recommendations of the High Court which are made in exercise of the power of control vested in the High Court. The High Court under this control cannot terminate the services or impose any punishment on District Judges by removal or reduction. The control over District Judges is that disciplinary proceedings are commenced by the High Court. It as a result of any disciplinary proceedings any District Judge is to be removed from service or any punishment is to be imposed that will be in accordance with the conditions of service. [379 D,E].
 (iii) The conclusion of the majority judgment of the High Court that the order of confirmation is to be passed by the Governor in consultation with the High Court is erroneous and has, therefore, to be set aside. Rule 10 which confers power on the Governor to confirm is ultra vires the Constitution. The order of confirmation of District and Sessions Judge is to be passed by the High Court. The High Court was right in quashing the order passed by the Governor directing the removal because the same was based on enquiry conducted by the Director, Special Enquiry Agency, otherwise than through or with the concurrence of the High Court. The High Court was also right in holding that Rule 9 of the Rules has not been complied with. [379 F-G] State of Assam v. S. N. Sen [1971] INSC 300; [1972] 2 S.C.R. 251 State of Assam v.
