 For the election to the office of the President of India, the Returning officer accepted the nomination papers of two candidates only viz. Giani Zail Singh and Shri H.R.Khanna. The election was held on July 12,1982, and Giani Zail Singh was declared as the successful candidate.
 The petitioners in Election Petition Nos. 2 and 3 of 1982 who had filed their nomination papers, contested the election on various grounds and alleged that Respondent 1.
 Giani Zail Singh exercised undue influence over the voters through his confidants.
 7 A preliminary objection to the maintainability of these petitions was raised on behalf of Respondent no. 1 and the Attorney General. It was contended that neither of the two petitioners was a `candidate' within the meaning of section 13(a) of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections Act, 1952 and since under section 14A, an election petition can be filed only by a person who was a candidate at the election, the petitioners had no standing to file the petitions.
 This Court framed the following preliminary issue:
 "Does the petitioner have no locus standi to maintain the petition on the ground that he was not a `candidate' within the meaning of section 13(a) read with section 14A of Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections Act 1952? Election Petition No. 4 of 1982 was filed by 27 Members of Parliaments challenging the election of Respondent No. 1, Giani Zail Singh as the President of India. contending that the petitioners jointly sponsored the candidature of Shri Khanna, a former Judge and that Giani Zail Singh was not a "Suitable person "for holding the high office of the President of India and that Shri M.H. Beg former Chief Justice and Chairman of the Minorities Commission, was engaged by Respondent I and by the Prime Minister "for influencing the votes of the Minority Communities";(2) that a Cabinet Minister of the Union Government, a `supporter and close associate 'of Respondent 1, exercised undue influence over the voters by misusing the Government machinery and that a statement was issued by him through the Press Info- Bureau asking the voters to vote for Respondent 1, (3) that the Prim, Min ter participated in the election campaign of Respondent 1 and misused to Government machinery for that purpose, (4) that the Prime Minister made a communal appeal to the Akali Dal that its members should vote for Respondent 1, and (5) that Government helicopters and cars were misused for the purpose of the election of Respondent 1, and that these various acts were committed by supporters of Respondent 1 with his connivance.
 It was contended on behalf of Respondent I that even assuming that the aforesaid allegation were true they did not disclose any cause of action for setting aside the election of respondent 1.
 This Court framed the following issues : (1) "can the election of a candidate to the office of the President of India be challenged on the ground that he is not a suitable person for holding that office",(2) "whether the averments in the Election Petition, assuming them to be true and correct; disclose any cause of action for setting aside the election of the returned candidate (Respondent 1) on the grounds stated in section 18 (1) (a) of the Act".
 Dismissing the election Petitions, ^ HELD:
 Election Petitions Nos. 2&3 of 1982.
 
 1. The petitioners have no locus standi to file the election petitions since they were neither duly nominated nor can they claim to have been duly ominated as candidates at the Presidential election.[16 H] 8 
 2. Three pre-conditions govern an election petition by which a Presidential election is challanged. In the first place such a petition has to be filed in the Supreme Court.
 Secondly, the petition must disclose a challange to the election on one or more grounds specified in sub-section (1) of section 18 or section 19. Thirdly an election petition can be presented only by a person who was a candidate at the presidential election or by twenty or more electors. joined together as petitioners.[14 E-F] 
 3. The definition of the word `candidate' in section 13 (a) of the Act consists of two parts.`Candidate' means a person who has either been duly nominated as a candidate at a Presidential election or a person who claims to have been duly nominated. Section 5B (1) (a) of the Act provides that on or before the date appointed for making nominations, each candidate shall deliver to the Returning Officer a nomination paper completed in the prescribed form, subscribed by the candidate as assenting to the nomination, and "in the case of Presidential election, also by at least ten electors as proposers and at least ten electors as seconders".[14 G-H; 15 A] In the instant case, neither of the two petitioners was duly nominated. The nomination papers filed by them were not subscribed by ten electors as proposers and ten electors as seconders. It was precisely for this reason that their nomination papers were rejected by the Returning Officer.
 Since the nomination papers of the two petitioners were not subscribed as required by section 5B (1) (a) of the Act, it follows that they were not duly nominated as "candidates" at the election. [15 A-B] 
 4. The occasion for a person to make a claim that he was duly nominated can arise only if the nomination paper complies with the statutory requirements which govern the filing of nomination papers and not otherwise. The claim that he was `duly' nominated necessarily implies and involves the claim that his nomination paper conformed to the requirements of the statute. A contestant whose nomination paper is not subscribed by at least ten electors as proposers and ten electors as seconders, as required by s. 58 (1) (a) of the Act, cannot therefore claim to have been duly nominated, any more than a contestant who had not subscribed his assent to his own nomination can. The claim of a contestant that he was duly nominated must arise out of his compliance with provision of the Act, and not out of the violation of the Act. Otherwise, a person who had not filed any nomination paper at all but who had only informed the Returning Officer orally that he desired to contest the election could also contend that he "claims to have been duly nominated as a candidate". [15 F-H; 16A] In the instant case, the nomination papers of the petitioners were rightly rejected on the ground of non- compliance with the mandatory requirement of s.58 (1)(a) of the Act. Their claim that they have been duly nominated is not within the framework of the Act but is dehors the Act.
 It cannot therefore be entertained.[16 C] Charan Lal Sahu v. Shri Fakruddin Ali Ahmed. (A.I.R.) 1975 S.C. 1288; Charan Lal Sahuv. Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy[1978] INSC 34; , [1978] 3 SCR 1, referred to.

 5. It is of the essence of the functioning of a democracy that elections to public offices must be open to the scrutiny of an independent Tribunal. [17 D] In the instant cases, it is regrettable that election petitions challenging the election to the high office of the President of India should be filed in a cavalier fashion.
 The petitions have an extempore. appearance and not even a second look, appears to have been given to the manner of drafting these petitions or to the contents raised therein.
 The court refrained from passing any order of costs and, instead expressed disapproval of the light hearted and indifferent manner in which these petitions were filed. [17 B-C] Election petitions No. 4 of 1982.
 
 1. The rights arising out of elections, including the right to contest or challenge an election, are not common law rights. They are creatures of the statutes which.
 create, confer or limit those rights. Therefore, for deciding the question whether an election can be set aside on any alleged ground, the courts have to consult the provisions of law governing the particular election. They have to function within the framework of that law and cannot travel beyond it. Only those persons on whom the right of franchise is conferred by the statute can vote at the election. [19 F-G] In the instant case, that right is conferred on every`elector' as defined in section 2(d) of the Act. Only those person who are qualified to be elected to the particular office can contest the election. That right is regulated by section 5A of the Act. The election can be called into question in the manner prescribed by the statute and not in any other manner. Section 14(1) of the Act provides that no election shall be called in question except by presenting an election petition to the authority specified in sub-section (2) which is the Supreme Court. The grounds for setting aside the election to the office of the President or the Vice-President and the ground on which a candidate other than the returned candidate may be declared to have been elected are laid down in sections 18 and 19 of the Act. The election can neither be questioned nor set aside on any other ground. Therefore, the challenge to the election of the returned candidate on the ground of his want of suitability to occupy the office of the President cannot be entertained and must be rejected.[20 D-E] K.Venkateswara Rao v. Bekkam Narsimha Reddy [1969] I SCR 679 at 684 and Charan Lal sahu v.Nandkishore Bhatt[1973] INSC 126; , [1974] 1 SCR 294 at 296 referred to.
 
 2. Suitability of a candidate is for the electorate to judge and not for the court to decide. The court cannot substitute its own assessment of the suitability of a candidate for the verdict returned by the electorate. The verdict of the electorate is a verdict on the suitability' of the candidate. `Suitability' is a fluid concept of uncertain import. The ballot-box is, or has to be assumed to be its sole judge. [20 G-2 1 A] 
 3. It is not open to a petitioner in an Election Petition to plead in terms of synonyms. In Election Petitions pleadings have to be precise, specific and unambiguous so as to put the respondent on notice. The rule of pleadings that facts constituting the cause of action must be specifically pleaded is as fundamental as it is elementary. [23 A] 10 
 4. Connivance may in certain situations amount to`consent'. Dictionaries give `consent' as one of the meanings of the word `connivance'. But it is not true to say that `connivance' invariably and necessarily means or amounts to `consent', that is to say, irrespective of the context of the given situation. The two cannot, therefore, be equated. Consent implies that parties are ad idem.
 Connivance does not necessarily imply that parties are of one mind. They may or may not be, depending upon the facts of the situation. [23 B-C] 
 5. Precision in pleadings particularly in Election Petitions is necessary. The importance of a specific pleading in election petitions can be appreciated only if it is realised that the absence of a specific plea puts the respondent at a great disadvantage. He must know what case he has to meet. He cannot be kept guessing whether the petitioner means what he says. The petitioner cannot be allowed to keep his options open until the trial and adduce such evidence as seems convenient and comes handy. It is therefore impermissible to substitute the word consent for the word `connivance' which occurs in the pleadings of the petitioners. [23 F, D-E] 
 6. In the absence or a pleading that the offence of undue influence was committed with the "consent" of the returned candidate, one of the main ingredients of section 18(1) (a) remains unsatisfied. [23 C] 7 When the Act was passed in 1952, section 18(1)(a) provided that the Supreme Court shall declare the election of the returned candidate void if it is of opinion that the offence of bribery or undue influence has been committed by the returned candidate or by any person "with the connivance" of the returned candidate. This sub-section was amended by section 7 of the Presidential and Vice- Presidential Election (Amendment) Act, 5 of 1974. The word `connivance' was substituted by the word `consent' by the Amendment Act. If `connivance' carried the same meaning as consent and if one was the same as the other, the Parliament would not have taken the deliberate step of deleting the word connivance a and substituting it by the word consent'.
 The Amendment shows that connivance and consent connote distinct concepts for the purpose of section 18 (I) (a).[23 G-24 B] 
 8. The mere Act of canvassing for a candidate cannot amount to undue influence within the meaning of Section 171C of the Penal Code. [26 C] Baburao patel v. Dr. Zakir Hussain [1968] 2SCR 133;
 Shiv Kirpal Singh v. Shri V.V Giri [1971] 2 SCR 197,320, 32]; and Ram Dialy santLal [1959] Suppl. 2 SCR 748 at 758, 759 referred to.
 
 9. The laws of election are self-contained codes and the rights arising out of elections are the off springs of those laws. The provisions of the Representation of the People Act 1951 cannot be engrafted upon the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections Act 1952, to enlarge the scope of an election petition filed to challenge a Presidential or Vice-Presidential election. Such an election can be set aside only on the grounds specified in section 18 (1) of the Act. [28 B-C] 
 10. The use of Government machinery, abuse of official position and appeal to communal sentiments so long as such appeal does not amount to 11 undue influence, are not considered by the Legislature to be circumstances which would invalidate a Presidential or a Vice-Presidential election. [27 M; 28 A] 
 11. The Act cannot be held to be unconstitutional on the ground that it limits the challenge to the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Election to the grounds set forth in section 18 (1). While enacting a law in pursuance of the power conferred by Article 71 (3), Parliament. is entitle to specify the particular kind of doubts or disputes which shall be inquired into and decided by the Supreme Court. If every kind of fanciful doubt or frivolous doubt will have to be inquire into by this Court, election petitions will became a fertile ground for fighting political battles. [28 F; 28 G-H] 
 12. A candidate who wants to contest the election for the office of the President cannot take the oath in any of the forms prescribed by the Third Schedule to the Constitution. That Schedule does not prescribe any form of oath for a person who desires to contest a Presidential election. [29 E] In the instant case, the averments in the Election petition, assuming them to be true and correct, do not disclose any cause of action for setting aside the election of the returned candidate on the ground stated in section 18 (1)(a) of the Act. [28 D]
