 Respondent No. 1 is a registered partnership firm which deals in leather foot wears at Karnal in Haryana and at other places under the name and style of "Liberty Footwear Company". It had an industrial dispute with his workmen; the latters' Union complaining that the management had terminat- ed the services of more than 200 workmen. The management asserted that the persons whose services had been terminated were not its employees at the material time. The dispute having remained unsealed, the workmen went on strike as a result whereof the management had to lay off certain work- ers. The agitation of the workers in front of the factory created a law and order problem and the police had to inter- vene in the matter. With a view to bring about a settlement, the official authorities such as Labour Commissioner, Labour and Public Health Minister and other. Concerned officials all came and extended their good officers. They succeeded in their efforts and on March 31, 1988, the parties entered into an agreement containing the terms of settlement of their dispute. It was agreed between them that a committee consisting of five persons, two from the management and two from the workmen's union, with the Deputy Commissioner Karnal, as the President should be constituted, as arbitra- tors, to determine the dispute. The Committee gave its award on 29.4.1988 and 11.5.1988 directing the management to reinstate in all 159 workers. The management did not imple- ment the award by reinstating the workmen but instead chal- lenged the validity of the award by means of a Writ Petition before the High Court. The management inter alia contended before the High Court that (i) the committee procedural irregularities; (ii) that the committee did not afford opportunity to the management to produce evidence and (iii) that the arbitration agreement was not published in the official Gazette as required by 1066 Sub-section (3) of Section 10A of the Act and thus the award made without such publication was bad and invalid. The High Court without going into other contentions accepted the Writ Petition only on the ground of non-publication of the agree- ment in the Gazette. It held that the requirement of Sub- section 3 of Section 10A is mandatory and its non-compliance would vitiate the award. It accordingly directed the State Government to publish the agreement in the Gazette and also directed the committee to determine the dispute afresh and pass the award after the publication of the agreement.
 The employees' Union has preferred this appeal after obtaining Special Leave. In the meanwhile the management had preferred Letters Patent Appeal against certain directions of the Single Judge of the High Court which is impugned in this appeal and the State Government has referred the dis- pute to the Industrial Tribunal, Ambala, under section 10(1) of the Act for adjudication.
 Disposing of the appeal with directions this Court, 
 HELD: At both the places viz, in Sub-section (3) and Rule 7 of the Industrial Disputes (Central) Rules, 1967, it may be noted that the legislature has used the word "shall".
 In the context in which the word has been, there is, little doubt about obligation to publish the agreement in the official Gazette. [1075F] It is now well established that the wordings of any provision are not determinative as to whether it is absolute or directory. Even the absence of penal provision for non- compliance does not lead to an inference that it is only directory. The Court, therefore, must carefully get into the underlying idea and ascertain the purpose to be achieved notwithstanding the text of the provision. [i076D] The Act seeks to achieve social justice on the basis of collective bargaining. Collective bargaining is a technique by, which dispute as to conditions of employment is resolved amicably by agreement rather than coercion. The dispute is settled peacefully and voluntarily although reluctantly between labour and management. The voluntary arbitration is a part of infrastructure of dispensation of justice in the industrial adjudication. The arbitrator thus fails within the rainbow of statutory tribunals when a dispute is re- ferred to arbitration it is therefore necessary that the workers must be made aware of the dispute as well us the arbitrator whose award would ultimately bind them. They must know what is referred to arbitration, who is their arbitra- tor, and 1067 what is in store for them. They must have an opportunity to share their views with each other and if necessary to place the same before the arbitrator. This is the need for collec- tive bargaining and there cannot be collective bargaining without involving the workers. The Union only helps the workers in resolving their disputes with management but ultimately it would be for the workers to take decision and suggest remedies. The arbitration agreement must therefore be published before the arbitrator considers the merits of the dispute. Non-compliance of this requirement would be fatal to the arbital award. [1076F-1077B] In the modern, welfare state, healthy industrial rela- tions are a matter of paramount importance. In attempting to solve industrial disputes, industrial adjudication, there- fore, should not be delayed. Voluntary arbitration appears to be the best method for settlement of industrial disputes.
 [1077G] The Court, therefore, gave the following directions:
 (i) The State Government shall publish condition No. '3' in the arbitration agreement in the Government Gazette within four weeks from to-day; (ii) The agreement containing condition No. '3' stands referred to the Industrial Tribu- nal, Haryana at Ambala for passing arbitration award in accordance with law (iii) The reference made under section 10(1) of the Act to Industrial Tribunal is quashed and (iv) The management shall withdraw the aforesaid Letters Patent Appeal and the Writ Petition pending in the High Court within 3 weeks from to-day failing which the High Court shall dispose them of as having become infructuous.
