 The appellant was interviewed for selection to the Indian Administrative Service for the year 1990 from amongst the Non-State Civil Service Officers in the State of Tamil Nadu. Three of the members of the Selection Committee rated him as `outstanding' whereas the other two members rated him as `very good'. But his name was not recommended for consideration by the Union Public Service Commission on the ground that there was no `consensus' regarding his ability.
 The appellant filed an application before the Central Administrative Tribunal, Madras for a direction that he should be considered and appointed to the Indian Administrative Service. His application was dismissed. He filed an appeal in this Court.
 Allowing the appeal, this Court, 
 HELD : The Central Administrative Tribunal was in error in dismissing the application of the appellant. If out of five committee members three ranked the appellant as `outstanding' and two as `very good', the result would be that there was definitely consensus that he was at least `very good' and in fact a little better. Therefore, there was no reason why his case could not have been put up for consideration by the Union Public Service Commission.
 Accordingly, it is directed that his case be put up for consideration by the Union Public Service Commission for appointment in the vacancy of 1990. [1073 H, 1074A-B]
