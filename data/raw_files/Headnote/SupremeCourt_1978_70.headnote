 The appellant was a Government Contractor of 16 years standing. He has been executing major building contracts.
 The Executive Engineer, PWD, Ernakulam, invited tenders for executing certain repairs to English and Mathematics blocks of Maharaja College at Ernakulam. The tender given by the appellant was accepted, and a formal agreement was executed.
 The agreement provided that the work should be completed within a stipulated time and that the time shall be considered as the essence of the contract.
 The appellant alleged that in spite of his requests the building was not handed over to him to enable him to start the work, and that in the meantime, the Engineers' strike supervened in which respondents 1 to 4 participated. The Executive Engineer sent a letter to the appellant asking him to show cause why the work might not be arranged otherwise at the appellant's risk and loss through other agencies after debarring the appellant as a defaulter and making good the loss that might accrue to the department from the subsisting contract in the division. The appellant sent a reply to the show cause notice asserting that he committed no default. The Executive Engineer finally cancelled the contract and informed the appellant; that the work was being arranged at the appellant's risk and loss through other agencies after declaring him a defaulter. The appellant was debarred from taking any contracts in future from the Department in Ernakulam Division. The appellant filed a writ petition under Art. 226 before the High Court. The learned Single Judge dismissed the Writ Petition. An appeal filed to the Division Bench also failed:
 The appellant contended in, appeal by Special Leave, that the order was illegal and void for the reasons that no opportunity was given to the appellant to represent his case before passing the impugned order. 'The respondent con- tended that the notice given to the appellant requesting him to show cause why the work might not be got done through other agencies after debarring him as a defaulter, afforded him sufficient opportunity to represent his case.
 Allowing the appeal the Court, 
HELD (1) The majority judgment of the Kerala High Court in the case of Thomas v. State of Kerala which holds that a person is not entitled to a hearing before he is black- listed must be deemed to have been over-ruled by this Court in the case of Erusian Equipment & Chemicals Ltd. v. State of West Bengal, where it was held that fundamentals of fairplay require that the person concerned should be given an opportunity to represent his case before he is put on the black-list. The show cause notice given to the appellant, if construed in the context of the entire para, could be understood as conveying no more than that an action with reference to the contract in question only, was under con- templation. There are no words in the notice which could give a clear intimation to the addressee that it was proposed to debar him from taking any contract whatever in future under the Department. The appellant was thus not afforded adequate opportunity to represent against the impugned action which must, therefore, be held to be bad in law. [518 E-F, 519 A-B, D] Erusian Equipment & Chemicals Ltd. v. State of West Bengal [1975] 2 S.C.R. explained; Thomas v. State of Kerala I.L.R.
 1968(2) Kerala 1(F.B.) overruled.
