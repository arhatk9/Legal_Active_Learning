 The respondents were elected as members of the Legislative Council of Madhya Pradesh in the elections held in 1972.
 The appellant presented an election petition on June 26, 1972 but did not deposit Rs. 2000/- security as required ,under s. 117 of the Act. The High Court dismissed the election petition holding that it was mandatory for the petitioner when filing an election petition to deposit the amount of Rs. 2000/- under s. 117 of the Act and there is no provision ,under which a discretion was conferred on the High Court to reduce the amount of security deposit as prayed for by him. On appeal I by special leave, to this Court, the appellant contended that : (i) the petition could only be dismissed ,after the trial commenced and the trial commences only after notices are issued to the respondents;
 and (ii) the provisions of s. 117 of the Act are directory and not mandatory in character.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) The reference to trial in section 86 is in a larger sense and deals with the steps in a trial rather than in a narrower sense of a trial commencing after the notice of the petition is directed to be served on the respondent.
 The marginal note of s. 86 namely, "Trial of election petitions" does not indicate that ,:under s. 86(1) an election petition cannot be dismissed for non-compliance with the provisions set out therein, unless notice is issued to the respondent. The language of s. 86(1) is clear as to admit of no other meaning, and the marginal ,note cannot be read to control that power. [298B-D] (2)..The provisions of s. 117 of the Act are mandatory in character. The ,High Court is not competent to reduce the amount of security deposit or to dispense with it. The non- deposit of the security along with the election petition leaves no option to the court but to reject it. The right conferred to challenge an election being a statutory right, the terms of that statute have to be complied ,with. [296C, D-E] K . Kamaraja Nadar v. Kunju Thevar and Others, [1959] S.C.R.
