 Dismissing the Appeals, S.L.Ps. and Writ Petitions the Court ^ 
 HELD : (1) Where the competing entries are an Entry in List II and Entry 97 in List I the Entry in the State list must be given a broad and plentiful interpretation. In a Federal Constitution like ours where there is a division of legislative subjects but the residuary power is vested in Parliament; such residuary power cannot be so expansively interpreted as to whittle down the power of the State legislature. That might affect and jeopardise the very federal principle. The federal nature of the constitution demands that an interpretation which would allow the exercise of legislative power by Parliament pursuant to the residuary powers vested in it to trench upon State legislation and which would thereby destroy or belittle state autonomy must be rejected. Before exclusive legislative competence can be claimed for Parliament by resort to the residuary power, the legislative incompetence of the State legislative must be clearly established. Entry 97 itself is specific that a matter can be brought under that entry only if it is not enumerated in List II or List III and in the case of a tax if it is not mentioned in either of those lists. [372 A-D, 373C-D] The Haryana Passengers and Goods Taxation Act is a law made pursuant to the power given to the State Legislature by Entry 56 of List II. The omission of reference to National Highways in Entry 30 and Entry 89 is of signifi- 365 cance and indicates that the subject of "passengers and goods" carried, on National Highways is reserved for inclusion in the State List. A consideration of Entries 22, 23, 24, 29, 30 and 89 of List I and Entry 56 of List II makes it clear that taxes on passengers and goods carried on National Highways also fall directly and squarely within and are included in Entry 56 of List II.

 (2) The power exercisable under Entry 56 of List II is the power to impose taxes which are in the nature of regulatory and compensatory measures. The Court is not bound by any statement made by or on behalf of the Executive Government on a question of the legislative intent or nature of an enactment. What the legislature intended an enactment to be need not necessarily be what the Government says it is. It is a matter of construction, in the light of several attendant circumstances including the source of the legislative power under the Constitution to make the particular law.

 (3) To say that the nature of a tax is of a compensatory and regulatory nature is not to say that the measure of the tax should be proportionate to the expenditure incurred on the regulation provided and the services rendered. If the tax were to be proportionate to the expenditure on regulation and service it would not be a tax but a fee. While in the case of a fee it may be possible to precisely identify and measure the benefits received from the Government and levy the fee according to the benefits received and the expenditure incurred, in the case of a regulatory and compensatory tax it would ordinarily be well nigh impossible to identify and measure, with any exactitude, the benefits received and the expenditure incurred and levy the tax according to the benefits received and the expenditure incurred. What is necessary to uphold a regulatory and compensatory tax is the existence of a specific, identifiable object behind the levy and a nexus between the subject and the object of the levy. If the object behind the levy is identifiable and if there is sufficient nexus between the subject and the object of the levy, it is not necessary that the money realised by the levy should be put into a separate fund or that the levy should be proportionate to the expenditure. There can be no bar to an intermingling of the revenue realised from regulatory and compensatory taxes and from other taxes of a general nature nor can there be any objection to more or less expenditure being incurred on the object behind the compensatory and regulatory levy than the realisation from the levy. [374 F-H, 375 A-C] The maintenance of highways other than the National Highways is exclusively the responsibility of the State Government. In view of the provisions of the National Highways Act, the State Government is not altogether devoid of responsibility in the matter of development and maintenance of a National Highway, though the primary responsibility is that of the Union Government.
 366 It is under a statutory obligation to obey the directions given by the Central Government with respect to the development and maintenance of National Highways and may enter into an agreement to share the expenditure. In developing and maintaining that part of the Highway which is within a municipal area State Government is surely facilitating the flow of passengers and goods along the national highway. Apart from this, other facilities provided by the State Government along all highways including national highways such as lighting, traffic control, amenities for passengers, halting places for buses and trucks are available for use by everyone including those travelling along the national highway. [376 A, C-F] The State Government does confer benefits and renders service in connection with traffic moving along national highway. Therefore, there is sufficient nexus between the tax and passengers and goods carried on national highways to justify the imposition. [376 G-H] (4) It is now settled that regulatory and compensatory taxes are outside the purview of Article 301 of the Constitution. In the instant cases, the tax is limited to the fare and freight for the distance within the State of Haryana. Therefore, section 3(3) of the Haryana Passengers and Goods Taxation Act is not violative of Article 301 of the Constitution. [377 A, 378 B] Automobile Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd. v. State of Rajasthan, [1963] 1 S.C.R. 491 and M/s. Sainik Motors Jodhpur & Ors. v. The State of Rajasthan, [1962] 1 S.C.R.
 517 @ 526; applied.
 (5) Under sections 4 and 5A of the Uttar Pradesh Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, tax is levied on the basis of their user in the State of Uttar Pradesh and not because they are "kept" in the State of Uttar Pradesh. [378 G-H] State of Mysore & Ors. v. S. Sundaram Motors P. Ltd.
 [1979] INSC 236; A.I.R. 1980 S.C. 148, distinguished.
 (6) The levy made on vehicles passing through Uttar Pradesh from a place outside Uttar Pradesh is not violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. The tax is payable because of the user of the roads while the question of picking up and setting down passengers and goods at wayside stations en route is dependant on the conditions of the permit and the reciprocal agreements between the States. One has nothing to do with the other. [379 B-C] (7) Entry 56 of List II cannot be read in conjunction with Entry 26. The taxing power of the State Legislature in regard to passengers and goods carried by roads or inland waterways is to be found in Entry 56. Therefore, such taxing power is not controlled by another Entry in List II which is unrelated to taxing power. The taxable event is the carrying of goods and passengers on roads within the State thereby making use of the facilities provided by the State. [379 F- G] (8) Section 9 of the Uttar Pradesh Motor Gadi (Malkar) Adhiniyam, 1964 is not violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. The rate of lump-sum tax is relatable to the freight carried or the period of the journey or to both.
 [380 A, F-G] 367 (9) Under section 3(6) of the Bihar Taxation of Passengers and Goods (Carried by Public Service Motor Vehicles) Act, 1961, tax can be levied where passengers or goods are carried from any place outside the State to any place outside the State because the vehicle passes through the State of Bihar. A journey from a place outside the State to another place outside the State, but through the State, involves a journey from a place outside the State to a place inside the State and a journey from a place inside the State to a place outside the State.
