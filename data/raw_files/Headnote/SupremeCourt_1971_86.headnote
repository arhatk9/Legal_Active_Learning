 The appellant was convicted of a charge under a. 5(2) read with a. 5(1) (d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The allegation against him was that by utilizing his position as a government servant he sent various articles such as Radios, Transistors, Clothes etc., from Goa to Bombay without paying customs duty thereon. Against the order of the High Court maintaining his conviction appeal was filed in this Court. The question for consideration was whether any customs duty was leviable on goods alleged to have been sent by the appellant to Bombay from Goa which when the goods were sent, had become a part of India.
 
HELD: Goa was liberated on December 20, 1961. The twelfth amendment to the Constitution which received the assent of the President on 27th March 1962 made Goa a part of India. All territories that this country may acquire in whatever manner become a part of India in view of Art. 1(3) (c). [115G-116C] According to the prosecution the goods complained of were all sent from Goa to Bombay after March 27, 1962. There was no statute or statutory rule to show that any customs duty had been imposed on the goods transferred from Goa to other parts of India after December 20, 1961. The trial court and the High Court wrongly held that certain customs duties were leviable because of some administrative instructions. No tax or duty can be levied or collected except by authority of law. Moreover no administrative instructions were produced before the court, privilege being strangely claimed for them on the ground that they were confidential documents. [116C-F] The notification issued in 1950 declaring Goa to be a foreign territory and thus bringing the exports from that country to India within the purview of the Land Customs Act, could not continue to have legal effect after Goa became a part of India, for it then ceased to be a foreign territory.
 [116G] Section 5 of the Indian Tariff Act 1934 as it stood in 1950 empowered the Government to declare any territory outside India as a foreign territory for the purpose of that provision. That provision did not empower the government to declare any part of India as a foreign territory. Once Goa became a part of India the Government was incompetent to declare that territory as a foreign territory. Nor did it appear that any such declaration was made after December 20, 1961. [117C-D] There was thus no legal basis for holding that the appellant had utilised his official position to evade customs duty.
 His appeal must accordingly be allowed. [117E-G] 8--1 S.C. India/71 114
