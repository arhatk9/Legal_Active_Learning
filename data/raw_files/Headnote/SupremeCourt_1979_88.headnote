 On further hearing the petition for release of under- trials in the State of Bihar.
 ^ 
 HELD : 1. The State Governments do not seem to be alive to their constitutional responsibility in the matter of provision of free legal services in the field of administration of criminal justice. If law is not only to speak justice but also deliver justice, legal aid is an absolute imperative. Legal aid is really nothing also but equal justice in action It is in fact the delivery system of social justice. [765D] 
 2. Every State Government will have to carry out its constitutional obligation to provide free legal services to every accused person who is in peril of losing his liberty and who is unable to defend himself through a lawyer by reason of his poverty or indigence in cases where the needs of justice so require. If free legal services are not provided to such an accused, the trial itself may run the risk of being vitiated as contravening Art. 21 and every State Government should try to avoid such a possible eventuality. [765F-G] 
 3. When an under-trial prisoner is produced before a Magistrate and he has been in detention for 90 days or 60 days as the case may be, the Magistrate must, before making an order of further remand to judicial custody, point out to the under-trial prisoner that he is entitled to be released on bail. [762H, 763A] 
 4. The Magistrate must take care to see that the right of the under-trial prisoner to the assistance of a lawyer provided at State cost is secured to him with a view to enable him to apply for bail in exercise of his right under proviso (a) to sub-section (2) of s. 167 Criminal Procedure Code. [763B] 
 5. The Magistrate must deal with the application for bail in accordance with the guidelines laid down in the Court's order dated February 12, 1979. [763C]
