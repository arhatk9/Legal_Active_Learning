 The appellant was the owner of-two bungalows, called "Truth Bungalow" and "Hill Bungalow" in Navsari, South Gujarat.
 The Truth Bungalow consisted of only one tenement with a separate room on the ground floor which was in the possession of the appellant. The rest of the Truth Bungalow which had been let out to a tenant who subsequently surrendered possession was given on leave-and-licence to one B in 1967.
 The Hill Bungalow consisted of two tenements, one on the ground floor and the other on the first floor. The first floor is occupied by S, the mother of the appellant since the last several years. She was paying a sum of Rs. 50/- p.m. to the appellant for the occupation of the first floor.
 The ground floor of the Hill Bungalow was let out by the appellant to one M in 1957 at a rent of Rs. 65/- p.m. M died in September 1966 leaving behind him his widow, respondent No. 5, his son, Resp. No. 1 and his daughter, respondent No. 2. Sometime prior to the death of M respondent Nos. 3 and 4 together with the members of their respective families had come to reside in the ground floor premises. After the death of M they continued to stay with respondent No. 1, Respondent Nos. 2 and 5, however, left the ground floor premises and went away from Navsari soon after the death of M. The appellant by a notice dated 15-10-1966 terminated the tenancy of respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 5, on the ground that they had unlawfully sub-let the ground floor premises to respondents Nos. 3 and 4 within the meaning of sec. 13(1)(e) of the Act. However, the respondents failed to hand over vacant possession of the ground floor premises to the appellant. Therefore, on 18-1-1967, the appellant filed a suit for eviction under sec. 13(1)(e) of the Act. The appellant was carrying on his profession as an Architect and Consulting Engineer in Bombay since 1960, when he retired from Army Service,. He lived in a flat in Bombay for which he paid Rs. 475/- p.m. The principal area of his work in the early stages of his career was Bombay and South Gujarat but by about the middle of 1968. his work in Bombay practically dwindled to nil and his professional activities became confined almost exclusively to South Gujarat. The appellant accordingly decided to settle down in Navsari which was his native place where his mother was living for last several years and from where he would be able to carry on his profession conveniently, economically and with advantage.
 The appellant accordingly amended the plaint in the pending suit with the leave of the Court introducing an additional ground that he reasonably and bona fide required the ground floor premises for hi-, personal use and occupation and was, therefore, entitled to recover possession u/s 13(1)(g) of the Act. Respondent Nos. 2 and 5 did not contest the suit of the appellant as they were not residing in the ground floor premises and the main defence was on behalf of respondent Nos. 1, 3 and 4, 268 who denied the allegations made in the plaint and disputed the grounds on which possession was sought to be recovered by the appellant.
 The trial Court on consideration of the evidence led on behalf of the appellant and respondent nos. 1,3 and 4, took the view that the appellant had not established that respondents nos. 3 and 4 were sub-tenants of respondent no.1 and, therefore, the appellant was not entitled to recover possession of the ground floor premises on the ground of unlawful sub-letting. However, the trial court held that the evidence on record was sufficient to establish that the appellant reasonably and bona fide required the ground floor premises for personal use and occupation and it was also clear from the evidence that greater hardship would not be caused to respondent nos. 1, 2 and 5 by passing a decree for eviction than what would be caused to the appellant by refusing to pass it. The trial Court passed a decree for eviction against the respondents. On appeal by the respondents, nos. 1 to 4, to the District Court, the District Judge confirmed the decree for eviction and dismissed the appeal. This led to the filing of Revision Application before the High Court u/s 29(3) of the Act. The High Court interfered with the findings of the District Judge on both the questions, namely, reasonable and bona fide requirement for personal use and occupation as also greater hardship and held on re-appreciation of the evidence that the appellant had failed to establish that he reasonably and bona fide required the ground floor premises for his personal use and occupation and in any event, greater hardship would be caused to respondent no. 1 by passing a decree for eviction than by refusing to pass it.
 The High Court accordingly set aside the decree for eviction and dismissed the suit of the appellant. On appeal by special leave to this Court, the appellant contended that in reversing the findings of the District Judge on the aforesaid questions, the High Court exceeded its jurisdic- tion u/s 29(3), since both these findings were findings of fact which did not suffer from any mistake of law and the jurisdiction of the High Court under that section was limited only to examining whether the decision of the District Judge was "according to law".
 
HELD : (1) The High Court was. on the evidence of record, in error in reversing the findings of fact recorded by the District Judge. For the purpose of determining whether the requirement of the appellant for the ground floor premises was reasonable and bona fide, what was necessary to be considered was not whether the appellant was juridically in possession of the Truth Bungalow but whether the Truth Bangalow was available to the appellant for occupation so that he could not be said to need the ground floor premises.
 If the Truth Bungalow was in occupation of B on leave And licence, it was obviously not available to the appellant for occupation and it could not be taken into account for negativing the need of the appellant for the ground floor premises.
 The finding of the District Judge on the question of reasonable and bona fide requirement was clearly one of fact. The Dist. Judge did not misdirect himself in regard to the true meaning of the word "require" in sec. 13(1) (g) and interpreted it correctly to mean that there must be an element of need before a landlord can be said to "require" the premises for his own use and occupation. [274 C] it is not enough that the landlord should merely desire to use and occupy the premises. What is necessary is that he should need them for his own use and occupation. This was the correct test applied by the Distt. Judge to the facts found by him. Therefore, it was not competent for the High Court in the exercise of its revisional power under sec.
 29(3) to interfere with this finding by re-appreciating the evidence. The High Court's reappraisal of the evidence and substitution of its own findings of fact in place of that reached by the District Judge was clearly outside the scope of the revisional power u/s 29(3). [2-74 F] The High Court can interfere with the decision of the lower court u/s 29(3) only' if there is miscarriage of justice due to mistake of law. The High Court cannot reassess value of the evidence and interfere with a finding 269 of fact merely because it thinks that the appreciation of the evidence by the lower court is wrong and the lower Court should have reached a different conclusion of fact from what it did.

 906 relied on.
 (2) On the question of greater hardship, the District Judge decided against the respondents on the view that as soon as the landlord establishes that he reasonably and bona fide requires the premises for his own use and occupation, the burden of proving the greater hardship by passing a decree for eviction than refusing to pass it is on the tenant and if the tenant fails to discharge this burden by producing proper evidence, a decree for eviction must go against him.
 This view in regard to the burden of proof is not correct law. [276 C] Kelly v. Goodwin, [1947] All Engl. Report 810, distinguished.
 M/s. Central Tobacco Co. v. Chandra Prakash, Civil Appeal No. 1175/69 dated 23-4-69, followed.
 The High Court was consequently justified in interfering with the finding recorded by the District Judge on the question of greater hardship and arriving at its own finding on the basis of the correct principle laid down by this Court. But the High Court fell into an error in appreciating the evidence and coming to the conclusion that greater hardship won d be caused to respondent No. 1 by passing a decree. for eviction than by refusing to pass it.
 There was no evidence to support this finding by the High Court. The evidence was entirely the other way. [277 C]
