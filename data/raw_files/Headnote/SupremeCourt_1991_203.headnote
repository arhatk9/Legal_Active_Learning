 The respondents in the two appeals were charged under Section 302, Section 302 read with Section 34 and Section 201 read with Section 34 IPC for the murder of their domes- tic help. and for causing disappearance of the commission of offence.
 The trial court acquitted all the four accused of the offence under Section 201 read with Section 34 IPC but convicted one of them under Section 302 and the other three for the nffence under Section 302 read with Section 34 and sentenced all of them to death. The High Court upheld the conviction of the accused under Section 302, but reduced his sentence to life imprisonment. It acquitted the other three accused of the offence under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC.
 The main accused, who was convicted under Section 302 IPC, appealed to this Court against his conviction. The State also flied an appeal before this Court against the acquittal of' two of the three accused for offence under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC. Since the respondents in the State's appeal could not be served by the time the appeals came up for disposal', this Court heard the appeal of the lone accused and taking into consideration the evi- dence which had bearing on the accused's appeal only, al- lowed his appeal.
 Subsequently, the State flied an appeal before this Court against the trial court's acquittal of the accused for the offence under Sec. 201 read with section 34 IPC.
 Dismissing the appeals, this Court, 693 
 HELD: 1. I The prosecution case collapsed so far as one of the accused, who was assigned the offensive part of the crime of murder, is concerned, and he stands. acquitted of the charge. of murder. It is he who was seen cutting the throat of the deceased with a big knife, and escaping from the scene of the occurrence, carrying a blood-stained knife in his hand, and was sought to be apprehended by the eyewit- nesses and others collected there. When the evidence against him, occular as well as circumstantial, has cautiously been weighed by this Court resulting in his acquittal, it is difficult to convict the said accused for offence under section 201 read with 34 IPC.

 1.2 As regards the other accused, on careful considera- tion of the evidence and other material on record, a differ- ent view than the one taken by the Sessions Court cannot he taken. The trial court when grappling with the matter took note of the evidence Of the witnesses of recovery, namely, P.Ws .5 and 11, wherefrom it was clear that a dead body was found inside a bag kept in the trunk. That by itself was of no consequence and at best gravely suspicious.. Its finding was that a dead body in a bag put inside a-trunk was recov- ered from a room of the house and further the part played by the accused in the placing of the dead body in that trunk was evidently not proved. Their individual statement to P.W.
 11 which alone, If at all admissible, does not reveal any disappearance of evidence so as to screen the offender of murder. This state of evidence is insufficient to prove that two of the respondents to have placed the dead body in the trunk. Having regard to the evidence of P.Ws. 5 and 11 there is no reason to differ from the views expressed by the trial court and which was a possible view. As regards the fourth accused there is no evidence against her. [398F-H, 699A-D] Vidya Sagar v. State of U.P., AIR 1977 SC 1116 at pages 11181119, referred to.
 
 2. 'One of the circumstances which weighed in favour of the main accused, who was acquitted was that be alone was not in the house to he solely responsible for the murder when committed and 'at that time besides him therein were said to be the two respondents. What has been spelled out in favour of that accused can with equal force apply to the case of the two respondents. If the so-called opportunity to likewise commit the crime was. 'available to the two re- spondents and not a circumstance to hold the accused who was acquitted, as one of the 694 inmates of the house guilty, it can conversely be said in the same manner about the guilt of the two respondents.
 Their being available in the house per se was not enough to hold them guilty for the .of fence of tie murder. Thus, there is no occassion to convict the two respondents for the offence of murder in view of the verdict of acquittal in favour of the other accused. There was hardly any evidence to connect the three accused to the murder of the deceased, especially when the eye- witnesses account given by PWs 1 to 3 was not very reliable. Besides, from the circumstance that the three accused were inside the house at flu time of the murder, it could not be inferred that they were acces- sories to the crime before the occurrence took place nor could it be inferred that the murder was committed in fur- therance of the common intention of all. In the circum- stances, the High Court was right in giving benefit of doubt to the three accused and acquitting them of the chaege of murder and accordingly thee respondents' acquittal of the two respondents is maintained.
