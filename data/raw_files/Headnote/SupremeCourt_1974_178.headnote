 A notice under s. 4 of the Rajasthan Land Acquisition Act, 1953 was issued by the State Government in May, 1960. It was published in the gazette in June, 1960. A notice under s. 6 was issued in May, 1961 and under s. 9 in July, 1961.
 In January 1970 the appellants challenged the validity of these notifications. The High Court dismissed the writ petitions on the ground that the petitioners were guilty of inordinate delay.
 Dismissing the appeals to this Court.
 
HELD : The High Court rightly dismissed the petitions on the ground of delay. Any challenge to the notifications should be made within a reasonable time. [70B; A] If persons allowed the Government to complete the acquisition proceedings on the basis that the notification under s. 4 and the declaration under s. 6 were valid and then attacked the notification on grounds which were available to them at the time when the notification was published it would be putting a premium on dilatory tactics.
