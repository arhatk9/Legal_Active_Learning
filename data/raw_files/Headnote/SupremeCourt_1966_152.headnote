 G and his son C, the first and second appellants, were owners of a plot of land which they verbally agreed to sell to the respondent on March 5, 1959, at a time when P, another son of G, was on trial for murder and the latter urgently needed funds for his defence. On that date, as against the total agreed price of Rs. 15,106 the respondent paid them Rs. 1006 as an advance amount for which a receipt was executed by the two appellants. No time was fixed for the completion of the sale. On April 4, 1959, upon receipt of another amount of Rs. 2,000 from the respondent, the two appellants executed a writing stipulating that the sale deed would be executed on or before April 15, 1959. This writing also incorporated a default clause imposing a penalty upon the party failing to complete the sale by the agreed date.
 The sale deed was however not executed by that date for which different reasons, were given by each of the parties.
 On April 15, another agreement was executed whereby it was agreed to complete the sale by 30th April 1959 on the same terms and conditions, but it was not completed by that date either. On July 30, 1959, appellants 1 and 2 wrote to the respondent stating that the agreement was subject to a spe- cific undertaking that time was of the essence of the agreement and since the respondent had failed to carry out the agreement by April 30, 1959, the agreement stood cancelled and the advance amount stood forfeited.
 Thereafter on July 9, 1959 appellants 1 and 2 agreed to sell the land to the 3rd appellant. On August 3, 1959 the respondent deposited the balance of the amount payable by him in a bank and informed the appellants that he was ready and willing to carry out his part of the contract-, and he called upon appellants 1 and 2 to execute the sale deed within 3 days against payment of the balance of the price.
 The appellants having failed to execute the sale deed the respondent instituted the present suit against them for a decree for specific performance of the agreement.
 The High Court reversed the decision of the Trial Court, and decreed the claim of the respondent for specific performance.
 On appeal to this Court, HELD: (By Wanchoo and Shah, JJ., Bachawat, J.
 dissertation) Although the High Court had rightly held that time was not of the essence of the contract, the finding of the Trial Court that after entering into the contract the respondent was not ready and willing to perform his part of the contract must be accepted; a decree for specific performance of the contract could not therefore be granted.
 The agreements dated April 4 and April 15 did not express in unmistakable language that time was to be of the essence and existence of the default clause would not necessarily evidence such intention. Fixation of the period within which the contract is to be performed does not make the stipulation as to time of the essence of the contract.
 Intention to make 228 time of the essence of the contract may be evidenced by either express stipulations or by circumstances which are sufficiently strong to displace the ordinary presumption that in a contract of sale of land stipulations as to time are not of the essence. In the present case theme was no express stipulation, and the circumstances were not such as to indicate that it was the intention of the parties that time was intended to be of the essence, of the contract.

 Before he could be awarded a decree for specific performance, the respondent had to prove his readiness and willingness continuously from the date of the contract till the date of hearing of the suit to complete his part of the contract, and if he failed in that, his suit was liable to fail. The Trial Court had found on the evidence that the respondent was at no time ready and willing to perform his part of the contract. This finding was never challenged before the High Court and the High Court did not hold that the finding was incorrect. [234 C] Ardeshir Mamna v. Flora Sassoon, L.R. 55 I.A. 360, referred to.
 (Per Bachawat J. dissenting) : There was no specific issue on the question whether the respondent was ready and willing to perform the contract. The Trial Court was clearly wrong in inferring that the respondent was not ready and willing to perform the contract from the fact that from April 30, 1959 upto the middle of July 1959 the respondent had not taken any steps in the matter and from his failure to explain the delay. If the respondent was guilty of aches, it was the duty of the appellants to fix a reasonable time for the completion of the sale. Mere delay, short of waiver or abandonment of the contract, is no ground for refusing relief, nor is it evidence of lack of readiness -and willingness. The materials on the record clearly indicated that the 'respondent was at all material times ready and willing to perform the contract. [239 E; 241 D-F] Jamshed v.
