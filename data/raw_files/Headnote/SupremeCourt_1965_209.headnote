 In order to promote rural welfare, the respondent had given administrative directions for dividing districts into Blocks and for the appointment of Block Planning and Development Committees. In pursuance of those directions, a primary health centre was inaugurated in a village in November 1958 in accordance with the resolution of the Block Planning and Development Committee. One of the conditions which the village had to comply with was that it should give 2 acres of land free and a cash contribution of at least Rs. 10,000.
 Since the amount was not paid by the village, the Block Planning and Development Committee, resolved to shift the primary health centre to another village with the consent of the representatives of the first village. The second village chosen, satisfied the condition regarding land and.
 cash contribution on 27th July 1959 and thereafter, on 31st July 1959 the first village also satisfied the condition.
 In August 1959 the Committee by a resolution decided to locate the contra at the second village, but the respondent directed that the matter should be decided by the Panchayat Samithi, as by the time, the Andhra Pradesh Panchayat Samithis and Zilla Parishads Act, 1959 had come into force and a Panchayat Samithi had been established for the concerned Block. Though in May 1960, the Panchayat Samithi at first resolved to have the centre at the first village, and though the said resolution was approved by the respondent, the Panchayat Samithi finally, by its resolution on 29th May 1961, cancelled its earlier resolution and resolved to locate the centre at the second village. On 7th March 1962, the respondent set aside the resolution of May 1961 of the Panchayat Samithi on the ground that it did not get the requisite support of 2/3rd majority. On 18th April, 1963, the respondent reviewed its previous order on the ground that the saki order was made under a mistaken impression that the health centre was permanently located at the first village, and directed that the centre should be located in the second village.
 The appellant, who was the representative of the first village in all the proceedings, filed an application before the High Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution for quashing the Government order dated 18th April 1963. The petition was dismissed by the High Court.
 In appeal to this Court, the appellant contended that : (i) Assuming the first Government order dated 7th March 1962 was made under s. 72(1) the impugned order dated 18th April, 1963 reviewing the first, was invalid: in as much as the prerequisite for the exercise of the power of review, namely, the existence of a mistake of fact or law or the ignorance of any material fact, was not satisfied, (ii) the first Government order was made under s. 62 of the Act, and therefore could not be reviewed by the impugned order under s. 72 and (iii) the impugned order was invalid, because it was made without giving an opportunity to the party prejudiced thereby. The respondent raised a preliminary objection that the appellant 173 had no personal right in the matter and therefore had no locus stand to file the application, and also urged, that the impugned order was neither made under s. 62 nor under s.
 
72. of the Act, but that it was really passed under the rules made by the respondent in exercise of the power conferred on it under s. 69 of the Act read with s. 18(2) and that therefore, no question -of review would arise at all as the respondent passed the final order in regard to the location of the health centre.
 
HELD : (i) The appellant had the right to maintain the application.
 Ordinarily, the petitioner who seeks to file an application under Art. 226 should be one who has a personal or individual right in the subject matter of the petition. The personal right need not be in respect of a proprietary interest : it can also relate to an interest of a trustee.
 In exceptional cases, a person who has been pre-judicially affected by an act or omission of an authority can file a petition even though he has no proprietary or even fiduciary interest in the subject-matter. The appellant was the president of the Panchayat Samithi of the first village. He was also the president of a committee for collecting contributions from the villagers for setting up the health Centre. His conduct, the acquiescence on the part of the members of the committee, and the treatment meted out to him by the authorities, support the inference that he was authorised to act on behalf of the committee which was in law, the trustee of the amounts collected. The appellant, therefore, had been prejudiced by the impugned order and his petition under Art. 226 was maintainable. [181 F] (ii)A reading of s. 18 of the Act with the Schedule shows that under the Act the statutory power to establish and maintain primary health centers is vested in the Panchayat Samithi, and there is no provision vesting the said power in the Government. Under s. 69 of the Act, the Government can only make rules for carrying out the purposes of the Act; it cannot under the guise of rules, convert an authority with power to establish a primary health centre into only a recommendatory body. It cannot, by any rule, vest in itself a power which under the Act vests in another body. It is one thing to say that the exercise of the power by the Samithi is regulated by the rules, but another thing, to deprive it of that power in the matter of location of the health centre and confer that power on the Government.
 Therefore, the Rules, in so far as they make the Panchayat Samithi a mere recommendatory body, are inconsistent with the Act, and so the impugned order could not be sustained under the authority of the Rules [183 F] (iii)Assuming that the first order was made under s. 72(1) the respondent was right when it said in the impugned order, that it made a mistake of fact in passing its earlier order on a misapprehension that there was a permanent location of the centre at the first village. The centre was never permanently located in the first village, it was only located' there subject to certain conditions which were not fulfilled [188 F] (iv)But, an analysis of the first order of the respondent demonstrates that it was nothing more than a cancellation of the resolution passed by the Samithi on 29th May 1961. The fact that the word "cancel" is not used and s. 62 was not mentioned in the order could not make it anytheless an order cancelling the resolution. Therefore, the order was, one made under s. 62 and could not be reviewed by the impugned order under s. 72. [187 A-B] Section 62 confers a special power on the Government to cancel a, resolution passed by the Samithi, by an order in writing, if in its opinion;
 174 such resolution is not legally passed or is in excess or abuse of the power conferred by the Act, after giving to the Samithi an opportunity for explanation. Section 72(1) confers a wide power of revision on the Government. On the principle of general a specialities non derogant the case provided for under s. 62 must be excluded from the operation of s. 72. It follows that the order reviewed fell under the scope of s. 62 and that in could not be reviewed under s.
 72, for s. 72(3) enables the Government only to review an Order made under s. 72(1). Further, the impugned order could not be sustained as being itself an order under s. 62 of the Act. The respondent, in exercise of that power, cancelled the resolution of the Samithi by its earlier order, and therefore qua that order had become functus officio. It could not be review not could s. 13 of the Madras General Clauses Act, 1891 be invoked, because, that section, which enables the Government to exercise its power from time to time as occasion requires. cannot apply to an order made in exercise of a quasi-judicial power under s.
 
62. [184 H-158 B; 187 D-E] (v) Since the impugned order was made without giving an opportunity as required by s. 72 to the appellant or to the committee, who were the representatives of the first village, and who were prejudicially affected by it, the order was bad. [189 A-B] The High Court, however, rightly refused to exercise its "extraordinary discretionary, power because, if it had quashed the impugned order. it would have restored the illegal order of 7th March 1962. That order was also illegal because it was made without giving notice to the Panchayat Samithi is required by s. 62. [189 E]
