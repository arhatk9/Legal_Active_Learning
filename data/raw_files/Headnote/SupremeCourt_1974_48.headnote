 The complainant who was Sarpanch of gram panchayat asked the second appellant, his predecessor, to make over the records of the gram-panchayat, transfer its accounts and hand over the money belonging to the gram panchayat to him. The second appellant put him off. When be made a complaint to higher authorities the second appellant transferred some amount to the complainant, but not the whole of it. The complainant filed a suit in Civil Court for recovery of the balance and rendition of accounts in respect of the unpaid amount which was also large. The suit of the complainant for rendition of accounts,was dismissed by the Civil Court, accepting the evidence of the second appellant and his plea that the accounts between the parties had been settled., The complainant filed a complaint alleging that the first appellant, an advocate and the second appellant had made him sign an official receipt of the gram panchayat with its official seal affixed on the receipt and took it without making the payment of money to him. The second appellant was tried for offences under sections 409, 461 read with 109 and 474 Indian Penal Code and the first appellant under s.409 read with s.109, section 467 read with s.109 Indian Penal Code and were convicted and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment and fine. The High Court confirmed their conviction and sentences. Before the trial court the complainant led oral evidence to prove that the appellants had taken advantage of his illiteracy and a trick was played upon him by them.
 Allowing the appeals to this Court, HELD: There are clear infirmities in the prosecution case.
 It is not possible to sustain the conviction of the accused.
 Oral evidence which runs counter to an admission contained in writing signed by a party in the very nature of things is a very weak piece of evidence and cannot be accepted without a grain of salt. In the face of the finding of the Civil Court it would be incongruous to convict the second appellant on the basis that the amount of the Gram Panchayat was still due from him. The complainant may be illiterate but there must be a limit up to which the benefit of illiteracy can be extended to him. The fact that the complainant was illiterate could not induce the court to ignore the infirmities in his evidence or to fill in lacunae in the prosecution case.[524B-C,525B-D,526A-B] This fact would also not justify the benefit of the doubt being given to the prosecution instead of to the accused.
