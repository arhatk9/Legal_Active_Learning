 The appellant filed a suit under s. 20(b) (i) of the U.P.
 Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950, on the basis that her name was. recorded as an occupant in the Khasra of 1356 Fasli, that she had therefore become an Adivasi, and was consequently entitled to possession of the lands from which she was unlawfully dispossessed by the respondents.
 The suit was dismissed but was allowed in appeal by the Additional Commissioner. A further appeal by the respondents to the Board of Revenue having been dismissed, they filed a writ petition in the High Court which, was allowed on the ground that the entry in favour of the, appellant was for a part of the year only and that therefore she was not entitled to the, Adivasi rights.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : Under the section the Adivasi rights can be claimed by those persons only who are recorded as occupants for the whole of the Fasli year 1356., The rights conferred by the section are available also to trespassers. It could not have been the policy of the Act that everyone of those fleeting trespassers who might be found in occupation at the time of the triannual inspections, should be given recognition and be made eligible for the, acquisition of Adivasi rights. It is neither logic nor good sense that the last entry-holder should be so recognised, because, such a construction,. would only encourage greater lawlessness amongst trespassers, every one of whom will make a frantic attempt to be last in the queue. Therefore,. there is no justification for construing the provision with greater liberality than the language warrants. Special rights having been conferred by the Act they ought to be subject to the special limitations imposed by the Act. [689C-D, A;
 690A-B] The Fasli year 1356 commenced on July 1, 1943 and ended on June30, 1949; and the appellant's name was entered as an occupant only from February 24, 1949. As the entry does not show that the appellant was in occupation of the land throughout the year she was not 'entitled to the Adivasi rights under the section. [690E] Shyam Sunar Lal v. Mangali and Ors., [1963] A.L.J. 286, Ram Chander and Anr. v. Chootu 1957 A.L.J. 24 (Revenue) and Girdhari v. Raghubir Singh etc. 1958, A.L.J. 183 (Revenue) approved.
