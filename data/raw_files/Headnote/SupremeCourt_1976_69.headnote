 In 1947, the State Government issued a notification imposing a tax under s. 128(1)(ii) of the U.P.
 Municipalities Act, 1916, on brick manufacturers. The affected assessees filed a suit for a declaration that the tax was void and not exigible. The suit was decreed. The appellant appealed to the High Court. By that time the U.P.
 Nagar Mahapalika Adhiniyam, 1959, had come into force, replacing the 1916-Act. Section 172 of the 1959-Act corresponds to s. 128 of the 1916-Act providing for the levy of various types of taxes on professions, trades and callings. The proviso to s. 172 provided that where any tax was being lawfully levied in the area before the commencement of the Constitution, such tax may continue to be levied until provision to the contrary is made by Parliament. Construing the proviso, the High Court held that the maximum tax leviable under s. 172(2), after the 1959-Act had come into force on Feb. 1, 1960 was only Rs. 50/- since that was the quantum of tax levied before the commencement of the Constitution. Section 142A(2) of the Government of India Act, 1935, provided that the total amount payable in respect of any one person to any one municipality by way of taxes on professions etc., shall not exceed Rs. 50/- per annum.
 Allowing the appeal of the Mahapalika to this Court in part, ^ 
 HELD : The period before the Constitution of India had come into force, that is, before January 26, 1950, will be governed by the maximum of Rs. 50/- fixed by the Government of India Act. Article 276 of the Constitution also sets a ceiling on such taxes, but, the maximum is not Rs. 50/- but Rs. 250/-. Therefore, for the period from January 26, 1950, to the date when the 1959-Act came into force, the maximum tax leviable will be Rs. 250/- As regards the period after Feb. 1, 1960, the interpretation put by the High Court on the proviso to s. 172 that it was only the quantum of tax and not its description that was kept alive and that, therefore, the valid tax is only up to the maximum of Rs.
 50/- mentioned in s. 142A of the Government of India Act is erroneous. The words 'such tax' in the proviso to s. 172 relates to 'any tax' and saves all species or classes of taxes and does not merely preserve the quantum of rate of such tax. Since the class or species of tax is the correct connotation of the expression 'such tax' and 'any tax' the tax on the trade or calling is ssved and its rate is as fixed in the Notification, subject to a maximum of Rs. 250/- . Therefore, the period after Feb. 1, 1960 will also be controlled by the same constitutional maximum of Rs. 250/-, unless any supervening parliamentary legislation, as contemplated by s. 172 of the 1959-Act, comes into being.
