 The owner let out the premises to one Occhhavlal in 1952.
 Occhhavlal sub-let the premises to one Sovani. About 1952, Sovani assigned his business with the possession of the suit premises to a private Company of which he became the Director. Rent was paid to the landlord upto 1966 by Occhhavlal. The owner obtained the possession of the suit premises in execution of a decree obtained against Occhhavlal for non-payment of rent and sub-letting. The assignee, private company, made an application for a relief against the dispossession under Order XXI, Rule 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The Trial Court granted the relief,. but the same was reversed by the appellate authority on the revision application filed by the owner.
 On the writ petition filed by the private company, the Bombay High Court allowed the Writ Petition holding that the private company was a tenant entitled to the protection of So. 15(2) of the Bombay Rent Act. Allowing the appeal filed by the owner, 
HELD : Sec. 15(2) of the Act protects only sub-leases or assignments or transfer by the tenants, but does not protect subsequent assignments or transfers by assignees of transferees. The proviso and explanation to Sec. 15(1) of the Act protects transfer of interest in notified lease or class of lease to assignees or transferees as well as subsequent assignments or transfers. The assignments in favour of the private company was not covered by any notification issued u/s 15 (1) of the Act. The assignment to the private company was not made by the tenant but sub- tenant. When the Ordinance of 1959 came into force, Sovani did not continue in possession. It was the private company which was in possession. Therefore the private company is not entitled to protection u/s 15 (2) of the Act.
 Section 108 (2) of the Transfer of Property Act notices distinction between sub-lease by a lessee and transfer by sub-lessee of his interest by subsequent transfer. [607C, F] N. W. Nayak v. Chhotalal Harirain, 69 Bom. LR. 551, approved.
