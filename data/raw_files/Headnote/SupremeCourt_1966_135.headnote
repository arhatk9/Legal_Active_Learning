 The respondent filed a suit against the appellant claiming two sums as losses in respect of two items and interest on the same. The disputes were referred to an arbitrator, before whom the respondent did not press for interest prior to the institution of the suit, but pressed its claim for the two sums and interests from the date of the institution of the suit till recovery. At the time of writing of the award, the arbitrator corrected one of the issues to show that the claim was for the price of the items. The arbitrator passed a lump sum award in respect of both items, and awarded interest on that sum from the date of the award till the date of payment. The award was filed in Court,, and the appellants application for setting aside the award was dismissed by the District Judge. This was confirmed by the High Court. In appeal, this Court, 
HELD : (i) The arbitrator could give a lump sum award. He was not bound to, give a separate award for each claim. He award on both fact and law is final. There is no appeal from his verdict. The court cannot review his award and correct any mistake in his adjudication, unless an objection to the legality of the award is apparent on the face of it.
 [107 G] Champsey Bhara & Company v. Jivray Ballo Spinning and Weaving Company Ltd., L.R. 50 I.A. 324, referred to.
 In the present case the arbitrator gave no reasons for the award There is no legal proposition which is the basis of the award, far less a legal proposition which is erroneous.
 [108 B] (ii) By amending an issue behind the back of the appellant, the arbitrator was not guilty of misconduct. By this amendment the appellant suffered no prejudice. [108 C-D] (iii) In an arbitration in a suit, the arbitrator has power to award pendente lite interest.
 Though, in terms, s. 34 of the Code of Civil Procedure does apply to arbitrations, it was an implied term of the reference in the suit that the arbitrator would decide the dispute according to law and would give such relief with regard to pendente lite interest as the Court could give if it decided the dispute. This power of the arbitrator was not fettered either by the arbitration agreement or by the Arbitration Act, 1940. In the present case, all the disputes in the suit were referred to the arbitrator and one of the disputes in the suit was whether the respondent was entitled to pendent lite interest. [109 D] Case law referred to.
