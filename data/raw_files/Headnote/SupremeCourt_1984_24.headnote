 The appellants questioned the relaxation granted to candidates belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in regard to the minimum qualifying marks for admission into the medical colleges without properly impleading the persons who were likely to be affected if the submissions of the appellants were accepted.
 Dismissing the appeals, ^ 
 HELD: Rules of natural justice apply as much to proceedings in courts of law as to proceedings before authorities elsewhere. It may be that where a general question is involved and a large number of persons are concerned, the court may, in appropriate cases, permit a few of them to be sued in a representative capacity or may consider them as sufficiently represented by a few who have been properly impleaded as parties. [793F-G] In the instant case no effort has been made to implead any person likely to be affected as a party to the proceedings. The question of the legality or validity of the relaxation granted in their favour cannot possibly be decided in their absence. [793G; F]
