 Upto February, 1961 certain "printing and writing paper" and "packing and wrapping paper" produced by the appellant Company were subject to exercise duty at the rate of 22 nP.
 per kilogram though the former was chargeable,under Item 17(3) and the latter under Item 17(4) of the First Schedule to the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944. The Finance Act of 1961 raised the, excise duty payable under Item 17(4) to 35 nP. per kilogram with effect from March 11 1968 and though for some months the Excise Officer continued to levy duty on certain "machine glazed paper" popularly known as "M.G. Poster paper" under Item 17(3) i.e. by regarding it as "printing and writing paper", subsequently the excise autho- rities began to treat this paper as "packing and wrapping paper" and insisted on the appellant paying duty thereon under Item 17(4). The appellant paid the duty at the rate claimed under protest and thereafter applied for refund of the excess on the ground that the duty on that paper should have been levied under Item 17(3). The Assistant Collector rejected the claim. An appeal to the Collector and a revision to the Central Government were also rejected. It was clear from the order of the Collector as well as from the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the Government that the appeal and the revision were rejected on the ground that the question was covered by a direction issued by the Central Board of Revenue to the effect that the paper in question was to be treated as packing and wrapping paper".
 On appeal, to this Court 
HELD :The direction given by the Board was invalid and had vitiated the proceedings before the Collector as well as the Government. The appeals must therefore be allowed and the orders of the Central Government as well as the Collector set aside, and the proceedings remitted to the Collector for deciding the question whether "M.G. Poster paper" should be assessed as "printing and writing paper" or "packing or wrapping paper" afresh. [253 A-C] The question whether "M.G. Poster paper" is "printing and writing paper" or "packing and wrapping paper" is essentially a question of fact. That had to be decided by the authorities under the Act. The power exercised by the Collector and the Central Government was a quasi-judicial power that could not be controlled by the directions issued by the Board. No authority however high placed can control the decision of a judicial or a quasi-judicial authority.
 There is no provision in the Act empowering the Board to issue directions to the assessing authorities or the appellate authorities in the matter of deciding disputes between the persons who are called upon to pay duty and the department. Although the assessing authorities as well as the appellate authorities are judges in their own cause, when they are called upon to decide disputes arising under the Act they must act independently and impartially. They cannot 246 be said to act independently if their judgment is controlled by the directions given by others. [249 B-C, F-H] Aluminium Corporation of India Ltd. v. Union of India, C.A.
