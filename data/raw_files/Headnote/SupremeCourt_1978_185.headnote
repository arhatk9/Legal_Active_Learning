 The appellant, a harijan by birth and a cobbler by vocation was the lessee of a portion of a shop in Ram Bazaar Simla, since 1963, on an annual rent of Rs. 300/-. On the landlord's petition for eviction of the appellant a tenant under section 13 (2) (ii) (b) of the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act, 1949, as applied to Himachal Pradesh on the ground that the premises were being used for a purpose other than the one for which they were let out, the Rent Controller held in favour of the landlord. The appellate authority having reversed it, the landlord went in revision before the High Court. The High Court set aside the appellate decision and restored the Rent Controller's Order, inferentially inter preting the lease deed that the lease being of a shop the purpose must have been commercial. In appeal by special leave, the appellant reiterated his contentions viz. that (a) there was no specific commercial purpose inscribed in the demise and therefore it was not possible to postulate a diversion of purpose and (b) even assuming that the letting was for a commercial purpose, the fact that the appellant had cooked his food or stayed at night in the rear portion of the small shop did not offend against S. 13(2) (ii) (b) of the Act.

 HELD : 1. While interpreting deeds and statutes two rules must be remembered. The first one is "in drafting it is not enough to gain a degree of precision which a person reading in good faith can understand, but it is necessary to attain if possible to a degree of precision which a person reading in bad faith cannot misunderstand". The second more important one for the Third World countries is that statutory construction, so long as law is at the service of life, cannot be divorced from the social setting. Welfare legislation must be interpreted in a Third World perspective. [903E-G] The law itself is intended to protect tenants from unreasonable eviction and is, therefore, worded a little in favour of that class of beneficiaries. When interpreting the text of such provisions-and this holds good in reading the meaning of documents regulating the relations between the weaker and the stronger contracting parties-the Court should remember that "where doubts arise the Gandhian talisman becomes a tool of interpretation; "whenever you are in doubt.....apply the following test. Recall the face of the poorest and the weakest man whom you may have seen, and ask yourself, if the step you contemplate is going to be of any use to him." [903G-H, 904A-B] Moti Ram and Ors. v. State of Madhya Pradesh, [1978] INSC 145; [1979] 1 SCR 335, applied.

 2. The provision of Section 13(2)(ii)(b) of the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act, 1949 has not been attracted. Even the legislature by a later amendment of the definition of "non-residential building" in its realism, has veered round expressly to approve de jure what is the de facto situation prevailing in the urban areas of Himachal Pradesh. [905B, F-G] 
 3. The life style of the people shapes the profile of the law and not vice versa. Law, not being an abstraction but a pragmatic exercise, the legal inference to be drawn from a lease deed is conditioned by the prevailing circumstances. The intention of parties from which courts spell out the purpose of the lease is to be garnered from the social milieu. Thus viewed it is difficult to hold, especially when the lease has not spelt it out precisely, that the purpose was exclusively commercial and incompatible with any residential use, even of a portion. [903D-E] In the instant case, it is impossible to hold that if a tenant who takes out petty premises for carrying on a small trade also stays in the rear portion, cooks and eats, he so disastrously perverts the purpose of the lease. A different `purpose' in the context is not minor variations but majuscule in mode of enjoyment. This is not a case of a man switching over to a canteen business or closing down the cobbler shop and converting the place into a residential accommodation. On the other hand, the common case is that the cobbler continued to be cobbler and stayed in the shop at night on days when he was running his shop but left for his home on shop holidays. A sense of proportion in social assessment is of the judicial essence. [904G-H, 905A-B] [The Court directed the restitution into possession by the trial court under section 144 C.P.C. within one month ignoring the fact that some other tenant was inducted by the landlord.]
