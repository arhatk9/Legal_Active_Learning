 The assessee carried on The business of supplying electrical energy in the City of Calcutta. During the year 1959-60 the corresponding valuation date being March 31, 1959, the assessee showed in its balance sheet a deduction from the value of its total assets on the ground that the sum in question represented the contribution made by the consumers for putting up service connections. The Wealth Tax Officer proceeded to assess the net wealth of the assessee under s.
 7 (2) of the Wealth Tax Act, 1957 and in doing so refused to grant the deduction claimed, though he accepted the valuation of the assets as shown in the balance-sheet. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the Appellate Tribunal however held that the deduction must be allowed. The Tribunal was influenced in its decision by the fact that in computing the value of the undertaking under s. 7 (A) of the Indian Electricity Act the value of service lines and other capital works or any part thereof which had been constructed at the cost of the consumers had to be ignored. The High Court in reference decided against assessee. In appeal to this Court by the assessee, 
HELD: (i) Section 7 (2) of the Wealth Tax Act authorises the Wealth-tax officer to accept the valuation of the assets of a business as shown in the balance-sheet of a company.
 He is not bound to accept any deduction shown in the balance sheet if he comes to the conclusion that the said deduction was impermissible. Section 7(2) does not say that the Wealth Tax Officer should accept the balance sheet as a whole or reject it as a whole. He is merely authorised to accept the value of the assets of the business as shown in the balance sheet. In the present case the wealth tax officer bad accepted the value of the assets of the business as shown in the balance sheet but bad not accepted the fact that the service lines were not owned by the assessee. [164 B-D] (ii) There was no material before the authorities under the Act to hold that the service connections were not the assets of the company. The fact that those assets were acquired by the company by utilising the contributions made by the consumers was a wholly irrelevant circumstance. The balance sheet showed the service connections as the assets 160 of the assessee. It was not said that they were the assets of the consumers on the relevant valuation date. The admission in the balance sheet (profit and loss accounts) was not rebutted by any other evidence. Hence the Wealth Tax Officer was justified in holding that they were assessee's assets. [164 E-H] (iii) It is true that in view of s.7(A)(2) of the Electricity Act, in computing the market value of the undertaking sold under sub-s.(1) of s-5 of that Act, the value of service lines and other capital works or any part thereof which had been constructed at the expense of the consumers will not be taken into consideration. But s.7(A) only deals with sales under s.5(1) of the Act. If a sale is effected under s.8 the licensee shall have the option to dispose of all land building, works, materials and plants belonging to the undertaking in such manner as he, may think fit. In such sales it is open to him to value the service connections put up at the expense of the consumers and add the same in computing the sale price. It is clear from ss.5 to 8 of the Electricity Act that the licensee is the owner of the service connections put up at the expense of the consumers. If that is not so, there is no purpose in mentioning in s.7A that while determining the market value of the undertaking the value of the service connections shall not be taken into consideration. Further s.8 would not have permitted the licensee to pocket the value of those service connections. The fact that the value of one or more of the assets of an undertaking will not be taken into consideration in computing the value of an undertaking when sold under compulsion of law because of some statutory provision does not by itself show that it is not a valuable asset within the meaning of s.7 of the Wealth Tax. Act.
