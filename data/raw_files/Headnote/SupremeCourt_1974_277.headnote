 The appellant is a Muslim, whose mother was a tribal Hindu who was converted to Islam on the eve of her marriage to a Muslim. In the election to the Assam Legislative Assembly from a constituency which is a tribal area of Assam with a heterogeneous composition of tribesmen vaguely Hindu by persuasion, plainsmen Hindus and nearly 80% Muslims, the appellant was declared elected. The respondent filed an election petition challenging the election inter alia on three grounds : (1) that the appellant offered Rs. 2,000/to P.W. 12 a Mulla to collect votes for him, and though P.W. 12 refused the offer the appellant was guilty of the corrupt practice under s. 123(1) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951; (2) that the appellant was guilty of corrupt practice under s. 123(3) because he canvassed for votes on the basis of his religion by asking for votes on the ground of his being the son of a tribal Hindu woman; and (3) that the appellant exercised undue influence by threatening that the persons who might note for the respondent, could be identified and would be subjected to the same treatment as people of Bangladesh were by the Pakistanis. thus violating s. 123(2). The High Court allowed the petition.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, (Per, Alagiriswami, J.) (1) Regarding the first charge, P.W. 12 stated that the appellant offered him money if he would work for him in the election in the two villages in which he happened to be the Mulla. Another witness stated that the appellant told him that he had offered money to P.W. 12 for helping him in the election campaign but that P.W. 12 rejected the offer and, requested that witness to make over the money to P.W. 12 and prevail upon him to work for the appellant. These facts do not fall under s. 123(1). Therefore. it is unnecessary to discuss whether, if money is paid or offered as consideration for votes promised to be secured by a person using his influence it is bribery or not. because, the question does not arise out of the facts of this case.
 [108G109A] (Per Krishna Iyer and Sarkaria, JJ.) (1)(a) An appraisal of the evidence and an overall view of it makes it doubtful whether the appellant it even met P.W.
 12 and therefore, the offer of the bribe had not been established. [123B; 126E-F] (b) Section 123(1) requires (i) an offer or promise by the candidate etc., of gratification to any person, and (ii) the object must be directly or indirectly to induce an elector to vote or not to vote at an election. The purpose of the provision is to ensure poll purity and the exclusion of pollution by money power. If the payment is to induce an elector to vote, be it direct or vicariously, it is corrupt.
 If the money is paid as consideration for votes Promised to be secured by an important person of the locality using his sway it is bribery even though indirectly exercised. But, if the candidate pays money to use his good offices and canvass votes for him it would be a border line case. In the present case, if P.W. 12 had been paid the money striking a bargain for getting the votes in his ambit of influence it is electoral corruption. On the other hand, if it is money received for the purpose of organising effectively the election campaign by hiring workers, going ground to places in car, meeting people and persuading them to vote for the candidate it is 107 proper election _expenses. The touch stone in all these cases of payment or gratification is to find out whether the money is paid in reasonable measure for work to be done or services to be tendered, and whether the services, so offered amount to a bargain for getting votes or merely to do propaganda or to persuade voters to vote for the candidate. The crucial point is the nexus between the gratification and the votes, one being the consideration for the other, direct or indirect. In the present case, the facts as spoken do not even if true, come within the relevant clause namely s. 123(1), because the offer was made only to make P.W. 12 work for the candidate that is, to persuade voters to support the paying candidates. [124B-E, 125B-C, D-F] (Per Alagiriswami, J.) (2) As far as the second charge is concerned some witnesses said that the appellant canvassed for votes claiming that he was a Hindu and others said that be claimed votes on the basis that his mother was a tribal woman. In: a constituency where 80% of the voters are Muslims it is extremely unlikely that the appellant would have canvassed for votes on any such basis. The appellant being a Muslim he could not be said to have canvassed for votes on the basis of his religion, he not being a Hindu. [109B-C] (Per Krishna lyer and Sarkaria, JJ.) (2) (a) The appellant is a Muslim and his appeal, if at all, is on the basis that he was an inter-caste or inter- racial or inter-religious product and as such a symbol of unity or a less communal Mussalman. An appeal by a candidate that he personifies Hindu-Muslim interplay does not cross the line of corrupt practice. [114G-115B] (b) The section requires that the vote must be sought by the candidate exploiting his religion. An appeal to Hindus by a Muslim candidate on the ground of his religion is impossible under the present Indian conditions. [115E] (c) In the particular constituency, if one took up a Hindu posture it would not be an advantage to him, and therefore, it is unlikely that the appellant sougth votes on the ground that he is a Hindu. The ground of religious or communal appeal does not stand in the light of the evidence in the present case and finding of the High Court is.
 therefore, wrong. The High Court had been far too easily persuaded by unsatisfactory oral evidence each of which is of an ad hoc character, uncorroborated by any testimony of compelling value and is contradicted by the party affected.
 The criterion of proof beyond reasonable doubt was forgotten although verbal homage was paid to it. [119C-F] [It is a matter for profound regret that political communalism far from being rooted out is foliating and flourishing, largely because parties and politicians have not the will. professions apart, to give up the chase for power through politicising communal awareness and religious cultural identity.] [119F] (By Full Court) (3) The election petition is vague in regard to the particulars in support of The averment of undue influence.
 More than one amendment. was sought and still neither the names of the persons nor of the places so vital to induce credence and to show fairplay have been given, in spite of the appellant urging that the allegation was vague and bold.
 One cannot pick up witnesses on route and march them into the witness box without running the risk of their apparently consistent evidence from being disbelieved. The charges are quasi-criminal and have serious consequences and all necessary particulars have to be furnished in the election petition as required by s. 83. This being absent and the entire case resting on shaky ipsi dixits the version tendered by the respondent could not be believed. [109C-D;
 122A-D] (Per Krishna Iyer and Sarkaria, JJ.):
 (4) Certain basic legal guidelines cannot be lost sight of while adjudging art election dispute. The verdict at the polls wears a protective mantle in a 108 democratic polity. The Court will vacate such ballot count return only on proof beyond reasonable doubt of corrupt practices. Charges, such as have been imputed here, axe viewed as quasi-criminal, carrying other penalties than losing a seat and a strong testimony is needed to subvert a Returning Officer's declaration. At the same time, findings reached by the trial judge, will not be reappraised and reversed in appeal unless palpable errors or misappreciation are writ large on them. [111H-112B]
