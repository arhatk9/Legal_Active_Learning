 A partnership consisting of the appellants and the respondent had entered into a lease agreement with the Custodian of Evacuee Property in respect of a mill and took possession of the mill on 31st August, 1952. The period of partnership was for 5 years being the period of the said lease. The partners having failed to pay one instalment of rent the Custodian served on the partners a show cause notice on 12-2-54 why the lease should not be terminated. On account of certain financial difficulties the parties entered into a second agreement on February 24, 1954.
 Disputes having arisen between appellants and the respondent, the appellants filed a suit on December 20. 1960 alleging that after the termination of the lease by the Custodian on May 25, 1954 the two appellants and the respon- dent had orally agreed not to dissolve the partnership in spite of the termination of the lease and prayed for a declaration that the partnership between them and the respondent was still subsisting on the terms and conditions set out in the partnership deed dated 24th February, 1954.
 They also prayed for rendition of the partnership accounts.
 The respondent on. the other hand alleged that there was no oral agreement between the parties and that the claim for rendition of accounts was barred by limitation.
 The trial court held that the appellants had failed to prove that there was an oral agreement between the parties and that the claim for rendition of accounts was barred by limitation.
 On appeal the High Court upheld the findings of the trial court.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD :-(1) No inference of implied agreement can be drawn from the material on record. [371E] According to section 42 of the Indian Partnership Act, subject to a contract between the partners a firm is dissolved if constituted for a fixed term by the expiry of that term. This provision makes it clear that unless some contract between the partners to the contrary is proved. the firm, if constituted for a fixed term would be dissolved by the expiry of that term. [371G-H] In the instant case it was indicated in the agreement of partnership that the period of partnership had been fixed at 5 years because that was the period of the lease of the mills and the lease was terminated on May 25, 1954. [372B-C] According to s. 47 of the Indian Partnership Act after the dissolution of the firm the authority of each partner to bind the firm and the other mutual rights and obligations of the partners continue notwithstanding the dissolution so far as may be necessary to wind up the affairs of the firm and to complete transactions begun but unfinished at the time of dissolution but not otherwise. The word 'transaction' in section 47 refers not merely to a commercial transaction of purchase and sale but would include also all other matters relating to the affairs of the partnership. The completion of a transaction would cover also the taking of necessary steps in connection with the adjudication of a dispute to which the firm before its dissolution was a party. In the instant case after dissolution, the partnership subsisted merely for the purpose of completing pending transactions, winding up the business and 359 adjusting the rights of partners and for these purposes and these only the authority, rights and obligations of the partners continued [374B-D, F-G] (3)The suit for rendition of accounts brought by the appellants on December 20, 1960 was barred by limitation.
 In the absence of a contract to the contrary there could be no survival of the firm after August 30, 1957 when the period of partnership expired. [373D-F]
