 The assessee company was incorporated with the object of taking over certain passenger and ferry services on the Konkan Coast. The ass company purchased the assets required for its business from the Scindia Steam Navigation Company and paid part of the consideration by allotting its own fully paid shares, leaving the -balance unpaid. It was provided in the contract of purchase that interest at 6 per cent per annum would be paid to the Scindia Company on any unpaid balance until the whole of it was fully paid.
 The Income Tax authorities disallowed the claim of the assessee company in the computation of its profits and gains for deduction of such interest paid to the Scindia Steam Navigation Company, and the High Court affirmed that -view.
 
 HELD : Interest paid by the assessee company was a permissible deduction under s. 10(2) (xv). [779 F-G] Per Shah and Sikri JJ.-BY s. 10(2) (iii) only interest paid in respect of capital actually borrowed for the purpose of the business, profession or vocation, is a permissible allowance. An agreement to pay the balance of consideration due by the purchaser does not give rise to a loan. Although a loan of money undoubtedly results in a debt, every debt does not involve a loan. In this case the unpaid balance did not amount to capital borrowed and the interest paid thereon could not therefore be allowed as a deduction under s. 10(2) (iii).
