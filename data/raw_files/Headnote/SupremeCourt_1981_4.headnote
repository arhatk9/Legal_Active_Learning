 The respondent granted to the appellant "leave and licence" for the use of their two studios, machinery, equipment and certain other materials. With effect from February 1, 1973 section 15A was inserted in the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947 under which any person who was in occupation of any premises on February 1, 1973 as a licensee shall be deemed to have become on that date a tenant of the landlord in respect of the premises or part thereof in his occupation. The 'leave and licence' agreement was in force on that date.
 In April, 1979 the respondent purporting to terminate the leave and licence' agreement called upon the appellant to hand over possession of the studios to the first respondent. Immediately thereafter the appellant filed a suit for a declaration that the appellant was a monthly tenant of the two studios and other structures covered by the agreement.
 In August, 1979 the appellant filed an application under section 33 of the Arbitration Act for a declaration that the arbitration clause in the 'leave and licence' agreement was invalid and inoperative. The application was dismissed by a single Judge on the ground that he had no jurisdiction to determine the rights, if any, of the appellant as a tenant. A Division Bench of the High Court dismissed the appellant's appeal against the order of the single Judge on the ground that it was not maintainable under section 39 of the Arbitration Act.
 Allowing the first respondent's application under section 8 of the Arbitration Act the High Court appointed the second respondent as the sole arbitrator.
 In appeal against the dismissal of his suit and against the judgment of the High Court appointing the second respondent as sole arbitrator it was contended on behalf of the appellant that under the 1947 Act the dispute between the parties could only be resolved by the Court of Small Causes and that the jurisdiction of every other Court including that of an arbitrator was excluded.
 On behalf of the first respondent it was contended that the subject matter of 'leave and licence' agreement was not 'premises' within the meaning of that expression as defined in the 1947 Act but the business as such and therefore the provisions of the Act were not attracted.
 467 Allowing the appeal ^ 
 HELD : A building in which a person is licensed to run a business is "premises" within the meaning of sections 5(8) and 5(8A), to which part II of the Act is made applicable by section 6(1) notwithstanding the fact that the building is not let as such. [474D] If the definitions of "premises let or given on licence for business", "premises" and "licensee" are read together it will be clear that even a building so constructed or designed as to be capable of being used for running a certain business only is "premises" within the meaning of section 5(8) and section 5(8A) and does not cease to be premises merely because the building is capable of being used for the particular business only or merely because machinery or equipment must necessarily go alongwith the building if it is to be used for the business. If "premises" did not, by definition, include a building given on licence but meant only a building which was let, it could perhaps be argued that the expression 'premises' would not take within its stride a business let as a business, but the situation is changed by the inclusion of any building given on licence in the definition of "premises" and by the deeming of a licensee as a tenant under section 15A of the Act. A licensee is not really a tenant but is a person deemed to be a tenant because of section 15A of the Act. [474 A-B] Uttamchand v. S. M. Lalwani A.I.R. 1965 S.C. 716 and Dwarka Prasad v. Dwarka Das Saraf, [1975] INSC 161; [1976] 1 S.C.R. 277 held inapplicable.
 The 1947 Act applies to a licence to use a building even if the building is to be used necessarily and simultaneously along with machinery and fixtures separately licensed to be used. In such a situation there can be no question of the licence to use the machinery and the licence to use the building being dominant and subsidiary purposes of the agreement. [475 G] The argument that the agreement was primarily a licence to carry on the business of shooting films by using the machinery and equipments listed in the agreement and that the licence to use the building was only a subsidiary incident of the dominant purpose of the agreement is not valid. The two studios given on licence would still be premises given on licence for business within the meaning of the Act so as to attract its protective provisions. [475 H] The agreement in the instant case is a composite agreement which gave "leave and licence" to use the studios and other premises for producing films and to use the machinery and equipment for the same purpose. The licensors parted with possession of the studios and the machinery in favour of the licensees. Notwithstanding the fact that the agreement was a composite one and the two licences were to operate "simultaneously and together" there could be no gainsaying the fact that the studios and other premises were certainly given on licence for the business of producing films. The parties themselves were conscious that the licence granted by the licensor in favour of the licensee was in respect of the studios and other premises and that there was even a risk of the licence being construed as a lease. They were, therefore, anxious to emphasise that what was granted was a licence and not a lease. Both by reason of section 28 of the 1947 Act and by reason of the broader consideration of public policy 468 the Court of Small Causes has and the arbitrator has not the jurisdiction to decide the question whether the respondent- licensor-landlord is entitled to seek possession of the two studios and other premises together with machinery and equipment from the appellant-licensee-tenant. [476 G-H] Section 28(1) of the 1947 Act positively confers jurisdiction on the Court of Small Causes to entertain and try any suit between, among others, a licensor and a licensee relating to the recovery of licence fee and to decide any application made under the Act and negatively excludes the jurisdiction of any other Court from entertaining and such suit, proceeding or application or dealing with such claim or question. [477 D-E] The scheme of the 1947 Act shows that the conferment of exclusive jurisdiction on certain Courts is pursuant to the social objective at which the legislation aims. Public policy requires that contracts to the contrary cannot be permitted. Therefore, public policy requires that the parties cannot be permitted to contract out of the legislative mandate which requires certain kinds of disputes to be settled by special courts constituted by the Act.
 [477G] Exclusive jurisdiction to entertain and try certain suits, to decide certain applications or to deal with certain claims or questions given to the Court of Small Causes does not necessarily mean exclusive jurisdiction to decide jurisdictional facts also. Jurisdictional facts have necessarily to be decided by the Court where the jurisdictional question falls to be decided and the question may fall for decision before the Court of exclusive jurisdiction or before the Court of ordinary jurisdiction. A suit by the landlord against the tenant for recovery of possession of his premises on grounds specified in the Rent Act will have to be brought in the Court of Small Causes which has been made the Court of exclusive jurisdiction.
 [478 A-C] In the instant case the relationship between the parties being that of licensor-landlord and licensee-tenant and the dispute between them relating to the possession of the licensed-demised premises the Court of Small Causes alone has the jurisdiction and the Arbitrator has none to adjudicate upon the dispute between the parties.

 The Court of Small Causes is not exercising jurisdiction over any arbitration proceedings merely because the agreement between the parties contains an arbitration clause and the Court is asked to stay a proceeding before itself. The jurisdiction under section 34 of the Arbitration Act may be exercised by the judicial authority before which the proceedings are pending and not by the court which has jurisdiction over the arbitration proceedings. This is clear from the 469 language of section 34 of the Arbitration Act. An application under section 34 is not an arbitration proceeding; nor is it an application arising thereout. The bar under section 40 does not come in the way of the Court of Small Causes exercising jurisdiction under section 34 of the Arbitration Act to stay proceeding pending before it.
