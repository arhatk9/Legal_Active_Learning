 In the election to the State Legislative Assembly to fill Lip a seat reserved for members of the scheduled castes from Nagpur, the second respondent was declared elected. The appellant challenged the election. on the ground, inter 'Ilia, that the second respondent ceased to be a Hindu having been converted to Buddhism. The High Court dismissed the election petition.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) The second respondent was a well known Doctor in Nagpur, the appellant belonged to Nagpur and they belonged to scheduled castes before the second respondent's alleged conversion to Buddhism. And yet, the appellant has not given the date, the place or the circumstances under which the second respondent became a convert to Buddhism. Nor did the appellant object at the time of the scrutiny of the nomination papers. that the second respondent was not a member of the scheduled caste. [925 G-926 B, F-G] (2) The second respondent was born a Hindu and was married according to Hindu rites. He went to England on a Government scholarship given to members of scheduled castes to study Medicine. If he was not a member of a scheduled caste he had run a risk of prosecution when he so claimed for getting the scholarship, and also ran a similar risk for perjury in the present case. [926 G-H] (3) Merely because the nieces of the second respondent were married according to Buddhist rites, the invitation for their marriage was in the Buddhist form, the second respondent's name was printed as one of those joining in the invitation, at the time of the marriage the pictures of Dr.
 Ambedkar and the Buddha were garlanded, and a Buddhist Bhiku officiated at the marriage, It could not be held that the second respondent was a Buddhist. [927 A-D, E. G] (a) The evidence shows that there is very little difference between a wedding according to Buddhist rites and one according to Hindu rites. Moreover, Buddhist's rites are followed even where one of the parties to the marriage is a non-Buddhist, and there is no evidence that the Hindu partner does not continue to profess Hinduism thereafter.
 [927 D-E, 928 D-E] (b) The names of brothers are included in wedding invitations under the lead "With best compliments of", very often without their permission. [927 B-C] (c) The picture of Dr. Ambedkar might have been garlanded beCAUSE he was held in great veneration by the Scheduled castes. Therefore, merely because of the garlanding and the Buddhist Bhiku officiating at the marriage. the wedding could not be considered to be according to Buddhist rites.
 [928 A- B] (4) When one is born a Hindu the fact that he goes to a Buddhist temple or a Church or Durga cannot be said to show that he is no more a Hindu and that he had changed his religion. [929 C-D] (5) Also, from the fact that Dr. and Mrs. Ambedkar and a large number of people openly got themselves converted to Buddhism it does not follow that all the members of the scheduled castes followed in their foot steps. [929 B] (6) Religion is essentially a highly personal matter and Hinduism is so tolerant and Hindu religious practices so varied and eclectic that one would find it difficult to say whether a person is practising or professing Hindu religion or not In such a matter, the open assertion by a person, especially in 924 educated member of society. about the religion he professes should be given considerable weight over the interested testimony of others based upon stray instances.
