 The first respondent, the 'Hindu', Bombay, which was a newspaper establishment terminated the services of the third appellant as its correspondent and declined to accede to the request of the latter for his re-instatement. His case was taken up and supported by the Bombay Union of journalists, a trade union, of which membership was open to all persons depending on journalism for their livelihood. He was not supported by any union of the employees of the 'Hindu', Bombay, or a number of its workmen. The Government referred the dispute for adjudication under s. 12(5) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 894 1947. The Industrial Tribunal rejected the reference holding that the dispute was merely an individual dispute between the 'Hindu', Bombay, and the third appellant who had not been supported by an appreciable number of employees of 'Hindu', Bombay. On appeal, Held, that the applicability of the Industrial Disputes Act to an individual dispute as distinguished from a dispute involving a group of workmen is excluded, unless the workmen as a body or a considerable section of them make common cause with the individual workmen.
 Central Provinces Transport Services Ltd. v. Raghunath Gopal.Patwardhan, [1956] INSC 66; (1956) S.C.R. 956 and The Newspapers Ltd.
 v. The State Industrial Tribunal, U.P. [1957] INSC 24; (1957) S.C.R. 754, followed.
 Members of a union who were not workmen of the employer against whom the dispute was sought to be raised could not by their support convert an individual dispute into an industrial dispute. Persons who sought to support the cause of a workman must themselves be directly and substantially interested in the dispute and persons who were not employees of the same employer could not be regarded as so interested.
 Workmen of Dimakuchi Tea Estate v. Management of Dimakuchi Tea Estate, [1958] INSC 3; (1958) S.C.R. 1156, followed.
 In each case in ascertaining whether an individual dispute had acquired the character of an industrial dispute the test was whether at the date of the reference the dispute was taken up and supported by the union of workmen of the employer against whom the dispute was raised by an individual workman or by an appreciable number of such workmen. The jurisdiction of the labour court was not affected by the subsequent withdrawal of support by the workmen who originally sponsored the cause. Nor could subsequent support by a union of concerned workmen convert what Was an individual dispute on the date of reference into an industrial dispute and confer jurisdiction. The Hindu v.
 The Working Journalist of the Hindu in Madras, (1959) II L.L.J. 348 and Working Journalist of the Hindu v. The Hindu (1961) 1 L.L.J. 288, referred to.
