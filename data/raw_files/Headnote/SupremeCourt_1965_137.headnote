 The respondents filed under s. 18A(2) of the Income-tax Act, 1922, estimates of their income for the assessment year 1948, 1948-49 and made advance payments of tax. On 31st MarCh 1953 the regular assessment was made, but the Income- tax Officer omitted to charge penal interest as required by s. 18A(6) even though the tax paid was less than 80% of the tax determined. The error was discovered during audit and the Income-tax Officer rectified the error after notice in 1956, under s. 35 of the Act. When the notice demanding interest was issued, the respondents challenged the order before the Commissioner on the ground that the omission to charge pepal interest could not be considered a mistake apparent from the record, in view of the proviso to s.
 18A(6), which was introduced on 24th May 1953 but was made retrospective from 1st April 1952, giving power to the Income-tax Officer to reduce or waive the interest payable by the assessee. The Commissioner did not accept the contention. The respondents then moved the High Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution and the High Court quashed the notice of demand.
 In his appeal to this Court, the Commissioner contended that : (i) no retrospective operation was effectively given to the proviso, because the rules, which alone could render that discretion operative, were framed only in December 1953, and (ii) there was nothing to show that the Income-tax Officer had purported to exercise his discretion when he passed the order of assessment but did not impose penal interest under s. 18A(6). Me respondent raised a preliminary objection that the appeal was incompetent because (a) the High Court had no power under Art. 133 to certify the appeal as a proceeding under Art. 226 was not a civil proceeding within the meaning of Art. 133, and (b) even if some proceedings under Art. 226 could be treated as civil proceeding, when relief is sought against the levy of a tax, the proceeding could not be so treated as it comes under " other proceeding" as contrasted with a civil proceeding, referred to in Art. 132(1).
 
HELD : (i) (by Full Court) : There is no ground for restricting the expression "civil proceeding" only to those proceedings which arise out of civil suits or proceedings which are tried as civil suits, nor is there any rational basis for excluding from its purview proceedings instituted and tried in the High Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Art. 226, where the aggrieved party seeks -relief against infringement of civil rights by authorities purporting to act in exercise of the powers conferred upon them by revenue statutes. [200 B-D] (Per P. B. Gajendragadkar, C. J., K. N. Wanchoo, J. C. Shah and S. M. Sikri, JJ) : The expression "civil proceeding" covers all proceedings in which a party asserts the existence of a civil right conferred by the civil law or by statute, and claims relief for breach thereof. It is one in which a person seeks to enforce by appropriate relief the alleged in- 191 fringement of his civil rights against another person or the State and which, if the claim is proved, would result in the declaration express or implied of the right claimed and -relief such as payment of debt, damages, compensation, delivery of specific property, enforcement of personal rights, determination of status, etc. By a petition for a writ under Art. 226, extraordinary jurisdiction, which is undoubtedly special and exclusive of the High Court is invoked. But on that account the nature of the proceeding in which it is exercised is not altered. The character of a proceeding depends, not upon the nature of the Tribunal which is invested with authority to grant -relief but upon the nature of the right violated and the appropriate relief which may be claimed. [196B, G, H; 197H] There is no warrant for the view that from the category of civil proceedings, it was intended to exclude proceedings relating to or which seek relief against enforcement of taxation laws of the State. If a person is called upon to pay tax which the State is not competent to levy, or which is not imposed in accordance with the law which permits imposition of the tax, or in the levy, assessment and collection of which rights of the tax-payer are infringed in a manner not warranted by the statute, a proceeding to obtain relief, whether it is from the tribunal set up by the taxing statute or from the civil court, would be regarded as a civil proceeding. The words "other proceeding" in Art.
 132(1) refer only to proceedings which may be neither civil nor criminal, such as, proceedings for contempt of court and for exercise of disciplinary jurisdiction against professionals. it is not because a reference under s. 256 of the Income-tax Act to the High Court is not a civil proceeding that a certificate under Art. 133 may not be granted, necessitating the enactment of s. 261 for granting such a certificate, but, because of the advisory character of the jurisdiction exercised by the High Court, the High Court's opinion is not a judgement, decree or order within the meaning of Art. 133. [196 D-G; 197E] (ii) (By Full Court) : It is true that the proviso operates only in respect of cases and under circumstances as may be prescribed by the rules, but as soon as the rules were framed which effectuate the purpose for which the proviso was enacted, the proviso and the rules became effective retrospectively from 1st April 1952.

 (iii) (Per P. B. Gajendragadkar, C.J., K. N. Wanchoo, J.
 C. Shah and S. M. Sikri, JJ.) : The High Court was right in setting aside the order passed by the Commissioner without considering the proviso (5) to s. 18A(6) which was clearly applicable to the case of the, assesse. [205E] The Income-tax Officer, on the language of s. 18A(6) on the date of making the assessment order, was bound to impose liability for payment of penal interest. But by reason of the retrospective operation given to the proviso added in 1953, the Officer must be deemed to have possessed discretion to reduce or waive interest payable by the assessee, on the date on which he made the assessment order.
 The order which did not take note of the law deemed to be in force must be regarded as defective; and the fact that the offered could not in making the assessment have adjusted his approach to the problem before him in the light of those provisions is irrelevant in considering the legality of his order. [202A, C; 205 B-C] Per Mudholkar, J. (dissenting) : Even though the proviso and the rule must be deemed to have been in force on 1st April 1952, the omi- 192 ssion to charge penal interest at the time of making the regular assessment could not be ascribed to the exercise of discretion by the income-tax Officer. In fact, when he made the assessment, he had no discretion and was bound by law to charge penal interest. His omission to do so must be ascribed to an oversight and not to deliberateness. He was competent to rectify the mistake under s. 35 and when he exercised his power under the section he himself accepted the position that what he did earlier was through mistake.
