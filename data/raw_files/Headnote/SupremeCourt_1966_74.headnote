 The office of commissioner was abolished in Bombay State in 1950 but it was revived in 1958 by the Commissioners of Division Act passed by the Bombay Legislature. The Schedule to the Act amended various enactments for the purpose of conferring powers on Commissioners thereunder. Sections 3(3) of the Act gave power to the State Government by notification to amend or delete any entry in the Schedule for the purpose of imposing any conditions or restrictions in the exercise of powers and discharge of duties conferred or imposed on the Commissioner or to withdraw them. Section 3(4) of the Act gave the State Government power to confer and impose on the Commissioner powers and duties under any other enactment for the time being in force and for that purpose by notification to amend that enactment. By virtue of this power the State Government of Bombay by notification conferred certain powers under the Land Acquisition Act on the Commissioner and amended the relevant sections of the Land Acquisition Act accordingly. Under the powers so conferred the Commissioner of Bombay, in 1962, commenced land acquisition proceeding in respect of certain lands owned by the appellants, the alleged purpose of the acquisition being "development and utilisation of the said lands as an industrial and residential area". The petitioner filed writ petitions under Art. 32 of the Constitution challenging the acquisition proceedings on the grounds,mainly that (i) s. 3(3) and 3(4) of the commissioners Act constituted excessive delegation of power to the State Government and amounted to abdication of its functions by the State Legislation and that (ii) definition of 'public purpose' as amended by the Bombay Legislature by introducing s. 3 (f) (2) in the Land Acquisition Act was ultra vires.
 
HELD:Per Gajendragadkar, C.J., Hidayatullah and Sikri, JJ.-(i) The object of a. 3(3) of the Commissioners Act is two fold; first to enable the Government to impose any conditions or restrictions on the exercise of powers and discharge of duties on Commissioners and secondly to withdraw them in case it is felt that the Commissioner should not exercise these powers. There can be no objection to this since the State Government is in charge of the administration and the whole object of the Commissioners Act is Co enable it to run the administration as smoothly as possible. The law which the Commissioners or the State Government or the other authorities have to administer remains the same; it is only the authority that is changed.
 [897 E-G] (ii)It cannot be said that the powers conferred under s.
 3(3) and 3(4) on the State Government are unguided.
 Sections 6 and 7 of the Act 885 886 indicate the kinds of powers which may be conferred on the Commissioner. Further the very nature of the office held by the Commissioner and the duties performed by him up to 1950 would show that it is only the duties of the State Government and of officers of equivalent rank discharging revenue and executive duties which would be conferred on the Commissioner. There can be no difference in principle between the State Legislature inserting a section in an Act enabling the State Government to delegate its power to another authority and the Legislature in view of the change in the administrative set-up conferring power on the State Government to confer not only its own duties on Commissioners but also of other officers performing executive and revenue duties. [895 C-E] (iii)The State Legislature cannot be said to have abdicated its powers in favour of the executive for it has laid down the legislative policy and wisely left it to the State Government to reorganise the administration consequent on the setting up of Commissioners Divisions. The State Government is after all in charge of the administration and it knows specially in view of its previous experience what powers of existing authorities including itself can suitably be conferred on the Commissioners. [897 G898A]:
 (iv)It was not necessary to get the President's assent for the notification amending the Land Acquisition Act because the amendment of the Act became effective by virtue of the Commissioners Act which had received the assent of the President, and not by virtue of the notification. [898 C] (v) It was riot necessary to decide the question as to the validity of s.(f)(2) of the Land Acquisition Act as enacted by the Bombay State Legislature because the purpose for which the land were acquired in the present case was a 'public purpose' as defined in the Land Acquisition Act as it stood before the amendment made by the Bombay Legislature, and it was not necessary for the respondents to rely on the amendment to sustain in the notification.
 Public purpose varies with the time and the prevailing conditions in towns like Bombay are such that it is imperative that the State should do all it can to increase the availability of residential and industrial sites. The welfare of a large section of the community is a 'public purpose'. [899 D-E; 902 E] (Vi)There is no law which requires a scheme to be prepared before issuing notifications under ss. 4 and 6 of the Land Acquisition Act. [Desirability of preparing such a scheme before disposal of sites suggested]. [903 D] Case law referred to.
 Per Wanchoo and Shah JJ. (dissenting).-(i) The amendment introduced by s. 3(f)(2) in the definition of 'public purpose' was within the concept of public purpose in Art.
 32(2) of the Constitution and could not be struck down as ultra vires. [911 B] (ii)By enacting s. 3(3) of the Commissioners Act the State Legislature in effect says that though it considers that the Commissioner should have certain powers it has conferred on him in the Schedule, the State Government may withdraw those powers. This is not a provision for delegated legislation but a transfer by the Legislature of its own power to make law to the executive. Further, if it can be considered to be conferment of power of delegated legislation it suffers from the vice of excessive delegation inasmuch as it gives a power to the executive to the extent of repealing a part of the law made by the legislature [912 G--913 B] (iii)The language of s. 3(4) is of the widest amplitude and gives blanket power to the State Government to amend any enactment which 887 may be in force for the time being in the State by making necessary entries in the Schedule. The provision cannot be read to mean that it authorises the State Government to delegate only its executive powers and duties under other enactments besides those mentioned in the Schedule to the Commissioner by the State Legislation. It is not a case of providing merely for delegated legislation properly so- called but amounts to complete transfer of its power of legislation by the legislature in this matter to the State Government. Sub-s. (4) wag therefore ultra vires and Sub-S.
 (5) which is consequential on it must fall with it. [913 C- D, H; 915 H-916B] (iv)As the proceedings under the land Acquisition Act were taken by the Commissioner by powers derived from a notification under s. 3(4) the Commissioner ACt which is ultra vires the said proceedings must be must be quashed.[918 A]
