 The respondents owned a brick kiln which they leased out to the appellants in 1950. They filed a suit against the appellants claiming rent for the period October 1, 1952 to September 30 1953. The appellants contended in defence that as a result of the operation of the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act the Land in question stood vested in the State of U.P. with effect from July 1, 1952 and no rent was payable to the respondents thereafter. The suit was partly decreed by the trial court but dismissed in toto by the first appellate court. In second appeal the High Court held that the brick kiln wag a 'building' within the meaning of s. 9 of the Act and therefore the land did not vest in the State. The appellants came to this Court.
 
HELD : In the absence of a definition in the Act itself the question as to what is a 'building' under s. 9 must always be question of degree a question depending on the facts and circumstances of each case. The brick kiln in the present case was a mere pit with some bricks by its sides. It could not be said to be a 'building' within the meaning of S. 9 of the Act and the High Court therefore went wrong in holding that the land did not vest in the State. [878 E-F, H] R. v.
