 The Hyderabad (Abolition of Jagirs) Regulation, 1358F, which abolished Jagirs, provided by s. 14 that the amount payable to the Jagirdars under the Regulation "shall be deemed to be interim maintenance allowances payable until such time as the terms of the commutation for the Jagirs are determined." The Hyderabad Jagirs (Commutation) Regulation, 1359F, by s.
 3 laid down that commutation sum for a Jagir would be a certain multiple of its basic annual revenue and by s. 6, that the commutation sum for each Jagir would be distributable between the Jagirdar and Hissedars in certain proportions. Sub-section (2) of s. 7 of the latter Regulation stated that "payment to a Jagirdar of the commu- tation sum of the Jagir shall constitute the final commutation as from the 1st April 1950, of his rights in the Jagir and if any payment by way of an interim maintenance allowance under the said Regulation," that is, the -Regulation of 1358F., "is made in respect of a 'period subsequent to the said date, the amount of such payment shall be recovered from the recipient thereof by deduction from .... his share in the commutation sum for the Jagir." Held that the interim maintenance allowances paid under s.
 14 of the earlier Regulation in respect of a period prior to April 1, 1950, were revenue receipts on which incometax can be imposed. They were intended to be quite distinct from the commutation sum, mentioned in it which sum was ad- mittedly a capital receipt. The words "final commutation" in s. 7 (2) of the Latter Regulation did not show that the interim allowances were part of the commutation sum and, therefore, 848 of the nature of capital receipts but they only meant that the final commutation was the only commutation that the Jagirdar was to get in respect of his rights in the Jagir.
 The observation in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v.
 Butterley & Co. Ltd. that such interim allowances were sui generis and were neither income from property nor from investment nor did it arise from the right to compensation but arose from the statute itself which directed it to be paid, approved.
