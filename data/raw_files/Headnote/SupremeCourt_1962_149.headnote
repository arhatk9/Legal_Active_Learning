 The Rajasthan State Roadways, which is a State Transport Undertaking, published five schemes under s. 68C of the Motor Vehicles Act. The State Government appointed the Legal Remembrancer to hear objections filed, amongst others, by the appellants who were plying their buses on three of those five routes. The schemes relating to those three routes were approved with slight modifications. The objectors in respect of the other two schemes, unlike the appellants, wanted the schemes to be entirely reacted and to adduce evidence. The Legal Remembrance relying on a decision of the High Court held that he had no power to reject a scheme in its entirely or to take evidence. One of the objectors filed a writ petition in the High Court but it was rejected. He came up in appeal to this Court. This Court overruled the decision of the Rajasthan High Court in Chandra Bhan v. State of Rajasthan and held that it was open to the Legal Remembrancer to reject the draft scheme and to take evidence if necessary (vide Malik Ram v. State of Rajasthan, [1961] INSC 156; [1962] 1 S. C. R. 978). The result was that a large number of writ petitions were filed in the High Court and that court dismissed those relating to the three routes, with which the present appeals were concerned, on the ground that the appellants had neither wanted a total rejection of the schemes nor to adduce evidence and had, therefore, no concern with the decision in Chandra Bhan's case. It was not the case of appellants in the High Court, that they had wanted to adduce any evidence that had been shut out by legal Remembrancer nor did they indicate in this Court what evidence they wanted to produce in support of the objections raised by them.
 Held, that the appellants could not be allowed to take advantage of the decision of this Court in Malik Ram'8 case.
 153 It was clear that their objections could be and were offect- ively dealt with by the Legal Remembrancer without going into evidence and the order passed by him approving the schemes under s. 68D of the Motor Vehicles Act was not in any way vitiated by his wrong approach with regard to the other objections.
 Malik Ram v. State of Rajasthan [1961] INSC 156; [1962], 1 S. C. R. 978, referred to.
 It was permissible under s. 68C of the Act to frame a scheme in partial exclusion of private operators and making the permit ineffective for the overlapping part of the route was no more than partial exclusion and was, therefore, justified under s. 68G of the Act.
 Although a permit holder whose permit was thus made ineffective could not claim compensation under s. 68G, whereas one, whose permit was cancelled for the overlapping part, could, there could be no discrimination within the meaning of Art. 14 of the Constitution unles it could be shown that the advantage to the former by being allowed to pick up passengers on the overlapping part of the route for destination beyond, was unequal to the compensation which he would have got by having his permit cancelled for the overlapping part.
 Discrimination under Art. 14 is conscious discrimination and not accidental discrimination that arises from oversight Which the State is ready to rectify.
