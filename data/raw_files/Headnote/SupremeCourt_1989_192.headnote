 A common question of law having arisen in this group of cases for determination by this Court, they were heard together.
 Lands of Respondents in Civil Appeal Nos. 2839-40 of 1989 were acquired under the Land Acquisition Act. The Collector made the award for compensation on March 30, 1963 and on a reference, being made under Section 18 of the Act, the Additional District Judge enhanced the compensation by his order dated June 10, 1968. The Respondents appealed to the High Court seeking further enhancement. During the pendency of the appeal, Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill 1982 was introduced on April 30, 1982 and became an Act on Sept. 24, 1984. The High Court disposed of the appeal on Dec. 4, 1984 and apart from raising the quantum of compensa- tion, also awarded a solatium at 30 per cent in terms of the Amendment Act 1984. The State appealed to this Court.
 The matter initially came up before a Division Bench on September 23, 1985. The Bench had before it two decisions of this Court wherein divergent views were expressed. The two decisions were: In K. Kamalajammanniavaru's (dead) by Lrs. v. Special Land 317 Acquisition Officer[1985] INSC 24; ,, [1985] 1 SCC 582.
 This Court (composed of.two Judges) took the view that award of 30 per cent solatium under the amended Section 23(2) by the High Court or the Supreme Court were applicable only where the award appealed against was made by the Col- lector or the Court between April 30, 1982 and Sept. 24, 1984. In the second decision, Bhag Singh & Ors. v. Union Territory of Chandigarh, [1985] INSC 176; [1985] 3 SCC 737, this Court (comprised of three Judges) took a contrary view and ruled that even if an award was made by the Collector or the Court on or before April 1982 and an appeal against such award was pending before the High Court or this Court on 30.4.1982 or was filed subsequent to that date, the provisions of amended Section 23(2) and 28 of the Land Acquisition Act would be applicable as the appeal was a continuation of the reference made under Section 18 and as such the appellate Court must apply the amended provision on the date of the decision of the appeal. In this way the decision in Kamalajammanniava- ru's case was overruled by this Court in Bhag Singh's case and the Court approved another decision of Division Bench comprised of three Judges in Mohinder Singh's case (1986) 1, SCC 365 which merely directed payment of enhanced solatium and interest without giving any reasons.
 In view of the conflicting decisions on the point of two Judges Bench before, whom these cases come up for considera- tion, referred to this Larger Bench the question: whether under the Amended Section 23(2), the claimants were entitled to solatium at 30 per cent of the market value irrespective of the dates on which the land acquisition proceedings were initiated or on the dates on which the award had been passed.
 Overruling the preliminary objection as to the maintain- ability of the reference of matters to a larger Bench, this Court disposing of the reference and directing that the appeals be now listed for hearing on merits, 
 HELD: Solatium is awarded under sub-section (2) of Section 23 of the Land Acquisition Act. Before the Amendment Act was enacted, the Sub-section provided for solatium at 15 per cent of the market value. By the change introduced by the Amendment Act the amount has been raised to 30 per cent of the market value. Sub-section (2) of Section 30 of the Amendment Act specifies the category of cases to which the amended rate of solatium is attracted. [322D] 318 What Parliament intends to say is that the benefit of Section 30(2) will be available to an award by the Collector or the Court made between 30th April 1982 and 24th September 1984 or to an appellate order of the High Court or of the Supreme Court which arises out of an award of the Collector or the Court made between the two said dates. The word 'or', is used with reference to the stage at which the proceeding rests at the time when the benefit under Section 30(2) is sought to be extended. If the proceeding has terminated with the award of the Collector or of the Court made between the aforesaid two dates, the benefit of Section 30(2) will be applied to such award made between the aforesaid two dates.
 If the proceeding has passed to the stage of appeal before the High Court or the Supreme Court, it is at that stage when the benefit of Section 30(2) will be applied. But in every case the award of the Collector or of the Court must have been made between April 30, 1982 and September 24, 1984. [339D-G] A pronouncement of law by a Division Bench of this Court is binding on a Division Bench of the same or a smaller number of Judges, and in order that such decision be bind- ing, it is not necessary that it should be a decision ren- dered by the full Court or a Constitution Bench of the Court. For the purpose of imparting certainty and endowing due authority, decisions of this Court in the future should be rendered by Division Benches of at least three Judges unless, for compelling reasons that is not conveniently possible. [337C-D] The Land Acquisition Bill 1982, was introduced in the House of the People on 30th April, 1982 and upon enactment the Land Acquisition Act, 1984, commenced operation with effect from 24th Sept. 1984. Section 15 of the Amendment Act amended Section 23(2) of the parent Act and substituted the words "30 per cent" in place of the words "15 per cent".
 Parliament intended that the benefit of the enhanced solati- um should be made available albeit to a limited degree even in respect of acquisition proceedings taken before the date.
 It sought to effectuate that intention by enacting Section 30(2) in the Amendment Act. [337G-H; 338A] There can be no doubt that the benefit of the enhanced solatium is intended by Section 30(2) in respect of an award made by the Collector between 30th April 1982 and 24th September 1984. Likewise the benefit of the enhanced solati- um is extended by Section 30(2) to the case of an award made by the Court between April 30, 1982 and September 24, 1984, even though it be upon reference from an award made before April 30, 1982. [338E] 319 One of the functions of the Superior Judiciary in India is to examine the competence and validity of legislation both in point of legislative competence as well as its consistency with the Fundamental Rights. In this regard the Courts in India possess a power not known to the English Courts. [323G-H] Exp. Canon Selwyn, [1872] 36 JP 54 and Cheney v. Conn, [1968] 1, All ER 779, referred to.
 The range of judicial review recognised in the Superior Judiciary of India is perhaps the widest and the most exten- sive known to the world of law. The power extends to examin- ing the validity of even an amendment to the Constitution for now it has been repeatedly held that no Constitutional amendment can be sustained which violates the basic struc- ture of the Constitution.
