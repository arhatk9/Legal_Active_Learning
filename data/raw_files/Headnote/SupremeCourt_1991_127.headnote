 The respondent was arrested by the police in connection with the murder of a Corporator, under Sections 147, 148, 149, 302 read with 120-B of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 3 and 4 of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987. The prosecution alleged that the respondent conspired and hatched the plot to murder the deceased. This was based on the respondent's repeated statement to the Press, which were also published in the local newspaper/magazine and interview given to another paper, dubbing those party Corporators who had voted against the respondent's party candidates for the offices of the Mayor and Deputy Mayor of the local civil body, resulting in their defeat as traitors and threatening them with death.
 The Designated Court, released the respondent on bail, but this Court cancelled the bail. Thereafter, the respondent moved another application for bail before the Designated Court, which granted bail on the view that from the newspaper reports it could not be assumed or inferred that the respondent was in any manner involved in the conspiracy, that there was no justification to record the First Information Report, that the statements of witnesses recorded by the investigating officer, could not be relied upon.
 Allowing the appeal preferred by the State, this Court 
 HELD: 1.1 The police investigation prima facie shows that mafia-type terror and fear psychosis was created which led to the cold-blooded murder of the deceased. The Judge, Designated Court acted illegally in appreciating the statements of witnesses and material collected by the investigating officer at the investigation stage. He should have dealt with the same in accordance with law. [623F] 
 1.2 The Judge virtually pre-empted the trial by delivering the judgment on the culpability of respondent.
 The Judge grossly erred in 620 fore-closing the trial by pre-judging the evidence which was yet to come on record. No doubt, while cancelling the bail order, this Court observed that the cancellation of bail was without pre-judice to the rights of the respondent to move the Designated-Court for bail at any subsequent stage, but that was only in the event of any further evidence being recorded by the court or any fresh material being made available during the investigation or before the court.
 This Court also directed that it was necessary for the Designated-Court also directed that it was necessary for the Designated-Court to consider further material collected by the investigating agency, by recording statements of witnesses. The Designated-Court did not record any evidence and there was no fresh material available before the Court.
 The Judge, Designated-Court, by putting his own gloss over the same material has again granted bail to the respondent.
 The manner in which the Judge has dealt with the matter cannot be appreciated.[623D-E] 
 1.3 The bail granted to the respondent is accordingly cancelled. [623G]
