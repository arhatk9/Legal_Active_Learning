 The appellant was assessed to Agricultural income-tax under the U.P. Agricultural Income.-tax Act, 1948, and was directed to pay it in four instalments. The appellant defaulted and, when summary proceedings to recover the amounts as arrears of land revenue were taken under s. 32 of the Act, it was found that two of the instalments had become time barred under s. 32(2). In a suit by the respondent State for recovery of those amounts, the appellant contended that the only remedy open to the respondent was under s. 32 and that the suit was not maintainable. The trial court dismissed the suit, but the High Court in appeal decreed the suit.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : Where a taxing statute provides for a summary mode of recovery and is not exhaustive, it will be open to the State to have recourse to any other mode open to it under the general law. [532D] Once a notice of demand is served on the assessee for payment of tax due under the Act, and the assessee makes a default after the date for payment specified therein has expired, a debt is created in favour of the State; and the State has the right to recover it by any of the modes open to it under the general law, unless, as a matter of policy ,only a specific mode to the exclusion of any other is prescribed by the law. No such prohibition is enacted in s.
 32 of the Act. [531C-E] Manickam Chetiar v. Income-tax Officer, Madurai, [1938] VI I.T.R. 180, Inder Chand v. Secretary of State, A.I.R. [1942] Patna 87 and Chaganti Raghava Reddy v. State of Andhra Pradesh, A.I.R. [1959] A.P. 631 applied.
