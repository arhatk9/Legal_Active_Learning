 The appellants were tried for murder and for concealing the dead, body. The evidence against them was their retracted confessions and the recovery of the dead body at the instance of appellant Babu Lal from his Kotha. The courts below held that the confessions were duly recorded and were voluntary and relying upon them and on the evidence of the recovery of the dead body convicted both the appellants under ss. 302 and 201 read with s.34, Indian Penal Code.
 The appellants contended (i) that the confessions were inadmissible as the provisions of s.364(3),Code of Criminal Procedure, were not complied with in as much as the confes- sions were actually reordered by the readers of the magistrate and the magistrate had not made any memorandum of the examination as it proceeded, and (ii) that the confessions were not voluntary. The respondent contended that the non-compliance with the provisions of s.364(3) was cured by s.533 of the Code as the error had not injured the accused as to their defence on merits and that the confessions were voluntary:
 Held, that the confessions were not voluntary and could not be used against appellants. The investigating officer had kept the appellants in police custody for several days even after a substantial part of the investigation was over ;
 there was no endorsement on the confession showing how much time bad been given to the appellants before they made their confessions ; less than 24 hours had elapsed between the time when the appellants came out of police custody and the time when their confessions were recorded ; the magistrate who recorded the confessions had taken part in assisting the investigation by attesting the recovery memos ; in recording the confessions the magistrate had adopted a somewhat casual attitude by disregarding the provisions of s,164(3) and s.364(3) which provided valuable safegaurds to protect the 750 interests of innocent persons. Having regard to these features, the confessions could not safely be treated as voluntary. After exclusion of the confessions, the charge of murder could not be sustained against the appellants.
 But the conviction of Babu Lal under s.201 Indian Penal Code could stand on the basis of the recovery of the dead body at his instance and of the evidence of the witnesses of the recovery.
