 The Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1963 (Act 1 of 1964) as originally enacted was specified in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution and was thus protected under Art. 31-B of the Constitution., However the subsequent amending act namely the Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act.1969, was not placed in the Ninth Schedule. The validity of the Act as amended was challenged in the High Court in the writ petitions out of which the present appeals arose. The State relied on Art. 31-A of the Constitution. The High Court help some of the provisions of the Act to be unconstitutional. In appeal by the State and by some of the writ petitioners the questions that fell for determination by this Court were : (i) whether arrears of rent being a charge on the interest of the tenant under s. 42 of the Act constituted an interest in land within the meaning of the word 'estate' as defined in s. 31-A, and consequently whether s. 73; of the Act which provided for the liquidation of arrears of rent was protected by Art. 31-A although held violative of Art. 19(1) (f) of the Constitution by the High Court; (ii) whether s. 45-A of the Act was valid it being conceded by the parties that its validity depended on that of s. 73: (iii) whether the explanation to s. 85(1) of the Act was violative of the second proviso to Art. 31-A (1);
 (iv) whether the amended Act when it reduced the ceiling limit and required surrender of the land held in excess of the limit fixed by the amended Act, without payment of com- pensation at market value, violated the constitutional inhibition contained in the second proviso to Art. 31-A(1);
 (v) whether the High Court after striking down s. 50-A(2) of the Act was justified in adding the rider that the finding would not affect the vesting of the landlord's rights in the Government if they had so vested under s. 72; (vi) whether the rights given to the Kudikidappukars under the Act were a measure of agrarian reform even though the definition of 'Kudikidappukaran' in s. 2(25) of the Act was not confined to agricultural labourers: and (vii) whether the extinguishment or modification of land-lord's rights vis-a- vis the tenant would also be within the ambit of Art. 31-A of the Constitution.
 
HELD:(i) The argument that arrears of interest is a charge on the estate and, being, therefore a right in land, can be extinguished as an estate was unacceptable on the language of the impugned statutory provisions. The liability to pay arrears of rent under the impugned Act, assuming the charge created by s. 42 is an interest in land, is not a 32 7 right in land; besides the liability being also a personal liability it would clearly amount to a debt, Acquisition or extinguishment of such a personal liability for payment of money cannot be covered by Art. 31-A, That money cannot be acquired is clear from the majority view of this Court's decision in Kameshwar Singh's case. Looking at the table incorporated in s. 73 it is obvious that the amount of rent to be paid for getting discharge of the whole debt has been arbitrarily fixed and does not seem to be founded on any rational, logical or just basis. [337 E--F] The amelioration of indebtedness of tenants is a laudable and desirable object. But the person to whom the arrears of rent are due to also entitled to seek protection of his legitimate right and if the acquisition of arrears of rent is outside the protection of Art. 31-A then the provisions cannot but be held invalid. It prima facie partakes of the character of forfeiture of confiscation of the discharged arrears. Art 39 of the Constitution to which reference was made can be implemented by other permissible means without violation or abridging the just and legitimate rights of those to whom the arrears of rents are clue. Section 73 was, therefore, rightly struck down by the majority opinion, [337 H-338 B] Pritam Singh Chahil v. Stale of Punjab, [1967] INSC 26; [1967] 2 S.C.R. 536, State of Gujarat v.

 (ii)On the above finding s. 45-A which broadly speaking provides that rent received after May 19, 1967 but before the commencement of the amendment Act of 1969, and appropriated towards arrears of rent for the period prior to May 1, 1966 shall be adjusted towards rent accrued due for period after May 1, 1966, must also be struck down as un- constitutional. [338 B-C] (iii) Theexplanation to s. 85(1) was rightly struck down by the" High Court. It is clear that by virtue of the second proviso to Art. 31-A(1) landwithin the ceiling limit is expressly protected against acquisition by the State unless the law relating to such acquisition provides for compensation which is not less than its market value. No attempt was made to take the impugned explanation out of this constitutional limitation. [340 F--G] (iv)Prior to the amendment undoubtedly no land within the personal cultivation of the holder under the unamended Act within the ceiling limit fixed thereby could be acquired without payment of compensation according to market value, but once the ceiling limit was changed by the amended Act the second proviso to Art, 31-A(1) must be held to refer only to the new ceiling limit fixed by the amended Act. The ceiling limit originally fixed ceased to exist for future the moment it was replaced by the amended Act. The prohibition contained in the second proviso operates, only within the ceiling limit fixed under the existing law, at the given time. It is true that the new ceiling limit was fixed contemporaneously with the acquisition of the land in excess of the ceiling limit. But it was not contended that a law so fixing the ceiling limit and acquiring theland in excess would offend any,provision of he Constitution.
 [341 C-E] (v)The High Court while holding s. 50-A,(2) invalid should not have added the rider that the finding would not affect the vesting of the land- 328 lord's rights in the Government if they had so vested under s. 72. In none, of these cases art- them facts and circumstances on which the rider could operate. The precise point covered by the rider directly arises for determination in a numb& of other cases pending before the High Court.
 Expression of OPinion on the rider was not necessary for giving relief to the parties approaching the High Court in these cases, The question must, therefore, be left open to be determined by the High Court in cases in which the question directly arises. [341 H, 342 C] (vi)(a) The mere fact that the definition of 'kudikidappukaran' in s. 2(25) of the Act was not confined to agricultural labourers did not make the provisions relating to the rights or Kudikidappukars invalid. In Ranjit Singh's case this Court considered it proper to place a liberal construction on Art. 31-A so as to cover cases where the general scheme of legislation is definitely designed to carry out agrarian reform and something ancillary thereto has to be undertaken to give full effect to such reforms. According to 'the High Court all the lands in the present cases were agricultural lands constituting estates within the contemplation of Art. 3 1 A(2) (a) (iii) and all the persons benefited by the impugned provisions were occupants of huts on such agricultural lands and were connected with agriculture. The erection of a homestead etc. cannot in the circumstances of these cases deviate from the general agricultural purpose.

 [The Court, however, made it clear that it was not expressing any opinion where the provisions of the Act were utilised for lands which are not agricultural lands and do not constitute estates nor where the beneficiary happens to be a person not substantially connected with agriculture, occupying nonagricultural land or where the facts are not covered by the general test laid down in the case of Ranjit Singh.] [348 E] (b)The objection that the area of land permitted to be purchased by Kudikidappukars is unreasonably excessive and there is no. obligation on them to use the land for agricultural purposes is without merit. The transfer is mainly of agricultural land to the landless occupant and it is likely to be used only for purposes of cultivation. This is ancillary to agrarian reforms. A part of the land is intended to be used for erecting a homestead etc., by the occupant. Such erection cannot deviate from the general agricultural purpose. [348 G-H] (vii)The question whether a landlord's right to quarry would be affected by the vesting provision in s. 72 could not be considered because the question was not raised in the writ petition or the High Court. Such opinions partake of the nature of obiter. 'Without dealing with any hy- pothetical question it was sufficient to point out that extinguishment or Modification of landlord's rights vis-a- vis the tenant would also be within the ambit of Art. 31-A of the Constitution if otherwise it was related to agrarian reforms.
