 The bail granted by the Sessions to the appellant, who was charged for an offence under section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, was cancelled by the High Court on the ground that he moved both the Sessions and the High Court simultaneously, without disclosing it to the Sessions Court.
 Allowing the appeal by special leave, the Court 
HELD : Refusal of bail is not an indirect process of punishing an accused person before he is convicted. This is a confusion regarding the rationale of bail. The real basis of bail law is as laid down by the Supreme Court in [1977] INSC 229; [1978] 2 SCR 358 [127 G-H, 128A] Gurcharan Singh & Ors. etc. v. State (Delhi Administration)[1977] INSC 229; , [1978] 2 S.C.R. 358 reiterated.
