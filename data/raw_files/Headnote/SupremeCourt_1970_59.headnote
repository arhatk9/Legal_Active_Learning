 Candidates at the Secondary School Examination held in March 1969, appeared at various centers. The results at all centres were published in July 1969, except those at a particular centre. The tabulators at that centre reported that the percentage of marks and of successful candidates was unusually high (80% or more). The matter was referred to tile Unfair Means Committee of the Board. A comparison of the answer books at that centre showed such a remarkable agreement in the answers, that it was obvious that unfair means were adopted and that the students had assistance from an outside source. The Chairman passed an order on August 30, 1969, cancelling the examination at the centre and allowing the examinees at the centre to reappear at the Supplementary Examination in September The action of the Chairman was placed before the Board and was- approved.
 The respondents, who were the examinees at that centre, moved the High Court under Art. 226 and the High Court quashed the order of" the Board and ordered publication of the results of that centre., In appeal to this Court, 
HELD:(1) There was enough material for the Chairman and the Board for taking action without any' complaint from anybody of the Use of unfair means. [966 E-F] (2) There was no reason for withholding the publication of results, of other centres which were not under suspension.
 [966 F] (3) Under s. 9(3) of the Bihar School Examination Board Act.
 in an emergency, the powers of the Chairman are co-terminus with those of the Board and be can take action himself and later report it to the Board. Therefore, the order of the Chairman in the present case was not incompetent. [966 C-F;
 967 A] (4) The essence of an examination is that the worth of every is appraised without any assistance from an outside source.
 If at a centre the whole body of students received assistance and managed to source success at a high percentage, when at other centres, the average was only 50%, the University or the Board could cancel the examination as a whole; and if there was -sufficient material on which it could be demonstrated that the Authority was right in its conclusion that the examination as a whole was vitiated then academic standards require that the Authority's appreciation of the -problem must be respected. To make such a decision depend upon a full-fledged judicial inquiry would hold up the functioning of such autonomous bodies as Universities and School Boards. [967 G-H; 968 E-H] 964 In the present case, no principle of natural justice was violated and there was no need to give the examinees an opportunity to contest the conclusion, because, the evidence was plain and transparent, and the Board had not charged- anyone with unfair means so that he could claim to defend himself. Therefore, the order of the High Court must be set aside and the respondents-candidates allowed to sit for the next examination. 1969 B-D] Board of High School Intermediate Examination, U.P.
