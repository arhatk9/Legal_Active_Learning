 The petitioners were officiating clerks Grade I in the office of the Deputy Chief Accounts Officer (Traffic Accounts Branch) Northern Railway. They had been promoted to these posts after passing a qualifying examination which in the Indian Railways Establishment Manual was referred to as the Appendix 2 Examination. When respondents 4 to 6 and 11 who had passed the said examination later than the petitioners were shown as senior to the petitioners in Grade I on the strength of para 20(b) of Chapter 11 and other relevant provisions of the aforesaid Manual, the petitioner filed a writ petition under Arts. 14 and 16 of the Constitution. Discrimination according to the petitioners arose because while seniority among direct recruits to Grade I was fixed on the basis of their appointment, the seniority of promotees to Grade I like the petitioners was regulated by their seniority in Grade It without regard being paid to the fact of their having 'Passed the Appendix 2 examination earlier or their having officiated in Grade 1.
 
HELD : (i) The equality of opportunity in the matter of services undoubtedly takes within its fold all stages of services from initial appointment to its termination including promotion but it does not prohibit the prescription of reasonable rules for selection and promotion, applicable to all members of a classified group.
 Mere production of inequality is not enough to attract the constitutional inhibition because every classification is likely in some degree to produce some inequality. The classification need not be scientifically perfect or logically complete. The matter has to be considered in a practical way without whittling down the equality clause.
 The classification must however be founded on intelligible differentia which on rational grounds distinguishes persons grouped together from those left out, and it must bear a just and reasonable relation to the object sought to be achieved. [483 F-H; 484 A] (ii) The State which encounters diverse problems arising from a variety of circumstances is entitled to lay down conditions of efficiency and other qualifications for securing the best service for being eligible for promotion in its different departments. In the present case the object which is sought to be achieved by the relevant provisions is the requisite efficiency in the Accounts Department of the Railway establishment. The departmental authority is the proper judge of its requirements. [488 C-D] The direct recruits and the promotees like the petitioners clearly constitute different classes and this classification is sustainable on intelligible differentia which has a reasonable connection with the object of efficiency Fought to be achieved, Promotion to Grade I is guided by the 482 consideration of seniority-cum-merit. It is therefore difficult to find fault with the provision which places in one group all those Grade 11 clerks who have qualified by passing the Appendix 2 examination. The fact that the promotees from Grade 11 who have officiated for some time are not given the credit of this period when a permanent vacancy arises also does not attract the prohibition contained in Arts. 14 and 16. It does not constitute any hostile discrimination and is neither arbitrary nor un- reasonable: It applies uniformly to all members of the class of Grade 11 clerks who have qualified and become eligible.
 The petitioners had not discharged the onus which lay on them to prove discrimination. [488 F] Meryyn Coutindo v. Collector of Customs, Bombay, [1966] INSC 46; [1966] 3 S.C.R. 600, referred to.
