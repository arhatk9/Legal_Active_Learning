 The respondent company in the first appeal carried on the business of manufacturing brass, copper and 'kasa' circular sheets for manufacturing utensils therefrom, milling paddy, a flour mill and a saw mill in the same compound. it had a rolling mill for the first item of its business and had other mills for the other for each of which it employed different set of workmen, but there were common clerks and other employees for the entire business. When the Employees Provident Funds Act came into force the company was required to comply with its terms. It challenged the applicability of the Act to it successfully by way of a writ petition before the High Court of Bombay at Nagpur.
 The respondent in the second appeal were mills which manufactured Hydrogenated vegetable oil. They also manu- factured tin containers for marketing and storing and its product in a separate establishment in which were employed only 31 workmen as against 211 employed for the manufacture of oil. The mills were also asked to comply with the Act, but contested the applicability of the Act to their industry which was manufacture of oil and not tin containers. They also successfully challenged the order of the appellant against them by a writ petition before the High Court of Bombay, Nagpur Bench. In both the appeals it was contended that each of the respondents was a factory' within the meaning of s. 1 (3) (a) of the Act and that the High Court was in error in construing it otherwise.
 Held, that the fact that the Act was beneficent piece of legislation aimed at promoting the welfare of the employees must he borne in mind in construing it and that there was no warrant in the language or context to read into or imply into s. 1 (3) (a) the sense of exclusive engagement in the schedule 816 industry and that composite factories were well within the meaning of 'factory' which was comprehensively defined by s.2(g) and later made clearer by the amendment by which establishments" were included within the meaning of 'factory'.
 Held, further, that in s. 1 (3) (a) the qualification in which fifty or more persons are employed' though it immediately followed the words industry' specified Schedule 1, properly applied to 'factory' which proceeded the latter words and that the applicability of the ordinary rules of grammer to a section is to be determind by the context and by reference to other relative provisions of the Act.
 Held, further, that the expression engaged in any industry specified in Sch. I' means primarily or mainly engaged in any industry as contrasted with incidentally and in that sense minor or subsidiary activities for the purpose of feeding the main industry would not determine the character of the industry with reference to the Schedule. When two constructions are possible each of which leads to some anomolies that which is on the whole consistent with common sense and the current understanding of the expression used should be preferred.
 Held, also that the respondent in the first appeal Was commercially engaged in a scheduled industry among others and the Act was applicable to it; further held that the respondent in the second appeal was mainly engaged in an industry not included in the Schedule but was engaged incidentally and only for the feeding that industry in manufacturing containers and hence did not come within the Act.
