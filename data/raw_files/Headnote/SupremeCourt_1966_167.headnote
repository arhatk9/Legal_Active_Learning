 Jewellery pledged with the respondent bank by its constituents was stolen by dacoits. The bank settled the claims of the constituents by crediting the value of the jewellery against the amounts advanced to the constituents.
 When the market value of the jewellery pledged exceeded the amount advanced the difference was paid by the bank to the constituent; where the market value of the jewellery was less than the amount advanced the difference was recovered from the constituent. Under the adjustments made in this manner the Bank in the year 1952 made a total payment of Rs.
 48,891 and in the year 1953 the Bank paid Rs. 1,21,760.
 In the return for the assessment year 1953-54 and 1954-55 the Bank claimed in computing its taxable income the amounts so paid to the constituents. The claim was disallowed by the assessing and appellate authorities but the ]High Court in reference under s. 66(2) of the Indian lncome-tax Act, 1922 allowed it. The Commissioner of Income-tax appealed to this Court by certificate.
 It was urged on behalf of the appellant that (1) by writing off either partially or wholly the amounts due from its constituents in its books of account the Bank merely forbore to enforce its demand against its constituents and such forbearance was not expenditure within the meaning of s.
 10(2)(xv) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, (2) in any case the expenditure was not laid out wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the business since the bank was under no legal obligation to pay the cost of jewellery.
 
HELD: (i) In its normal meaning the expression "expenditure" denotes " spending" or "paying out or away" I.e., something that goes out of the coffers of the assessee. A mere -liability to satisfy an obligation by an assessee is undoubtedly not "expenditure'; it is only when he satisfies the obligation by delivery of cash or property or by settlement of accounts there is expenditure. But expenditure does not necessarily involve actual delivery or parting with money or property. If there are crossclaims- one by the assessee against a stranger and the other by the stranger against the assessee-and as a result of accounting the balance due only is paid, the amount which is debited against the assessee in the settlement of accounts may appropriately be termed expenditure within the meaning of a.
 10(2) (xv). [35OF E-G] It could not be said that there was by the settlements mere forbearance to recover the amounts advanced to the constituents. The settlements were bilateral : each constituent admitted his liability to repay the amount which had been advanced to him, and the Bank admitted liability to pay to the Constituent the value of the jewellery pledged with it. When the Bank paid to the constituent the difference between the value of the jewellery pledged with it and the amount due by the constituent the Bank in effect paid the value of the jewellery against payment by the constitu- 349 ent of the amount due by him. In making payment of that difference the Bank in truth laid out expenditure equal to the value of the jewellery pledged. [351 A-C] (ii) The Bank could have if so advised taken its stand strictly on its legal obligations and could have recovered the amounts due by the constituents at the same time denying liability to make any compensation for the loss of jewellery pledged with it. But such a stand might very well have ruined its business, especially in the rural areas in which it operated. In choosing to compensate the constituents and thus maintaining their goodwill the Bank laid out expenditure for the purpose of its business. [351 G-H]
