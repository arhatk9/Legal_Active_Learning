 The first respondent, his brother and parents were charged under Section 302 read with section 34 and section 201 I.P.C. for the murder of first respondent's wife and screening of evidence.
 485 After seventeen months of marriage of the deceased with the first respondent, PW.15, deceased's brother received a telegram that his sister had died. Immediately, the same night at 9.00 P.M., he came to the first respondent's place and found that his sister was dead. He alleged that the first respondent had made extra judicial confession that the deceased was strangulated for not getting the dowry of their demand, and that she was burnt to destroy the evidence and sought pardon of him. He sent for his people. A compromise was mooted to which he was not agreeable. A complaint was lodged with the police the next day. PW.1, the doctor, held the autopsy and found that the death was due to asphyxia.
 The prosecution adduced evidence of PWs. 9 and 15 for the motive of demand for more dowry, extra judicial confession of first respondent, said to have been made to PW.15 that the deceased was strangulated, for not getting dowry of their demand and burnt to destroy evidence, and recoveries etc.
 PW.1, the Doctor, who conducted post-mortem in his evidence stated that the deceased died due to asphyxia, as a result of strangulation, which was ante-mortem and sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature, and that burn injuries were 95 per cent, on the entire body except on the feet, and these were post-mortem.
 The Sessions Judge disbelieved the extra judicial confession spoken to be PW.15 and others, but accepted the evidence of PW.1 and other circumstantial evidence and found that the first respondent had strangulated the deceased and burnt the body to destroy the evidence, and convicted him under Section 302 and 201 I.P.C. However, the Sessions Judge acquitted the other respondents giving them benefit of doubt. On Appeal, the High Court acquitted the first respondent and confirmed the acquittal of the other respondents.
 Aggrieved, the brother of the deceased, the complainant, and the State filed appeals by special leave, before this Court.
 It was contended on behalf of the respondents that since palms were not clenched and the eyes did not protrude but were half closed , the mouth was closed and tongue was not protruding and the duration of death was of 5 to 10 minutes, as opined by the doctor, it was not a case of strangulation, but suicide, that the respondents had no motive, and in fact, the High 486 Court had found that the evidence was not sufficient to establish motive, and the case was based on circumstantial evidence and, therefore, motive being absent, the prosecution had failed to establish this important link in the chain of circumstances to connect the accused, and that the evidence of DW.4., and the statement of first respondent under Section 313 Cr.P.C. clearly established that the respondent was not at home when the occurrence had taken place.
 Allowing the appeals, partly, this Court, 
 HELD : 1.1 In a case founded on circumstantial evidence the prosecution must prove all the circumstances connecting unbroken chain of links leading to only one inference that the accused committed the crime. If any other reasonable hypothesis of the innocence of the accused can be inferred from the proved circumstances, the accused would be entitled to the benefit. What is required is not the quantitative but qualitative, reliable and probable circumstances to complete the chain connecting the accused with the crime. If the conduct of the accused in relation to the crime comes into question the previous and subsequent conduct are also relevant facts. Therefore, the absence of ordinary course of conduct of the accused and human probabilities of the case also would be relevant. The court must weight the evidence of the cumulative effect of the circumstances and if it reaches the conclusion that the accused committed the crime, the charge must be held proved and the conviction and sentence would follow.
 [491F-H, 492A] 
 1.2 Undoubtedly, in cases of circumstantial evidences motive bears important significance. Motive always locks up in the mind of the accused and some time it is difficult to unlock. People do not act wholly without motive. The failure to discover the motive of an offence does not signify its non-existence. The failure to prove motive is not fatal as a matter of law. Proof of motive is never indispensable for conviction. When facts are clear it is immaterial that motive has been proved. Therefore, absence of proof of motive does not break the link in the chain of circumstances connecting the accused with the crime, nor militates against the prosecution case. [498H, 499A] 
 1.3 In the instant case, it is clearly established that the deceased aged about 22 years, was exterminated hardly one year and five months after the marriage. As per doctor's evidence, she died of asphyxia, as a 487 result of strangulation, and that 95% post-mortem burn injuries were found over the dead body except the feet. He positively ruled out the theory of alternatives or suicide.
 [491E-E] 
 1.4 A study of medical jurisprudence establishes that the symptoms found at post-mortem are not uniform but variable depending on the compression employed on the neck and duration. It would be an inferential fact since direct evidence would rarely be available. [497G-H] Taylor's Principles and Practice of Medical Jurisdrudence, Thirteenth Edition 1984 by Keith Mant, Vol.

 1.5 In the instant case, all the symptoms found on the dead body of the deceased unmistakably show that her death was due to pressure on the neck and the findings at the post-mortem examination recorded by the doctor and his evidence are consistent with medical jurisprudence. The duration of death also depends on the mode of pressure employed and the circumstances in which constriction was done. Doctor's evidence is clear, cogent and convincing in his findings that the death was due to asphyxia and not due to suicide. The doctor had meticulously done an expert and excellent autopsy with grasp of medical jurisprudence to establish, without any shadow of doubt, of the cause of death of the deceased as asphyxia. [498D-E] 
 1.6 The evidence of PW.1, the doctor, is truthful, reliable and acceptable. From his evidence it is now conclusively established that the death was due to constriction (asphyxia) and that a deliberate attempt was made to destroy the evidence of death by pouring kerosene on the dead body and burning the dead body extensively of 95%.
 The High Court committed palapable illegality in accepting the defence version to doubt the evidence of the doctor.
 The death was, therefore, homicide and not suicide. [498E] 
 1.7 The evidence of DW.4, maternal uncle of the first respondent, that the first respondent, his brother and father were in the shop at the relevant time has to be considered in the light of the attending circumstances and the conduct of the first respondent. It is established from the 488 eivdence that the deceased and the first respondent alone were living in the upstair's room. The occurrence took place in the broad day time in their bed room. Admittedly, the day of occurrence is a Sunday and that too in the afternoon. Therefore, the shops must have been closed.
 DW.2, Post Office Superintendent, examined by the defence, categorically admitted that the handwriting of all the four telegrams was of the same person. The first respondent admitted that he issued two telegrams including the one to PW.15 and the two were issued by this father. Therefore, four telegrams were issued by the first respondent alone.
 When the wife was practically charred to death, and innocent, and compassionate husband would be in a state of shock and would not move from the bed-side of the deceased wife and others would attend to inform the relations. It is also his case that he phoned to the police station and informed of the occurrence. Evidence is other way about.
 An attempt was made to have the matter compromised, but failed. Thereafter they were found to be absconding. The evidence of DW.4 that the first respondent was in the shop thus gets falsified and his is a purgered evidence. This false plea is a relevant circumstance which militates against his innocence. The death took place on the bed room of the spouse and the attempt to destroy the evidence of murder by burning the dead body; the unnatural conduct of the first respondent immediatley after the occurrence, the false pleas of suicide and absence from house are telling material relevant circumstances which would complete the chain of circumstantial evidence leading to only one conclusion that first respondent alone committed the ghastly offence of murder of his wife, the deceased. Though the torn pieces of the letter would indicate that she contemplated to commit suicide, obviously it was due to being unable to bear with the mental torture brought upon her. She accordingly must have written, but later changed her mind seeing the tender son in her arms and not to make him to lose mother's care and affection. That would clearly show that she was not being treated well. Far from being helpful, this circumstances also is in favour of the prosecution and against the husband showing that the deceased was subjected to cruelty. No credence can be given to the plea that the first respondent was not the author of the crime and the plea that no neighbour was examined by the investigation officer as they were not prepared to give their statements. Therefore, the investigating officer was helpless in collecting the evidence from the neighbours. It is not an insurance that he was innocent. The delay in filing F.I.R. cannot be considered fatal to the prosecution.
 Admittedly, PW.15 was residing in another place. On receipt of the telegram he rushed to the place and immediately on seeing the dead body 489 he sent for his relations. After they come to the scene, the F.I.R. was lodged on the next day. The delay in lodging F.I.R. is of little significance. [499B-H, 500A-G] 
 1.8 The High Court did not consider the evidence in proper perspective. The order of acquittal of the first respondent is set aside and his conviction and the sentences awarded by the Sessions Judge restored.
 [501B] 
 1.9 The evidence of PWs. 15 and 9, regarding the motive was found to be shaky by the High Court and for the reasoning given, it might appear to be probable. In those circumstances the animation by the in-laws and brother-in- law to be a privy to the ghastly murder cannot be positively concluded. Undoubtedly, the parents and brother might be present. They or someone amongst them might have facilitated the first respondent to screen the evidence of murder. Suspicion is not a substitute for proof. No proof beyond doubt is forthcoming. Under these circumstances on the facts of this case their acquittal is right. [500H, 501A-B]
