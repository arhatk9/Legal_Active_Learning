 The claim for relief under s. 49D of the Income Tax Act 1922 made by the respondent-assessee Company in its return for the assessment year 1960-61, the relevant previous year being the calendar year 1959, in respect of the net dividend income of Rs. 15,266/- after deduction of British income-tax of Rs. 9,881/- was rejected by the Income-tax Officer without making the reasons for his decision explicit.
 In appeal by the assessee, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner confirmed the decision of the Income-tax Officer observing that even if it be held that the net dividend income suffered U.K. tax by deduction, there is nothing to show that the tax deducted was paid to U.K.
 Revenue and therefore s. 49D is not attracted. In further appeal by the assessee the Tribunal accepted the contention of the assessee and at the instance of the Revenue referred the question to the High Court. The High Court after an exhaustive examination of the relevant provisions of the Income-tax Act of U.K. and the decisions bearing on the question confirmed the decision of the Tribunal.
 Dismissing the appeal by certificate, the Court 
HELD : 1. All the requirements of s. 49D of the Income-tax 1922 read with Explanation have been satisfactorily established by the assessee and therefore the High Court rightly answered the question in the affirmative in favour of the assessee. [854 F] 2.To be eligible for relief under s. 49D read with its Explanation, the assessee must establish excluding the non- disputed requirement that (i) the assessee has income which has accrued or arisen without taxable territory; and (ii) the assessee has paid in any country income-tax by deduction or otherwise under the law in force in that country; (iii) in that event the assessee would be entitled to the deduction from Indian income tax payable by him; (iv) a sum calculated on such doubly taxed income at the Indian rate of tax or the rate of tax of the said country, whichever is lower. The expression rate of tax of the said country' must be given the meaning as set out in para (iii) of the explanation and in doing so the importance of the words 'income assessed in the said country' has to be borne in mind. [847 F-H] 3.Under U.K. law, the company has to pay tax on its profits or gains as its liability and not as agent of members to whom dividend is distributed out of profits.
 Therefore, if dividend is distributed after profit or gain of the company is charged to tax, it is optional with the company either to deduct or not to deduct income tax paid by it from the dividend paid to members and if it chooses to exercise the option it can do so at standard rate. There is no specific provision under U.K. Income-tax Act which would show that dividend income in U.K. in the hands of the assessee is exempt from payment of income tax. The company is liable to pay income-tax on its profits and gains and s.
 184 enables the company to deduct from the dividend paid out of profits, tax at the standard rate for the year in which the amount payable becomes due. Dividends which represent the distribution of a taxed Fund are, therefore styled as franked income so far as concerns any further taxation at the standard rate, i.e. the rate at which deduction has been made. The assumption underlying this position is that the dividend represents the residue of the total income which has already been 845 taxed in the hands of the company, the fiction being that if tax was not paid by the company there would have been a higher dividend and, therefore, the dividend income is already taxed. The company is treated as a large partnership and though this system is highly artificial but it is a domestic expedient limited in its operation to U.K.
 [849 F-G, 850 B-D, 851 E] According to the statute law of U.K. and the interpretation put on it by the highest court in that country, the dividends which have borne tax in the hands of the paying company were treated as franked income in the hands of the assessee. In other words it would mean that the income is the income in the form of dividends has been subjected to tax. It is immaterial whether they are taxed in the hands of the assessee or not but they are deemed to have been taxed in the hands of the assessee in U.K. Dividends which are styled as franked income have borne tax at the source.
 [852 C-D, F] If the dividends styled as franked income have been charged to income-tax at the source, it would mean that it is the income in respect of which income tax has been paid by deduction or otherwise in accordance with the law in force in the country in which the income accrued. If it is now charged to tax under the Indian Income-tax Act it obviously becomes a doubly taxed income and one of the requirements of s. 49D would be satisfied. [852 F-G] Bradbury v.

 4.Undoubtedly to be entitled to relief under s. 49D the requirements for eligibility therein prescribed must be satisfied by the assessee. one such requirement is that income in respect of which relief from double taxation is sought, is the income in respect of which he has paid income-tax by deduction or otherwise under the law in force in the country in which the income accrued. [853 A] While examining the question whether the assessee has fulfilled this requirement, it will have to be ascertained what is the law bearing on income-tax in the country in which income has arisen and whether according to that law, the said income has suffered tax by deduction or otherwise again according to the law in that country. According to the income-tax law in U.K. dividends represent the distribution of a taxed fund and are therefore styled as franked income. The payment of tax by the company and deduction made at standard rate from dividend distributed to shareholder operates in relief of the shareholders. Such dividend income according to the law of the country where it has arisen is deemed to have been subjected to tax. Viewed from this angle the dividend income in the hands of shareholder is not charged to income-tax.[853 B-C] Inland Revenue Commissioner v. Blott, [1921] A.C. 171 @ 201;
 quoted with approval.
 5.Once it is accepted that the dividend represents franked income distributed out of profits and gains and not liable to further income-tax in the hands of member, it clearly transpires that for relief against double taxation it is the income which has been subjected to tax in the foreign country in which it has arisen and irrespective of the fact that there is no provision comparable to s. 18(5) of our Act in the Income-tax Act of U.K. yet the payment of tax by the company operates in relief of the shareholder and on that account alone the dividend income is not chargeable to tax in U.K. Therefore, it can be said with reasonable certainty that in respect of the dividend income of the assessee income-tax has been paid by deduction or otherwise under the law in force in the country in which income has arisen. The principle of agency in payment by the company is worked out on the basis of company being treated as a large partnership so that the payment of tax by the company would operate to discharge the quasi-partners.

 [1976] 104 ITR 233 over-ruled, 846 6.The expression 'income assessed in the foreign country would clearly, in the context in which it is used, mean subjected to tax in the foreign country. In order to ascertain whether the rate under the Indian Income-tax Act or the rate of tax in the foreign country is lower, apart from any other consideration, the rate. of tax in U.K. in the context of dividend income is easily ascertainable inasmuch as company can deduct income-tax at standard rate only. Undoubtedly, where the assessee was also liable to pay surtax in U.K. on the dividend income no complication would arise in working out the rate because surtax is payable on dividend income. But in the present case that difficulty does not arise as the assessee being a company, it was neither liable to any surtax nor entitled to any relief in U.K., and, therefore, the rate of tax can be worked out with certainty consistent with the provisions of para (iii) of the Explanation. The assessee thus, in respect of the dividend income has paid tax at the standard rate and that is the rate of tax of the foreign country for the purpose of para (iii) of the Explanation.
