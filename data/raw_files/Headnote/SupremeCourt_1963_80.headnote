 Mrs. Mary Magdelene Coelho executed on July 25, 1907, a will, cl. 3 (c) of which provided that "all kinds of movable properties that shall be in my possession and authority at the time of my death, i. e., all kinds of movable properties inclusive of the amounts that shall be got from others and the cash ; all these my eldest daughter Severina Sobina Coelho, shall, after my death, enjoy and after her life- time, her male children shall enjoy permanently and with absolute right." Mrs. Coelho died in February, 1946, and in September, 1946, a suit was filed for partition and separate possession by the widow and daughter of Denis-one of the sons of Severina.
 The contention of plaintiffs was that Severina acquired under the terms of cl. 3 (c) only a life-interest in the property and the remainder in absolute was conferred upon her male issues. The defendants maintained that cl. 3 (c) conferred on Severina an absolute interest in the property as a result of which the entire interest in the property and not merely her life interest passed under the Court auction and consequently the claim for partition must fail. The contention of the defendants was accepted by the trial court and the District judge. However, the High Court held that Severina obtained only a life interest in the property covered by cl. 3 (c).
 The appellants came to this Court by special leave. The only point Urged before this Court was that under cl. 3 (c), Severina got an absolute interest in the property and not merely a life interest.
 Held that the only reasonable construction of cl. 3 (c) was that the interest created in favour of Severina was merely a life interest and the remainder in absolute was conferred 723 on her male, children. The use of the words "after her lifetime" was intended to show that the interest referred to was a life interest.
 One of the cardinal principles of. construction of wills is that, to the extent that it is legally possible, effect should be given to every disposition contained in the will unless the law prevents effect being given to it. Moreover, each will has to be construed on its own terms and in the setting in which the clauses occur.
