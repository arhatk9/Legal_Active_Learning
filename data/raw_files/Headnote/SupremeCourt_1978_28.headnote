 There were six estates of Tribal Chiefs called Mehwassi Estates, in West Khandesh district. The Bombay Land Revenue Code, 1879 was made applicable to the Mehwassi Estates by s.
 3 of the West Khandesh Mehwassi Estates Regulation, 1949, and Section 4 of this Regulation also made applicable all other Acts passed by the Central or the State Legislatures which were in force in other parts of West Khandesh District. This included, inter alia, the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948, which was amended from time to time. Respondent No. 1 the owner of one such Estate, namely, Kathi Estate became an occupant of the agricultural lands forming part of the Estates as a result of the application of the Bombay Land Revenue Code and the persons who were cultivating these lands under him became his tenants, and their relationship was governed by the Tenancy Act, 1948. By virtue of ss. 32 to 32R of the Tenancy Act as amended by Bombay Act 13 of 1956 and the order dated 31st March 1957, the tenants of the 1st respondent became the "deemed purchasers" of the lands held by them on 1st April, 1957 and the 1st respondent ceased to be the owner and became entitled to receive from his permanent tenants a purchase price equal to six times the rent of the lands and from his ordinary tenants, a purchase price between twenty to eighty times the assessment. By reason of a later amendment to the Tenancy Act, adding s.88D, with retrospective effect from 1st August, 1956 the old relationship was restored so that the tenants did not become deemed purchasers" of the lands and the first respondent did (not cease to be the owner of such lands. As a result of %the passing of West Khandesh Mehwassi Estate (Proprietary Rights Abolition etc.) Regulation 1961 and a Notification of the Governor of Bombay dt. 24th February, 1962, conferring occupancy rights of inferior holders on the tenants and abolishing the proprietary rights of the holder of the Mehwassi Estates, the tenants of the 1st respondent became the occupants of the land held by them and the 1st respondent was deprived of all his rights, and he ceased to be entitled to receive anything from his inferior holders, the purchase price receivable by him from his permanent tenants was reduced from six times the rent to three times the assessment and from his other tenants, he became entitled to receive only purchase price at six times the assessment instead of twenty to eighty times the assessment.
 The 1st respondent challenged the constitutional validity of these legislative measures and the High Court struck them down on the ground that they violated the fundamental-right of the 1st respondent under Art. 19(1)(f) and they were not protected by Art. 31A of-the Constitution. During the pendency of the said appeal by certificate, the 1961 Regulation was included in the Ninth Schedule, as Item No.
 155.
 Allowing the appeal by certificate the Court 
HELD: The effect of the inclusion in the Ninth Schedule was that the west Khandesh Mehwassi Estate (Proprietary Rights Abolition etc.) Regula- 857 tion, 1961 was immunised from challenge on the ground that it was inconsistent with or took away or abridged any of the- rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution and hence its constitutional validity could no longer be assailed on the ground that it violated Art. 19(1)(f).
 Article 31B and the Ninth Schedule, cured the defect, if any, in the West Khandesh Mehwassi Estate (Proprietary Rights Abolition etc.) Regulation Act 1961. as regards any unconstitutionality alleged on the ground of infringement of fundamental rights and by the express words of Art. 31B, such curing of the defect took place with retrospective operation from the date on which this regulation was enacted by the Governor. This Regulation, even if inoperative or void at the time when it was issued by the Governor on account of infringement of Art. 19(1)(f) of the Constitution assumed full force, and vigour from the date of its enactment by reason of. inclusion in the Ninth Schedule [859 A-H] Jagannath v. Authorised Officer, Land Reforms [1972] 1 SCR 1056 at 1070 referred to.
 [The Court directed the Central Government to sympathetically consider. if lands forming part of his Estate have been included in his assessment of wealth tax and if the income therefrom has been assessed to income-tax, whether any such tax recovered from him for the period from and after the date of coming into force of the Regulation may in all fairness be refunded to him]
