 The prosecution case was that the deceased, a discharged military officer managed to have complete hold of the properties of his father and excluded his six brothers and four sisters from enjoyment of the properties. The appellant, the youngest brother of the deceased, resented his conduct. Later on there was reconciliation between the appellant and the deceased. As the appellant nursing grivance against the deceased for his obstinance to exclude him of right of residence in their family property, on 5.8.1988 he came to their family house and bolting the door inside, killed the deceased inflicting on the body of the deceased 17 incised injuries and one stab injury.
 The appellant was charged under section 302, I.PC. Before the trial Court, the prosecution, relying on the circumstances, namely, (1) motive of the accused, (2) preparation, (3) presence of accused in the neighbourhood and in the locality immediately before the occurrence, (4) presence of the accused in the house on the date of occurrence, (5) his presence immediately after the occurrence, (6) recoveries pursuant to accused's statement under section 27, and (7) injury found on the ringer of the accused, claimed to have 391 established that the appllant committed the offence of murder.
 The trial Court found the appellant guilty and convicted him under section 302, IPC and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life for causing the death of his brother.
 High Court confirmed the conviction on appeal. Hence this appeal by special leave.
 Allowing the appeal, this Court, 
HELD:1.1. Normally when the Trial Court and the High Court concurrently found that the accused has committed the crime, this Court would refrain to appreciate the evidence. On going through the judgments of the Sessions Court and the High Court this Court entertained doubt regarding the conclusiveness of the appellants' complicence. Therefore, this Court directed the appellant to produce the evidence.
 Accordingly the typed evidence has been placed on record.
 From the evidence this Court is satisfied that the Courts below did not subject the evidence to critical analysis on the touchstone of human conduct and probabilities and overlooked material admissions and obvious unfair trial and incurable irregularities leading to grave prejudice to the appellant and miscarriage of justice. (395-A-B) 1.2.From the evidence it is clear that prosecution brought on record the circumstantial evidence from obliging witnesses to the police. Appellant was said to have been seen before or after the occurrence by several tea shop owners and the labourers in the tea stall etc. To corroborate the evidence of tea stall owners, labourers were examined that they had seen the appellant with blood stained clothes and same were recovered pursuant to the statement under s. 27 of Evidence Act. It is preposterous to place absolute reliance on such suspect evidence. It is curious that the appellant claimed to have gone to each tea stall for tea just to enable them to note his movements. The normal human conduct would be to avoid any-body noticing him either before or after committing the offence. It is highly unbelievable that he had used two types of-weapons one stabbing and another cutting weapon. (398-E-F) 1.3.The criminal trial was unfair to the appellant and the procedure adopted in the trial is obviously illegal and unconstitutional. The Sessions Court in fairness recorded the evidence in the form of questions put by the prosecutor and defence counsel and answers given by each witness. As seen the material part of the prosecution case to connect the appellant with the crime is from the aforestated witnesses. The Sessions Court permitted even 392 without objection by the defence to put leading questions in the chief examination itself suggesting all the answers which the prosecutor intended to get from the witnesses to connect the appellant with the crime. (398-G-H) 1.4. Leading question to be one which indicates to the witnesses the real or supposed fact which the prosecutor (plaintiff) expects and desires to have confirmed by the answer. Leading question may be used to prepare him to give the answers to the questions about to be put to him for the purpose of identification or to lead him to the main evidence or fact in dispute. The attention of the witness cannot be directed in chief examination to the subject of the enquiry/trial. The court may permit leading question to draw the attention of the witness which cannot otherwise be called to the matter under enquiry, trial or investigation.
 The discretion of the court must only be controlled towards that end but a question which suggest to the witness, the answer the prosecutor expects must not be allowed unless the witness, with the permission of the court, is declared hostile and cross-examination is directed thereafter in that behalf. therefore, as soon as the witness has been conducted to the material portion of his examination, it is generally the duty of the prosecutor to ask the witness to state the facts or to give his own account of the matter making him to speak as to what he had seen. The prosecutor will not be allowed to frame his questions in such a manner that the witness by answering merely "yes" or "no" will give the evidence which the prosecutor wishes to elicit. The witness must account for what he himself had seen. (399F-H, 400-A) 1.5.Sections 145 and 154 of the Evidence Actare intended to provide for cases to contradict the previous statement of the witnesses called by the prosecution. Sections 143 and 154 provide the right to cross-examination of the witnesses by the adverse party even by leading questions to contradict answers given by the witnesses or to test the veracity or to drag the truth of the statement made by him. Therein the adverse party is entitled to put leading questions but section 142 does not give such power to the prosecutor to put leading questions on the material part of the evidence which the witnesses intends to speak against the accused and the prosecutor shall not be allowed to frame questions in such a manner which the witness by answering merely "yes" or "no", but he shall be directed to give evidence which he witnessed. The question shall not be put to enable the witness to give evidence which the prosecutor wishes to elicit from the witness nor the prosecutor shall put into witness's mouth the words which he hoped that the witness will utter nor in any other way suggest to him the answer which it is desired that the witness would give. The counsel must leave the witness to tell unvarnished tale 393 of his own account (400-B-C) 1-6. Leading questions were put to the witnesses to elicit on material part of the prosecution case in the Chief examination itself without treating any of the witness hostile. It shows the fact that the prosecutor led the witnesses what he intended that they should say the material part of the prosecution case to prove against the appellant which is illegal and obviously unfair to the appellant offending his right to fair trial enshrined under Art.21 of the Constitution. It is not a curable irregularity. (400-D) 1.7. Suspicion is not the substitute for proof. There is a long distance between 'may he true' and 'must be true' and the prosecution has to travel all the way to prove its case beyond all reasonable doubt. (400-E) 1.8. The prosecution not only not proved its case but palpably produced false evidence and the prosecution has miserably faded to prove its case against the appellant let alone beyond all reasonable doubt that appellant and he alone committed the offence. (400-F)
