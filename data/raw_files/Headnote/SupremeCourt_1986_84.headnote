 Sub-section (1) of s. 5 of the Bombay Animal Preservation Act, 1954 prohibits slaughter of animals except on a certificate in writing issued by the competent authority that the animal is fit for slaughter. Sub-section (1A) of s.5, substituted by Gujarat Act No. 23 of 1979, prohibits grant of such a certificate in respect of (a) a cow, (b) the calf of a cow, whether male or female, (c) a bull below the age of sixteen years, and (d) a bullock below the age of sixteen years. It was brought into force retrospectively with effect from November 28, 1978. Sub- section (2) of s. 5 prohibits issue of certificate in respect of animals, to which sub-s. (1A) does not apply, if in the opinion of the competent authority (a) the animal is useful or likely to become useful for the purpose of draught or any kind of agricultural operations, (b) the animal, if male, is useful or likely to become useful for the purpose of breeding, and (c) the animal, if female, is useful or likely to become useful for the purpose of giving milk or bearing offspring. Sub-section (3) of s. 5, also substituted by Gujarat Act No. 23 of 1979, exempts from the purview of s. 5 for bonafide religious purposes, the slaughter of (i) animals above the age of fifteen years other than a cow, bull or bullock, (ii) a bull above the age of fifteen years, and (iii) a bullock above the 720 age of fifteen years provided a certificate in writing has been obtained from the competent authority.
 The appellants, who are dealers in beef and other allied trades, assailed the constitutional validity of the ban imposed by cls. (c) and (d) of sub-s. (1A) and sub-s.
 (3) of s. 5 of the Act, on the slaughter of bulls and bullocks, on various grounds, but the High Court repelled all of them.
 In these appeals by certificate, it was contended for the appellants that the ban on the slaughter of bulls and bullocks below the age of sixteen years imposed by cls. (c) and (d) of sub-s. (1A) of s. 5 of the Act puts an unreasonable restriction on their fundamental right under Art. 19(1)(g) of the Constitution to carry on their trade and profession, and that the ban so imposed is violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution as it discriminates between dealers who deal in meat of cows, bulls and bullocks and those who deal in meat of buffaloes and other animals.
 Dismissing the appeals, the Court, ^ 
 HELD : 1. The prescription of the age of sixteen years in cls. (c) and (d) of sub-s. (1A) of s. 5 of the Bombay Animal Preservation Act, 1954 cannot be said to be an unreasonable restriction looking to the balance which has to be struck between public interest, that required useful animals to be preserved and permitting the appellants to carry on their trade and profession as mentioned in Art.
 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. [729 C-D; H] The longevity of cattle and their useful span of life in the State of Gujarat has increased appreciably with the help of the scientific advances which have taken place in recent years, such as better cattle feeding, better medical health and better animal husbandry services. There is no doubt that if the scientific tests were to be applied, bulls and bullocks up to sixteen years of age would be found useful for the purpose of breeding, draught and other agricultural purposes. [729 B-C] 
 2. Clauses (c) and (d) of sub-s. (1A) of s. 5 of the Act are not hit by Art. 14 of the Constitution. It is only if the classification is unreasonable that the impugned provisions can be struck down.[730 C] 721 In the instant case, looking to the different purposes for which buffaloes and their progeny on the one hand and cows and their progeny on the other are used in each State it cannot be said that there is any hostile discrimination against those who deal in meet of bulls and bullocks. The dealers in different types of meat are not in the same class. A clear distinction is maintained on scientific grounds between animals which are useful and which have not yet reached the age of sixteen years so far as bulls and bullocks are concerned. As regards buffaloes, there is no restriction as to the age, the only bar being sub-s. (2) of s. 5, based on their usefulness for purposes of draught, agricultural operations, breeding, giving milk or bearing offsprings. Bulls and bullocks are useful for agricultural purposes but male buffaloes are seldom used for any purpose other than breeding or rearing progeny. [730 E-G] Abdul Hakim Qureshi & Ors. v.
