 A partnership firm carrying on business in Calcutta had also a branch in Kanpur. In 1948, 'A' one of its partners went away to Pakistan. Under the United Provinces Administration of Evacuee Property Ordinance 1949 all evacuee property situated in the United Provinces, vested in the Custodian of Evacuee Property. In September 1949 the Deputy Custodian of Evacuee Property, Kanpur, took possession of the Kanpur property of the firm. The firm raised objections under s. 8 of the aforesaid Ordinance. On October 18, 1949 a Central Ordinance namely the Administration of Evacuee Property Ordinance 1949 came into force; it was succeeded on April 17, 1950, by the Administration of Evacuee Property Act, 1950. Under the provisions of the Central Ordinance as also the Act any property which had vested in the Custodian under the Provincial Ordinance would be deemed to continue being so vested. On May 31, 1950 The Deputy Custodian of Evacuee Property (Judicial) Allahabad Circle, Kanpur, dealing with the aforesaid objections raised by the firm held 'A' to be an evacuee and his share in the firm to be evacuee property.
 No appeal was filed against this order. on December 13, 1952 the Competent Officer, Kanpur -sent separate notices under s. 6 of the Evacuee Interest Separation Act, 1951 to each of the partners of the firm calling upon them to file their claim for the purpose of determining the interest of the evacuee in the partnership business. The firm filed a claim under s. 7 of the Act and raised various objections contending that 'A' was not -a member of the firm. The competent officer rejected all the objections. The firm's appeal to the Appellate Officer failed; whereupon it filed petitions under Art. 226 of the Constitution before the High Court. The petitions were dismissed by a single Judge who took the view that the order of the Competent Officer had merged in that of the Appellate Authority whose office was situated in Delhi beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the High Court. Special appeals before the Division Bench were also dismissed. The firm and its partners appealed to this Court. They also filed a petition under Art. 32. The Court 'had to consider (i) Whether a fresh notice and declaration under s, 7 of the Central Ordinance of 1949 or of tile Cen- tral Act of 1950 was necessary, (ii) Whether any fundamental right of 135 the partners of the firm had been. affected, (ii) Whether the Appellate Authority was subject to the jurisdiction of the High Court of Allahabad.
 
HELD : From the Facts 'it was clear that 'A', in view of disturbed conditions, went away to Pakistan in the year 1948 and therefore he was an 'evacuee' within the meaning of U.P.
 Ordinance 1 of 1949. His property i.e. his interest in the partnership business immediately vested under the Ordinance in the Custodian. This automatic vesting was continued by Central Ordinance 27 of 1949 and Central Act 31 of 1950 by the deeming provisions contained therein. Therefore no question of issuing further notice or making a declaration that the said interest was evacuee property under s. 7(1) of the Ordinance arose. Section 7 only applied to properties other than those which have vested automatically in the Custodian. Such a vesting cannot be reopened under the Cen- tral Ordinance or the Central Act for it has already vested thereunder by a fiction. [142 E-G] (ii) It followed that the partners had no interest in the share of 'A' in the firm which had vested in the Custodian.
 They had also acquiesced in the order of the Deputy Custodian of Evacuee Property (Judicial) (Allahabad) holding 'A"s property to be evacuee property. It was no longer open to them to question that finding. The partners had there- fore no fundamental right in regard to the interest of 'A' in the partnership. L143 B] (iii) The Appellate Authority, though for convenience having its head office in New Delhi, was factually and legally functioning under the State Act within the territorial jurisdiction of the Allahabad High Court. Such an appellate authority is located within the territorial limits of the High Court for the purpose of disposing of the appeals under the Act. [146 B-C] Election Commission, India v.
