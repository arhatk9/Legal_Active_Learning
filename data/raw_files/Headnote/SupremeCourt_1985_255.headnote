 The appellant filed a writ petition in the High Court claiming ownership and title of six boxes containing jewellery and other valuable articles lying in Srinagar Toshakhana. These were kept under lock and seal of the Commissioner appointed by the High Court. The petition was the result of two matters pending before the Government of India: (1) Whether the appellant was the owner of the jewellery or other valuable articles of personal use lying in those boxes on the ground that the properties are heirlooms, and (ii) whether exemption in respect of such items of properties as heirlooms under s.5(1)(xiv) of the Wealth Tax Act in wealth tax assessment proceedings of the appellant as HUF was available to him or not. Pursuant to a request and the suggestion of the Central Board of Direct Taxes to have physical inspection of the items in question by the Members (W.T.&J) alongwith experts to establish whether the properties are heirlooms or not, an application was accordingly moved before the High Court for inspection of the jewellery and other articles. The High Court dismissed the application on the ground that no useful purpose will be served to grant inspection.
 Being aggrieved, the appellant appealed to this Court.
 The appeal was opposed by counsel for the Respondents on the grounds (i) that the appellant's claim of ownership or title to these items has been refuted in the counter-affidavit that had been filed in the main Writ Petition where property has been claimed to be State property; (2) that unless the appellant showed some prima facie title to the property in question, inspection would be premature and uncalled for, and (3) that the writ petition itself was not maintainable in view of Article 363 (1) of the Constitution.
 1070 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: 1(i) The order dated July 20, 1985 is clearly erroneous, and inspection sought ought to have been granted.
 The six boxes containing the jewellery and other valuable articles lying in Srinagar Toshakhana shall be opened for the purpose of inspection by the Member, Central Board of Direct Taxes (WT&J) who will be accompanied by the Director General of Archaelogical Survey of India, Director Antiques, Director National Museum and Approved Valuers of Jewellery for determining whether any and if so what items constitute heirlooms or articles of personal use of the appellant and his family. Such inspection will be taken in the presence of the appellant's representative as also a representative of the State Government but such representatives shall not work on the panel of the Inspection Committee but may render assistance as may be necessary. [1073 E-G] (ii) The relevance and necessity of such inspection in the instant case cannot be disputed. The main issue arising between the parties is whether the jewellery and other valuable articles of personal use contained in the six boxes lying in Srinagar Toshakhana are heirlooms of the appellant and his family as claimed by him or not. Such inspection by experts will unquestionably facilitate its determination.
 [1072 B-C] 
 2. Questions of maintainability of the writ petition and appellant's title to the property in question would undoubtedly be gone into at the final hearing of the writ petition but it cannot be gainsaid that the inspection by experts will be useful for determination of the appellant's title to the property. At this stage no one can proceed on the assumption that the preliminary objection as regards maintainability will necessarily be upheld Moreover, the assessment order for the 3 assessment years, 1978-79, 1979- 80 and 1980-81 though made on protective basis and subject to final valuation of the assets, clearly show that the Wealth Tax Authorities, and the CBDT are treating the estate lying in the Srinagar Toshakhana as property belonging to the appellant's family.
