 Section 123(1)(A)(b) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 defines bribery as 'any gift, offer or promise by a candidate or his agent or by any other person with the consent of a candidate or his election agent of any gratification, to any person, whomsoever. with the object, directly or indirectly of inducing an elector to vote or refrain from, voting at an election'. Respondent No. 1 filed an election petition challenging the election of the appellant that he had committed corrupt practice under s.
 123(1)(A)(b) of the Act. The. High Court declared the election void on the ground that the appellant, by paying a big sum in cash and promising payment of a similar sum by execution of a promissory note, made Respondent No. 3 to retire from the contest and publish a pamphlet that the electors should vote for the appellant and not for himself.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD: 1 (a) It is not possible to sustain the judgment of the High Court holding the appellant guilty of corrupt practices within the meaning of. 123(1)(A)(b) of the Act.
 [790B] (b) Mere payment of any gratification to a third person for securing or procuring some votes in favour of a particular candidate, without the establishment of any nexus between the money and the inducement to the voter, will of be sufficient to prove that the voter is indirectly induced on account of the payment of gratification to the third person.
 The gratification must have some connection or reflection, direct or indirect, in persuading the, voter to vote or refrain from voting atan election. If the inducement to the voter is not caused by the paymentof the gratification to a third person but by the persuasion or influence ofsuch third person it will not be possible to say that the gratification had any indirect inducement to the voter.
 [787F-11] (c) Payment of any gratification to any person to work or canvass at an election is outside the ambit of the definition. [787H] (d) If the inducement to the voter is free from the shade or colour of he gratification paid to the third person it will not be bribery. If, however, he inducement in a given case is Coloured or shaded by the payment of the ,ratification to a third person it would be an indirect inducement to the voter himself within the frame of the definition. In other words it is the fact of payment to the third person that must induce the voter. It is not enough that the third person induces the voter. The frame of any definition more often than not is capable of being made flexible. But the precision and certainty in law requires that it should not be made loose and kept tight as far s possible.

 106 referred 784 in the instant case money was not paid to the respondent as consideration for votes promised or as a bargain for getting votes but it was money paid to him to retire from the contest and to do propaganda and persuade the voters to vote for the appellant. In spite of the propaganda and the appeal of the respondent no. 3 the voters were left free not to respond to his persuation. [790A]
