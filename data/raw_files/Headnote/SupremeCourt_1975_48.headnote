 The appellant was one of the joint owners of the premises in question. In ,,execution of a money decree obtained against the appellant his share in the property was put to sale and was purchased by the father of the first respondent for Rs.
 77,000. The purchaser deposited 25 per cent of the purchase price. The property was put to sale once again and was in fact knocked down for a sum of Rs. 700/- in favour of the father of respondent No. 1. The appellant made an application under Order XXI Rule 71 of C.P.C. for recovering the deficiency in the price realised in the second sale from the purchase. Order XXI Rule 71 C.P.C. reads as under :-- "Any deficiency of price which may happen on a re-sale by reason of the purchaser's default and all expenses attending such re-sale, shall be certified to the Court by the Officer or other person holding the sale, and shall at the instance of either the decree holder or the judgment debtor, be recoverable from the defaulting purchaser under the provisions relating to the execution of a decree for the payment of money." The proclamation of sale for the first sale stated that the premises were free from encumbrances. Proclamation for the second sale, however, states that the entire ground floor excepting two road-side shops, was let out.
 The Learned Single Judge allowed the application of the appellant and directed the purchaser to pay the deficiency with interest. The Division Bench ,of the High Court allowed the appeal and dismissed application filed by the appellant under Order XXI Rule 71 for recovering from the auction purchaser the deficiency in the said price. On appeal by certificate under Article 133(1)(a) & (c) it was contended before this Court by the appellant that he was entitled to recover from the first respondent the deficiency in the price realised in the second sale under Order XXI Rule 71. The respondent contended that the appellant can recover the defficiency in the second sale only if it can be attributed to default of the auction purchaser.
 HELD:
 The application of Order XXI rule 71 is limited to cases in which the deficiency of price has occurred by reason of the auction purchaser's default. Property once put to sale in execution proceedings may have to be resold for reasons which may or may not be connected with the default of the auction purchaser. It is not enough that the resale is occasioned by the default of the auction purchaser. It is further necessary that the resale must result in a defi- ciency of price which deficiency is attributable to the default of the auction purchaser. In the first proclamation of sale there was no mention of the lease. In the second proclamation the lease has been mentioned. In the city of Calcutta where premises are situated, the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1956 was in force at the time of the second sale. Under that Act tenants enjoyed the privileges of standard rent and immunity from eviction. The reference in the second sale proclamation to a lease and to the fact that substantial part of the property was in occupation of the tenant was bound to affect the marketability of the property. Order XXI rule 71 is intended to provide an expeditious remedy to the judgment debtor or the decree holder who has suffered a detriment due to the default of the auction purchaser. [729C; G; 731B-D] 727 (2) The appeal before the Division Bench was not time barred. The time requisite for obtaining Certified copy means time properly required and an appellant cannot in computation of the period of limitation :for filing the appeal ask for exclusion of time which was spent negligently. in the present case settlement of the, draft decree was adjourned from time to time by an officer of the court on being properly satisfied that there was good reason for adjournment. The Auction purchaser cannot be blamed for the time thus spent in settling the draft of the decree under appeal. [734F-G]
