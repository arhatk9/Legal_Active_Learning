 The property involved in the first appeal was a set of rooms used for indoor games by the mill employees, one big hall used as the Gurkha Guards Club, a set of rooms used as Officers' Club and a set of rooms used as residential quarters by workers of the mills. The property involved in the second appeal consisted of 200 quarters which had been allotted to the workers of the factory for their occupation.
 The question was whether these properties were exempted from taxation under s. 4 of the Punjab Urban Immovable Property Tax Act, 1940 115 or not. The assessing Authority held that these properties were liable to taxation. Appeals against the orders of the Authority were rejected by the Deputy Excise and Taxation Commissioner. The respondents moved the High Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution for getting the orders quashed.
 The High Court held in both cases that the petitioners were entitled to exemption prayed for and quashed the orders of assessment. The State of Punjab came to this Courts against the order of the High Court.
 Held, that no tax was leviable under the Punjab Urban Immovable Property Tax Act. 1940, in respect of the buildings in the two appeals and the High Court had rightly quashed the orders of assessment. In the first appeal, the buildings were allotted for the use of workmen and that was a purpose which was necessary for the efficiency of workmen.
 In the second appeal also, the allotment of 200 quarters was necessary for the welfare and efficiency of workmen. Hence it must be held that the buildings were being used for the purposes of a factory. Just as the use of a building for a purpose which maintains the efficiency of the machines is a user for the purpose of a factory, so also is the user of a building for the purpose of providing something which is necessary for maintaining the efficiency of workers. Where a building is used for a purpose which the Factory Law requires must be fulfilled in order that the factory may function, that user is also for the purpose of a factory.
 Held, also, that the word "rent" in cl. (ii) of r. 18 (4) of the Punjab Urban Immovable Tax Rules, 1941, means payment to a landlord by a tenant for the demised property and does not include payments made by licensees.
