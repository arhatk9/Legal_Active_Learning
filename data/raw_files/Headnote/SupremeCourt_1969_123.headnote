 The appellants passed the pre-medical examination of the Delhi University in April, 1968 and obtained over 62% marks, They applied for admission to the first year M.B.B.S. Course at the Maulana Azad Medical College which is a constituent of the University of Delhi and was established by the Government of India in 1958. The college prospectus contained certain rules relating to the admission of students which made reservations of places in the college in favour of various categories of students and provided for nominations to be made by the Central Government to fill some of the reserved places. The appellants' applications for admission to the college were rejected. Thereafter they filed a writ petition challenging primarily the power of the Central Government to make the nominations and contended that nine students nominated by the Government had obtained lower marks in the pre-medical examination so that if they were to be excluded, the appellants would be entitled to be admitted in the college. The High Court dismissed the petition.
 It ",as contended on behalf of the appellants that the provisions in the rules for reservation of seats were not based on any reasonable classification and were therefore violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution: further more, they also violated clauses (1) and (4) of Art. 15 as well as clause (2) of Art, 29. It was further contended that the nominations to the reserved seats were also contrary to the rules.
 
HELD : dismissing the appeal (i) The first group of persons for whom seats were reserved were the sons and daughters of residents of Union territories other than Delhi. These areas are well known to be comparatively backward and with the exception of Himachal Pradesh they do not have any Medical College of their own.
 It was necessary that persons desirous of receiving medical education from these areas should be provided some facility for doing so. As regards the sons and daughters of Central Government servants posted in Indian Missions abroad, it is equally well known that due to exigencies of service these persons are faced with difficulties in the matter of education. Apart from the problems of language, it is not easy or always possible to get admission into institutions imparting medical education in foreign countries. The reservations for the cultural, Colombo Plan and Thailand scholars were made by reason of reciprocal arrangements of educational and cultural nature. The reservations in favour of Jammu and Kashmir scholars were also justifiable as there were inadequate arrangements for medical education in the State itself. The classification in all these cases was based on intelligible differentia which distinguished them from the group to which the appellants belonged. [418C-F] 414 The object of the classification by the Central Government who maintained and ran the institution was to select the best available students from sources as classified in the rules and the classification therefore had a rational nexus with the object to be achieved.

 There was no discrimination against the appellants on grounds only of religion, race, caste, language, sex or place of birth and therefore there was no violation of Art.
 15 or Art. 29.
 (ii) The appellants did not have any right to challenge the nominations made by the Central Government. They did not compete for the reserved seats and had no locus standi in the matter of nomination of two such seats. The contention that if nominations to reserved seats were not in accordance with the rules, such seats must be regarded as not having been properly filled and must be thrown open to the general pool, was wholly unfounded. The Central Government was under no obligation to release those seats to the general pool. Although in the larger interest of giving maximum benefit to candidates belonging to the non-reserved seats, the Central Government could and did release some seats, if could not be compelled to do so at the instance of students who had applied for admission from out of the categories' for whom seats had not been reserved.
