 The first appellant accompanied by his wife, the second appellant, visited foreign countries on business. He was allowed foreign exchange amounting to 337 and 1410 U. S.
 dollars, the visit being limited to two months. The second appellant 'was not allowed any foreign exchange and was allowed to go on the representation that a foreign company will bear all her expenses for the trip. When after three months the appellants returned to Delhi, the Customs authorities found on the person of the first appellant travelers cheques of the value of 2590 U.S. dollars. The Director of Enforcement took the appellant's explanation and on adjudication found that the appellants had received a sum of 3500 U. S. dollars as gift, were owners of it and contravened s. 9 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947, read with Notification dated March 25, 1947, issued 515 thereunder, for failing the offer the foreign exchange for sale as required thereunder within a month of their becoming owners thereof. He, therefore, forfeited the travellers cheques to the extent of 1990 U. S. dollars found with them and imposed a penalty of Rs. 18000 on the first appellant under s. 23 of the Act. The appellants appealed to the Appellate Board which confirmed the order of the Director.
 Held, that s. 9 of the Foreign Regulation Act applied not merely to foreign exchange owned or held at the date the Act came into force but also to foreign exchange acquired after that date. The words "or who may hereafter become the owner of any foreign exchange" in the Notification, therefore, were not ultra vires the section. It must be held that those words were implied in the section and the main purpose of the Notification was to specify what kind of foreign exchange was to be offered for sale thereunder.
 The Notification was clear that the offer of sale was to be made within a month of acquisition of ownership of the foreign exchange and not within a month of arrival in India.
