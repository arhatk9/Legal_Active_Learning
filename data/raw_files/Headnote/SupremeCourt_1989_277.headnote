 Proceedings for acquisition of the land belonging to the petitioner were initiated under the Kerala Land Acquisition Act, 1961 viz. a State law. A writ petition filed by the petitioner challenging the acquisition was dismissed by the High Court. Thereafter the Central Act I of 1894 viz. Land Acquisition Act, 1894, as amended by Act 68 of 1984, became applicable to the State of Kerala. Consequently the Kerala Act ceased to be in force. Without issuing a fresh notifica- tion under the Central Act, the Land Acquisition Officer issued notice for making the award.
 The petitioner filed another petition in the High Court for quashing the said notice and the continuance of the proceedings on the ground that in the absence of fresh procedural steps envisaged by the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 the award could not be made. This petition was also dis- missed by the High Court.
 In this appeal on the question: whether in the absence of a specific provision in the Central Act 68 of 1984, the acquisition proceedings taken under the Kerala Land Acquisi- tion Act of 1961, could be continued under the Land Acquisi- tion Act of 1894.
 Dismissing the appeal, the Court, 
 HELD: The provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 as amended by the Amending Act 68 of 1984. were substantial- ly different from the provisions in the Kerala Land Acquisi- tion Act 1961. In view of the fact that the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 became applicable to the 207 State of Kerala and in view of the repugnant provisions, in terms of Article 254 of the Constitution the Kerala Act stood repealed. There is no provision made in the Amending act to indicate repeal of the State law but application of Article 254 is automatic to situations where it is applica- ble and by the operation of this Article the State Act stood repealed and the Central Act became applicable. [208F-G] Steps taken under the Kerala Land Acquisition Act, upto declaration under section 6 which had been upheld by High Court were valid steps and there was no effacing thereof on account of the deemed repeal of the State Act by the Amend- ing Act of 1984. It was, therefore, open to the Land Acqui- sition Officer to continue the pending proceeding from the stage where it was at the time of coming into force of the Central Act.
