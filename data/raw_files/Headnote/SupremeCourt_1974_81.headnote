 The respondent had imported sewing machine needles under a licence. Claiming that the import licence did not 'cover the needles for domestic sewing machines the Customs Authorities imposed a penalty and confiscated the goods.
 The respondent claimed that the needles imported could be used in both domestic and industrial sewing machines or were interchangeable and that the prohibition was not meant for such interchangeable needles which could be used for "domestic" as well as "industrial" sewing machines but was confined to needles capable of being used only for domestic sewing machines. A single Judge of the High Court get aside the penalty but confirmed the order of confiscation. On appeal the Division Bench, without going into the other question raised by the respondent, held that there was no prohibition or restriction during the relevant period for the import of domestic sewing machine needles. It therefore quashed the confiscation order.
 Allowing the appeal and remitting the case to the High Court, 
HELD : There was the required prohibition against import without licence of needles specified. Sec. 3 of the imports
