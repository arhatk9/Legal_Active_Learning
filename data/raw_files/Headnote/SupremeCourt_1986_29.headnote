 The petitioner applied for allotment of "Maruti Car 800" and due to an error of the computer his name was not included for the allotment of "Maruti 800" but for "Maruti Truck". When the petitioer pointed out the discrepency the error was accepted by the respondents who however, agreed to consider the case of the petitioner for allotment out of the manufacturers' discretionary quota of 5%. Accordingly, the petitioner was alloted Serial No.8 under the discretionary quota. In the course of certain correspondence that ensued between the petitioner and the respondent, the respondents indicated the usual guidelines adopted in the allotment of the car out of the manufacturers' discretionary quota to defence forces, judiciary, Constitutional heads, MPs etc.
 The petitioner has challenged such a classification as arbitrary and violative of the provisions of the Article 14 of the Constitution.
 Disposing of the petitions, ^ 
 HELD : The interest of justice would be met, if the allotment of Maruti vehicles out of manufacturers' discretionary quota is made in favour of the named categories specified in the order and subject to strict observance of the conditions indicated therein. [586 E-F] 586 (The Court ordered that the guidelines would be in force for a period of three years and will be subject to review later taking into consideration the prevailing circumstances which may exist at that point of time.
 Applying non-liquet for the present, the Court left open the several contentions raised in the petitions.)
