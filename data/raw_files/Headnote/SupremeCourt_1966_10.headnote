 The suit lands were granted as inam for the Performance of puja in a Devasthanam. As they had been alienated, Revenue Divisional Officer, acting under s. 44B of the Madras Hindu Religious Endowments Act- 1926, resumed and regranted them to the Devasthanam that the inam consisted of both melwaram and kudiwaram. The appellant Mission, which was in possession of the lands as alienee, filed suits for a declaration that the inam consisted only of the Melwaram, that the grant was a personal inam not liable to resumption under s. 44B and that the section itself was ultra vires the Provincial Legislature. The trial Court hold that the inam consisted of both warm=, but that it was a personal inam outside the purview of s. 42B, and therefore decided in favour of the Mission. On appeal the High Court reversed both the findings and held that the section was intra vires.
 In appeals, to this Court by the Mission and the Devasthanam, 
HELD : (i) A concatenation of the several powers of the Provincial Legislature under the Government of India Act, 1915, furnished adequate scope for comprehensive legislation on the subject of inams connected with religious and charitable endowments. Even if there was any doubt, the Governor-General in Council must have decided the question as per r. 4 of the Devolution Rules under the Government of India Act, 1915, and put an end to any controversy on the matter. The section and the amendment to it in 1946 would be sustained by s. 292 of the Government of India Act, 1935, and the power of the Provincial Legislature thereunder.
 Section 44B was thus fully within the competence of the Provincial legislature and the same would be true of the corresponding section, s. 35 of the Madras Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1951, vis-a-vis the Contitution, [297 C-E, H] (ii)The lnam Fair Register incorporated an official declaration which was theresult of detailed inquiries.
 All evidence collected in of eachinam was carefully sifted and considered before any conclusion was reached or declared. In the absence of positive and proper evidence to the contrary, such declaration must possess supreme importance. The High Court reached, on the admissible evidence, the right conclusion that the melwaram alone was the subject of the inam and that the inam was always considered as remuneration for archaka service of the Devas- thanam. The finding of the trial Court that it was a personal inam Was erroneous. [290 B; 294 D-E; 295 E, F] 284 Arunachalam Chetty and other v. Venkatachalapathi, L.R. 56 I.A. 204, applied.
 (iii) 32 & 33 Vict. c. 29 only validated the title deeds granted by the Inam Commission. It did not create any contract, and therefore like any other grant which is resumable on breach of its conditions, this inam was resumable according to its terms and conditions. On alienation, it was liable to resumption under s. 44B; and as the resumption by the Government was of the melwarum only, and since there is no period of limitation prescribed by any law, no question of adverse possession by the Mission would arise.

 (iv)By the resumption and regrant what was done was only to restore the Devasthanam what it had lost. therefore, it was not a case of putting a denonminational religious institution at an advantage. [297 F-G]
