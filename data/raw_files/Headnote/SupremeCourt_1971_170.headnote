 The assessee company was incorporated under the erstwhile Gwalior Companies Act which did not make any distinction between public and private companies. 'The affairs of the company were not controlled by less than six persons but shares carrying more than 50% of the total voting power were during the relevant previous year held by less than 6 persons. After the company's assessment for the assessment year 1955-56 had been completed the Income-tax Officer levied additional super-tax on the company under s. 23A of the Income-tax Act, 1922 holding that it was not a company in which the public were substantially interested within the meaning of sub-cl. (b) (iii) of the Explanation to cl. (9) of s. 23A. Under the Explanation a company is treated to be one in which the public are substantially interested if it is not a private company under the Indian Companies Act and the affairs of the company or the shares carrying more than 50% 3f the total voting power are at no time during the previous year controlled or held by less than six persons.
 The authorities under the Act as well as the High Court, in reference, held against the assessee. In appeal by special leave to this Court the assessee contended that the word 'or' in sub-cl. (b) (iii) aforesaid had been used disjunctively and therefore if either of the conditions mentioned therein did not exist the company must be deemed to be one in which the public were substantially interested.
 Reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in the case of the State Company Ltd. in which the word 'or' used in sub-cl. (b) (ii) of the aforesaid Explanation was held to have been used disjunctively. It was also contended that on the facts and circumstances of the case the imposition of the additional super-tax under s. 23A without recourse to the provisions of s. 34(1) was not valid.
 
HELD: (i) The language of sub-cls. (ii) and (iii) of cl. (b) is different. The former relates to a positive state of affairs whereas the latter lays down negative conditions.
 The word 'or' is often used to express an alternative of terms defined or explanation of the same thing in different words. Therefore if either of the two negative conditions which are to be found in sub-cl. (b) (iii) remains unfulfilled, the conditions laid down in the entire clause cannot be said to have been satisfied. The clear import of the word 'and' appearing there read with the negative or disqualifying conditions in sub-cl. (b) (iii) is that the assessee was bound to satisfy apart from the conditions contained in the other sub-clauses that its affairs were at no time during the previous year controlled by less than 6 persons and shares carrying more than 50% of the total voting power were during the same period not held by less than 6 persons.

 (ii)An order made by the Income-tax Officer directing payment of additional super-tax is not an order of assessment within the meaning of s. 34(3) of the Act and to such an order the period of limitation prescribed thereby does not apply.
