 The petitioner challenged the order of his detention made under section 3 of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act.
 The Order was founded on 3 grounds. First, the petitioner exploded a bomb in which one person died in a thickly populated area which created panic amongst the local people and he threatened the local people to see that they did not inform the Police. Secondly, the petitioner and his associates tried to extort on pain of instant death grocery from a shop keeper. As a result customers fled away for fear of their lives and all shops in the bazar closed down immediately. Thirdly. bombs were recklessly burled at the villagers, causing panic and disruption.
 The petitioner contended :
 (1) That the grounds mentioned in the detention order are not relevant to public order. They concerned law and order only.
 (2) That the impugned order was passed mechanically without application of mind.
 Dismissing the petition.
 
HELD : Qualitatively the acts which affect law and order are not different from the acts which affect public order. It is the potentiality of the act to disturb the even tempo of the life of the community which makes it prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. If the contravention in its effect is confined only to a few individuals. directly involved as distinguished from a wide spectrum of the public, it would raise a problem of law and order only. It is the length, magnitude and the intensity of the terror- wave unleashed but particular eruption of disorder that helps distinguish it as an act affecting public order from that concerning law and order. The instances in question were serious enough to cause panic and disruption of even flow of life in the locality. Counter-affidavit clearly states that the prosecution against the petitioner could not succeed because the witnesses were not prepared to give evidence for fear of their lives. [304 D-G] Held further, that the detention order in question was passed after due consideration of all relevant grounds. [309 G]
