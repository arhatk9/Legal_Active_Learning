 The appellant was declared elected as a member of the Haryana Legislative Assembly from the Sadbure Scheduled Caste Reserved Constituency in the election held on 19th May, 1982. The contest was between the appellant and 12 others including respondent 1. The appellant secured 20981 votes while respondent 1 secured 20971 votes, that is the appellant secured 10 votes more than the respondent 1.
 Respondent 1 filed an election petition in the High Court challenging the election of the appellant on the ground that the counting of votes was not proper. Respondent 1 prayed not only for recounting of the votes but also for declaration that he was the duly elected candidate Respondent 1 alleged that on his application to which the appellant had also consented, though the Returning Officer had initially ordered recounting of all the ballot papers, the ballot papers of the appellant and respondent 1 only were recounted and therefore 1100 the recount was void. The respondent 1 also alleged that in the recounting, the Returning Officer had improperly rejected about 100 ballot papers said to have been cast in favour of respondent 1 as invalid under the influence of the Naib Tehsildar (Election). The issue framed by the High Court was as to whether respondent 1 was entitled to recount The High Court found that the discretion of the Returning Officer in the matter of rejection of some doubtful ballot papers had been influenced by the opinion of the Naib Tehsildar. In those circumstances, the High Court found a prima facie case made out for ordering rechecking and recounting of the rejected ballot papers. On March 15, 1983 the High Court ordered scrutiny and recount of only the rejected ballot papers of the appellent and respondent 1 by District judge (Vigilance), Punjab. The High Court was of the opinion that no case had been made out for ordering recounting of all the votes. The appellant filed a special leave petition against the High Court's order dated 15.3.1983 which was dismissed by this Court. After the recounting it was found that respondent 1 and the appellant had gained 14 and 8 more votes respectively in addition to the votes already counted in their favour by the Returning Officer. The High Court held that since the appellant had not filed any recrimination application under s. 97 (1) of the Representation of People Act, 1951 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act'), the rejected votes of the appellant, the returned candidate, could not be scrutinized and the appellant could not have the benefit of the 8 ballot papers found to have been wrongly rejected. The High Court found that the result of the returned candidate (appellant) had been materially affected by the wrongful rejection of valid votes cast in favour of respondent 1 and it accordingly allowed the election petition and set aside the appellant's election and declared respondent 1 to be duly elected. Hence this appeal.
 The appellant contended (1) that no recounting at all should have been ordered by the High Court and (2) that if the votes found in the recounting by the Court to have been improperly rejected were to be taken into account at all they must be taken into account not only in regard to respondent 1 but also in regard to the appellant. Relying upon the dissenting view of Ayyangar, J. in the case of Jabar Singh v. Genda Lal (1966) 6 SCR 66, the appellant submitted that it would not be in conformity with the principles of democracy and the will of the electorate to hold, by refusing to take into account the 8 rejected ballot papers in favour of the appellant, that the election of the appellant had been materially affected by the improper rejection of the 14 votes cast in favour of respondent 1 and declare respondent 1 to have been duly elected merely because the appellant had not filed a recrimination application under s. 97 (1) of the Act.
 Dismissing the appeal by majority, ^ 
 HELD: (per S. Murtaza Fazal Ali and A. Varadarajan, JJ.) The High Court found that the allegation of respondent 1 that the Returning Officer obtained the guidance of the Naib Tehsildar in his decision as regards the doubtful votes is probabilised by the evidence of not only the appellant but also of his election agent. The High Court also 1101 found that the admission of the observer, R.W. 4 that respondent I took objection to the presence of the Naib Tehsildar during the recounting probabilises the contention of respondent I that the Naib Tehsildar was influencing the opinion of the Returning Officer in his decision on doubtful votes. Admittedly, some ballot papers meant for the Kalka constituency had been issued and they had been cast in favour of respondent I and were rejected on the ground that they were not meant for use in this constituency. We think that the rejection of these ballot papers without any finding on the question whether the mistake in the use of the ballot papers relating to the Kalka constituency in this constituency had been caused by any mistake or failure on the part of the Returning Officer or polling officer as required by the proviso to rule 56 (2) (g) of the Conduct of Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961 is a ground which could have been taken into consideration for ordering recount of the rejected ballot papers of respondent 1. On a perusal of the rejected ballot papers of the appellant and respondent, 1, we are satisfied about the correctness of the High Court's finding regarding the number of ballot papers improperly rejected by the Returning Officer. In these circumstances, we are clearly of the opinion that the High Court was perfectly justified in ordering recount of the rejected ballot papers relating to respondent 1. [1114G-H;
 1115A-B; D-E; H] We agree with respondent 1's submission that after dismissal of the special leave petition filed by the appellant the High court's order dated 15.3.1983 directing recount of the rejected ballot papers in so far as it is not in excess of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal (High Court) has become final and that it is not open to the appellant to reagitate that question in this appeal which is no doubt under s 116 of the Act, as the principle of construction res judicata applies. [1116A-B] The appellant's contention that the will of the electorate should not be thwarted by holding that the result of the appellant's election is materially affected by the improper rejection of some ballot papers relating to respondent I alone and declaring respondent I to be the duly elected candidate has do substance. This contention of the appellant has already been answered by this Court in P.
 Malaichami v. M. Andi Ambalam and Others. We agree with the following observations of the Court made in that case.
 Courts in general are averse to allow justice to be defeated on a mere technicality. But in deciding an election petition the High Court is merely a Tribunal deciding an election dispute. its powers are wholly the creature of the statue under which it is conferred the power to hear election petitions. An election petition is not an action at law or a suit in equity but is a purely statutory proceeding unknown to the common law and the Court possesses no common law power. It is always to be borne in mind that though the election of a successful candidate is not to be lightly interfered with, one of the essentials of that law is also to safeguard the purity of the election process and also to see that the people do not get elected by flagrant branches of that law or by corrupt practices.
 [1121E; 1122B; 1121G H; 1122A] P. Malaichami v. M. Andi Ambalam and Others, [1973] 3 SCR 1026, referred to.
 What is the effect of the omission to make a recrimination application 1102 under s. 97 (1) of the Act by the returned candidate within the time allowed by the statute in a case where the election petitioner makes a double prayer, namely, declaration of the returned candidate's election as void and a further declaration that he is the duly elected candidate ? In Jabar Singh v. Genda Lal, the majority view of this Court was that in an election petitioner where the election petitioner makes a double claim: it claims that the election of the returned candidate is void and also asks for a declaration that the petitioner himself or some other person has been duly elected the returned candidate must make a recrimination petition under s.97 (1) if he wants to raise pleas in support of his cause that the other person in whose favour a declaration is claimed cannot be said to have been validly elected. Section 97(1) undoubtedly gives an opportunity to the returned candidate to dispute the validity of any of the votes cast in favour of the alternative candidate or to plead for the validity of any vote cast in his favour which has been rejected; but if by his failure to make recrimination within time as required by s. 97 the returned candidate is precluded from raising any such plea at the hearing of the election petition, there would be nothing wrong if the Tribunal proceeds to deal with the dispute under s. 101 (a) on the basis that the other votes counted by the Returning Officer were valid votes and that votes in favour of the returned candidates, if any, which were rejected were invalid. This Court in P.
 Malaichami v. M. Andi Ambalam and Others observed that it is not enough to say that what ought to be looked into is the substance and not the form. If a relief provided under statute could be obtained only by following a certain procedure laid therein for that purpose, that procedure must be followed if he is to obtain that relief. It is not a question of mere pleading, it is a question of jurisdiction.
 The Election Tribunal had no jurisdiction to go into the question whether any wrong votes had been counted in favour of the election petitioner who had claimed the seat for himself unless the successful candidate had filed a petition under s. 97. The law reports are full of cases where parties have failed because of their failure strictly to conform to the letter of the law in regard to the procedure laid down under the Act and the rules.

 Malaichani v. M. Andi Ambalam and Others, [1973] 3 SCR 1026, referred to.
 The appellant's submission that the majority view in the case of Jabar Singh v. Genda Lal should be ordered to be considered by a much larger bench in view of the dissenting judgment of Ayyangar, J. cannot be accepted. Such a request has already been considered and rejected by this Court in P.
 Malaichami v. M. Andi Ambalam and Others on the ground with which we agree, that the dissenting judgment does not throw much light on the subject. [1121A-B] Jabar Singh v. Genda Lal, [1964] 6 SCR 57 and P.
 Malaichami v. M. Andi Ambalam and Others, [1973] 3 SCR 1026, referred to.
 There is no scope for equity since the entire gamut of the process of election is covered by statute. Reliefs as are available according to law can only be granted. [1125E] 1103 Arun Kumar Bose v. Mohd. Purkan Ansari and Others, [1983] INSC 133; AIR 1983 SC 1311, referred to.
 In the instant case, respondent 1 has challenged the appellant's election on the ground of improper rejection of ballot papers which is certainly a ground for declaring an election void. If it was the case of the appellant that any vote validity cast in his favour had been improperly rejected he could have urged it as a ground in a recrimination application filed under s. 97(1) of the Act against respondent 1's prayer that he be declared as the duly elected candidate. Therefore, we do not agree with the appellant that s. 97 (1) will not apply to the facts of the present case and that it will apply only to cases where the returned candidate seek to challenge the prayer in the election petition that the election petitioner or some other candidate be declared to be the duly elected candidate on some other grounds such as corrupt practice. [1128 A-C] In the absence of a recrimination application under s.97 (1) of the Act the High Court originally committed a jurisdictional error in directing the District Judge (Vigilance), Punjab to recheck and recount the rejected ballot papers relating to the appellant. But that mistake has been rectified by the High Court subsequently by not taking into account the 8 ballot papers relating to the appellant which appear to have been wrongly rejected. In these circumstances we hold that the High Court was justified in directing recount of the rejected ballot papers relating to respondent I and declining to take into account the 8 ballot papers relating to the appellant found by the District Judge (Vigilance), Punjab to have been improperly rejected in the absence of a recrimination application under s.97 (1) of the Act and holding that the election of the appellant had been materially affected by the improper rejection of 14 ballot papers relating to respondent 1 and that respondent 1 is entitled to be declared to have been duly elected.

 (Per Sabyadsachi Mukharji, J.) The entire purpose of the constitutional provisions as well as other provisions of law is to ensure that true democracy functions in this country and the will of the people prevails. The purpose of the Representation of the People Act is to safeguard that one who obtains majority of valid votes by proper and due process of law alone should represent the constituency and will of the people. All the legal provisions and the procedures of the enactment should be so construed as to ensure that purpose. It would really be a mockery to the procedure of law if a situation here it is demonstrated duly in the court that a person who obtained four votes 1104 less than other next candidate should be declared elected in preference to the others and allowed to represent the constituency. It is not an appeal to any abstract justice nor it is an appeal to equity but it is to emphasise that procedure should be so construed that these rules of procedure such as s. 97 of the Act subserves the wishes of the voters. For this reason the views expressed by Ayyangar, J. in Jabar Singh v. Genda Lal appeals to me more reasonable though these may strain the literal provisions of the section a bit, Even if the legislature has not amended the relevant provisions after the said decision, I am of the opinion that in a matter of this nature, this Court has a responsibility to construe the procedural provisions of the law in such manner that the procedure does not defeat the purpose or object of the Act. [1130 D-H] 1131 A] Jabar Singh v. Genda Lal, [1964] 6 SCR 66 and Income- tax (Central) Calcutta v. B.N. Bhattachargee and Another, 118 I.T.R. 461 at 480 referred to.
 A Statutory provision must be so construed. if it is possible, that absurdity and mischief may be avoided. Where the plain and literal interpretation of a statutory provision produces a manifestly absurd and unjust result, the Court might modify the language used by the legislature or even do some violence to it so as to achieve the obvious intention of the legislature and produce a rational construction and just result [1132B-C] K.P. Varghese v. Income-tax Officer, Ernakulam and Another, 131 I.T.R. 597, referred to.
 I feel that in view of the lapse of time and the very convincing arguments advanced by Ayyangar, J.,Jabar Singh's case requires reconsideration by a larger Bench. [1132D] A party cannot take advantage of one part of the order which is advantageous to him and discard the other part of the order which may not be to his advantage especially when an application for special leave from that order has been rejected. If that order has to be given effect to as has been done in this case, it has been found that taking into account the eight ballot papers relating to the appellant which had been improperly rejected and also taking into account other ballot papers which had been improperly rejected in favour of respondent No 1, it is manifest by mechanical recounting that the appellant had secured four votes more than respondent No. 1. If that is the position, then in my opinion this Court cannot and should not declare respondent No. 1 to have obtained majority of the valid votes. The order of 15th March, 1983 must stand or fall together. In my opinion it cannot be bifurcated. It cannot be said that the recounting in so far as it was directed of the rejected ballot papers of respondent No. 1 the High Court was within its jurisdiction and in so far as the High Court directed recounting of the rejected ballot papers of appellant also it had committed a jurisdictional error. This is more so after the application for special leave was rejected by this Court. Apart from that I am of the opinion that there was no jurisdictional error-there was power of the High Court to order such a recount. Even if there was no such prayer in hot 1105 petition before the High Court, it cannot be said that the High Court acted without jurisdiction. In such a situation, applying the principle of majority view of Jabar Singh's case, there certain exceptions where even without recrimination petition, a candidate like the appellant in the present case can take advantage of the ballot papers which have not been properly counted in his favour.[1132F-H;
 1133A-D] Janardan Dattuappa Bondre, Etc. v. Govindprasad Shivprasad Choudhary & Ors. Etc., [1979] INSC 99; [1979] 3 SCR 897, referred to.
 I must observed that reference has been made to certain observations in some of the decisions to the effect that in election petitions, there was no question of importing any equitable principle or of importing any principle of remedying injustice as such. With respect I cannot persuade myself to this angle of vision. In construing both statutory provisions as well as provisions giving remedy provided under special statute, efforts should be made that patent injustice and inequity which repels commonsense and which defeats the purpose of the statute, should be avoided.
 [1135A-B] In the instant case I find it difficult to declare respondent No. 1 who has admittedly received less votes than the appellant to have been duly elected.[1135C] In view of the facts and circumstances of the instant case I am of the opinion that even proceeding on the basis that the views expressed by majority of the learned judges in Jabar Singh's case is correct, upon which I must proceed for the purpose of this case but which I still feel should be reconsidered by a larger Bench, on the analogy of the decision in the case of Janardan Dattuappa Bondr, Etc. v.
 Govindprasad Shivprasad Choudhary and Ors. Etc. I would allow this appeal.[1135D-E] Janardan Dattuappa Bondre, Etc. v. Govindprasad Shivprasad Choudhary and Ors. Etc., [1979] 3SCR 897, referred to.
