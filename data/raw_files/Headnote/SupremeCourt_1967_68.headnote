 The two appellants and four other named persons were charged for murder. The Sessions Judge acquitted the four persons but sentenced the two appellants under ss. 302 and 201 read with s. 149 I.P.C. The High Court altered the convictions to those under ss. 302 and 201 read with s. 34. In appeal to this Court, HELD: The appeal must be dismissed.
 Where six named accused persons are charged under s. 302 read with s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code for committing murder and the evidence is directed to establish that the said six persons have taken part in the murder and it is not known who gave the fatal blow, on the acquittal of four persons the remaining two accused can be convicted of the offence under s. 302 read with s. 34. Even if it was not known which particular person or persons gave the fatal blows, once it was found that the murders were committed in furtherance of the common intention of an, each one of all such persons was liable as though the murders had been committed by him alone. Section 34 is intended to meet a case where members of a party acted in furtherance of the common intention of all but it was difficult to prove exactly the part played by each of them. Me principle which the section embodies is the participation in some action with the intention of committing a crime; once such participation is established, s. 34 is 'at once attracted.
