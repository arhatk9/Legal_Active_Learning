 Although the joint recording of statements made by witnesses during an investigation is a contravention of s. 161(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and must be disapproved, that by itself does not render the testimony given by such witnesses in court inadmissible. It is, however, for the court to decide whether it will rely on such testimony or attach any weight to it.
 Zahiruddin v. Emperor, (A.I.R. 1947 P.C. 75), applied.
 Baliram Tikaram v. Emperor, (A.I.R. 1945 Nag. 1) and Magan- lal Radhakishan v. Emperor, (A.I.R. 1946 Nag. 173), disapproved.
 Bejoy Chand Patra v. The State, (A.I.R. 1950 Cal. 363), ap- proved.
 The court has power to substitute a charge under s. 149 of the Indian Penal Code for a charge under s. 34.
 Karnail Singh and others v. The State of Punjab, ([1954] S.C.R. 904)and Willie Slaney's case, (Criminal Appeal No. 6 of 1955), referred to.
 Although s. 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure contem- plates oral examination of the accused in court and though the practice of filing written statements is to be deprecated, the fact that the accused filed a statement instead of being examined is no ground for interference unless he is shown to have been prejudiced thereby.
 Consequently, in a case where the accused were put up for trial under s. 302 read with s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code, and the Additional Sessions Judge relying on the evidence of three of the prosecution witnesses whose statements during the investigation were recorded jointly in contravention of s. 161(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, convicted and sentenced them to transportation for life and the High Court in appeal agreed with the findings of fact, but altered the conviction to one under s. 326 read with s. 149 of the Indian Penal Code, as also the sentence, their conviction was not liable to be set aside.
