 In the Central Public Works Department of the Ministry of Works and Housing, Government of India, the promotions to the posts of Executive Engineers are made from amongst Assistant Executive Engineers (Class-I) who have rendered more than five years of their service in their grade on the basis of seniority-cum fitness and also from Assistant Engineers (Class-II) who have rendered more than eight years of service in their grade on the basis of merit, the selection being made through a departmental promotion committee presided over by a member of the Union Public Service Commission, since for the latter the post of Executive Engineer is a selection post. Promotion to the grade of Executive Engineers, for the first time, on 25th August, 1949, a quota in the ratio of 75% to 25% was prescribed by the Central Government. This was continued right upto the Recruitment Rules 1954 were enacted for these two categories. From September 7,1955, this quota was altered with retrospective effect to 66-2/3% and 33-1/3% and it was again altered with effect from April 1, 1972 to 50 :
 50 for a period of seven years.
 However, at the time of promotions not only the quota was not adhered to with the result that Assistant Engineers came to be promoted 848 with Executive Engineers far in excess of their quota, while there was a shortfall in the promotions of Assistant Executive Engineers, so far as their quota was concerned, but all of them were treated as officiating Executive Engineers.
 There was no statutory rules governing inter-se seniority of Executive Engineers promoted from these two grades. They were therefore, governed by the Memorandum issued by the Home Ministry on June 22nd, 1949 which laid down the general principles of seniority applicable to all departments of the government. The Memorandum provided that "in respect of persons employed in any particular grade, seniority should, as a general rule, be determined on the basis of length of service in that grade as well as service in an equivalent grade irrespective whether the latter was under Central or Provincial Government in India or Pakistan." The length of continuous officiation in the grade was thus taken as the yardstick for the purpose of determining seniority in all departments of the government and a fortiorari, in the grade of Executive Engineers. On the basis of this yardstick, Assistant Engineers promoted as officiating Executive Engineers within their quota would clearly be senior to Assistant Executive Engineers promoted later as officiating Executive Engineers.
 Respondents 1 to 3 issued a seniority list on 1st July, 1971 in which Executive Engineers promoted from the grade of Assistant Engineers in regular manner on the basis of selection made by Departmental Promotion Committee and within their quota were shown as junior to several Executive Engineers promoted much later from the grade of Assistant Executive Engineers. Respondents 1 to 3, in making this seniority list proceeded on the basis that the quota rule specified in the last part of sub-rule (2) of Rule 4 of the Recruitment Rules necessarily implied a system of rotation and it was required to be strictly applied at the stage of confirmation in the grade of Executive Engineers, In other words, out of three vacancies in the grade of Executive Engineers, unless two reserved for promotion of Assistant Executive Engineers were filled up by confirmation of such promotees, the third one for confirmation of an Assistant Engineer promoted as Executive Engineer could not be filled.
 Consequently, all Assistant Engineers were treated as ad-hoc appointees without any claim to seniority until such time as they were confirmed as Executive Engineers within their quota. The impact of this decision of Respondents Nos. 1 to 3 was disastrous for a large number of Executive Engineers promoted from the grade of Assistant Engineers on officiating basis, since many of them had to retire without being confirmed and therefore, without any claim of seniority in the grade of Executive Engineers and the position continues to exist till date. Therefore the aggrieved Assistant Engineers filed a writ petition before the Delhi High Court. The Full Bench of that Court dismissed, the said petitions. In the appeals, by a common judgment reported A. K. Subraman and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. [1975] 2 S.C.R. 979; the Supreme Court accepted the contention of the petitioners that the quota rule was to be applied at the stage of initial promotion in officiating capacity to the grade of Executive Engineers and not at the stage of confirmation and that it did not necessarily imply the rotational system and since the general principles 849 for determining seniority laid down in the Memorandum dated 22nd June, 1949 were, on their plain terms, applicable, seniority in the grade of Executive Engineers was liable to be fixed on the basis of length of continuous officiation in that grade as provided in the Memorandum. The Court allowed the appeal after summarising its conclusions in the form of following six propositions namely:
 (1) when Assistant Engineers (Class-II) are initially appointed in a regular manner in accordance with the rules to officiate as Executive Engineers, their seniority in the service in Grade-I will count from the date of their initial officiating appointment in Class I provided their initial officiating appointment as Executive Engineers was within their quota;
 (2) Their seniority will not be reckoned from the date of their future confirmation in Class-I. The above principle is, however, subject to one reservation, namely, if an Assistant Engineer, before his confirmation in Class II were appointed to officiate in Class I in the grade of Executive Engineer, although within his quota, his seniority will count only from the date of his confirmation in Class II as permanent Assistant Engineer notwithstanding his earlier officiating appointment as Executive Engineer;
 (3) The quota rule will be enforced at the time of initial recruitment, in an officiating capacity to the grade of Executive Engineer and not at the time of confirmation;
 (4) The quota rule will be enforced with reference to vacancies in all posts, whether permanent or temporary including in the sanctioned strength of the cadre (except such vacancies as are purely of a fortuitous or adventitious nature) and the operation of the quota rule will depend upon the availability or non availability of Assistant Executive Engineers for appointment as Executive Engineers. The non- availability of Assistant Executive Engineers for recruitment to the grade of Executive Engineer will not postpone the regular recruitment of the Assistant Executive Engineers within their quota.
 (5) Once the Assistant Engineers are regularly appointed to officiate as Executive Engineers within their quota they will be entitled to consideration in their own rights as Class I officers to further promotions. Their "birth marks" in their earlier service will be of no relevance once they are regularly officiating in the grade of Executive Engineer within their quota.
 (6) If Assistant Engineers are recruited as Executive Engineers in excess of their quota in a particular year they will be pushed down to later years for absorption when due within their quota." and directed the respondents Nos. 1 to 3 to amend and revise the seniority list of 1st July 1971 in the light of the directions given in the judgment and to give effect to the revised seniority list so prepared.
 850 Respondents Nos. 1 to 3, thereafter, issued a seniority list on 14th August, 1975 accompanied by a memorandum bearing the same date in which it was stated that the seniority list of Executive Engineers had been raised in the light of the judgment of the Supreme Court dated 11th December, 1974 in accordance with the principle set out in the memorandum. For the purpose of determining the seniority in the grade of Executive Engineers from and after 22nd December, 1959 respondents Nos. 1 to 3 introduced the carry forward principle and applied the rotational formula. The officers who had been, with the concurrence of the Union Public Service Commission, officiating as Executive Engineers prior to 25th August, 1949 and continued to do so thereafter were shown en bloc senior to the officers appointed after 25th August, 1949 and so far as the period between 25th August 1949 and 21st December, 1959 was concerned the inter se seniority of persons promoted during that period from the grades of Assistant Engineers and Assistant Executive Engineers within their respective quotas was determined in accordance with the length of their regular continuous service as Executive Engineers, subject to the qualification that in case of Assistant Engineers who were promoted as Executive Engineers the length of their regular continuous service as Executive Engineers for the purpose of determining seniority would be computed only from the date when they were confirmed as Assistant Engineer.
 But with effect from 22nd December 1959, a departure was made by respondent Nos. 1 to 3 from the principle of continuous officiation and "carry forward principle was applied by providing that 86 posts earmarked for promotion of Assistant Executive Engineers to the grade of Executive Engineers in accordance with their quota during the period prior to 22nd December, 1959 which had remained unfilled owing to non-availability of Assistant Executive Engineers upto 22nd December 1959 should be carried forward and 86 Assistant Executive Engineers promoted after 22nd December, 1959 should be adjusted against these posts and they should be assigned seniority en bloc immediately below the last Executive Engineer promoted regularly prior to 22nd December, 1959. The result was that the Assistant Engineers who had been promoted as Executive Engineers regularly within their quota subsequent to 22nd December 1959 became junior to the Assistant Executive Engineers promoted against these 86 carried forward posts, even though they might have been promoted as Executive Engineers long prior to the promotion of such Assistant Executive Engineers. The Assistant Executive Engineers promoted and adjusted against these 86 carried forward posts, were given seniority above the Assistant Engineers promoted regularly within their quota after 22nd December, 1959 irrespective as to when such Assistant Executive Engineers were actually promoted. These posts were adjusted on the basis of the order in which the vacancies in the respective quotas of Assistant Executive Engineers and Assistant Engineers for promotion as Executive Engineers were allocated from time to time. The seniority inter-se of Assistant Executive Engineers and Assistant Engineers promoted regularly within their respective quotas subsequent to 22nd December, 1959 was thus determined by the application of the rotation formula based on the quota prevailing at the relevant time. But since it had not been possible to fill all the posts allocated to the Assistant Executive Engineers' quota and some posts remained unfilled, they were shown as vacant 851 in the seniority list prepared according to the roster based on the rotational formula so that as and when Assistant Executive Engineers might be promoted as Executive Engineers regularly within their quota, they would occupy the vacant posts earmarked for them in the seniority list. The disastrous effect of the revised seniority list was that most of the Assistant Engineers promoted as Executive Engineers regularly within their quota subsequent to 22nd December, 1959 lost a considerable number of places in seniority and were placed in a much worse situation than what they were in under the seniority list dated Ist July, 1971 which was quashed at their instance, in writ petitions.
 A contempt application against respondents Nos. 1 to 3 was therefore moved but, before the Court could hear the objections against the seniority list on merits, the first respondent issued on 8th June, 1976 the Executive Engineers, Central Engineering and Central Electrical Engineering Service (Group A) (Regulation of Seniority) Rules 1976.
 These rules were deemed to have come into force with effect from 10th December, 1974, that is one day before the delivery of Judgment by this Court and they substantially enacted in statutory form the same principles which were set out in the memorandum that accompanied the seniority list dated 14th August, 1975 and on which that seniority list was based.
 The petitioners, thereupon, filed the present writ petitions contending that the Rules of 1976 were not applicable to the petitioners and other Assistant Engineers promoted as Executive Engineers regularly within their quota prior to 10th December 1974 and if these Rules were held to be applicable, they were unconstitutional and void. The petitioners challenged the validity of the seniority list dated 14th August, 1975 and the Rules of 1976 on the following grounds, namely; (i) that it was the case of the petitioners and other Executive Engineers promoted from the grade of Assistant Engineers regularly within their quota from and after 22nd December 1959 but before 11th December, 1954 is covered by the decision of this Court in A. K.
 Subraman's case; (ii) that they are entitled to claim seniority, on the basis of length of continuous officiating, over Assistant Executive Engineers promoted as Executive Engineers later in point of time; (iii) that the Assistant Executive Engineers promoted and adjusted against 86 carried forward posts cannot be given seniority en bloc over Assistant Engineers promoted as Executive Engineers earlier;
 (iv) that the rotational formula cannot be applied retrospectively so as to deprive Assistant Engineers promoted as Executive Engineers of their seniority on the basis of length of continuous officiation in the grade of Executive Engineers; (v) that the Rules of 1976 are, to that extent, unconstitutional and void as being outside the power of the Central Government; (vi) that since the Rules of 1976 have been brought into force with effect from 10th December, 1974, they cannot affect the petitioners and other Assistant Engineers promoted as Executive Engineers regularly within their quota prior to that date and their seniority vis-a-vis Assistant Executive Engineers promoted as Executive Engineers must continue to be governed by the principle of length of continued officiation in the grade of Executive Engineers; and (vii) that if the Rules of 1976 are applicable for determining inter se seniority of Executive Engineers promoted from the grades of Assistant Engineers and Assistant Executive Engineers within their respective quotas from and after 22nd December, 1959, they are unconstitutional and 852 void as offending Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution, since the seniority rules enunciated in the Rules of 1976 being closely linked with the quota rule continued massive departure from the quota rule over a long period of time must result in the break down of the seniority rules and to apply the seniority rules in such a situation would create gross inequality of opportunity of employment violative of Articles 14 and 16.
 Allowing the petitions, the Court, ^ 
 HELD: 1.1 Rule 2(iii) of the Central Engineering and Central Electrical Engineering Service Rules, 1976, in so far as it gives en bloc seniority to the Assistant Executive Engineers promoted to the eighty six vacancies carried forward from the period prior to 22-12-1959 irrespective of the date when they were actually promoted and pushed down in seniority Assistant Engineers though promoted regularly within their quota prior to the actual promotion of such Assistant Executive Engineers, merely prejudicially affecting their promotional opportunities is violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. [906B-D] 
 1.2 Rule 2(iv) of the said Rules also suffers from the same infirmity as it provides for rotational rule of seniority based on the prevailing quota for determining inter-se seniority between Assistant Engineers and Assistant Executive Engineers promoted to the grade of Executive Engineers from and after 2nd December, 1959, subject to an en bloc seniority being given to the Assistant Executive Engineers promoted to the eighty six "carried forward" vacancies as set out in Rule 2(iii). Obviously, if Rule 2(iii) providing for en bloc seniority to be given to the Assistant Executive Engineers promoted to the eighty six "carried forward" vacancies is unconstitutional and void, Rule 2(iv) is also unconstitutional and void, when there has been enormous deviation from the quota rule in the promotions of Assistant Executive Engineers and such deviation has continued from year to year over a period of almost twenty five years. [906D-H] 
 1.3 The rotational rule of seniority is inextricably linked up with the quota rule, and if the quota rule is not strictly implemented and there is large deviation from it regularly from year to year, it would grossly be indiscriminatory and unjust to give effect to the rotational rule of seniority. The rotational rule of seniority must obviously break down when there is such massive departure from the quota rule regularly from year to year leading to continuously increasing deficiency in promotions of Assistant Executive Engineers and corresponding excess in promotions of Assistant Engineers.

 2.1 Notwithstanding Rules 2(iii) and 2(iv) of the Rules of 1976, the inter se seniority between Assistant Engineers and Assistant Executive Engineers promoted regularly within their respective quota upto 11th December, 1974 must be determined on the basis of length of continuous officiation in the grade of Executive Engineers, subject of course to the length of continuous officiation in the case of Assistant Engineers being computed from the date of their confirmation as Assistant Engineers in view of decision of the Supreme Court in Subraman's case. In this view carrying forward of eighty six posts of Executive Engineers allocable to Assistant Executive Engineers and giving up seniority en bloc to the Assistant Executive Engineers promoted to the 'carry forward posts' by applying the rotational formula for the purpose of determining seniority amongst Assistant Engineers and Assistant Executive Engineers promoted to the subsequent vacancies is ineffective quota Assistant Engineers and Assistant Executive Engineers promoted upto 11th December 1974 and so far as these Assistant Engineers and Assistant Executive Engineers are concerned, their i ter se seniority must be held to be governed by the length of continuous officiation in the grade of Executive Engineers.
 [888H, 889A-B] 
 2.2 On a plain reading of the decision in Subraman's case, it is obvious that the direction given by it in regard to determination of inter se seniority on the basis of length of continuous officiation was not limited to Executive Engineers promoted from the grade of Assistant Engineers and Assistant Executive Engineers upto 2nd December, 1959 but was on its plain terms applicable to all Executive Engineers promoted from the grade of Assistant Engineers and Assistant Executive Engineers within their respective quota right upto 11th December, 1974 being the date of the decision of the Court. But the revised seniority list dated 14th August, 1975 issued by the Government of India was plainly in defiance of this direction given by the Court. [872A-C, F-G] 
 2.3 When this Court in so many terms laid down that the inter se seniority of Executive Engineers promoted from the grades of Assistant Engineers and Assistant Executive Engineers upto December 11, 1974 must be held to be governed by the rule of length of continuous officiation and the Government of India has been directed by a writ of the Court to amend and revise the seniority, the effect of this decision cannot be set at naught and the binding character of the writ issued against the Government of India can be abrogated by the mere promulgation of the Rules of 1976 with retrospective effect from 10th December 1974. It is significant to note that the Explanatory Memorandum which was in the nature of statement of objects and reasons for the Rules of 1976 did not seek to override the effect of the decision in Subramn's case but on the contrary affirmed that the principles of seniority set out in those rules were laid down on the basis of the said decision. Since the Rules of 1976 purports merely to carry out the direction given in the said decision they cannot have the effect of overriding that decision and absolving the Govt. of India and the Government of India, must, therefore, amend and revise the seniority list of 1st July, 1971 by applying the rule of seniority based on length of continuous officiation for determining 854 inter seniority of Executive Engineers promoted from the grades of Assistant Engineers and Assistant Executive Engineers upto 11th December, 1974. The relative position of the Executive Engineers in regard to their inter se seniority having been crystalised in the decision in Subramn's case and a writ having been issued by he Court directing the inter se seniority of the Executive Engineers to be fixed on the basis of length of continuous officiation the Executive Engineers promoted from the grade of Assistant Engineers were entitled to enforce the writ for determining the inter se seniority with the Executive Engineers in accordance with the rule of length of continuous officiation. The right of the Executive Engineers promoted from the grade of Assistant Engineers under the said decision could not be taken away by anything contained in the Rules of 1976. The decision in Subaraman's case continued to subsist and the Government of India was bound to a determine inter se seniority amongst Executive Engineers in accordance with the direction contained in that decision. If by reason of retrospective alteration of the rule of seniority the decision is rendered erroneous, the remedy may be by way of review, but so long as the decision stands, it cannot be disregarded or ignored and it must be obeyed by the Government of India, despite Rule 2(iii) and 2(iv) so far as the Executive Engineers promoted from the grade of Assistant Engineers and Assistant Executive Engineers Executive Engineers upto 11th December, 1974 are concerned. [873E H, 874B-F,877A-B] Further, the rule of seniority set out in paragraphs 5(ii) and 6 of the Memorandum of the Ministry of Home Affairs dated 22.12.1959 has no application to the instant case.

 3.1 If a vacancy arises on account of an incumbent going on leave or for training on deputation for a short period, it would be a fortuitous or adventitious vacancy and the quota rule would not be attracted in case of such a vacancy. But where a vacancy arises on account of the incumbent going on deputation for a reasonably long period and there is no reasonable likelihood of the person promoted to fill such vacancy having to revert, the vacancy would be subject to the quota rule, because it would be a regular vacancy in the post of Executive Engineers and the person promoted to fill the vacancy would be an officiating Executive Engineer would continue as such without reversion until confirmed and his promotion would, therefore, be by way of recruitment to the cadre of Executive Engineers. Of course, the vacancy which attracts the applicability of the quota rule, is the vacancy in the post included in the sanctioned strength of the cadre of Executive Engineers and not the vacancy in the deputation post. There may be a vacancy in a deputation post in another department or organisation and an Executive Engineer holding a post included in the sanctioned strength of the cadre of Executive Engineers may be sent to such deputation post, but the 855 vacancy which would call for the application of the quota rule in such a case would be the vacancy arising in the post of Executive Engineer within the cadre by reason of the incumbent of that post going to the deputation post and not the vacancy in the deputation post which would be filled up by the Executive Engineer going on deputation. Therefore, what has to be considered for the applicability of the quota rule is a vacancy in a post included in the sanctioned strength of the cadre of Executive Engineers and the sanctioned strength which has to be taken into account, is not merely the sanctioned strength of the cadre of Executive Engineers in the entire Central Engineering Service, Class I. The sanctioned strength of the cadre of Executive Engineers in the Central Engineering Service, Class I, may include not only posts of Executive Engineers in the Central Public Works Department but also posts of Executive Engineers in other departments and organisations. [890H, 891A-G] 
 3.2 Therefore, it cannot be said that promotion to the post of Executive Engineer contemplated under the Rules can be made only where there is no lien of any officer on that post because promotion according to the quota rule is initial promotion in officiating capacity and not concerned with confirmation. It is true that a confirmed Executive Engineer who goes on deputation may revert to the post on which he has a lien and so also an officiating Executive Engineer who goes on deputation may revert back on termination of his deputation and theoretically, in either case, an Assistant Engineer or Assistant Executive Engineer who is promoted to fill the vacancy arising on account of deputation may have to revert, but in actual practice and reality, not a single Assistant Engineer or Assistant Executive Engineer who is promoted to fill the vacancy arising on account of deputation, has had to revert, because deputation is a normal feature in this service and 20 to 25 per cent of the Executive Engineers are continuously on deputation. Even, if one Executive Engineer comes back on termination of his deputation, another has to be sent in his place and deputations thus go on rotating with the result that the vacancy in the post of Executive Engineer arising on account of deputation does not cease and the Assistant Engineer or Assistant Executive Engineer promoted as Executive Engineer to fill the vacancy does not ever have to revert and consequently the vacancy filled by him is really and truly a permanent and long term vacancy which has to be filled according to the quota rule. In fact, if the quota rule were not to be applied with reference to such a vacancy, the position would be that whenever an Executive Engineer goes on deputation for a period which may extend anything between three to five years, the Central Government would be entitled to promote an Assistant Engineer ignoring the claims of Assistant Executive Engineers and this would totally be arbitrary in a situation where 20 to 25 per cent of Executive Engineers are on deputation. For this purpose the vacancies in the posts of Executive Engineers arising on account of deputation of Executive Engineers to other departments, organisations and public undertakings for a period of one or more years were long term vacancies and they could not be regarded as fortutious or adventitious in character and hence they were subject to the quota rule.
 [891G-H, 895H, 896A, 897-F, 856 
 3.3 However, the vacancy pro tempore filled irregularly by an Assistant Engineers would continue to belong to the quota of Assistant Executive Engineers and it can be filled only by the Assistant Executive Engineer, if the quota rule is to be strictly observed. The death or retirement of an irregular promotee to the vacancy cannot therefore give rise to a fresh vacancy: it is the same vacancy which continues until properly filled by promotion of an Assistant Executive Engineer at a subsequent date. If in such a case the death or retirement of an irregular appointed Assistant Engineer were to be treated as creating a fresh vacancy, it would lead to gross distortion. Similarly while pushing down Executive Engineers promoted from the grade of Assistant Engineers in excess of their quota in a subsequent year, the Government must treat them as absorbed from the date when a vacancy in that year arises in the quota of Assistant Engineers and not on a national basis from 1st January of that year.
