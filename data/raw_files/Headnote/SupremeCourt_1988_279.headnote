 A suit for eviction on the ground of arrears of rent was filed by the Appellant-landlord on 11th June, 1973, after the coming into the force of the U.P. Urban Building (Regulation of Letting, Rent and Eviction Act, 1972. In the plaint it was contended that the Act would not apply to the demised premises which was a shop because the same had been constructed only in the year 1966 and as such the shop was exempted from the purview of the Act for a period of 10 years under section 2(3). The respondents contested the suit, the main ground being that the shop was covered by the Act and as such they were entitled to claim the statutory benefit conferred by section 39 on tenants who were in arrears of the rent.
 During the pendency of the suit the respondents made applications in February and March, 1976 to direct the Appellant to disclose the date of construction of the shop.
 As no information was forthcoming the respondents after waiting for some time deposited the arrears of rent together with the interest as required under section 39 of the Act in April, 1976. The Appellant thereafter furnished the information that though the shop had been constructed in 1965 it was assessed to house tax for the first time in January, 1966 and therefore the date of construction for purpose of section 2(2) would be January 1. 1966.
 The Trial Court accepted the aforesaid statement regarding date of construction of the shop and took the view that the respondents had failed to deposit the arrears of rent within one month from the date but had deposited the arrears only in the month of April, 1976 and as such the respondents were not entitled to claim the benefit under section 39.
 The Revision Petition preferred by the respondents to the District Court under section 25 of the Provincial Small PG NO 1079 PG NO 1080 Causes Courts Act was dismissed following the ratio laid down by this Court in Om Prakash v. Digvijendrapal, [1982] INSC 31; [1982] 3 SCR 491. The Addl. Distt. Judge took the view that irrespective of the date of deposit of the arrears of rent, the respondents were entitled to claim the benefit under section 39 because the Act itself did not apply to the demised premises inasmuch as the suit for eviction was not pending on the date the Act came into force namely 15th July, 1972 and had been filed only on 11.7.1973.
 The respondents preferred a writ petition under Art. 226 to the High Court. A Single Judge held that the observation in Om Prakash's case to the effect that in order to attract section 39, the suit must be pending on the date of the commencement of the Act, viz., 15.7.1972 has been held to be obiter dicta in the later case Vineet Kumar v. Mangal Sain Wadhera, [l984] 3 SCC 352, and therefore the respondents would not stand dis-entitled to seek the benefit of section 39 of the Act. The High Court further held that since the appellant had failed to disclose in the plaint the date of construction the respondents cannot be found fault for not having deposited the arrears of rent, that the respondents can be attributed to have knowledge about the date of construction of the shop only in the month of April 1976 and since the arrears of rent had been deposited in April, 1976, they are entitled to claim the benefit of section 39 of the Act. The High Court accordingly allowed the writ petition, and quashed the decree for eviction passed against the respondents.
 the appeal, this Court, 
 HELD: 1. The High Court was not correct in taking the view that since the respondents came to know only in April 1976 about the date of construction of the building, the deposit of the arrears of rent in the month of April 1976 should be considered a valid deposit and sufficient compliance with the mandatory requirement of section 39.

 2. Section 39 envisages only two situations viz. deposit of the arrears of rent within one month from the date of the commencement of the Act or within one month from the date of knowledge of the pendency of the suit. The Section does not provide for a tenant depositing the arrears of rent within one month from the date of his coming to know of the date of construction of the building. [1086E-F] 
 3. In the instant case, even though the respondents had contested the suit and taken a plea in the written statement that the lease of the shop granted to them would PG NO 1081 be governed by the terms of the Act, they had failed to deposit the arrears of rent within one month from the date of their coming to know of the pendency of the suit. On the other hand, they had waited till February and March 1976 to call upon the appellant to furnish the date of construction of the building and then of their own accord had deposited the arrears of rent in April, 1976. No explanation was offered by the respondents as to why they failed to deposit the arrears of rent within one month from the date of their knowledge of the pendency of the suit even though they claimed the benefit of Section 39 or as to why they had waited till February/March 1976 to call upon the appellant to furnish information regarding the date of construction of the shop. [1086C-E] 
 4. It is not necessary in the instant case, to go into the question whether the respondents would or would not be entitled to claim the benefit of section 39 of the Act by reason of the eviction suit not being a pending action on the date the Act came into force. However, it can be said in agreement with the pronouncement in Vineet Kumar's case, that the view taken in Om Prakash's case was obiter dicta.
