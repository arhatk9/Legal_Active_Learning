 The appellant entered into a contract with the respondent for certain construction work at Kanpur. The contract contained an arbitration agreement between the parties.
 The respondent filed a suit in 1946 claiming certain monies due from the appellant against its final bills but, at the instance of the appellant, the suit was stayed and the matter referred to arbitration. The arbitrator made an award in March 1960' in favour of the plaintiffs determining the amount payable by the appellant. Thereafter the appellant made an application for setting aside the award on the ground that the arbitrator misconducted himself in not properly considering that the claim of the respondent was barred by limitation under s. 326 of the U.P. Act 2 of 1916.
 Although the trial court set 'aside the award, the High Court, in appeal, reversed this decision.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended for the appellant that the award was' bad by reason of an error apparent on the face of the award.
 
HELD: Dismissing the appeal, In the present case, it could not be predicated of the award that there was any proposition of law forming the basis of the award, and, therefore, it could not be said that there was any error apparent on the face of the award.
 The arbitrator was under the agreement in the present case to decide the questions which were within the province of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. It could not be said on the face of the award that the arbitrator has decided on any principle of construction which the law does not countenance. [30 G--H; 31 A--B] It is sufficient if the arbitrator gives an award on the whole case and he need not deal with each issue separately.
 It was open to the arbitrator to decide on the rival contentions of the parties as to limitation. In doing so if an arbitrator makes a mistake either in law or on fact and if such mistake does not appear on the face of the award, the award will not be bad notwithstanding any mistake.
