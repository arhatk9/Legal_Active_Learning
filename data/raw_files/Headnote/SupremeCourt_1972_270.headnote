 Succession to the office of Mohunt of the Mutt at Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh is regulated by custom which provides that upon the death of a Mohunt his senior disciple becomes next mohunt. This is, however, subject to the condition that the senior disciple must be a North-Indian Brahmin. in 1947 P was the Mohunt of the Mutt. Upon his death in 1947 the succession was disputed between N and C, The dispute was resolved under the terms of the compromise recorded in Ex.
 B-8. Under the compromise N became the Mohunt, and after him the office was to devolve on C and after C on a senior disciple of N. Upon the death of N in 1958 there was again a dispute as to succession. C claimed to be the. mohunt under the terms of Ex. B-8, while R the present appellant claimed the office, by virtue of his status as a senior disciple of N., The' dispute was settled in terms of a document Ex. B-1 whereby C was to succeed N and after C the, office was to go to R. Very soon after this on 18 March, 1962 C died. Dispute again arose about succession R claimed the office in terms of Ex. B-8 and Ex. B-1 and also by virtue of his being the only surviving disciple of N. The other claimant was D, the respondent in this appeal, who put up claim to the office by virtue of his Position as senior disciple of the last reigning, Mohuat. As D was a minor, a suit was filed on his behalf by his next friend. In that suit he claimed for a declaration of his title to the office of mohunt with all the properties attached to the office as well as an injunction against R restraining him from interfering with affairs of the Mutt. The subordinate Judge held that R was a North-Indian Brahmin and was entitled to succeed as the senior disciple of N and the period of mohuntship of C was to be treated as a break in the practice of the customary rule that only the senior most disciple succeeds upon the death of the reigning mohunt. In the appeal the High Court found that N was not a North Indian Brahmin and therefore not entitled to succeed. The High Court further held that since D was a senior disciple of C he should by the rule of custom succeed to the office of the mohunt upon the death of C. R appealed to this Court with certificates.
 
HELD:(1) The High Court was right in its findings that the plaintiff wasa North-Indian Brahmin while the defendant was a South-Indian Iyengar. It was true that there was a recital in Ex. B-1 that R was a North-Indian Brahmin. Apart 'from the solitary evidence, the entire evidence on record went to show that R was not North-Indian Brahmin. [915 C] Even though a clear plea of estoppel arose from the recital in Ex. B-1 the defendant did not rely on this plea and entered into an issue on the fact so that the whole matter became open for the decision of the learned subordinate Judge., R not only failed to invoke the doctrine of estoppel before the learned Subordinate Judge but joined issue with the 912 plaintiff upon the question whether the defendant was not a North-Indian Brahmin and accordingly an issue was raised and evidence adduced on this question R could not therefore rely on the doctrine of estoppel to prevent the plaintiff from proving that R was in fact not a North-Indian Brahmin. In the light of the foregoing considerations there was no reason to discard the finding of fact recorded by the High Court to the effect that D was North-Indian Brahmin and R was not L916 C; E & 917 A] Young and Anr. v.

 (2)It was not possible to make R the mohunt for the simple reason that he was not a North-Indian Brahmin. The, rule of custom should prevail in all cases and if any aberrations have to be corrected such correction must take its in the direction of reestablishing the rule of custom.

 (3)in most cases if there is a break in the customary rule it may not at all be possible to revert back to the' customary succession if one has to start from the point when the original break had commenced. In such cases even if it may be possible to revert to the customary practice, it may not be possible to go back to the point where the customary.
 line of succession had its first break. Thus, in this case though it had been possible to trace at least one person who was a disciple of N after ,whom the customary practice was broken and the office handed over to an alleged interloper, even this lone survivor of the original line of succession was not a person who was competent to become the Mohunt by the immemorial custom of the Mutt. Therefore, it was not possible at all to reestablish the customary line of succession if one treats the period of C's mohuntship as altogether non-existing. it was not open to the Court ,to lay down a new rule of succession or to alter the rule of succession ,completely. The only way to save the custom was by accepting something as a fact which had so far been accepted by everybody concerned with the Mutt as a fact and which could not any longer be undone without demolishing altogether the custom of the Mutt. [918 EG] In these circumstances.it must be held that D was entitled to succeed C as his senior-most disciple on the strength of immemorial custom of
