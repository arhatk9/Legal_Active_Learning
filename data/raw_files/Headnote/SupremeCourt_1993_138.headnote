 The Food Corporation of India appellant entered into an agreement dated August 14, 1967 with the respondent No. 1 entrusting him the work of clearing, transporting, storing and distribution of foodgrains on behalf of the Corporation viz. a storage agency by the Corporation. Clause 37 of the agreement provided that either party was at liberty without assigning any reason to terminate the agreement on giving two months prior notice in writing.
 The Managing Director of the Corporation in the meeting of the Zonal Managers, Senior Regional Managers and other officers held on September 20/21, 19S4 pointed out that the private storage agencies were responsible for high transit losses (if the foodgrains in the State of West Bengal, and directed that the desirability of continuing the system of storage agents be examined. Immediately a Committee was formed to go into this question. The Committee reported against continuing the storage agency system, and the report was accepted in principle, a final decision to abolish the storage agency was taken, and a target date for abolition was fixed for compliance. This decision was contained in the letter of the Zonal Manager dated 14th March 1985.
 The District Manager by his notice dated June 25, 1987 terminated the storage agency agreement with the respondent with effect from August 31, 1987. The respondent challenged the validity of the notice by way of a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution before the High Court. The respondent challenged the termination notice on the grounds that : (i) clause 37 of the agreement was arbitrary and as such violative of Article 14 of the Constitution, (ii) clause 37 was unilateral, against natural 498 justice, unlawful and as such was void under section 24 of the Indian Contract Act, and (iii) the action of the Corporation was arbitrary against public policy and public interest.
 A Division Bench of the High Court did not go into any of the aforesaid grounds contended by the respondent and instead examined the correspondence and various office orders placed before it by the Corporation, and came to the conclusion that in fact no policy decision was taken by the FCI before terminating the agreement, and set aside the notice dated June 25, 1987.
 Allowing the appeal of the FCI, this Court, 
 HELD : 1. The High Court was not justified in quashing the notice especially when the terms and conditions of the Contract permitted the termination of the agreement by either of the parties. [501G] 
 2. The High Court should not have gone into the question of contractual obligation in its writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. [501G] 
 3. The High Court misread the documents on record and grossly erred in reaching the conclusion that no policy decision was taken by the FCI to terminate the storage agencies in the State of West Bengal. [501H] In the instant case, there is no manner of doubt that a policy decision was taken at the level of the Zonal Manager to abolish the storage agencies and the said decision was approved by the Head Office of the FCI. The letter dated March 14, 1985 of the Zonal Manager indicates the plan to be worked out for abolishing the storage agencies in the West Bengal Region. [504B-D]
