 For the assessment year 1947-48 the appellant in the first case field a return of her income and the assessment was completed sometime in 1948 as a result whereof it was found that no tax was payable by her. On April 2,1956, the appellant was ,served with a notice dated March 19, 1956, under s. 34 (1) of the Income-tax Act, 1922, on the ground of escaped assessment. The date of the notice fell within 8 years from the end of the relevant assessment year i.e.
 March 31, 1948, but it was served beyond 8 years from the date and therefore was clearly out of time under the provisions of the said section. In the second case, the appellant was assessed for the assessment year 1947-48 and the tax thereon was deposited on his behalf. On April 2, 1956, the appellant was also served with a similar notice as aforesaid. The appellants filed two petitions under Art.
 226 for quashing the said notices and the learned Judge of the High Court issued rules nisi to the Income-tax Officer, the Commissioner of Income-tax and the Union of India. On September 11, 1958, the rules were made absolute. The respondents then preferred appeals to a Division Bench of that Court. Pending the appeals, on March 12, 1959, s. 34 of the Act was amended by s.2 of the Amending Act, 1959.
 After the said amendment the appeals were heard and relying upon the said amendment the learned judges held that the said notices, though served on the appellants after the prescribed time, were served under s. 4 of the Amending Act.
 On appeal by Special Leave it was urged on behalf of the appellants that s.4 of the Amending Act only saved a notice issued after the prescribed time, but did not apply to a situation where notice was issued within but served out of time. The respondents contended that the expression "issued" means "served" and that, in any view, it was comprehensive enough to take in the entire process of giving and serving of notice.
 Held: To the present case the general rule of construction of fiscal Acts would apply, and not the exception engrafted on the rules; for, s. 4 of the Amending Act, cannot be described as a provision laying down the machinery for the calculation of tax. In substance it enables the Income-tax Officer to reassess a person's income which has escaped assessment, though the time within which he could have so assessed had expired under the Act before the amendment of 1959. It resuscitates barred claims. Therefore, the same stringent rules of construction appropriate to a charging section shall also apply to -such a provision.
 Case law discussed.
 On a true construction of s. 4 of the Amending Act, it must be held that the clear intention of the legislature was to save the validity of the notice as well as the assessment from an 540 attack on the ground that the notice was given beyond the prescribed period. That intention would be effectuated if the wider meaning is given to the expression "issued". The dictionary meaning of the expression "issued" takes in the entire process of sending the notice as well as the service thereof. The said word used in s. 34(1) of the Act itself was interpreted by courts to mean 'served". The limited meaning, namely, "sent" will exclude from the operation of the provision a class of cases and introduce anomalies. In the circumstances, by interpretation, the wider meaning of the word "issued" must be accepted. In this view, though the notices were served beyond the prescribed time, they were saved under s.4 of the Amending Act.
