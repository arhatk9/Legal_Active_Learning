 The appellant was declared elected to the State Legislative Assembly and the first respondent, who get the next highest number of votes, challenged his election on various grounds and also prayed that he should be declared elected in the appellant's place. One of the grounds alleged against the appellant was that by hiring, 10 cars for campaigning, and spending money for printing election materials, be ,spent by way of election expenses, money beyond the legal limit, and thus committed the corrupt practice under s. 123(6) of the Representation of the People Act. 1951 The High Court held this ground proved and also that some of the printed handbills contained libellous matter, and set aside the election and declared the first respondent elected.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The setting aside of the appellant's election by the High Court should be confirmed, but the declaration in favour of the first respondent should be set aside. [399 B- C] (1) The numbers of the some of the cars hired as set out in the petition were :different from those given in evidence.
 But the infirmity would not have any effect on the first respondent's case since no prejudice has been sustained by the appellant by the change and no integral element in the ground of corrupt practice, namely excessive expenditure for the election, has been kept back. In the law of election.
 facts constitutive of corrupt Practice must be averred in the petition itself or brought in by amendment by leave of court within the limitation period. But particulars ;illustrative of corrupt practices alleged stand on a different footing. Proof at minor variance with alleged particulars may be allowed by the court Provided the opposite party has not sustained any prejudice and is given an Opportunity for adducing rebutting evidence. [388 G-389E] Bhagwan Datt Shastri v. R. R. Gupta, 11 E.L.R. 448, 456 followed.
 (2) Where the trial court has watched the delivery of testimony by the witnesses its opinion on their credibility is entitled to much credit by the appellate court. [389G-H] (3) An election tribunal must know that there exists an initial presumption in favour of the poll verdict; and that the whole constituency is invisibly party to the lis. The voice of the voters will be interfered with only if the votes in favour of the elected candidate were illegally procured. In the present case, the High Court has weighed the evidence fairly and correctly. The approach of the court to the evidence is impeccable. There mayhave been adulteration of evidence; but, after full consideration of the finding of the High Court that the appellant had committed the corrupt practice under s. 123(6) must be confirmed. [390 C-D, E-F; 394H-395A] (4) But assuming that some of the allegations in the hand bills undoubtedly amounted to character assasination of the first respondent and injured his poll prospects, and group disaffection or threat, as stipulated in s. 123, could be ,read into them the sanctity of the poll verdict will stand violated, if the tribunal without the strict compulsion of statutory provisions, substitutes for an elected representative a court picked candidate. The requirements under s, 101 before the 385 court can declare a rival candidate as the returned candidate, are (a) the returned candidate must have obtained votes by operation of corrupt practices, (b) such tainted votes must be quantified with judicial assurance, and (c) after deduction of such void votes the petitioner or some other candidate must be shown to have secured a majority of the valid votes. Therefore, in the present case the decisive factor would be satisfactory proof of the number of votes, if any, attracted by the appellant into his ballot box by the corrupt means proved against him. But there is no evidence to show how many votes were definitely obtained by the appellant by the use of corrupt practices. There is no link between the polluted practice and the voters affected. Further, there is nothing to show why those voters would have Preferred the first respondent and not any other candidate, there being as many as 10 contesting candidates. [396 B-C, H-397E; 398B-D] T. Nagappa v. T. C. Basappa, A.I.R. 1955 S.C. 756 and Jamuna Prasad v. Lachhi and, AIR1954 S.C. 686, 689: [1954] INSC 81; [1955] S.C.R. 608. referred to.
 (5) Money power casts a sinister shadow on our elections Further, there is a built-in iniquity in the scheme, because, an independent candidate who exceeds the ceiling prescribed under the law commits a corrupt practice, but his rivals set up by political parties with considerable potential for fund-raising and using, may lay out a hundred times more in each constituency on their candidates and yet escape the penalty under s. 77 on the ground that the excessive expenditure was not spent by the candidate but by the party for its campaign. This evasion of the law by using big money through political parties is a source of pollution of the Indian political process. It may therefore be proper to infuse into the election law the cleansing spirit suggested by this Court in Kanwarlal Gupta v. Amar Nath Chawla [1975] 2 S. C. R. 259 and by the Select Committee on the Indian Election Offences and Enquiries Act, 1920. Elections. constituency wise. are the corner stone of our parliamentary system and if the law is to reflect and ensure the democratic norms set by the nation in this strategic area, serious political consensus. not sanctimonious platitudes, on reducing the heavy expenditure on election by parties and candidates, must emerge. it is only to a limited extent that courts can respond to the fulfillment of this constitutional aspiration by a benignant interpretation of the legal limits on election expenditure set down in s. 77.
