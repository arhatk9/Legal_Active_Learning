 An agreement, containing a clause for settlement of the disputes by reference to an Arbitrator at Calcutta was executed at Delhi between the appellant-Union of India, and the respondent for certain constructions at Dalbhumgarh.
 Ignoring the arbitration clause, the -respondent filed a suit on the original side of the Calcutta High Court claiming certain amount under the agreement. The appellant filed an application under s. 34 of the Arbitration Act for the stay of the suit. The suit was stayed and the matter was referred to the Arbitrator in Calcutta before whom the appellant made a counter-claim. The respondent objected to the entertainment of the counter-claim. The stay granted by the Calcutta High Court was vacated. Pending the suit the appellant filed an application under s. 2O of the Act before the Subordinate Judge, Delhi, for making the reference to the Arbitrator. The respondent opposed the application on the ground that the Subordinate Judge, Delhi had no jurisdiction to entertain the application and that the appellant having filed an application under s. 34 of the Act in the Calcutta High Court, the subsequent application should be filed in the Calcutta High Court. The Subordinate Judge Delhi, referred the disputes to the Arbitrator holding that the Delhi Court had jurisdiction as the contract was concluded and signed at Delhi. The respondent filed an appeal to the Punjab High Court, which the High Court allowed holding that the Delhi Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the application. In appeal, this Court, 
HELD : The Subordinate Judge, Delhi was right in holding that the application under s. 20 was maintainable in his court and for making a reference of the disputes to the arbitrator mentioned in the agreement.
 Two conditions must be fulfilled in order to give a court exclusive, jurisdiction under s. 31(4) of the Act. In the first place an application under the Arbitration Act must be made to the Court competent to entertain it, and, in the second place, it must be made "in any reference". The application for stay of suit under s. 34 in the present case was not an application in a reference within the wider meaning given to that phrase by this Court in Kumbha Mawji's case. There are different sections in the Arbitration Act whereby an application is to be made even before any -reference has been made. Section 8 for instance, provides for an application to invoke the power of the court, when the parties fail to concur in the appointment of an arbitrator to whom the reference can be made. So also s. 20 provides for an application to file the arbitration agreement in court so that an order of reference to an arbitrator can be made. These are clearly applications anterior to the reference but they lead to a reference.
 Such applications are undoubtedly applications "in the matter of a reference" and may fall within the purview of s.
 31(4) of the Act even though these applications are made before any reference has taken place. But an application under s. 34 is clearly not an application belonging to 352 the same category. It has nothing to do with any reference.
 It is only intended to make an arbitration agreement effective and prevent a party from going to court contrary to his own agreement that the dispute is to be adjudicated by a private tribunal. [355F-356C] Kumbha Mawji v. Union of India, [1953] INSC 34; [1953] S.C.R. 878, referred to.
 The other condition imposed by s. 31(4) is that the application for stay must be made to a court competent to entertain it. In s. 34 the expression "judicial authority" is used. The section provides for an application to a judicial authority before whom a legal proceeding is pending for the stay of that proceeding. An application for stay of legal proceeding to a judicial authority before whom it is pending is an application under the Arbitration Act to a judicial authority competent to entertain it. But the judicial authority need not necessarily be a court competent under s. 2(c) to decide the question forming the subject matter of the reference. A party to an arbitration agreement may choose to file a suit in a court which has no jurisdiction to go into the matter at all and merely because the defendant in such a suit has to make an application to that court under s. 34 of the Act for the stay of the suit it cannot be said that the court which otherwise has no jurisdiction in the matter becomes a court within the meaning of s. 2(c) of the Act.
