 The respondent's application under s. 25 of the Guardians and Wards Act for the custody of respondent's daughter was rejected by the Civil Judge. When the decision was reversed in appeal by a single Judge of the Rajasthan High Court, the appellants preferred an appeal to the Division Bench under cl. 18 of the Rajasthan High Court Ordinance. This was dismissed on the ground that the appeal was incompetent having regard to sq. 47 and 48 of the Guardians and Wards Act. In appeal to this Court, 
HELD:The appeal before the Division Bench of the Rajasthan High Court under cl. 18(1) of the Ordinance was competent.
 [106 H] The competence of an appeal before the Division Bench will have to be judged by the provisions of cl. 18 of the Ordinance itself and s. 48 of the Act has no restrictive impact. Section 48 saves the provisions of s. 47 of the Act and s. 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure; and considered by themselves the provisions of s. 47 do not create any bar against the competence of an appeal under cl. 18(1) of the Ordinance where the appeal permitted by s. 47 is heard by a single Judge. [106 G] Section 48 attaches finality to the order passed by the trial Court subject to the provisions prescribed by s. 47 of the Act and s. 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure. [106 E]
