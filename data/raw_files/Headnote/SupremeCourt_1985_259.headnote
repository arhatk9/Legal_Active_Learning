 The Ministry of Railways exercising powers under section 27A of the Railways Act issued a Preferential Traffic Schedule. This Schedule prescribed five priorities i.e. priorities 'A' to 'E' with inter-se priority amongst 'A' to 'E' to be accorded by the railways for transport of certain goods or class of goods specified under each category. Different kinds of coal fell under priority 'C' (iii) which provides for movement of coal from collieries in accordance with programme and movements sponsored or recommended by the Coal Controller or the State Government Director, (Movement) Railways.
 In Viklad Coal Merchant, Patiala v. U.O.I. [1984] 1 S.C.R. 657, the Supreme Court held that (i) section 27 of the Indian Railways Act casts a duty on the Railway Administration to arrange for receiving and forwarding traffic without unreasonable delay and without partiality;
 (ii) Section 28 prohibited the railway administration from giving undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person or railway administration; (iii) Section 27A gave power to the Central Government to issue directions for giving special facilities or preferential treatment in transport of goods or class of goods consigned to the Central Government or the Government of any State; (iv) in order to be eligible for obtaining allotment of wagon under priority 'C' it is necessary for the person indent in the wagon to satisfy the five conditions specified therein, namely (a) that the coal is to be loaded from the collieries; (b) that the coal to be loaded is in conformity with the commodity quotas laid down from time to time for certain types of coal and or in accordance with the programme and movements sponsored or recommended by the Coal Controller and/or any Committee appointed by him; (c) or it is sponsored or recommended by the State 881 Government and/or other recommending authorities and accepted by the Railway Administrations; (d) or it is sponsored or recommended by Director, Movement (Railways) Calcutta; and (e) it must be in accordance with the Zonal Scheme applicable to each field and the principles of transport rationalisation in force from time to time, and that stoppage at way-side stations for the booking of coal in wagons could not be described as violative of section 28 of the Act or indicated unreasonable restrictions.
 The railways had been allotting wagons and rakes to its sponsored traders even after the judgment of the Supreme Court in Viklad's case in priority 'C' when loaded from various stations nominated for coal loading on N.F.
 Railways. For movement of Khasi Coal there is no station at colliery siding. As such the coal loaded from the stations nominated for coal loading on N.F. Railway had been taken as coal loaded from collieries. One party M/s Mangalam Enterprises - the respondent to the S.L.P. as well as to the writ petition filed a petition before the Gauhati High Court against the registration of indents on the basis of the priorities granted by Calcutta High Court. The High Court allowed they Civil Rule and directed the Railways to allot wagons in priority 'C' to the sponsored traders only when they fulfil the five conditions set out in Viklad Coal Merchants, case and that otherwise the registration would be made under 'E' priority and allotment of wagon rakes shall strictly be according to the seniority of indents at the booking station as per rule 201 of the Goods Traffic. It further directed that all existing indents registered under item 'C' for the parties not fulfilling all the five conditions were to be covered in 'E'.
 Pursuant to the aforesaid order the Railways had been permitting loading of coal by those having sponsorship certificates under item 'E' even though the indents might have been registered under item 'C'. Hence these petitions to the Supreme Court.
 It was contended before the Supreme Court that (1) those sponsorers who had to load coal from stations which are not collieries should not be given priorities in priority 'C' and, (2) the Preferential Traffic Schedule enjoins that the movement of Traffic Schedule should be controlled by Controller of Movements and not by the general Managers of Regional Railways and that this was not canalised by the Controller of Movements.
 Disposing of the writ petition and the special leave petitions, 882 ^ 
 HELD : 1. It is true that the railways have permitted movement of coal from nominated railway stations which are not at all collieries. This had to be done in the interest of equitable distribution of coal in the whole country.
 Otherwise, the State of Meghalaya which had no railway stations at the colliery sidings will not be able to transport any coal for the need of Punjab or the North. If there is coal in Meghalaya and there is need in Punjab and the North then the scheme should be so read that even the nominated stations in Assam, nominated by high authorities of railways, should be treated for the purpose of the scheme as colliery sidings for Khasi coal in those areas. This, the Railways did prior to the order of the High Court. This was proper interpretation of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Viklad's case, and this should be adhered to. [890 G-H;
 891 A-B] 2. The area of Meghalaya falls within the Assam Fields.
 The list of zonal rationalisation of movement of coal from different coal fields suggests that such zonal rationalisation must be controlled by Central Authorities and not by General Managers of different Railways. The movement of such coal must be such that it should be coordinated by the Central Authorities like the Coal Controller and cannot be done haphazardly by the General Managers of the different regions. In future, movement of coal should be sanctioned by the Zonal Managers of Railways with the prior consultation and concurrence of the Coal Controller. This can be achieved quickly if intimation of the same is sent to the Controller and no objection is received immediately, it will be deemed to have been sanctioned.
 In the instant cases, where requisitions have already been issued and sanctioned with the knowledge of the Controller of Coal then there has been sufficient compliance. [892 A-F] 3(i) The stations nominated by the railway in Assam and Meghalaya Zones should be treated as stations at colliery sidings in terms of the directions given in Viklad's case.
 3(ii) the allotment of wagons made by the Zonal Managers should be adhered to so far as these have already been made and coal should be loaded but in future Zonal Manager should follow the procedure in making allotments as indicated herein.
 3(iii) in cases where the General Managers sanction movements of coal, immediate intimation should be given to the controller of Movements and vice versa. These two authorities must act in harmony, and in consultation. [892 G-H; 893 A] 883
