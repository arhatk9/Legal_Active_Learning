 For a 'Parliamentary seat in the State of Punjab the appellant, a candidate of the Akali Dal, and the first respondent, the nominee of the Communist Party of India, were two of the contesting candidates. The total number of votes polled were 344073 out of which 7663 were invalidated.
 The first respondent was declared elected by a margin of 210 votes. Even at the time the counting was completed the appellant applied to the Returning Officer for a recount but the application was rejected as premature. Soon after the announcement of the votes polled by each candidate the appellant applied again for recount, under r. 63(2) of the conduct of Election Rules. The Returning Officer rejected this application also. The- appellant filed an election petition and contended that, the attitude of the counting staff was hostile to the appellant and his party, and that there were many irregularities in rejecting votes in favour of appellant, in accepting vote in favour of the 1st respondent, and in the counting and prayed for a general recount.
 The High Court, by an interim order ordered a limited recount of votes in one of the segments of the constituency and that order was affirmed by a consent order in this Court to cover the votes of both the contestants. This recount revealed some errors but did not tilt the scale in favour of the appellant. The election petition was ultimately dismissed by the High Court.
 
HELD : (1) On the evidence there is no force in the appellant's contention about either official bias or of violation of rules. If there had been any manipulation by the counting staff the matter would have been brought to the notice of the Returning Officer and the senior officers present for supervising the counting and deciding disputes, reference to it would have been made in the two applications for recount, and in the appellant's application to the Election Commissioner for inspection. Moreover, the alleged biased behaviour is disproved by the accuracy disclosed in the recount, the marginal error being more or less similar in the case of both the candidates. [388 C-F] (2) The Returning Officer was in error in disallowing the recount. Under r. 63 the mandate for recount is not the exception, and refusal is restricted to cases. where the demand itself is 'frivolous or unreasonable'. Where the margin of difference is minimal the claim for a fresh count cannot be summarily brushed aside as futile or trumpery. If formal defects had been misconstrued as substantial in- firmities or vice versa resulting in wrongful reception or rejection, the sooner it was set right the better, especially when a plea for a second inspection had been made on the spot. Prestige or fatigue should not inhibit a fresh or a partial check. The instructions contained in para 17, cl. (nn) of the Procedure for Counting in the Handbook for Returning Officers requires the Returning Officer to ensure further accuracy in the counting of votes by making 5% test check. The Returning Officer, in the present ease, had not done so, but that is no ground for this Court to order recount or to reverse the decision of the High Court refusing recount. [385 G-386 B; 392 C-G] (3) While the Returning officer should be liberal, the power of the Court to order recount which is undoubted, should be exercised sparingly. Even if there is difficulty in giving the serial number of voting papers illegally rejected or received, an application made for inspection of ballot boxes must give material facts which would enable the tribunal or the Court to consider whether in the interests of justice, the ballot boxes should be inspected or not. In dealing general allegations that valid votes were improperly rejected or invalid votes were improperly accepted, would not serve the purpose which is provided for in s. 83 (1) (a). In dealing with this question the importance of secrecy of the ballot papers cannot 10-4023SCI/75 382 be ignored. The statutory rules framed under Act are intended to provide adequate safeguard for the examination of the validity or invalidity of votes for their proper counting. Care must be taken to see that election petitioners do not get a chance to make a roving or fishing enquiry into the ballot boxes so as to justify their claim that the returning candidate selection is void, and to threaten the certainty of the poll by flippant recounts.
 [390 D-H; 392 G-H; 393 C-D] Jagjit Singh, A.I.R. 1966 S.C. 774, 783 and Chanda Singh v.
 Choudhary Shiv Ram Verma, Civil Appeal No. 1185 of 1973, decided on 20-12-1974, followed.
 In the present case. the High Court construed r. 56 of the rules in the light of r. 38 and took the view that the ballot paper shall not be rejected merely on the ground of a formal defect as the accidental omission of the signature of the Presiding Officer, without the Returning Officer proceeding to consider if such defect was occasioned by the inadvertence or lapse of the Presiding Officer or the Polling officer, and ordered a limited recount rightly.
 However, the number of totally rejected ballot papers of all candidates when subjected to a repeated scrutiny yielded disappointing results from the point of view of the appellant. Out of 1096 rejected ballot papers only 17, claimed by the appellant, and 7, by the first respondent, were found faulty. Therefore, the High Court was right in refusing to grant a recount on a comprehensive scale. [387 E-H] (4) Even in the application to the Election Commission the plea for inspection of the used ballot papers was primarily confined to one Assembly segment and the rejected ballots of other assembly segments. In regard to that plea, the petition gave details, but not a scintilla of evidence, on which the Court could act, was present on the record to prove prima facie, what has been alleged. Therefore, refusal of recount was not improper. [391 B, D-E-]
