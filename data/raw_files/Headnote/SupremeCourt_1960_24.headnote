 The assessee was the Managing Agent of a company and for the accounting year 950 its total commission was Rs. 3,09,114.
 At the oral request of the Directors of the Company made during the accounting year the assessee agreed to accept Rs.
 1,00,000 only as its commission and relinquished the balance. The Income-tax Officer and the Appellate Assistant Commissioner hold that the sum of Rs. 3,09,114 had accrued to the respondent as commission and that the whole amount was taxable. On appeal the Appellate Tribunal held that out of the accrued commission the amount relinquished, i.e. Rs.
 2,09,114, was allowable expenditure under S. 10(2) (XV) Of the Income-tax Act. The Tribunal found that: (i) the financial condition of the managed company was unsatisfactory, (ii) in the past also the assessee had been remitting part or whole of its commission when the profits of the managed company were unsatisfactory, (iii) in the year of account the profits of the Company would have been Rs. 3,63,078 if the whole commission was deducted, which would be the lowest since 1940, (iv) it was not a bounty by the respondent to the managed company, (v) the business of the respondent was so linked up with the managed company that if the latter was put on a sounder position the assessee would also get a larger commission in future, and (vi) the respondent had accepted Rs. 1,00,000 at the instance of the managed company. The appellant contended that S. 10(2)(xv) applied only when the expenditure was incurred directly for the purpose of the business of the assessee and not when it affected his business only indirectly as a result of the benefit to the managed company.
 Held, that the finding of the Tribunal that the amount which was claimed as a deductible allowance under S. 1O(2)(XV) was laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the assessee's business was one of fact and as there was evidence to support it, it could not be interfered with. In deciding whether the payment was a deductible expenditure the question of commercial expediency and the principles of ordinary commercial trading had to be taken into consideration. If the payment of expenditure was incurred for the purpose of the trade or business of the assessee it did not matter that the payment enured to the benefit of a third party also. Another test was whether the transaction was properly entered into as a part of the assessee's legitimate 39 commercial undertaking in order to facilitate the carrying on of its business. But if the expense was incurred for fostering the business of another only or was made by way of distribution of profits or was wholly gratuitous or for some improper or oblique purpose outside the course of business then the expense was not deductible.
