 The appellant who was engaged to one Mrs. Knight, transferred 750 shares to her on December 10, 1947. On December 15, 1947, the Company transferred those shares in her name in its books. On December 18, 1947, the marriage was solemnised. The Income-tax Officer included the income of Mrs. Thomas from those shares in the income of her husband. The appeal of the assessee-husband was dismissed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner who held that the 481 provisions of s. 16 (3) (b) and S. 16 (3) (a) (iii) applied.
 Appeals having failed, the Appellate Tribunal referred to the High Court the question whether the provisions of s. 16 (3) (a) (iii) would apply or those of s. 16 (1) (c). The view of the High Court was that the provisions of s, 16 (3) (a) (iii) would apply and not of s. 16 (1) (c). The appellant came to this Court after obtaining a certificate of fitness.
 Held that the provisions of s. 16 (3) (a) (iii) did not apply to the present case. From whatever point of view the transfer of the shares be considered, whether as a consideration for a promise to marry or a gift subject to the subsequent condition of marriage, the transfer took effect immediately and was not postponed to the date of marriage. On the date of transfer, the appellant and Mrs.
 Knight were not husband and wife and hence there was no transfer, directly and indirectly, by the husband to his wife. All income of the wife from all assets is not includible in the income of her husband. The income from only those assests of the wife can be included in that of her husband which were transferred to her by her husband after they became husband and wife.
 The statute must be construed in a manner which carries out the intention of the legislature. The intention of the legislature must be primarily gathered from the words of the statute itself If the words are unambiguous or plain, they will indicate the intention with which the statute was passed and the object to be obtained by it. There is nothing in s. 16 (3) which indicates that the words 'wife' or 'husband' must not be taken in their primary sense which is clearly indicative of a marital relationship. The words 'wife and husband' should be given their true natural meaning. They do not include prospective husband and prospective wife.
