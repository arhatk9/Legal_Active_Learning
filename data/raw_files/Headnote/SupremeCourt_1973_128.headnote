 On the question whether the High Court was right in holding that the respondents, who were inamdars, were entitled to compensation on the abolition of the Bhil Naik Inams under the provisions of s. 7(1) of the Bombay Bhil Naik Inam Abolition Act, 1955, 
HELD : A grant of the profits of land as remuneration for an office is resume able but a grant of land burdened with service cannot be resumed unless there is a specific provision in the grant to that effect. [302 G] In the present case, since the grants were intended to be of the soil and not to provide remuneration for any specific services and there was no specific provision in the grant entitling the government to resume, their abolition has the effect of extinguishing or modifying rights in property and hence the decision of the High Court was right. [302 G-H] (a)..The object of the grants, which date from pre-British period was not so much to provide remuneration for services which were being rendered or which were to be rendered, as to induce the Bhils to give up their predatory anti-social activities by settling them on lands. The grants were continued on political considerations by the British Government. The grantees, were to render services mentioned in clause (2) of the Sanad; but there was no provision for resumption even if no services were required or for failure to render them. The fact that express provision has been made for resumption only on the failure to observe the three conditions specified in clause (3) of the sanad would show that there was an implied prohibition for resumption in any other contingency. [302 E-F, H to 303A] (b). Further, the grantees were expressly precluded from alienating the inams or any portion of their income by mortgage or otherwise, thus making a distinction between the inam and the income. The definition of 'Bhil Naik Inam' makes it clear that the grants were of the villages or lands and not of the income or revenue. The conclusion that there was a transfer of land itself is strengthened by the provision in the sanad that the Secretary of State had reserved to himself all the rights which he had to all the mines and minerals and all powers for working and exploring them as he liked. [303 A-C] Lakhamgouda Basavorabhu Sardesai v. Baswantrao and Others, A.I.R. 1931 P.C. 157, applied.
 First Appeal No. 326 of 1953 of Bombay High Court, approved.
