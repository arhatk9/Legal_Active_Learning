 The appellants were upgraded from the post of Sub-Inspectors to Inspectors of taxation in the former State of Punjab on 1st April, 1966. They were allocated to the State of Himachal Pradesh on 1st November, 1966, the appointed day tinder the Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966. The respondents were Excise SubInspectors in Himachal Pradesh on that date.
 On 14th February, 1967, the Central Government gave instructions for equating posts for the purpose of integration in the services. On the 26th April, 1969, the Central Government wrote to the State Government that 45 posts of Excise and Taxation SubInspectors in Himachal Pradesh may be abolished and in their place 33 posts of Excise and Taxation Inspectors may be created. The State Government gave effect to the directions of the Central Government and upgraded the Excise Sub-Inspectors to Inspectors, with effect from 1st May, 1969. Thus, the upgrading was done with the sanction of the Central Government in accordance with the provisions of s. 82(6) of the Act. On 29th May, 1971 the State of Himachal Pradesh, by an executive decision. changed the date of upgrading of the respondents from 1st May, 1969 to 1st April, 1966.
 The State prepared two seniority lists in one of which one of the appellants was mentioned along with the officers of Himachal Pradesh, and in the other, the other appellants were shown as juniors to the officers of Himachal Pradesh.
 The State Government also appointed four Excise Inspectors of Himachal Pradesh as Assistant Excise and Taxation Officers.
 The appellants challenged (a) the change in the date of promotion of the officers of Himachal Pradesh to 1st April, 1966, (b) the two seniority lists and (c) the four promotions as Assistant Excise and Taxation Officers.
 The High Court set aside the two seniority lists and the four promotions and gave the following directions regarding the preparation of seniority lists, namely, (i) that the appellants should be equated with the Inspectors of Himachal Pradesh that is. that all inspectors of Himachal Pradesh should be taken as Excise and Taxation Inspectors and that their cadre should be taken as 'joint; (ii) that the date of continuous appointment in an equated post shall govern the seniority' (iii) that specific approval of the Central Government is to be taken under s. 82(6) if the date of upgradation is to be fixed as 1st April, 1966; and (iv) that the rules of promotion to the posts of Assistant Excise and Taxation Officers should be prepared after getting the approval of the Central Government.
 In appeal to this Court, the appellants contended that the directions given regarding the preparation of seniority lists should be set aside, on the ground that the appellants were deprived of their quota of promotion under r.6 of Class 111-A Punjab Rules, 1956, that the posts of Excise Inspectors and Taxation Inspectors belonged to different cadres, that the appellants belonged to the Taxation Cadre, and that for promotion under the Punjab Rules, 3 years continuous service as Inspectors was sufficient.
 
HELD : (1) If the State Government of Himachal Pradesh wished to change the date of upgradation to 1st April, 1966 the State Government cannot do so without the sanction of the Central Government under s. 82(6) of the Act. The State of Himachal Pradesh not only set at naught the direction of the 908 Central Government, but by giving a retrospective validation to the date upgradation, changed the conditions of services of the appellants to their disadvantage. Hence the direction 'that if the State Government wanted to alter the date of upgradation of posts of Himachal Pradesh Sub- Inspectors to 1st April, 1966, the sanction of the Central Government should have been obtained is correct. [912 D-E, 913 H] (2) The other direction given by the High Court that the rules for promotion .to. the post of Excise and Taxation Inspector shall be finalised after getting the approval of the Central Government is also correct. [913 H] (3) If the State Government wishes to equate the appellants with the Inspectors of Himachal Pradesh the State of Himachal Pradesh will have to follow the Provisions of the State Reorganisation Act in that behalf. The date .of continuous appointment of appellants and the respondents in the equated posts will also have to be in compliance with the provisions of the Act. The ,appellants were also not heard regarding equation of posts and with regard to the seniority lists. Therefore, all facts and circumstances affecting the service conditions of Inspectors of both the States will have to be placed by the State Government before the Central Government for the decision and approval of the latter under s. 82(6).
