 On October 26, 1962, the President issued a proclamation of Emergency which was later approved by both houses of Parliament. On the same day he promulgated the Defence of India Ordinance, 1962, and under s. 3 thereof the Central Government promulgated the Defence of India Rules, 1962. On November 3, 1962, the President issued an Order under Art, 359 (1) of the Constitution suspending the right of any person to move any Court for the enforcement of the rights conferred by Arts. 21 and 22 during the proclamation of emergency "if such person has been deprived of any such rights under the Defence of India Ordinance, 1962 or any rule made thereunder". On November 20, 1962, the respondent made an order under r. 30 of the Defence of India Rules for the detention of the petitioner. The petitioner moved the Supreme Court under Art. 32, challenging his detention. The respondent contended that the petition was not maintainable.
 The petitioner contended that the right to move the Supreme Court under Art. 32 being a guaranteed right could not be, and was not, suspended and that the President's Order suspending the right was ineffective as it was dependent on the continued existence of the Ordinance but the Ordinance had been repealed by the Defence of India Act, 1962.
 Held that the petition was not maintainable. Though the power of the Supreme Court to issue a writ in the nature of habeas corpus was not touched, the right of the petitioner to move the court for such a writ was suspended by the President's 443 Order. The Order did not suspend all the rights of a citizen to move the Supreme Court but only the rights under Arts. 21 and 22. Since his right to move the Court was suspended he was not entitled to challenge the vires of the Act and of the Rules. The repeal of the Ordinance by the Defence of India Act, 1962, did not make the President's Order ineffective. By virtue of the saving clause in s. 48 of the Act "any rules made anything done or any action taken" under the Ordinance shall be deemed to have been made, done or taken under the Act . Further, the reference to the Ordinance in the President's Order was, by virtue of s. 8 of the General Clauses Act, to be read\ as a- reference to the Act. The word "instrument" in s. 8 included the President's Order.
