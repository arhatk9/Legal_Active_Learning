HELD : The Legislature has, by providing in the opening part of a. 63(1) of the Act, "Except as may otherwise be prescribed", made the provision subject to the rules framed under s. 68, and a rule conferring authority to countersign the permit in so far as it relates to another region, upon the R.T.A. who issues the permit is made, in r. 63(a). The power to frame the rules is expressly granted by s. 68, and the exercise of that power for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of the Act, is not subject to any other implied limitations. Therefore r. 63 must prevail over s. 63.
