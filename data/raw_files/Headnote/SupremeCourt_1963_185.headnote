 On a complaint the appellant decided to hold a departmental enquiry against the respondent, suspended him and served a notice calling upon him to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken on the following charges; (i) Meeting the Deputy Director, Administration, C.P.W.D., at his residence without neccssary permission, (ii) Voluntarily expressing regret at his not having brought sweets from Calcutta for the Deputy Director's Children, (iii) Offering a currency note which from size and colour appeared to be a hundred rupee note as bribe with the intention of presuading Deputy Director, Shri Rajagopalan to support his representation regarding his seniority to the U.P.S.C., (iv) violation of Rule 3 of the C. C. B. (Conduct Rules). The respondent tendered his explanation and on enquiry, the charges were not found proved. The appellant considered the enquiry report and provisionally came to the conclusion that the respondent should be dismissed and accordingly issued a second notice against him. The respondent submitted his explanation to this notice. At that stage, his case was referred to the Union Public Service Commission. The Commission advised the appellant that none of the penalties could be inflicted on the respondent. The appellant considered the matter afresh and remitted it back to the commission to reconsider it again. The Commission, on re- examining the matter adhered to its earlier views 719 and conveyed them to the appellant. The appellant considered the whole case again and dismissed the respondent from service. The respondent then moved a writ petition in the High Court under Arts. 226 and 311 for quashing the said order of dismissal. The petition was dismissed by the learned single Judge. The respondent then preferred Letters Patent Appeal before the Division Bench of the High Court.
 The appeal was allowed and his dismissal was set aside. In this Court two questions of law arose for consideration, namely (1) whether Government is competent to differ from the findings of fact recorded by the enquiry officer who has been entrusted with the work of holding a departmental en- quiry against a delinquent Government servant under r. 55 of the Civil Services Rules and (2) whether the High Court in dealing with a writ petition filed by a Government Officer who has been dismissed from service is entitled to hold that the conclusion reached by the Government in regard to his misconduct is not supported by any evidence at all. The appellant mainly contended that if it acted bona fide, the High Court would not be justified in interfering with its conclusions though the High Court may feel that the said conclusions are based on no evidence.
 Held, that on principle, neither findings recorded by the enquiry officer, nor hisrecommendations are binding on the Government and therefore,the constitutional safeguard afforded by Art. 311(2) cannotbe said to have been contravened by the appellant.
 The Secretary ofState for India v. 1. M. La, [1945] F.C.R. 103, High Commissioner for India and High Commissioner for Pakistan v. I. M. Lal, 75 I.A. 225, Khem Chand v. Union of India, [1957] INSC 113; [1958] S.C.R. 1080, State of Assam v. Bimal Kumar Pandit, [1964] 2. S.C.R. I and A. N. D'Silva v. Union of India, [19621 Supp. I S.C.R. 968, referred to.
 In dealing with writ petition filed by public servants who have been dismissed or otherwise dealt with so as to attract Art. 311(2), the High Court under Art. 226 has jurisdiction to enquire whether the conclusion of the Government on which the impugned order of dismissal rests is not supported by any evidence at all.
 It cannot be held, that if mala fides are not alleged and bona fides are assumed in favour of the appellant, its conclusion on a question of fact cannot be successfully challenged even if it is manifest that there is no evidence to support it.
 In the present case, there is no evidence on the record to sustain the finding of the appellant that charge no. 3 has been proved against the respondent.
