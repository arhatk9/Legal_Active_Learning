 16 persons constituted a partnership firm under an agreement dated 19-5-1930. Out of the 16 partners, 3 were outsiders and 13 were members of 3 Hindu Undivided Families. Though the firm consisted of 3 Hindu Undivided Families, the income tax assessment till 1939-40 was on all the 16 individuals.
 From 1939-40 to 1941-42, the Income Tax Department assessed the 13 persons not as individuals but as 3 Hindu Undivided Families. on the basis of a settlement betweer, them and the department. After 1941-42, all the 16 persons were to be individually assessed. Nevertheless, the Income Tax Officer proceeded to make the asessment as though the 3 Hindu Undivided Families still continued. The members of the Hindu Undivided Families disputed this and on appeal, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal directed that the assessment for the year 1943-44 had to be made or, each individual partner. In respect of the year 1944-45, the I.T.O. had, meanwhile, assessed the 3 H.U. Families as Hindu Undivided Families by declaring the cases of the individuals as cases of "No assessment". These assessments were, however, set aside by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner according to the directions given by the Tribunal earlier.
 After receipt of the orders of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner the I.T.O. issued notices under s. 34 to all the 13 persons in April 1954. By that time, the Indian Income-tax (Amendment) Act 1953, which amended s. 34(a) became operative retrospectively from 1-4-1952. The notices under s. 34 were served on 8th April 1954 and the assessments were made on 31-1-1955 on the footing that under that Section, there was no time limit. Both the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and Tribunal dismissed the appeals filed by the assessees. These assessments were, however, set aside by the Appellate Assistant Commis(i) whether, having regard to the directions given by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, and having regard to the second proviso to Section 34(3) as amended, the reassessment made by the I.T.O. on 31-1-1955 is, governed by any limitation period, such as mentioned in s. 34(3).
 (2)In respect of 4 other assessees, who furnished individual returns, "whether the remedy available to the I.T.O. had already become time-barred under s. 34 before that Section wag amended in 1953 with retrospective effect." The High Court answered the questions in the affirmative and hence, the appeals before this Court.
 
HELD:(i) The direction given by the Tribunal on 31-3-53 was in respect of the assessment for 1943-44. The I.T.O.
 had even before that date, assessed the three units as H.U.F., for 1944-45 and passed an order of 'No assessment' in respect of the individuals. For that year also, all of them had filed their returns as individuals. Therefore, there was no question of omission or failure to make a return or to disclose fully all material facts necessary for their assessment and escapement of assessment was not due to any such fact but due to the action of the I.T.O. assessing non-existent Hindu Undivided Families and passing an order of 'No assessment' in respect of individuals. Section 34(1)(a) cannot, therefore, apply and only section 34(1) (b) can apply. [395D-F] (i)As regards the application of the second proviso to s.
 34(3), it applies only to the three individuals (Narayandas, Meghraj and Hanumandas) who filed returns as individuals but who had been assessed as Hindu Undivided Families and who were before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the Tribunal 392 but not to other eight respondents who were not parties to the proceedings and there was no Hindu Undivided Families at that time-all these eight persons having filed their returns as individuals. [395F-396C] I.T.O. v. Murlidhar Bhagwan Das, [1964] 52 I.T.R. 325, referred to.
 The right of the I.T.O. to assess these persons can be upheld only if the notice under the substantive part of s.
 34 can be said to be a valid notice. The assessment year being 1944-45, the notice under s. 34 issued in April 1954 was beyond the period of 4 years under s. 34(1)(b) and so, the second proviso to s. 34(3) does not apply to them.
 [397A-B] (iii)The effect of the amendment of s. 34 in 1953 is not to enable the I.T.O. to take action under that Section where the period mentioned therein had expired before 1.4.1952. In the case of the 3 assessees, however s. 34(3) would apply, whether it is the old proviso or the proviso introduced in 1953. [398D-F] S.C. Prashar v. Vasantsen Dwarkadas, [1956] 29 I.T.R. 857 and J. P. Jani, I.T.O. v. Inuduprasad Devshanker Bhatt, [1969] 72 I. T. R. 595 and Income Tax Officer v. T. S.
