 By an agreement, the State Trading Corporation appointed the appellant as its selling agent for cement. A term of the agreement was that the agent shall collect State or inter-State sales tax on the sale of cement and pay the same in accordance with law. The appellant paid the sales tax on its annual turnover to the Sales Tax Authorities.
 Later, however, it filed an appeal stating that it was not a dealer and, as such, was not liable to pay any tax, but that was dismissed. Its appeal to the Appellate Tribunal and later revision application before the High Court were dismissed.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court.

 HELD : (1) The contention that the appellant being an agent of the State Trading Corporation, it was not a dealer as defined in s. 2(b) of the Central Sales Tax Act and hence was not liable to pay any sales-tax thereunder has no substance. Having realised the sales-tax from the various customers and voluntarily paid it as per the return submitted it was ill-advised to take an inconsistent stand of its not being liable to pay sales tax under the Central Sales Tax Act. [853F-G] (2) From a reading of the terms of the agreement it is abundantly clear that sale was made by the appellant-company as it effected transfer of property in the goods to the customers and realised the sale price from them by issuing invoices in its own name. The restricted definition of the term "dealer" defined in the Central Sales Tax Act is not wide enough to cover all kinds of agents such as a broker or a commission agent simpliciter. The term "dealer" defined in the Central Act, would, however, include a del credre agent or a mercantile agent who earries on the business of buying or selling goods not as an agent simpliciter on behalf of the disclosed principal but as a principal vis-a-vis its customers. [855F-H] Kandula Radhakrishna Rao and others v. The Province of Madras represented by the Collector of West Godavari, Eluru and another, A.I.R. 1952 Madras 718, approved.
 In the instant case it was the appellant company which carried on the business of selling cement aithough it was acting as selling agent of the Corporation. The Corporation was not a dealer which effectedl the sales but it was the company which did so.
