 In exercise of the powers conferred under s. 3(1) and (3) of the, West Bengal (Prevention of Violent Activities) Act, 1970 the District Megistrate passed an order detaining the petitioner with a view to prevent him from acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. The grounds of detention were that he along with his associate attacked the Railway Police Force with bombs and created disturbance of public order. After his arrest the case was referred to the Advisory Board and the Board, after considering the entire material before it, reported to the State Government that there was sufficient cause for the detention of the petitioner. On the same day he sent a representation that he may be heard in person which the Board received two days later. The Board however heard him, found no reason to revise its opinion, and sent a supplementary report to that effect.
 The petitioner challenged the detention in this Court.
 Dismissing the petition, 
HELD: (1) The question whether a person has only committed a breach of law and order or has acted in a manner likely to Cause disturbance of the public order is one of degree and the extent of the reach. of the act upon society. The act by itself is not determinative of its own gravity. In its quality it may not differ from another but in its potentiality it may be very different. Similar acts in different contexts effect differently law and order on the one hand and public order on the other. It is always a question of degree of the harm and its effect on the community. In the final analysis it depends on the facts of each, case whether the acts prepetrated are such a nature of potentiality.

Commissioner of Police, Calcutta and another [1969] INSC 339; A.I.R. 1970 S.C. 8.14 and Nagendra Nath Mondal v. The State of West Bengal, [1972] S.C.R. 498 and Arun Ghosh v. State W. Bengal, A.I.R. 1970 S.C. 1228, referred to.
 In the present case, the acts attributed to the petitioner are such as would bring them within the ambit of s. 3(2) (b) and (d) of the Act. Attacking the Railway Police, Force party with bombs at the railway station was bound to cause scare among all the members of the public who would be resorting to the station yard and interfere with their acti- vities in getting the goods loaded or unloaded. The acts had the potentiality of affecting the even tempo of the life of the community in the locality by their reverberations.
 Therefore, the grounds communicated to the petitioner disclosed that he indulged in an activity which was prejudicial to the maintenance of public order [491 G-H, 492A-B] 489 (2) Section II of the Act provides that the Advisory Board may give personal hearing if it considers it essential or if the person concerned desires to be heard. In this case, the. Board did not consider it essential to hear the petitioner in person before submitting its report. But when petitioner sent a representation that he may be heard in person the Board heard him before submitting the supplementary report. Therefore, the petitioner cannot contend that he was not personally heard before the Board submitted its opinion. [492E-G]
