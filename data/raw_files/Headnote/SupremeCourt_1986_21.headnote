 600 metric tonnes of tin plates worth about Rs.60 lakhs were seized from the respondent-firm. Prosecution was launched by the State Government against the respondents under ss.7 and 8 of the Essential Commodities Act 1955 for violation of paragraph 3(2) of the West Bengal Declaration of Stocks and Prices of Essential Commodities Order 1977 and under ss.120B and 420 of the Indian Penal Code 1860. Show cause notices for confiscation of the seized goods were also issued by the Additional Collector under s.6A of the Act.
 In the Writ Petition under Article 226 before the High Court the respondents moved an application for release of the seized goods which was rejected by a Single Judge. In appeal the Division Bench set aside the interlocutory order of the Single Judge and directed the release of the seized goods to the respondents on their furnishing of a bank guarantee of Rs.5 lakhs in the form of fixed deposit recepits and also on furnishing security of immovable property being 0.71 acre of land situate at Police Station Titaghur District 24 pargana.
 Allowing the appeal of the State to this Court, ^ 
 HELD: 1. Although the powers of the High Court under Art.226 are far and wide and the Judges must ever be vigilant to protect the citizens against arbitrary executive action, nonetheless, the Judges have a constructive role and therefore, there is always the need to use such extensive powers with due circumspection. There has to be in the larger public interest an element of self-ordained restraint. It was distressing that despite a long line of decisions of Supreme Court deprecating the cursory manner of passing such interlocutory orders for the mere asking, the High Court 365 should have passed the impugned order in the manner that it did. [370 C-D; 367 B-C] 
 2. The ad interim order of the Division Bench of the High Court was illegal and invalid. The result of the order was that the respondents under threat of contempt secured release of valuable seized material practically furnishing little or no security. The observations of the Division Bench which had the effect of prejudging the whole issue before the Single Judge who was seized of the writ petition, as also foreclosing the trial of the respondents for commission of the alleged offences had also no legality and propriety.
