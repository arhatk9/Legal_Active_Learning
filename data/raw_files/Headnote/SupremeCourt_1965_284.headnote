 Searches were carried out in the appellants' premises by the Superintendent of Customs and Central Excise Nagpur. The authority to search was given by the Assistant Collector of Customs and Central Excise Nagpur under Rule 126 L(2) of the Defence of India Rules, 1963 for the purpose of seizing gold held in contravention of the Rules and also connected documents. The documents seized during the search were re- tained by the Superintendent at Nagpur for 8 days and were then sent to Delhi temporarily for the purpose of translation by the Departmental Hindi Officer. While the documents were at Delhi the Collector of Customs Nagpur on September 6, 1963 made an order of seizure under s. 110(3) of the Customs Act purporting to seize the aforesaid documents from the possession of the Superintendent. On September 11, 1963, the Collector made another similar order purporting to seize the said documents from the Assistant Collector to whom, he believed, they had been transferred by the Superintendent. The appellants challenged inter alia the legality of the seizure of the documents by the Superintendent and the orders of seizure made by the Collector, before the High Court. Their writ petitions having been dismissed they appealed to this Court by special leave.
 The questions that came up for consideration were : (1) Whether the officer authorised under Rule 126L(2) could seize documents by exercising his additional powers under Rule 156. (2) Whether the Collector of Customs was a 'proper officer' for the purpose of ordering seizure of documents under s. 110(3) of the Customs Act. (3) Whether the order under s. 110(3) was legally effective in view of the fact that the documents in question were not in the physical possession of the Superintendent or the Assistant Collector of Central Excise. (4) Whether the power under s. 105 of the Customs Act was a general power or a power to seize only specified documents. (5) Whether the documents in question could be said to have been 'secreted' within the meaning of s. 105.
 
HELD : (i) The power granted under Rule 156 is an ancillary or incidental power for making effective seizure of suspected gold. In other words the power granted under Rule 156 is the power to take such action as may be necessary for seizing prohibited gold, and does not include the power of seizure of documents which is not an ancillary or incidental power. This view is borne out by the Seventh Amendment of the Defence of India Rules on June 24, 1963. by this arsenates power to 992 seize documents has been expressly conferred under Rule 126L(1) and (3) without conferring similar power under Rule 126L(2). The Super. intendent of Central Excise, could not therefore seize the documents b) authority given under the said Rule. [997 G] (ii) However the appellants were not entitled to the grant of a writ because there was a valid order for seizure of the documents on September 11, 1963 by the Collector of.Customs under s. 110(3) of the Customs Act. Under the said Sub-section documents relevant to the proceedings under the Act can be seized by the 'proper officer'. [999 C] (iii) A Collector of Central Excise is a 'proper officer' within the meaning of s. 2(34) of the Customs Act.
 [1000 E] (iv) The fact that on September 6 and 11, 1963, when the two orders under s. 110(3) were passed the goods were in Delhi and not in the physical possession of the officers from whose possession they were purported to be seized did not affect the validity of the orders. Though the documents had been sent to Delhi, the Superintendent of Excise was still, in legal possession of them for he had the right to control the use of the documents and to exclude persons who should or should not have access to the documents. The legal position is that at Delhi the documents were in possession of a bailer for the limited purpose of examination and translation of the documents but the legal possession was still with the Superintendent. [1000 H-1001 B] Ancona v. Rogers, (1876) 1 Ex.D.285 and United States of America v. Dollfus Mieg it Compagnie S.A. and Bank of England [1952] 1 All ER. 572, relied on.
 From the above it would follow that the Collector by his order of seizure dated September 6, 1963 or September 11, 1963 could transfer the legal possession of the documents to himself. The legal effect of the order of seizure made by the Collector was the transfer of the legal possession of the documents from the Superintendent or the Assistant Collector. to the Collector. Such a change of possession need not necessarily involve physical transfer of possession if it was not possible at that stage, but as a matter of law on and from the date of seizure the Collector exercised the full incidents of possession over the documents. The fact that the documents were retained at Delhi for a specific purpose will not affect the legality of the order of seizure. [1001 F-H] Gian Chand v. State of Punjab, [1962] Supp. 1 S.C.R. 364 and Vinter v. Hind, (1882) 10 Q.B. 62, distinguished.
 (v), It cannot be said that the documents have not been 'secreted within the meaning of s. 105 of the Customs Act unless they are hidden or concealed. In the context of the section the word means 'documents which are not kept in the normal or usual place' or it may even mean 'documents or things which are likely to be secreted'; in other words documents or things which a person is likely to keep out of the way or to put in a place where the officer of the law cannot find it. [1005 F-G] The power to search granted under s. 105 of the Customs Act is a power of general search and it is not necessary for its exercise that the authorisation should specify the documents for which search is to be made. But it is essential that before this power is exercised the preliminary conditions required by the section must be strictly satisfied that is, the officer concerned must have reason to believe that any documents or things which-in his opinion are relevant for any proceeding under the Act are secreted in the place searched.
