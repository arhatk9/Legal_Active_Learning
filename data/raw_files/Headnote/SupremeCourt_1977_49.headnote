 Words and Phrases--"in respect of"--Meaning of.
 Under s- 2(d) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act,' 1947 foreign exchange means foreign currency. Section 4(1) prohibits the sale or purchase of foreign exchange by a person other than an authorised dealer except with the permission of the Reserve Bank. Section 23(1)(a) prescribes a penalty for contravention of s. 4. Section 23(1B) pro- vides that, in addition to the penalty which may be imposed for such contravention, a court may direct that any curren- cy or any other money or property in respect of which the contravention has taken place shall be confiscated to the Central Government. The explanation to this sub-section provides that for the purpose of the sub-section property in respect of which contravention has taken place shall include deposits in a bank where the said property is converted into such deposits.
 A large sum of Indian currency which was the sale pro- ceeds of foreign currencY, was recovered from the respond- ent. In addition to imposing a penalty. the Director of Enforcement confiscated the Indian currency seized from the respondent. In a petition under art. 226 of the Constitu- tion, the High Court held that the Director of Enforcement had no competence to order confiscation of Indian. currency because the contravention had taken place in respect of some foreign currency and not in respect of the Indian currency seized.
 Allowing the appeal, 
 HELD: The currency in respect of which there has been con- travention covers the sale proceeds of foreign currency, sale of which is prohibited under s. 4(1). [954H] The High Court was wrong in quashing the order of confis- cation. The intention of the legislature is clear from the Explanation to s. 23(1B). If, for this sub-section any property in respect of which a contravention has taken place includes deposits into which the property may be converted and can be reached, even where the deposits are in a bank, it is not reasonable to hold that the sale proceeds in Indian currency of foreign exchange would be outside the scope of s. 23(1B) and, therefore not liable to be confis- cated. [955 A] The words "in respect of" admit of a wide connotation.
 In the context of s . 23 (1b) "in respect of" has been used in the sense of being" connected with". [954 G] Cuperd's Trustees v. Inland Revenue Commissioners 174 L.T. Rep. 133 and S.S. Light Railway Co. Ltd. v. Upper Doab Sugar Mills Ltd. & Anr. [1960) 2 S.C.R. 926 referred to.
