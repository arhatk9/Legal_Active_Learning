 The Government of Andhra Pradesh issued a Notification under Section 4 sub-sec. (1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 for acquiring certain land for the purpose of the Hyderabad Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and published it in the Andhra Pradesh Gazette on 4th August, 1977. Public notice of the substance of the Notification was given at convenient places in the locality, after a period of about 2 months, on 3rd Oct., 1977. On 10.1.1979, the State Government issued another Notification under Section 6 of the Act excluding some land and declaring that the remaining area af land was needed for the purpose of HUDA. The Land Acquisition Officer made an Award on 27th July 1981 and issued notices to the respondents to deliver possession of the land comprised in the area notified under Section 6 of the Act. The respondents challenged the validity of the aforesaid Notifications in a writ petition before the High Court. The High Court, following an earlier Full Bench decision dated 3rd December, 1982, allowed the writ petition on the ground that local publication of the substance of the Notification under sec. 4 sub-sec.(1) was not made on the same day on which the Notification was published in the Official Gazette and, therefore, the Notification under Section 4 sub-sec.(1) was invalid and the Notification under Section 4 sub-section (1) being the foundation of the jurisdiction to proceed further with the acquisition, the Notification under Section 6 must also fail.
 153 Subsequent to the delivery of the judgment by the High Court, the Supreme Court in Deepak Pahwa v. Lt. Governor Delhi Ors. [1984] INSC 149; [1984] 4 SCC 308 held that there is nothing in sub-sec. (1) of Section 4 which requires that the publication in the Official Gazette and public notice in the locality must be simultaneous or immediately after one another, but there should not be a large gap between publication in the Gazette and public notice in the locality as would be indicative of break in the continuity of action.
 However, before the decision in Deepak Pahwa's case, the Andhra Pradesh Legislature passed the Land Acquisition (Andhra Pradesh Amendment (Validation) Act 1983 (For short, the Amending Act) with retrospective effect from 12th Sept., 1975. Sub-section (1) of section 4 of the Act after the amendment provided that the collector shall, within forty days from the date of publication of such Notification, cause public notice of the substance of such Notification to be given at convenient places in the locality.
 In appeals to the Supreme Court, the appellant argued (i) that the Legislature proceeded on the assumption that the Full Bench Judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court represented the correct law on the subject and it was on that assumption that the Amending Act was enacted by the Legislature. If, on the Full Bench Judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court being reversed by the Supreme Court in Deepak pahwa's case, the assumption made by the Legislature turned out to be incorrect and it was found that the Legislature proceeded on an erroneous view of the law in enacting the Amending Act, the Amending Act, must be considered superfluous and not the Amending Act, but the correct law as it prevailed prior to the Amending Act must be applied; and (ii) that the legislature enacted the Amending Act for the purpose of validating acquisitions made after 12th September, 1975 which were liable to be declared invalid on account of the Full Bench Judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court and it could never have been the intention of the Legislature to invalidate, acquisitions which were valid when made and therefore section 2 of the Amending Act which introduced the amendment in sub-s. (1) of sec. 4 should not be read as having retrospective effect, but should be construed as prospective in operation.
 Dismissing the appeals, ^ 
 HELD: (i) The retrospective amendment made by the Amending Act in sec. 4 sub-sec. (1) of the Act completely invalidates the Notifications under sec. 4 sub-s. (1) and sec. 6 issued by the 154 Andhra Pradesh Government and the Judgment of the High Court quashing these Notifications has therefore to be sustained though on a ground different from that which found favour with the High Court. Whatever be the reason for which the Legislature enacted the amending Act, the Amending Act is on the Statute book and is in force with effect from 12th Sept., 1975 and it must be given effect according to the plain natural meaning of its words. There can be no ground for denying to the amendment in sub-s. (1) of sec. 4 retrospective effect, which sub-s. (3) of sec. 1 of the Amending Act expressly directs that it shall have. In fact, there is no inconsistency between the mandate of sub-s. (1) of sec. 4 and the law as declared by Supreme Court in Deepak Pahwa's Case. What the amended sub-sec. (1) of sec. 4 does is to legislatively lay down the limit of the time gap beyond which it must be presumed that there is a break in the continuity of action. [155 B-C; 159 F-G; 160 C-D] 1. (ii) The requirement laid down in sub-s. (1) of sec.
 4 as it stood from and after 12th Sept., 1975 would obviously apply to every Notification under sub-s. (1) of sec. 4 issued by the appropriate Government on or after 12th Sept., 1975. If in case a Notification issued under sec. 4 sub-sec. (1) on or after 12th Sept., 1975 public notice of the substance of such Notification is not given in the locality within forty days from the date of publication of such notification in the Official Gazette, it would introduce a fatal infirmity invalidating such notification.
