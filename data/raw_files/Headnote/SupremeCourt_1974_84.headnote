 The three appellants and two others were convicted for an offence under s. 3021149, I.P.C. and sentenced to imprisonment for life by the High Court, affirming the judgment of the trial court.
 Dismissing the appeal by special leave, 
HELD : (1) In in appeal under Art. 136 of the Constitution this Court is \cry slow to interfere with the concurrent conclusions of the two courts below \with regard to appreciation of evidence of the witnesses. The accused must be able to make Out an extraordinary case of gross and palpable injustice to induce this Court to take a view contrary to that arrived at by the High Court [893 E] (2)The evidence disclosed that the live accused were members of an unlawful assembly with the common object to kill the deceased. The manner ill which the defence was conducted in the trial court shows that the accused were not prejudiced by the use of the word 'beat' in the charge. [893 G-894 D] (3)Even if the accused were originally members of unlawful assembly with the common object of only hearing the deceased they would be guilty under s. 302 read with the second limb of s. 149. Since they came armed with deadly weapons and knew that by using those deadly weapons upon the deceased death would be caused. This is not a case where something foreign. or unknown to the original object had taken place all of a sudden. Even assuming that the unlawful assembly was formed originally only to beat, it is clearly established in the evidence that the said object is well- knit with what followed as the dangerous finale of the beating. It 'was the execution of the same common object which assumed the fearful character implicit in the illegal' action undertaken by the five accused. [894 F-G; 895 A-E] K.C. Mathew and others v. The State of Travancore-Cochin [1955] 3 S.C.R. 1057, followed.
 (4) There is no circumstance in the case which can bring it under s. 304' I.P.C. [894G]
