 The Defence Research and Development Organisation (R & D) was set up under the Ministry of Defence for carrying out scientific and technological research and development work on projects of vital importance to the defence forces. Its personnel consist of large number of civilian scientists as well as a smaller number of service officers drawn from the three wings of the Armed Forces who have operational experience of weapon systems.
 The policy followed in regard to the intake of service officers was that they were initially taken on a tenure basis and subsequently absorbed in the organisation on a permanent basis in the event of being found suitable and willing. Since the Officers from the three services came to the R & D cadre with different lengths of service and at different levels, it became imperative to evolve a reasonable principle for the determination of their inter-se seniority after their secondment to the organisation.
 In November 1979 in supersession of all previous Rules and Orders on the subject, rules were made under the proviso to Art. 309 laying down the procedure for the intake of service officers in the R & D organisation and the terms and conditions of service of those permanently retained therein.
 Rule 16 dealt with "Seniority after permanent secondment" and provided that "seniority of all service Officers permanently seconded to DRDO will continue to be based upon their seniority of substantive rank of Major/Sqn. Ldr./Lt.
 Cdr..........and the 454 seniority of officers with substantive ranks higher than Major/Sqn. Ldr./Lt. Cdr. will after their permanent secondment also reckon vis-a-vis other officers in the R & D Cadre, for future promotion/confirmation, from the date of their substantive rank of Major/Sqn. Ldr./Lt. Cdr.........
 ".
 The appellant who was commissioned in the Air Force was seconded to the service. In his writ petition he contended that the principle for determination of seniority laid down in Rule 16 was arbitrary and violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution, and as he had been permanently seconded to the R & D Organisation in 1971 long prior to the proclamation of the rule his rights regarding seniority and promotion could not be affected by the provisions of this rule. By taking the date of substantive appointment to the rank of Major/ equivalent as the basis for reckoning seniority, officers who had obtained substantive promotions to higher ranks in the parent service earlier than some of their seniors who were only subsequently promoted to such higher ranks, suffer serious prejudice because the latter gain over the earlier promotees and supersede them in the matter of seniority in the R & D Organisation, and that subsequent inductees in the R & D Organisation cannot be legally assigned seniority above those already borne on the cadre, irrespective of the substantive rank held by them at the time of their intake into the R & D.
 The Single Judge rejected all the contentions and declined to grant relief. The R & D Organisation was however directed to issue the tentative seniority list drawn up in accordance with Rule 16. The Letters Patent Appeal filed by the appellant was dismissed in limine.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, ^ 
 HELD: 1. Since officers from different sources are taken into the R & D Organisation for meeting the discipline-wise requirements arising therein from time to time and they are brought into a common pool on such permanent secondment, a reasonable principle had to be evolved for fixation of inter se seniority within the R & D cadre. The principle adopted under Rule 4 of reckoning seniority with reference to the date of attainment of the rank of substantive Major/equivalent strikes a reasonable mean as it ensures to all the service officers in the R & D the fixation of seniority in the integrated cadre giving full credit to the length of service put in by them in their respective parent services. [466 C; 466 H; 467 A] 
 2. It is settled law that the service conditions pertaining to seniority are liable to alteration by subsequent changes that may be introduced in the rules and except to the extent of protecting promotions that have already been earned under the previous rules, the revised rules will operate to govern seniority and future promotion prospects. There is, therefore, no substance in the argument advanced by the appellant that it was not open to the Government of India to introduce a new principle of seniority by promulgation of Rule 16 so as to affect his rights for future promotion. [463 D-E] 
 3. A statement contained in the statute or statutory rule of the factual background leading up to the enactment has ordinarily to be accepted and acted upon by the court as wholly correct. [463 A] 455 
 4. Rule 16 contains a categorical declaration that in the past also the seniority of service officers permanently seconded to the R & D Organisation was being reckoned on the basis of their dates of attainment of substantive rank of Major/Sqn. Ldr./Lt. Cdr. subject to any penalty/loss of seniority that an officer might suffer subsequently. It is therefore not possible to accept the contention of the appellant that prior to the coming into force of the rule be had acquired a vested right to have his seniority in the R & D reckoned with reference to the date of his permanent secondment and to have all Officers joining the organisation on subsequent dates ranked only below him. [462 G-H; 463 B- C] 
 5. The structure and composition of the Organisation have necessarily to undergo rapid, qualitative and quantitative changes in the light of the fast developments that take place in science technology and international relations. The intake of service Officers is not on the basis of any general selection from service cadres. As and when the Organisation finds it necessary to obtain the service of officers with operational experience in any particular weapon system or other scientific discipline the parent service is requested to spare for deputation suitable hands in the particular branch or speciality and initially they are taken on a tenure basis. There is a selection only in a very limited sense that the suitability of the concerned officer is adjudged before he is taken but the claims or merits of others are not considered. The secondment of such officers to the R & D Organisation is not therefore, effected on the basis of a general selection.
 Officers who are senior in the parent service in relation to the person who is seconded and who may possess greater experience and superior attainment might not have been considered for secondment when their juniors in the service were seconded to the R & D Organisation, because the parent service might not have been in the position at the relevant point of time to spare the services of the former. [463 G-H;
 464 A-E] 
 6. Where persons from different sources are drafted to serve in a new service a just and wholesome principle commonly applied is that the pre existing length of service in the parent department should be respected and preserved by taking the same into account in determining their ranking in the new service cadre. Such a provision does not involve any discrimination violative of Article 16 of the Constitution. [470 E] R.S. Makashi & Ors. v. I.M. Menon & Ors., [1981] INSC 199; [1982] 1 S.C.C. 379, referred to.
 
 7. The secondment of an officer from his parent service to the R & D is not a transfer to Central Service from a subordinate service or from another department. [469 G] 
 8. Rule 16 being statutory in origin, its validity cannot be affected by reason of any inconsistency with the provision of a prior executive order issued by the Central Government i.e. Office Memorandum dated July 22,1972.
 [469 H] 
 9. When a statutory rule governing seniority is issued in respect of a service, the said rule would govern the personnel in the service with effect from the date of its promulgation and in so giving effect to the rule in future, no element of retroactivity is involved. [470 G-H] 456 
 10. The promulgation of a statutory rule governing seniority is not a quasi-judicial function. It is the exercise of a legislative power and in respect thereof the principles of natural justice have no application at all.
