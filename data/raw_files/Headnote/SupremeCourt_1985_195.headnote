 The appellant was a tikka mazdoor-person who helps the Examiners of Coins and notes in the Reserve Bank of India, the 1st Respondent. He was selected in 1974 on daily wages basis and he had to report to the bank regularly in the morning to ascertain whether he could get work every-day. On days when no work was given he had to wait till noon to be told by the authorities concerned that no work was available. Thus, he had work only for four days in 1974, and one hundred and fifty four days in 1975, and one hundred and five days in 1976. At the time he was selected for employment, he was not a matriculate. He passed the matriculate examination in 1975. His name was struck off the list of Tikka Mazdoors as the confidential circular issued by the bank indicated that persons who passed the matriculation examination could not be retained in the list.
 As the appellant was not given any work after July 1976 and as there were no written order terminating his service and as attempts to get his grievances redressed by correspondence having failed he moved for conciliation. The Assistant Labour Commissioner though impressed with the genuineness of the claim of the appellant, could not persuade the bank. Thereupon, the Central Government referred the dispute for adjudication to the Central Government Industrial Tribunal.
 The appellant in his claim statement before the Tribunal, pleaded that he had presented himself for duty daily but was not 843 offered jobs on the days when he reported for duty for reasons best known to the bank, that he was employed for 4 days in 1974, 154 days in 1975 and 105 days in 1976, that he was not told at the time when he accepted the job that his name would be struck off from the rolls if he passed the matriculate examination and that he had worked continuously for 240 days if the Sundays and Holidays were taken into account, and that the action of the bank in striking out his name from the list amounted to retrenchment.
 The claim of the appellant was resisted by the Bank contending that the reference was had since the dispute was not sponsored by any representative trade union, that Section 2-A of the Industrial Disputes Act 1947 was not attracted, and also that the dispute in question was not an industrial dispute, that the appellant failed to inform the bank that he had passed the matriculation examination after getting selected and that he had not worked for 240 days in any year.
 The Tribunal held that the action of the Reserve Bank, in not giving regular appointment to the appellant was legal and proper and that his name could be struck off from the list of approved Tikka Mazdoors in terms of a proper and justifiable policy followed by the management of the Bank;
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: 1. Striking off the name of the appellant is clearly termination of his service and the dispute squarely comes within Section 2A of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The Tribunal grossly erred in upholding the preliminary objection raised by the Bank. [852 C] 
 2. Striking off the name of a workman from the rolls by the employer amounts to 'termination of service' and such termination is 'retrenchment' within the meaning of Sec.
 2(oo) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 if effected in violation of the mandatory provision contained in Sec. 25-F and in invalid. [850 F, 853 F-G] Delhi Cloth & General Mills Ltd. v. Shambhu Nath Mukherjee & Ors. [1977] INSC 185; [1978] 1 S.C.R. 591., State Bank of India v. Shri N. Sundra Money, [1976] INSC 3; [1976] 3 S.C.R. 160., referred to.
 In the instant case, the pleadings, documents and the confidential circular indicate that the Bank was determined to adopt methods to terminate the services of employees like the 844 appellant. The appellant was not told that he would be struck off the rolls if he passed matriculation. He was not given any order in writing either refusing work or informing him that his name would be struck off the rolls. The appellant's name had been struck off the list contrary to the mandate contained in Section 25F. [850 E,G] 
 3. The 5th Schedule to the Industrial Disputes Act contains a list of unfair labour practices as defined in sec. 2(ra), and to employ workmen as 'badlis casual or temporaries and to continue them as such for years, with the object of depriving them of the statue and privileges of permanent workmen' is one of them as indicated in Item 10.
 [852 F-G] 
 4. The Bank has deliberately indulged in unhealthy labour practice by rotating employees like the appellant to deny them benefits under the Industrial Law. It is disturbing to find that the appellant was denied job because he had become better qualified. [853 B-C] In the instant case, the confidential circular directed the officers that workmen like the appellant should not be engaged continuously but should as far possible, be offered work on rotation basis and the case that the appellant is a 'badli' worker, have to be characterised as an unfair labour practice.[852 H] 
 5. Industrial adjudication in bona fide claims have been dragged on by employers for years by raising technical and hyper technical pleas. It would always be desirable for employers to meet the case of the employees squarely on merits and get them adjudicated quickly. It is too late in the day for this Court to alert the employers that their attempt should be to evolve a contended labour. [853 D-E]
