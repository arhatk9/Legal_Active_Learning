 The assesses firm which carried on business at Calcutta in bullion despatched during the accounting year to Bikaner, where its partners resided, a certain quantity of silver bars and showed them a,; having been sold to the partners.
 The Income-tax authorities disbelieved the story of the sale and, treating the bars as stock-in-trade and valuing them at their market value at the close of the year which was much higher than the cost, assessed the firm's profits at Rs.
 2,20,887. The assessee contended that, even admitting that the bars were the stock-in-trade of the business, the increased value at the close of the year accrued at Bikaner and was exempt from tax in British India under s. 14(2)(c) of the Income-tax Act. The High Court held that the notional profit representing the appreciation in value of the stock-in-trade emerged out of the valuation and the profit accordingly arose at the time when, and at the place where, the valuation was made, and as the valuation was made at Calcutta s. 14(2)(c) did not apply and the profit was taxable. On appeal, 212 Held, that the view of the High Court that the profit &rose out of the valuation of the closing stock and the situs of its accrual or arising was therefore where the valuation was made, was erroneous. The conclusion of the High Court that the profit did not accrue in Bikaner but at Calcutta could, however, be supported on another ground, viz., that the source of the profit was the business and as the profit could be correctly ascertained according to the method adopted by the assessee only after bringing into the trading account his closing stock wherever it may exist, the whole of the profits must be taken to accrue or arise at the place of carrying on the business, viz., Calcutta, The principles underlying the method of ascertaining profits by valuation of stock at the beginning and close of the year and of the rule that the closing stock is to be valued at cost or market value, whichever is the lower, explained.
