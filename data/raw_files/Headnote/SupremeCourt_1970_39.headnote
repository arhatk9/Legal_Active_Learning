 The respondent filed complaints before the Magistrate at Meerut under s. 207 of the Companies Act, 1956 on an allegation of failure on the part of appellant,the director- incharge of a Company whose registered office was at Delhi, to pay the respondent dividends on shares held by him, although the dividends were declared by the company for the respective years. The appellant contended that the Magistrate at Meerut had no jurisdiction to try the complaints and that the Magistrate at Delhi where the registered office of the Company was situated had the jurisdiction. The Magistrate rejected the appellant's contention-on the ground that as the dividends had to be paid at the registered address of the respondent,Which was at Meerut, the Court, at Meerut had jurisdiction. This view \\,,as upheld in appeal by the Sessions Judge and in revision by the High ,Court. In appeal on certificate, this Court 
 HELD : The- Court at Delhi and not at Meerut was competent to try the offenses.
 It is clear from s. 205(5) that the company could pay dividend either in cash or by posting a cheque or a warrant at the registered address of the respondent. Article 132 of the Articles of Association also authorises the Company to pay dividend either in cash or by posting a cheque or it warrant to the shareholder at his registered address. The effect of Art. 132 is that when a dividend warrant is posted at the registered address of the shareholder that would be equivalent to payment. Once a warrant is so posted the company is deemed to have paid and discharged its obli- gation. The Articles of Association constitute an agreement between the ,company and the shareholders, and the latter are entitled to the payment of dividend in the manner laid down in the Articles and in that manner alone. Article 132 thus not only 'authorises the company to make the payment in the manner laid down therein but amounts to a request by the shareholders to be paid in, the manner so laid down. When, therefore, the company posts the dividend warrant at the registered address of a shareholder, that being done at the shareholder's request, the post office becomes the agent of the shareholder and the loss of a dividend warrant during transit thereafter is the risk of the shareholder. [793 F] That being the position, the place where a dividend warrant would be posted, is the, post office at such place being the agent of the shareholder, is the place where the obligation to pay the debt is discharged in the present case at Delhi where the company has its registered office. It follows that the offence under s. 207 of the Act would also occur at the place where the failure to discharge that obligation arises, namely, the failure to post the dividend warrant within 42 days. The venue of the offence, therefore, would be Delhi -and not Meerut, and the court competent to try the offence would be that court within whose jurisdiction the 789 offence takes place, i.e., Delhi. This should be so both in law and common sense, for, if held otherwise, the directors of companies can be prosecuted at hundreds of places on an allegation by shareholders that they have not received the warrant. That cannot be the intention of the legislature when it enacted s. 207 and made failure to pay or post a dividend warrant within 42 days from the declaration of the dividend an offence.
