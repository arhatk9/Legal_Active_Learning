 The appellant-tenant filed a suit for the fixation of standard rent and during its pendency paid the provisional standard rent fixed by the Court of Small Causes. After the final order fixing the standard rent of Rs. 125/per month passed on November 9, 1956 both the tenant and landlord filed revisions in the District Court which were dismissed after contest on March 25, 1958. It appears that the landlord filed a further revision in the High Court about which it is not known from the record when and how it was dismissed. After the order passed on November 9, 1956 the landlord demanded the balance of the rent due to him at the new rate and sent a registered notice but the tenant did not pay. Thereupon, the landlord filed the suit, giving rise to the present appeal, contending that the tenant was in arrears for six months which he had failed to pay within one month of the notice. The suit was terminated in favour of the tenant on April 28, 1958 because by then the back rent calculated at the standard rate finally fixed and the costs of the suit were fully paid by the tenant. The landlord appealed to the Assistant Judge claiming that after the Standard rent was fixed finally on March 25, 1956 the case fell to be governed by cl. (a) of s. 12(3) of the Act and as the tenant was in arrears for a period of six months he ought to have been evicted. The appeal failed as it was held that the tenant was protected by cl. (b) of s. 12(3).
 On revision, the High Court reversed the decision being of the opinion that cl. (a) of s. 12(3) applied to the facts of the case. In appeal by special leave :
 HELD:The appeal must be allowed.
 Eviction under cl. (a) is made to depend upon several considerations which must coexist and one such condition is that there should be no dispute about the standard rent.
 Clause (b) comprehends all cases other than those falling within cl. (a) and a. case in which there is a dispute about standard rent must obviously fall not in cl. (a) but in cl.
 (b).
 Since the dispute continued as both sides had filed revisions, the tenant was protected by cl. (b) of s. 12(3).
