 A mortgagee in possession of the mortgaged property filed a suit for enforcement Of the mortgage. As provided in 0-34, rr. 4 and 2 the trial court framed a preliminary decree in Form No. 5A of the Appendix D to the First Schedule of the Code of Civil Procedure declaring the amount ,due under the mortgage. This was done without debiting the profits of the property realised by the mortgagee in the manner contemplated by s. 76 Transfer of Property Act. After the decree was passed the mortgagors prayed that the mortgagee be asked to render accounts. Their application was rejected by the Trial Court, but the High Court in revision remanded the case and directed the trial court to declare the amount due under the mortgage after taking accounts from the mortgagee. The mortgagee's legal representatives (the present appellants) appealed to the Supreme Court by special leave.
 The appellants contended that since the preliminary decree had finally determined the rights of the parties no claim for subsequent accounting could arise. The respondents (mortgagors) on the other hand contended that the appellants had withdrawn the amount deposited in court in part satisfaction of the decree after having given an assurance that they would render accounts of the profits, and therefore the appellants were stopped from denying their liability to account.
 
HELD : (i) In a suit on a mortgage for sale the court may either order an account to be taken of what is due to the plaintiff at the date of the preliminary decree, or it may declare the amount so due on that date. In the latter case the decree will be made in Form No. 5A in Appendix D to the First Schedule. In a case where a decree is made in !Form No. 5A it is the duty of the Court to ascertain the amount due to the mortgagee at the date of the preliminary decree.
 The amount due cannot be declared unless the net profits realised by the mortgagee from the property are ascertained.
 'Me ascertainment of the net profits is therefore a matter directly and substantially in issue up to the date of the preliminary decree. If the requisite plea is not raised and the court does not in framing the preliminary decree take into account the net profits a subsequent plea for rendition of accounts by mortgagee would be barred on the principle of res judicata. A preliminary decree is final in respect of disputes that should have been raised before it was made.
 [159 D-160 D] In the present case therefore the mortgagor could not claim rendition of accounts for the period prior to the preliminary decree. [160 D] 155 (ii) The same however cannot be said of the net receipts realized by the mortgagee subsequent to the preliminary decree as no dispute about them could have been raised before it was made. As a suit notwithstanding the preliminary decree continue till the passing of the final decree and therefore any payment made by the judgment-debtor to the decree-holder would go in deduction of his mortgagee liability. On the same analogy the net receipts statutorily debited to the mortgagee would equally be taken into consideration in fixing the mortgagor's ultimate liability.

 (iii) There can be no estoppel unless the person to whom a representation is made acts on that representation to his detriment. By depositing the decretal amount the respondents had only discharged their legal liability under the decree and this cannot in any sense of the term be des- cribed as detrimental to them.
