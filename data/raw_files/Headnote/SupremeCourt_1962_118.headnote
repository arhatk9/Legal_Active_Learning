 The respondent was a dealer in gunny bags. He purchased gunnies from the Mills on terms of a written contract which was on a printed form. The Mills after receiving a part of purchase price, issued "delivery orders" directing the delivery of goods as per the contract. Instead of taking delivery himself the respondent endorsed the delivery orders and these passed through several hands before the ultimate holder of the delivery order presented it the Mills and obtain delivery of the gunnies from them, 185 At the date of the contract for purchase, the goods which were the subject matter of the purchase were not appro- priated to the contract so that there was no completed sale since no property passed but only an agreement of sale.
 The Sales Tax Officer assessed the respondent and collected sales tax on the said transactions. The question was whether the transactions were or were not "Sales of goods" within s. 3 the Madras Sales Tax Act, 1939, so as to enable the turnover represented by these sales to be brought to tax under the Act, or were mere sales or transfers of delivery orders: and further what was the effect of the property in the goods passing to the ultimate endorsee of the delivery order.
