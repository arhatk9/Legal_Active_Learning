 The fact of the non-explanation of the injuries on the accused person is a question of fact and not of law. Answer to such a question depends on the circumstances of each case. The entire prosecution case cannot be thrown overboard simply because the prosecution witnesses had not explained the injuries on the person of the accused. Such non-explanation is a factor which is to be taken into account in judging the veracity of the prosecution witnesses and the Courts would scrutinise their evidence with care.
 Each case presents its own features. In some cases the failure of the prosecution to account for the injuries of the accused may undermine its evidence to the core and falsify the substratum of its story while in others it may have little or no adverse effect on the persecution case. It may also in a given case strengthen the plea of private defence set up by the accused but it cannot be laid down as an invariable proposition of law that as soon as it is found that the accused had received injuries in the same transaction in which the complainant party was assaulted the plea of private defence would stand prima facie established.
 In every case, the question is' really one of appraisal of total evidence and its effect. In the instance case, the totality of the evidence on record neither establishes even with reasonable possibility a right of private defence in favour of the appellants nor throw a cloud of doubt on the prosecution case. A right of private defence is essentially one of defence or self protection and not a right of reprisal or punishment. It is subject to the restrictions indicated in section 99 which are as important as the right itself. [89 1-H; 92 G-H]
