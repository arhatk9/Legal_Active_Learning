 Sub-section (7) Of s. ii of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, as inserted by Act 48 of 1950, provides: " Subject to the rules made under this Act, the costs of, and incidental to, any proceeding before a Tribunal shall be in the discretion of that Tribunal, and the Tribunal shall have full power to determine by and to whom and to what extent and subject to what conditions, if any, such, 221 costs are to be paid and to give all necessary directions for the purposes aforesaid, and such costs may, on application made to it by the person entitled, be recovered as arrears of land revenue or as a public demand by the appropriate Government. t.
 During the pendency of the proceedings before the Industrial Tribunal for the adjudication of a dispute between the appellant Bank and its workman, an application was made by one of the' representatives of the, workmen praying inter alia that the appellant should be ordered to pay travelling and halting allowances for the representatives of the various Unions coming from different, stations other than 'Delhi to attend the hearing before the Tribunal at Delhi, on the ground that the appellant had branches all over India and that there 'Were several Unions of. its employees at those branches who were, involved in the dispute in question. The Tribunal while conceding that there was no provision of law in support of the claim, made by the res- pondents nevertheless made the order relying on the general practice of the Industrial. Courts. The appellant appealed by special leave and contended that the order was wholly without jurisdiction and was also unjust, while the respondents supported the order relying on s. II (7) Of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947:
 Held, that the order of the Tribunal was without jurisdiction and could not be- supported either on the basis of the general practice of the Industrial Courts or with reference to the provisions of s. II (7) Of the Act, because (1) there was no uniform or consistent practice in the matter and even if there was any such practice, it was neither warranted by law nor by the principles of reason and justice ; (2) on a proper construction' of the sub-section there was no power in the Tribunal to direct the payment of the costs of a party in advance by the other party, irrespective of the final result of the proceeding.
 The discretion which is given to a Tribunal under s. II(7) of the Act is a judicial discretion and must be exercised.
 according to the rules of reason and justice, not by chance.
 or caprice or private opinion or some fanciful idea of benevolence or sympathy.
