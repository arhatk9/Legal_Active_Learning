 The respondent who owns a house let out 5 rooms on the ground floor and 2 rooms on the second floor in the said house to one Lal Chand. The respondent flied a suit in the year 1958 in the Court of the Sub Judge for evicting Lal Chand, Kesho Ram, Jhangi Ram, Nand Lal and Smt. Kakibai alleging that Lal Chand had sublet the premises to four of them. The eviction was sought on the ground of personal requirement. reconstruction and arrears of rent. The pro- ceedings ended by the judgment of the High Court which granted a decree of eviction in respect of all 7 rooms in favour of the respondent. Since the suit property is situ- ated in a slum area the respondent filed an application under section 19(2) of the Slum Areas (Improvement and Clearance Act, 1956 for permission of the competent authority to execute the decree for possession obtained by him against Lal Chand and others. The competent authority after taking into account the factors mentioned in section 19(4) of that Act passed an order permitting the respondent to execute the decree in respect of the 2 rooms situated on the second floor only. The respondent was expressly refused permission to execute the decree in regard to the 5 rooms situate on the ground floor. An appeal filed by the re- spondent to the Administrator failed. Pursuant to the said order the possession of the 2 rooms on the second floor was handed over to the respondent. Thereafter, the respondent filed a Regular Suit in the year 1966 against Lal Chand, Kesho Ram and Jhangi Ram for possession of the remaining 5 rooms on the ground floor. The suit was decreed by the Trial Court. Nandial and Kakibai were not impleaded because they had surrendered possession of the two rooms on the second floor. Aggrieved by the judgment of the trial Court Lal Chand, Kesho Ram and Jhangi Ram filed an appeal.
 During the pendency of the said appeal Lal Chand died where- upon his widow and his son applied for being brought on record in that appeal as his legal representatives. The Appellate Court upheld the objection of the respondent that in view of the ejectment decree Lal Chand had ceased to be a tenant and, therefore, on his death the right to sue did not survive to his heirs. The Court, therefore, dis- missed the appeal. Kesho Ram, Jhangi Ram and the legal representatives of Lal Chand filed a second appeal in the High Court. The High Court upheld the decision of the Appellate Court and held that on the death of Lal Chand during the pendency of the first appeal the cause of action did not survive to his legal representatives and that there was nO one who could legitimately prosecute that appeal.
 523 Allowing the appeal by Special Leave.
 
 HELD: 1. The suit out of which the appeal before the High Court arose was filed by the respondent not only against Lal Chand but also against Kesho Ram and Jhangi Ram who were all in possession of the ground floor premises.
 The case of the respondent in the earlier round of litiga- tion that Lal Chand had sublet the premises to Kesho Ram and Jhangi Ram was not pursued. The ejectment decree did not rest on the ground of alleged -subletting. [526C-D] 
 2. Since the suit was filed against Lal Chand alongwith Kesho Ram and Jhangi Ram and since they were as much aggreived by the ejectment decree as Lal Chard himself and since they were entitled to equal protection of the Slum Clearance Act, the appeals could not have been dismissed by the first Appellate Court and the High Court on the ground that Lal Chand had died without leaving a heritable inter- est. Even if it .is assumed that Lal Chand left no surviv- ing cause of action to his heirs, the two other appellants Kesho Ram and Jhangi Ram had a real and substantial inter- est in prosecuting the appeal in their own right. Under' Order 41 rule 4 of the C.P.C. where there are more plain- tiffs or more defendants than one in a suit and the decree appealed from proceeds on any grounds common to all the plaintiffs or to all the defendants, any one of t e plain- tiffs or defendants can appeal from the whole decree and thereupon the appellate Court may reverse or vary the de- cree' in favour of all the plaintiffs or defendants as the case may be. [526E-H, 527A-C] 
 3. The observation of the High Court that Kesho Ram and Jhangi Ram were sub-tenants and they had, therefore, no independent right to continue the appeal, is without any basis. [527-G] 
 4. Under Section 19(1) of the Slum Areas (Improvement and Clearance) Act, 1956, notwithstanding anything con- tained in any other law for the time being in force no person shall except with the previous permission in writing of the competent authority institute any suit or proceeding for the eviction of a tenant from any building or land in a slum area after the 1964 amendment and where any decree or order is obtained before the 1964 amendment it cannot be executed without the previous permission in writing of the competent authority. A tenant against whom a decree of eviction is passed under the Delhi Rent Control Act is also a tenant within the meaning of section 19 of the Slum Clear- ance Act. The word "tenant has not been defined in the Slum Clearance Act. Under Sec. 2(1) of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958, a tenant does not include any person against whom any order of decree for eviction has been made. However, the Slum Clearance Act has not adopted that definition. Since clause (b) of section 19(1) of the Slum Clearance Act prohibits the execution of a decree for eviction it is clear that a person against whom a decree for eviction is obtained also continues to be a tenant. The rule is well settled that where the same expression is used in the same statute at different places, the same meaning ought to be given to that expression as far as possible.
 The Slum Clearance Act was passed, inter alia, for the protection of tenants in slum areas from eviction. The policy of the Slum Clearance Act being that the slum dweller should not be evicted unless alternative accommoda- tion is available to him, the word tenant in section 19(1)(a) must for the purposes of advancing the remedy provided by the Statute be construed to include a person against whom a decree or order for eviction has been passed.

 Lakshmi Chand v. Kauran Devi, [1965] INSC 241; [1966] 2 SCR 544, distin- guished.
 
 5. Since the respondent did not obtain permission of the competent authority for instituting the present suit for obtaining a decree for eviction of Chand and since Lal Chand must be held to be a tenant for the purposes of sec- tion 19(1)(a) the suit was incompetent. [531-B] 
 6. The suit is also barred by section 37A of the Slum Clearance Act which takes away the jurisdiction of a Civil Court in respect of any matter which the 524 competent authority or any other person is empowered by. or under the Act to determine. [531-C-D] 
 7. The present suit filed by the respondent is also barred by a principle analogous to res judicata. The respondent after obtaining a decree for eviction against Lal Chand and his alleged sub-tenants applied for permission of the competent authority to execute the decree. Permission was granted to him to execute the decree in respect of the 2 rooms or. the second floor only and in pursuance of that permission he obtained possession of these 2 rooms. By the present suit the respondent is once again asking for the relief which was included in the larger relief sought by him in the application filed by him under the Slum Clearance Act and which was expressly denied to him. The fact that section 11 of C.P.C. cannot apply on its terms since the earlier proceeding before the competent authority was not a suit, is no answer to the extension of the principle underlying section 11 to the instant case. Section 11 is not exhaustive and the principle which motivates that sec- tion can be extended to cases which do not fall strictly within the letter of the law. The issues involved in the two proceedings are identical, those issues arise as between the same parties and thirdly the issue now sought to be raised was decided finally by a competent quasi-judicial Tribunal. The principle of res judicata is conceived in the larger public interest which requires that all litigation must, sooner than later, come to an end. The principle is also founded on equity, justice and good conscience which require that a party which has once succeeded on an issue should not be permitted to be harassed by a multiplicity of proceedings involving determination of the same issue.
