 On April 13, 1959, it was resolved by the Board of Directors of the Express Newspapers (P) Ltd. that the company should sell the proprietary rights of printing and publishing its daily and weekly newspapers to the Indian Express (Madurai) (P) Ltd., Madurai, and to Andhra Prabha (P) Ltd., Vijayawada. In the purchaser-companies, the chairman of the Board of Directors of the vendor-company and members of his family held 4000 out of 4200 shares. On April 22, 1959 there was an agreement between Andhra Prabha (P) Ltd. and the Express Newspapers whereby it was agreed that all the employees employed by the vendor-company in connection with the publications purchased by the purchaser-company would be taken into the service of the purchasercompany without any change in their conditions of service. The workers of the Express Newspapers who were protesting against the sale to the company at Vijayawada on the ground that at an earlier stage assurance had been given that the publication of the papers would not be shifted from Madras to Vijayawada, were informed of the sale to and the agreement with the company at Vijayawada. They were also informed that the services of those workers who were not willing to join the purchaser- company at Vijayawada would be terminated on the usual terms a.% the Express Newspapers had no work to offer to them.
 The workers then gave a notice of strike and struck work from April 27, 1959. On April 29, 1959 the management of Express Newspapers gave a notice of closure and closed the company, and on the next day, the Government of Madras referred to the Industrial Tribunal the two questions namely, (1) whether the transfer of the publication of the news paper and weekly to Vijayawada was justified, and (2) whether the strike and lock-out Were justified. Though the company closed its undertaking of publishing the newspapers and weeklies on April 29 as it had very valuable property it retained some persons, one of whom was a reporter. to look after the property, and the teleprinter service in Madras continued to be used till the end of October 1959 by the Madurai and Vijayawada companies.
 The Tribunal held that there was no evidence of the alleged assurance not to shift to Vijayawada and that the strike was unwarranted. The Tribunal however held, that the suspension of business at the inception, that is on April 29 was a lock out, but became a genuine closure only by the end of October 1959.
 The workers as well as the Management appealed to this Court.
 
HELD : There was a genuine closure even on April 29 and the scheme of dispersal of the original undertaking was not mala fide. Ever) if there had been no strike there would 'have been a closure to give effect to the scheme and the strike only precipitated matters. [912C-D] The new company which was an independent legal entity could not be called a daughter company or benemidar of the older Organisation, 902 merely because, there was in both companies a person or family who could guide the destinies of the two companies.
 Further, the fact that there was a reporter among the persons retained to look after the property could not Iea to the inference that the company did not close down its business butkept it going to take it up whenever it wanted. Similarly, the failureto inform the competent authority under the Employs& ProvidentFund Act of the termination of the employment of 700 workers was an omission, but that could not mean that the workers continued to be in the service of the company. With regard to the teleprinter service, it had been paid for upto October and the fact that the Madurai and Vijayawada companies used it till the end of October, 1959 would not by itself or in conjunction with other circumstances of the case justify the conclusion that the company retained the teleprinter service for its own use.
