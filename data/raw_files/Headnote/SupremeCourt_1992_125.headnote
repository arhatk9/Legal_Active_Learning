 The Andhra Pradesh Panchyat Samithis and Zilla Parishads Ministerial Service Rules, 1965 were issued on 15.3.1965. Rule 4 of the said rules prescribes the qualifications for appointment to the various categories of employees of Panchayat Samithis and Zilla Parishads. Under this rule passing of Account Test was made a prerequisite qualification from 15.3.1965 for the typists, lower division clerks etc. working in the Telangana area for promotion to the post of Upper Division Clerks, Superintendents and managers. Since many employees had not acquired the test qualification and were liable to be reverted, the Government by its order NO. G.O.Ms.No. 487 granted two years time from 7.8.1967 to 7.8.1969 to enable them to pass the Account Test. The time allowed for two year was extended from time to time and finally up to November 1974. By a notification No. G.O.Ms. No.822 P.R. dated 22.8.1977, Rule 4 was amended.
 The first proviso to the amended rule provided that services in the category of Upper Division Clerks and such of the Lower Division Clerks who were temporarily promoted as Upper Division Clerks and Senior Accountants prior to 15.3.1965 but passed the Account Test before 30th November, 1974 shall be regularised from the date of their first temporary promotion or from a subsequent date. Under second proviso such regularisation was not to affect the seniority and promotions to higher posts ordered in accord- 863 ance with rules in favour of those who passed the Account Test before 7.8.1967.
 The appellants, initially appointed as Lower Division Clerks in Zilla Parishads, were promoted as Upper Division Clerk during 1960 to 1963. They passed he Account Test after 7.8.1967 but before November, 1974. The respondents were promoted as Upper Division Clerks before 1965 but they passed the Test before 7.8.1967. In the seniority list the appellants were placed above the respondents and in due course were promoted as Superintendents and Managers. The respondents claimed seniority and promotions over the appellants on the ground that they have passed the Account Test before 7.8.1967 while the appellants have passed the Test after 7.8.1967 and therefore they were entitled for promotion to the higher posts before the appellants.
 The Administrative Tribunal allowed the respondents' claim by holding that persons who were not qualified up to 7.8.1967 and who got the benefit of the notification dated 22.8.1977 have to be treated as juniors to those having passed the Account Test before 7.8.1967 were fully qualified for regular appointment as Upper Division Clerks irrespect ive of whether such persons were appointed to the posts of Upper Division Clerks regularly by 22.8.1977 or not.
 In appeals to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellants that the interpretation placed on the 2nd proviso to Rule 4 by the Tribunal is wrong; (2) since time was granted for passing the prescribed test the appellants who were promoted before passing the Account Test must be deemed to have been qualified even at the time of the first appointment on their passing the Account Test; (3) that the respondents were also promoted as Upper Division Clerks before they passed the test and their passing the test before the extended time did not confer on them any right of seniority when they were juniors to the appellants in the category of Lower Division Clerks.
 Disposing the Appeals, this Court, Held : 1. The intention of the Government in issuing the second proviso in G.O.MsNo.822 P.R. dated 22.8.1977 is to protect only those who passed the Account Test before 7.8.1967 and whose services in the category of Upper Division Clerks were regularised and promoted to the higher 864 posts by 22.8.1977. It is not intended to benefit those persons who are not regularised or promoted even though they had passed the Account Test before 7.8.1967. The crucial words in the second proviso `the seniority and promotion to higher posts ordered in accordance with rules in favour of those who passed the Account Test before 7.8.1967' contemplated an order of promotion taking into account the test qualification acquired before 7.8.1967. If there had not been an order of promotion, the mere passing of the test before 7.8.1967 does not confer seniority to those Upper Division Clerks over the category which had been granted the concession.
 [876 D-E, 873 F-G] 
 2. On a plain reading of the proviso in the light of the various Government Orders, it is very clear that until the Upper Division Clerks promoted before 15.3.1965 were regularised and promoted to the higher post on their acquiring the test qualification before 7.8.1967, they do not get seniority over those who passed the test after 7.8.1967 but within the time granted and the latter do not lose their seniority in favour of their juniors who acquired the test qualification before 7.8.1967. [876 F-G] 
 3. Those temporary Upper Division Clerks who were liable to be reverted for want of test qualification and who had been conferred he concession by extending the time for passing the test were entitled to be regularised on passing the Account Test from the date of their first temporary appointment or the subsequent date without affecting the seniority of those persons who had secured promotion to higher post in accordance with the rules on having passed the Account Test before 7.8.1967. Thus the proviso clearly indicates that as a matter of right the temporary Upper Division Clerks who were liable to be reverted but had been given the concession and had passed he Account Test within the time granted could maintain their seniority over those persons who had not been promoted by virtue of their test qualification. The latter category who had already been promoted had to be treated as senior to the former. Any other interpretation of these provisos would make the second proviso redundant. [873 H, 874 A-C] 
 4. The passing of the Account Test does not automatically result in regularisation of the appointment as Upper Division Clerks. The persons who were temporarily promoted earlier had been granted concession to get qualified and when they acquired such qualification they stood in he same position as those who passed the test earlier. The regularisation is not with 865 reference to the date of passing the test but with effect from the date of first promotion in such cases. [877 B-C] 
 5. The protection under the latter part of the proviso to Rule 4 is available to those Upper Division Clerks who happened to be juniors and who had also acquired the test qualification and had been promoted to the higher posts on a regular basis though their senior acquired the test qualification within the time allowed by he Government.
 However, such protection is not available to those employees who remained in the same category of Upper Division Clerks and had been temporarily promoted as Upper Division Clerks subsequent to the appellants though they had passed the test before 7.8.1967 [877 F-G] Chandrakant v. State of Gujarat, [1977] 2 S.L.R. 605, referred to.
 
 6. The Tribunal overlooked the true scope of the proviso in the light of the Government order dated 7.8.1967 and uniformly applied the protection afforded in the second proviso to all those persons who had acquired the test qualification before 7.8.1967 irrespective of the fact that they had been regularised and promoted to higher posts before 1977. The seniority list shall be prepared in all the cases in the light of the above findings and the consequential relief be granted to the appellants. [876 F, 878-A]
