 The respondent firm had income from property, ready business in kappas, and also speculation business. It was registered under s. 26A of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, for the assessment years 1958-59, 195960 and 1960-61. In the accounting periods relating to the assessment years 1958-59 and 1959-60 the firm suffered loss in the speculation business. The Income-tax Officer did not set off this loss against the income from property and ready kappas business but apportioned it between the, partners of the firm. In 1960-61 there was profit in the speculation business and the firm claimed that the loss in that business in the preceding two years should, be set off against the said profit.
 According to the firm the Income-tax Officer was wrong in apportioning the speculation loss between the partners in 1958-59 and 1959-60. The plea was not accepted by the Income-tax Officer or the Appellate Assistant Commissioner.
 But the Tribunal in further appeal, and the High Court in reference under s. 66A accepted it. The Revenue appealed to this Court.
 
HELD : (i) The principal clause of s. 24(1) lays down that if there be a loss of profits or gains in any year under any of the heads in s. 6, that loss has to be set off against the income profits or gains of the assesses under any other head in that year. The first proviso to the clause however lays down an exception to the above rule, namely, that the losses sustained in speculative transactions are not to be taken into account in computing the profits and gains chargeable under the head 'profits and gains of business, profession or vocation,' except to the extent that they will be set off against profits and gains in any other business which itself consists of speculative transactions. In the present case the Income-tax Officer was clearly right in the assessment years 1958-59 and 1959-60 in not setting off the losses in the speculative business against the income earned in those years either from property or from ready business in Kappas. [816 D-H] (ii) The Income-tax Officer however erred in -apportioning the said speculation loss in the years 1958-59 and 1959-60 between the partners and in not carrying it forward and setting it off against the profit in speculation business in 1960-61.
 The second proviso to s. 24(1) in so far as it deals with registered Arms lays down that any loss which cannot be set off against the income profits and gains of the registered firm is to be apportioned between the partners of the firm and they alone are entitled to have the amount set off under this section. Clearly the word 'any loss' here must refer to the loss computed for purposes of the principal clause of s. 24(1) taken with the first proviso, and will therefore not comprise in it the loss in speculative business which is not to be taken into account under the first proviso. If this part of the second proviso were interpreted to include within it the loss in speculative business Which is not to be taken into account under the first 814 proviso, the effect of giving a wider meaning to the words 'any loss' in it would be that the same loss in speculative business would, after apportionment, be set off against income profits and gains under other heads in computing the total income of the partners. The result would be that the effect of the first proviso would be nullified by this part of the second proviso. [817 E-H] Proviso (c) to s. 24(2) envisages the existence of loss which has not been apportioned between the partners and this clearly strengthens the view that the second proviso to s.
 24(1) does not cover loss in speculative business and consequently does not permit that loss to be apportioned be- tween the partners. [820 E-F] Section 23(5)(a) of the Act also could not help the Revenue.
 Under the first proviso to s. 23 (5) (a) the share of a partner in a loss is required to be set off against his other income, or carried forward and set off in accordance with the provisions of s. 24, This proviso however does not refer to the loss incurred by a registered firm in speculative business which is not to be taken into account when computing the total income of the registered firm under s. 23(1), (3) and (4) of the Act.
