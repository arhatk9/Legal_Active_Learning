 The appellant imported 200 metric tons of wolfram concentrate, under a contract which prescribed minimum contents of 65% of WO3 in the concentrate. The Customs authorities levied duty at the rate of 60% amount under item 87 of the First Schedule. The appellant claimed refund on the ground that no duty was leviable as the goods imported was an "ore" and fell under item 26 or 70(7) of the Import tariff. The Assistant Collector of Customs held that the appellant was not entitled to refund because the term 'ore' mentioned in the text of item 26 is confined to articles which are in 'form and condition in which they are mined and not as wolfram ore concentrate in powder form as in the present case. On appeal by the appellant the Appellate Collector held that the goods in question were in the manufactured form made by special specifications by dressing and were thus not "ores". The Central Government rejected the revision application filed by the appellant holding that the examination by the Chemists showed that. the uniform granules of the material were not only separated from rock but also from various impurities and had been subjected to such processing as would take them out of the category of metallic ore mentioned in entry 26.
 In appeal to this Court the appellant contended that for the purposes of levy of ditty under entry 26 the normally acceptable merchantable quality of wolfram (containing a minimum 65% W03) is relevant and riot wolfram in mined form.
 Allowing the appeals, 
HELD : Wolfram ore when mined contains only 5 to 2 per cent W03 and in order to make it usable and merchantable ore with minimum 65% W03, Concentration is necessary. If item 26 of the Import Tariff is to be restricted to wolfram being material containing 5 to 2 per cent W03, it would be mainly rock which can not be imported in large quantity and it will have no market. It is only usable ore with 65% W03 concentration that is relevant for levy of duty. What has to be seen is what is meant in International trade and in the market by Wolfram ore containing 65% or more W03. The said concentrate is achieved by selective mining and washing or magnetic separation. It does not involve any manufacturing or processing with chemical for removing impurities. The concentrate, therefore, does not cease to be an 'ore'.within the meaning of item 26. [1002C-F] 
HELD, further, that in interpreting items in taxing statutes, resort should be had not to the scientific or technical meaning but to the meaning attached to them by those dealing in them in their commercial sense. [1002H] 998
