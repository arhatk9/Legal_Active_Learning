 The respondents were tenants under the appellant who was the inamdar. On the allegations that they were in arrears of rent for three consecutive years 1957 to 1960, the appellant terminated their tenancy by giving them notice on June 18, 1960 and on August 4, 1960, filed an aspiration under ss.
 28(2) and 32(2) of the Hyderabad Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1950.. The application was allowed and the possession of the lands was directed to be restored to the appellant under s. 32(2). The order was confirmed in appeal. On revision, the Maharashtra Revenue Tribunal held :-(i) that the tenants were in arrears of rent, (ii) that all rights and interests with respect to the inam lands had vested absolutely in the State with effect from July 20, 1955, (iii) under s. 3(1) of the Hyderabad Abolition of Inams Act, 1955, that the landlord was therefore dis- entitled to possession of the inam lands under s, 32(2) of the Tenancy Act, and (iv) that occupancy rights had been conferred on the respondents under the Abolition Act. The High Court on being approached under Art. 227 of the Constitution, confirmed the order of the Tribunal on different grounds relying upon the decision of the Bombay High Court in DattatrayaSadashiv v. Ganapati Raghu, (67 Bom. L.R. 521). These grounds were,that where, the inam was abolished with effect from July 20,1.955under the Abolition Act, the relationship of landlord and tenant continued to subsist till July 1, 1960; but since the appellant in this case only gave a notice to the tenants to quit and had not applied for possession under s. 32 of the Tenancy Act before that date, the appellant-landlord was not entitled to claim possession pursuant to that notice.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) The decision in Dattaraya Sadashiv's case is not a binding precedent for the decision of the present case.
 That case is a direct authority only for a situation where an application is made by a landlord under s., 44 of the Tenancy Act. Reference to ss. 19 and 25 was made in that case by the High Court only for the purpose of fortifying its view of s. 44 by contrasting the kinds of cases dealt with by the Tenancy Act. Section 44 deals with a landlord's right to culminate protected tenancy where he requires the ',and for cultivating personally. [109F-H] (2) In the State of Maharashtra v.-Laxman Ambaji, (A.f.R.
 1971 S.C. 1859) this Court, while considering certain provisions of the Tenancy Act observed'. that the relationship of landlord. and tenant under the Abolition Act ceased on July 1, 1960, that if a tenant prior to that date, surrendered possession and the inamdar had accepted such surrender and remained in possession, he would be entitled to the grant of occupancy 104 rights, but that if the tenant claimed to be in possession on that date the Government would have to ascertain who was in lawful possession or July 1, 1960 for the purpose of grant of occupancy rights. But these decisions do not deal with the effect of the absolute vesting in the State under s. 3 of the Abolition Act of all rights and interests with respect to inam land with effect from July 20, 1955, and the question whether the vesting could be said to have become ineffectual by reason of the mere continuation of the relationship of landlord and tenant up to July 1, 1960.
 Therefore, the order of the High Court should be set aside land the case remitted to it for re-decision after considering the distinction pointed out in Dattaraya Saclashiv's case and in the light of the decision of this Court in Laxman Ambiji's case. [109H; 110A-D; 113B] (3)The finding of the Tribunal that occupancy rights had beenconferred under the Abolition Act on the respondents has also to be considered by the High Court. [112E-F]
