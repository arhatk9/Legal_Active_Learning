 Under s. 80A of the Representation of the People Act. 1951, the High Court is given jurisdiction to try election petitions. Section 81 Prescribes the period of 45 days from the date of the election of a returned candid-ate as the period within which an election petition calling in question any election on one or more of the grounds specified in s.
 100 (1) or s. 101 has to be presented. If the provisions of s of S. 81 are not complied with, s. 86 requires that the High Court shall dismiss the petition. Rules 6 and 7 of the Election Rules framed by the Patna High Court provided, (i) that the petition must, first, be presented to the stamp Reporter (ii) The Stamp Reporter has to certify thereon whether it is in time and in conformity with the requirements of the Act and the rules in that behalf or is defective; (iii) the petition should be returned to the petitioner for removing the defects if any and for formal presentation to the judge in open Court after removing the defects; (iv)if the judge who is designated to entertain and try election petitions is absent the petition shall be presented before the Bench hearing civil applications and motions; and (v) the date of presentation before the Judge or Bench, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be the date of the filing of the election petition for purposes of limitation.
 In the present case, the election petition was filed on Monday instead of on the previous Saturday which was the last day of limitation, and the High Court dismissed the petition as time-barred.
 In appeal to this Court, on the questions: (1) Is the Court closed on Saturday because Judges do not sit, and (2) by virtue of s. 29 (2) Of the Limitation Act, 1963. are the provisions of ss. 4 to 24 and especially s. 5 of the Limitation Act applicable to election petitions, so that, the petitioner could show sufficient cause for not filing the petition within time, 
HELD: (1) (a) Under s. 4 of the Limitation Act, it is Provided that where tile prescribed period for any suit, appeal or aPPlication expires on a day when the court is closed, the suit, appeal or application may be instituted, preferred or made on the day when the court reopens. Even if s. 4 of the Limitation Act does not apply to election petitions s. 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, would certainly apply to election petitions. Under both the provisions where the prescribed period of limitation expires on a day when the Court is closed the petition could be filed on a day when the court next reopens. But a court is not closed notwithstanding the fact that judges do not sit on any day if otherwise the court is open on that-day. [34H;

 (b) Rules 6 and 7 of the Elections Rules of the Patna High Court should be read subject to r. 24 of the same Rules; and so read, in so far as they are not inconsistent wit with the election rules, the Patna High Court Rules shall apply mutatis mutandis 32 to all election petitions. Rules 26 of the Patna High Court Rules provides for the presentation of the memorandum of appeal or application to the Registrar when no Bench is sitting, and after certification by him for presentation to a Bench on the next subsequent day on which the Bench is sitting. Rule 26 applies to an election petition also and is not inconsistent with r. 7, Election Rules. Rule 7 does not provide for a contingency where a Judge or Bench is not sitting on a day when the court is not closed. The practice of the High Court is that Judges do not sit for judicial work on Saturdays and there are no Benches sitting on that day and consequently any provision made to deal with such a contingency could not be said to be inconsistent with the Election Rules. That contingency is provided for by r. 26 of the High Court Rules. Further, it would be incongruous that a Court is open on Saturday for presentation of appeals, applications, plaints or decrees etc. mentioned in r. 13 of the High Court Rules even though Judges are not sitting on that day, but the Court is closed on the same day for presentation of election petitions. Therefore, reading rr. 6 and 7 of the Election Rules with r. 26 of the High Court Rules there is no doubt that an election petition can be presented, on the last day of the limitation even though the Judges are not sitting to receive or entertain an election petition, to the Registrar or, in his absence, to the other officers specified in r.26. [38H-39D] (2) (a) Section 29 (2) of the Limitation Act, 1963, provides that the provisions contained in Ss. 4 to 24 shall apply in so far as and to the extent to which they arc not expressly excluded by such special or local law. The words 'expressly excluded' could not mean that there must be express reference made in the special or local law to the specific provisions of the Limitation Act of which the operation is to be excluded. if on an examination of the relevant provisions it is clear that the provisions to the Limitation Act are necessarily excluded then the benefits conferred therein could not be called in aid to supplement the provisions of the Special Act. Even in a case where the special law does not exclude the provisions of s. 4 to 24 of the Limitation Act by an express reference it would, nonetheless be open to the Court to examine whether and to what extent the nature of those provisions or the nature of the subject matter and schemes of the special law exclude their operation.[44C-F] (b) Section 86 of the Representation of the People Act, which is a special law, gives a peremptory command that the High Court shall dismiss an election petition which does not Comply with the provisions to sections 81, 82 or 117.
 (e) If the Limitation Act were to apply to an election petition which does not comply with s. 81, it should equally apply for non-compliance with Ss. 82 and 117. But in Charan Lal Sahu v. Nandkishore Bhatt and Others, [1973] INSC 126; [1973] 2 S.C.C. 530, it was held that the Court had no discretion to condone the delay in non-compliance with the provisions of Ss. 82 and 117. If for non-compliance with the provisions of Ss. 82 and 117, which are mandatory, the election petition has to be dismissed under s. 86 (1), the presentation of an election petition within the period prescribed in s. 81 would be equally mandatory requiring dismissal of the petition for noncompliance with it. [44G] (d) On the terms of s. 29 (2) of the Limitation Act, the applicability of Ss. 4 to 24 of the Limitation Act has to be judged not from the terms of the Limitation Act but by the provisions of the Representation of the People Act relating to the filing of election petition and their trial.
 Sections 6 to 24 of the Limitation Act are not expressly excluded, but they cannot on that account be made applicable to proceedings under the Representation of the People Act, because, they are, in terms inapplicable. Therefore, the Representation of the People Act is a complete code in itself which does not admit of the application of any of the provisions of the Limitation Act mentioned in s. 29 (2) of that Act, including s. 5, [45D] (e) Under s. 86 (5) of the Representation of the People Act the High Court may allow the amendment of the particulars of any corrupt practice alleged in the petition but the High Court shall not allow any amendment to the petition which will have the effect of introducing particulars of a corrupt practice not previously alleged in the petition. This is not permitted because it would amount to a new petition being filed after the period of limitation, indicating that s. 5 of the Limitation Act cannot be attracted. [46G] 33 (f) It is also significant that the delay in presentation of the election petition under the repealed s. 81 could be condoned by the Election Commission in its discretion; but when the Act was amended in 1966 and jurisdiction was given to the High Court to entertain and try the election petitions a similar provisions for condoning delay was not enacted, showing Parliament's intention not to confer such a power. The whole object of the amendment was to provide a procedure for more expeditious disposal of the election disputes by the High Court. [47A] Therefore, the provisions of s. 5 of the Limitation Act do not govern the filing of an election petition or their trial. [49D] K.Venkateswara Rao and Anr. v. Bekkam Narasimha Reddi & Ors., [1969].1 S.C.R. 679, N. P. Ponnuswami v. Returning Officer Namakkal Constituency and others[1952] INSC 2; , [1952] S.C.R. 218 and Krishan Chander v. Ram Lal [1973] INSC 135; [1973] 2 S.C.C. 759, referred to.
 [It is true that if the election petitions are thus dismissed the allegations of serious corrupt practice could not be enquired into and the purity of the elections cannot be maintained but that however is a matter which can be set right only by the legislature.]
