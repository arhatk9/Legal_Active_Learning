 A common question of law arose in these appeals namely, whether the Bihar Town Planning and Improvement Trust Act, 1951 (Act 35 1951), replaced the Land Acquisition Act (1 of 1894) in the matter of acquisition of land for the said Trust and whether the notifications issued by the Government of Bihar under ss. 4 and 6 of the Land Acquisition Act were valid, after the Bihar Act had come into force. The High Court held the notifications of the State Government ultra vires and illegal. On the principle of generalia specialibus non derogant and also that if a statute directs a thing to be done in a certain way that thing shall not, even if there be no negative words be done in any other way.
 Held, (per Imam, Kapur and Mudholkar, JJ.), that s.71 of the Bihar Act which modified the Land Acquisition Act itself contemplates the machinery of the Land Acquisition Act as modified even for the purpose of acquiring land for the Trust. It does not exclude the Land Acquisition Act; on the contrary it makes it applicable but subject to its modifications and exceptions. The first relevant modification is by sub-cl. (1) of clause (2) of the schedule. There the first notice under s. 46 of the Bihar) Act is substituted for and has the same effect as a noti- fication under s. 4 (1) of the Land Acquisition Act but that is subject to an important exception and that exception is a notification under s. 4 (1) of the Land Acquisition Act or a declaration under s. 6 of that Act which "has been previously made and is in force". The words "has been previously made" did not merely connote the issuing of a notification before the Bihar Act was passed, but include all notifications made prior or anterior to the first publication of a notice of an improvement scheme under s. 46 of the Bihar Act.
 813 Mercer Henderson's Trustees v. Dunferuline District Committee, 37 Sc. L. R. 119, referred to.
 Held, further, that the power of the State Government' to acquire land for the Trust was not taken away by the Bihar Act was further shown by s. 33 of that Act which deals with the preparation of a Master Plan by the Trust, which has to designate the land subject to compulsory acquisition by the various authorities mentioned therein including the State Government.
 Held, also, that s 50 (1) of the Land Acquisition Act would be equally available for being put into force for the pur- pose of a Trust, which shows that the intention of the legislature was not to exclude the functions of the Land Acquisition Act such as ss. 4, 6, 50 etc. in the matter of acquisition of land for the purpose of a trust.
 Per, Subba Rao, J. Under the Act, the Trust was authorised to implement the improvement schemes in a particular way and for the purposes of implementing, that to acquire land in a prescribed manner. If that be so, the Trust was bound to implement the scheme in the manner prescribed and could not resort to any other method. The broad scheme of the Act also supports the conclusion that the Trust could only implement the scheme involving acquisition of land in the manner provided by the Act, that is to say in accordance with the land acquisition provisions incorporated in the Act by reference and therefore the two principles noticed by the High Court were apposite.
 Secretary of State v. Hindustan Co-operative Insurance Society Ltd. A. 1. R. 1931 P. C. 149 and EX-Parte Stephens, (1876) 3 Ch. D. 659, relied on.
 The saving of notification issued under s. 4 or s. 6 of the Land Acquisition Act in para. 2 (1) of the schedule of the Act applies to such notifications issued before or after passing of the Act, but prior to the issue of the first pubuliction or notice of implementation of the scheme under s. 46 of the Act.
