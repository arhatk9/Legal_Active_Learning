 The appellant was ordered by the Commissioner of Police Madras to leave India because he had obtained a Pakistan passport and had thereby become the citizen of a foreign country. He made an application to the Central Government under s. 9(2) of the Indian Citizenship Act, 1955 for the determination of his citizenship. The Central Government rejected his claim to Indian Citizenship without giving him a hearing. The appellant thereupon filed a writ petition before the High Court in which he challenged the validity of s. 9 of the Citizenship Act and also that of Paragraph 3 of Sch. III to the Citizenship Rules, 1956. The High Court rejected these contentions and also his further contention that the enquiry prescribed by R. 30 of the Citizenship rules conducted by the Central Government for the purpose of a decision under s. 9(2) is a quasi-judicial process in which a reasonable opportunity to the affected citizen to prove his case is necessary With certificate of fitness granted by the High Court the appellant came to this Court.
 
HELD(i) If voluntary acquisition of citizenship of another country determines Indian Citizenship within the meaning of s. 9(1) and by virtue of paragraph 3 of Sch. III of the Citizenship Rules a conclusive presumption of voluntary acquisition of citizenship is to be raised from the obtain- ing of a passport from the Government of any other country, it would be implicit that the obtaining of a passport was the result of the exercise of free volition by the citizen.
 This view is strengthened by the scheme of s. 9(2) read with Rule 30 which contemplates an enquiry by an authority prescribed under sub-s. (2) for determination of the question whether citizenship of another country has been acquired by an Indian Citizen. [892 D-E] (ii)Determination of the question as to whether, when, and how foreign citizenship has been acquired postulates an approach as in a quasijudicial enquiry : the citizen concerned must be given due notice of the nature of the action which in the view of the authority involves termination of Indian Citizenship, and reasonable opportunity must be afforded to the citizen to convince the authority that what is alleged against him is not true. [891 B-D] (iii)Obtaining of a passport of a foreign country cannot in all cases mean merely receiving the passport.
 Cases may be visualised in which on account of force or fraud a person may be compelled or induced to obtain a passport from a foreign country. It would be difficult to say that in such a case the passport has been 'obtained' within the meaning of paragraph 3 of Sch. Ill. [891 G-H] (iv)The question whether the passport was voluntarily obtained cannot be decided by the foreign country, representative of which issues 885 a passport; and mere issue of a passport may not always be regarded decisive of the question that the passport was voluntarily obtained. Section (2) read with r. 30 confers the power to determine whether Indian Citizenship is terminated upon the specified authority, and in exercising that power the authority is guided by the statutory rules of evidence. It would beimpossible to hold that termination of Indian Citizenship depends upon theaction of a foreign country in issuing the passport. [892 F-G] (v) The appellant was not given opportunity by the Central Government to prove his case that the Pakistan passport had not been voluntarily obtained by him. The Central Government had therefore to re-determine the question of his citizenship after giving him an opportunity to prove his case. [893 A-B]
