 The appellants filed a suit for an injunction restraining the respondents from infringing their registered trade mark used on packets of biscuits manufactured by them, The suit was dismissed by the trial court and the High Court.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) Under the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958, a registered trade mark is infringed by a person who uses, in the course of trade, a mark which is identical with or deceptively similar to, the trade mark, in relation to any goods in respect of which the trade mark is, registered; and the expression 'deceptively similar' means a mark which so nearly resembles another mark as likely to deceive or cause confusion. In order to come to the conclusion whether one mark is deceptively similar to another the broad and essential features of the two are to be considered. They should not be placed side by side to find out if there are any differences in the design, and if so, whether they are of such character as to prevent one design from being mistaken for the other. It would be enough if the impugned mark bears such an overall similarity to the registered mark as would be likely to mislead a person usually dealing with one to accept the other if offered to him. [292 B-D; 294 D- F] In this case, the packets of biscuits manufactured by the appellants and respondents were practically of the same size, the color scheme of the two wrappers was almost the same, and the designs on both, though not identical, bore such a close resemblance that one could easily be mistaken for the other. If one was not careful enough to note the peculiar features of the wrapper on the plaintiffs' goods, he might easily mistake the defendants' wrapper for the plaintiffs' if shown to him some time after he bad seen the plaintiffs' wrapper. Though the trial court and the High Court had concurrently found that the defendants' wrapper was not deceptively similar to that of the plaintiffs, the finding must be set aside as it was not arrived at on a proper consideration of the law. 1294 F-H], Durga Dutt v. Navaratna Laboratories [1964] INSC 228; [1965] 1 SC.R. 737 followed.
