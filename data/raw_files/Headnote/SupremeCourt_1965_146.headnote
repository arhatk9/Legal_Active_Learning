 The appellants sued the respondents for recovery of money advanced to them, and the suit was decreed. On appeal by one of the respondents, the High Court held that only the 2nd appellant had lent the money, that out of the money lent, Rs. 6000 was borrowed by the 3rd respondent and the balance by the 5th respondent against whom a decree was not sought, that the 2nd appellant was registered as a moneylender under s. 5(4) of the Bihar Moneylenders Act, 1938 and r. 5 of the rules made thereunder, and that since the registration certificate mentioned that he could transact money-rending business up to a maximum of Rs. 4999, he could get a decree only for that sum.
 In their appeal to this Court, the appellants contended that the High Court erred in holding that a registered money- lender could not recover by suit loans advanced in excess of the maximum amount mentioned in the registration certificate.
 
HELD : A money-lender who has been registered under the Act can sue for the recovery of a loan advanced by him during the period his registration certificate is in force, even if at the time of advancing the loan he had exceeded the limit of the amount mentioned in the registration certificate as the amount up to which he could transact money-lending business, because, under s. 4 of the Bihar Money-lenders (Regulation of Transactions) Act, 1939, it is the de facto registration of the money-lender under the 1938 Act which entitles him to sue for the loan and not the contents of the registration certificate. [344 D-F] The mere ground that a certain construction of a rule or consideration of its effect will defeat the purpose or object of the Act is not a good ground for taking away the rights of the money-lender to sue for the recovery of a debt due to him-, when the Act itself contains no provision authorising any limit to the loan which a moneylender may lend. [340 E] There is no justification for holding that the object of the Act would be defeated if the registered money-lender could be held competent to lend money in excess of the maximum amount mentioned in the certificate. The various provisions of the Act indicating the kinds of relief which the legislature considered necessary to provide for the good of debtors and the absence of any discretion in the Sub- Registrar to refuse registration for whatever figure the money-lender wants the certificate, indicate that the limit of the loans to be advanced does not figure as a factor in either regulating the money-leading transaction or in giving relief to a debtor. [341 G; 342 A-C] The State Government is not competent to make a rule fixing the maximum amount under its rule-making power, and the rules framed 336 do not, in fact, provide that a money-lender properly registered as such under the Act will cease to be a money- lender so registered, if he advances a loan in excess of the limit mentioned in the certificate. The classification of money-lenders according to the amount of money up to which they wanted to lend, for the purposes of registration fee, can be no justification for placing any limit on the maximum amount of loans.
