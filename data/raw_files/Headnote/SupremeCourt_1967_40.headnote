 The respondent was a dealer in firewood and charcoal. in ings for assessment of sales tax under the Madhya Pradesh, General sales Tax Act. 1958, the respondent claimed that charcoal was 'coal' within the meaning of Entry I of Part Ell of the Schedule II to the Act and fore was taxable at the rate of 2%. The sales tax authorities however held that charcoal was not 'coal' and was taxable at 4% as it fell the rwsiduary Entry I of Part VI of Schedule II. The Board of India the High Court held in favour of the respondent relying on the dictionaty meaning of the word 'coal'. The Commissioner of Salex tax appealed.
 It was urged on behalf of the appellant that coal wag a mineral while charcoal was manufactured from products like wood and other things by human agency and therefore the dictionary meaning ought not to have been relied upon.
 Reliance was also placed on legislative practice which had treated coal and charcoal as different items.
 In interpreting items in statutes like the Sales Tax resort should be had not to the scientific or technical meaning of the terms used but to their popular meaning or the meaning attached ter them by those dealing in them, that is to say, in their commercial sense. Viewed from this angl both a merchant dealing in coal and a consumer wanting to purchase it would reaard coal not in its geological sense but in the sense as ordinarily understood and would include 'charcoar in the term 'coal'. Under the Entries.' 'coal' as well as 'firewood' were taxed at 2%. It could not have been intended to tax charcoal alone at 4%. Entry I of Part III of Sch. II must therefore be read broadly and held to include charcoal. It was not possible to adopt its connotation from other statues passed for different purposes or in the context of different objects.[713 B; 725 A-E; 726 c] Ramavtar Budhaiprasad etc. v.
