 In the course of assessment to sales tax for the last two quarters of 1957 under the Orissa Sales Tax Act, 1947 on the sales of iron and steel goods, the assessee company claimed a deduction from its gross turnover of an amount representing central sales-tax collected by it from purchases and paid over to the central sales-tax authority.
 This claim was disallowed by the Sales Tax Officer and the Collector of Sales-tax confirmed this decision. However, on appeal, the Sales Tax Tribunal held that the central sales- tax realised by the assessee from its customers was not part of the price charged by it and, therefore, it did not fall within the definitions of "sale price" and "taxable turnover' in the Act. In coming to its conclusion, the Tribunal relied upon the fact (i) that the assesse was a controlled stock-holder under the Iron and Steel Control Order, 1956, and was not, therefore, entitled to charge a price higher than that fixed by the Government of India; and (ii) that by virtue of Condition No. 4(ii) of the Iron & Steel (Control) Notification dated Oct. 18, 1958 the customer was required to pay the controlled stock-holder the central sales tax incurred by the latter in obtaining the material and on the sale to the customer. The High Court, upon a reference, agreed with the Tribunal. On appeal to this Court, 
HELD: In view of the fact that the price which the stock-holder was entitled to charge was statutorily fixed and the stock-holder was not entitled to and did not charge more, the central sales-tax paid under the provisions of the Iron and Steel (Control) Notification did not form part of the sale price paid by the customer to the assessee.
