 The mere filing of award in Court by a party to it without the authority of the arbitrator or umpire is not a sufficient compliance with the terms of s. 14 of the Indian Arbitration Act, 1940, nor can it be inferred from the mere handing over of the original award by the umpire to both the parties that be authorised them to file the same in Court on his behalf ; that authority has to be specifically alleged and proved.
 The phrase "in a reference" in s. 31, sub-s. (4), of the Indian Arbitration Act, 1940, is comprehensive enough to cover an application first made after the arbitration is completed and a final award made, and the sub-section vests exclusive jurisdiction in the Court in which an application for filing an award has been first made under s. 14 of the Act.
 The respondent who was a party to an award filed an applica- tion before the Subordinate Judge of Gauhati under s. 14 (2) of the Indian Arbitration Act, on the 10th August, 1949, praying that the umpire may be directed to file the award in Court and upon this notice was issued to the umpire to file the award in Court before 24th August, 1949. As the original award had been handed over to the parties, the umpire sent by post on the 18th August, 1949, a copy of the award signed by him. The Court directed the respondent to file the original award in Court and he did so on the 3rd September, 1949. Meanwhile the appellant's solicitors sent to the Registrar of the Calcutta High Court Original Side, on the 17th August, 1949, the original award for being filed in Court and the award was filed on the 29th August:
 Held, that, as the umpire had, on the direction of the Sub- ordinate Judge of Gauhati sent a copy of the award signed.by him to the Court on the 18th August, 1949, the earlier filing for the purposes of s. 31(3) of the Arbitration Act was in the Gauhati Court and not in the Calcutta High Court, though the original award was filed by the respondent in the Gauhati Court only after the appellant's solicitor had sent the award for filing to the 879 Calcutta High Court. In the circumstances the Gauhati Court alone had jurisdiction to proceed with the hearing of the dispute under s. 31 of the Act.
 Judgment of the Calcutta. High Court affirmed.
