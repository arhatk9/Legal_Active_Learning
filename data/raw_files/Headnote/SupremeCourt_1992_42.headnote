 The respondent entrusted certain construction work to the petitioner, and the petitioner executed the contract.
 During the course of the contract, the petitioner was required to do some extra work for which a claim for payment was made and on that account, a dispute arose. Since clause 70 of the contract provided for arbitration, the petitioner asked for the appointment of arbitrator. Accordingly, an arbitrator was appointed. The petitioner protested against the appointment of the arbitrator and the proceedings dragged on. On his retirement from the Army, the appointment of the arbitrator came to an end. The same was the case with the two successive arbitrators appointed thereafter. Subsequently another arbitrator was appointed and he too relinquished the charge as the petitioner did not cooperate with him for more than 4 years. Thus, the matter was pending adjudication for about nine years, and a notice under Section 8 of the Arbitration Act was issued by the petitioner calling upon the Respondent to appoint an arbitrator. But no such appointment was made. Thereafter the petitioner filed an application before the trial court for appointment of an arbitrator by the Court. The respondent contested the suit on merits and also on the ground of lack of territorial jurisdiction. The trial court allowed the application and appointed an arbitrator. It also revoked the appointment of the arbitrator made by the respondent during the pendency of the application before the trial court.
 Aggrieved against the said order, the respondent approached the High Court by way of a Civil Revision. The High Court gave its finding that there was want of jurisdiction on the part of the trial court; and that Section 8(1) (b) of the Arbitration Act did not apply since there was no 603 negligence or refusal by the respondent to appoint an arbitrator. Accordingly, the High Court set aside the order of the trial court appointing an arbitrator, who later made an ex-parte award without affording adequate opportunity to the respondent.
 Against the High Court's order, the petitioner preferred the present special leave petition.
 On behalf of the petitioner, it was contended that the appointment of the arbitrator made by the trial court should not have been interfered; that where a notice was issued by the petitioner calling upon the respondent to appoint an arbitrator, after the expiry of 15 days of that notice, the right to appoint arbitrator is forfeited; and since a part of the cause of action has arisen, within the territory as payment was made there by cheque, there was no lack of territorial jurisdiction.
 On behalf of the respondent, it was contended that Section 8 (1) (a) of the Arbitration Act had no application to a case in which the agreement provided for appointment of an arbitrator by one of the parties or by nominated persons;
 that where the parties have consented to a named person to be appointed as arbitrator, there was no application of Section 8 of the Act; and that merely because the arbitrator had hurried, that would not constitute failure of justice.
 Dismissing the special leave petition, this Court, 
 HELD: (Per Mohan, J.) 1. Sub-section (1) (a) of Section 8 of the Arbitration Act would apply to a case of initial appointment of an arbitrator or arbitrators. The implication is in the arbitration agreement that the arbitrator or arbitrators must not have been named. Where, therefore, they are named, this section will have no application. Similarly, the arbitrator or arbitrators are required to be appointed by all parties to the reference with consent. On the contrary, if there is some other mode of appointment, say Section 4, where the parties to the agreement agree that the arbitrator has to be appointed by a person designated in the agreement either by name or held, for the time being in office, certainly, the section will not apply.

 2. In view of clause 70 of the General Conditions of the Contract it would be clear that the arbitrator is to be appointed by the Engineer-in-Chief. Of course, if the arbitrator resigns or vacates his office or is unable or unwilling for some reason or other, then he may appoint another arbitrator. The Engineer-in-Chief acted in accordance with clause 70 and appointed an arbitrator. Even the vacancy arising from time to time was actually supplied by him. It cannot therefore be said that the respondent forfeited the right to appoint an arbitrator. There was no refusal or negligence on the part of the Engineer-in-Chief.
 As such the question of applicability of Sub-section (1) (b) of Section 8 of the Arbitration Act did not arise. [612E-H;

 3. The trial court ought not have appointed the arbitrator. The appointment of arbitrator by the court, has caused immense prejudice to the respondent. First and foremost there was not even an application on behalf of the petitioner under Section 12 for revocation of the appointment of the arbitrator made by the respondent. Then, again, the arbitrator appointed by the trial court took charge on 1.9.90 and issued a direction to the respondent to submit its defence on or before 20.9.90. The hearing date was fixed between 4th and 7th of October, 1990. A request was made though a telegram from the Chief Engineer not to proceed with the arbitration. However, the arbitration not finding the statement of defence forthcoming before 20th September, directed the same be filed before 1st of October.
 Even then no statement was filed. The Union of India had not entered appearance. An ex-parte award was made on 8.10.1990 for a huge sum of Rs. 90.67 lakhs. While the petitioner could not give details of the 605 four claims before the arbitrator earlier appointed, he filed as many as 29 claims before this arbitrator and they are all accepted. The arbitrator had given 335% as escalation with regard to claims No. 1 to 24. Apart from the haste with which the arbitrator had proceeded, the matter has not been considered in its proper perspective through a process of reasoning.
 [615B-E] PER THOMMEN, J. In view of the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present case, the challenge made against the High Court judgment is unsustainable. [605E-F]
