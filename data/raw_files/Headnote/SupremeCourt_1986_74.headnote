 The petitioners challenged the selection of candidates for admission to the first year of the MBBS and BDS degrees in the Government Medical Colleges at Srinagar and Jammu, the B.E. First Year Course in the Regional Engineering College, Srinagar, and the nominations made by the State Government to the Medical and Engineering Colleges outside the State for the academic year 1984-85.
 Admission to these courses was through entrance examinations consisting of a written test and a viva voce test, conducted separately for the medical and engineering courses. Under the procedure laid down in the Jammu & Kashmir Government Medical Colleges (Selection of Candidates for Admission to the First Year MBBS Course) Procedure Order, 1983, the written test carried 85 points and the viva voce test 15 points, making a total of 100 points. The points reserved for the viva voce test were sub-divided into 8 points for "Aptitude" and 7 points for "General knowledge and General Intelligence". A similar procedure was prescribed for admission to the Regional Engineering College, Srinagar. The entire proceedings during the interviews were to be recorded on a tape recorder. Fifty per cent of the total admissions were to be affected on the basis of open merit and the 561 remaining fifty per cent on the basis of merit from amongst A reserved categories including the Scheduled Castes, socially and educationally backward classes as well as residents of backward areas. Nominations to the institutions outside the State were to be made on the basis of merit in the select list.
 Annexure 1 to SRO 272 issued by the State Government on July 3, 1982 enumerated 1153 villages short of the Actual Line of Control Zone as backward areas of the State. SRO 334 dated June 13, 1983, raised this figure to 1754 villages.
 Thereafter SRO 335 dated June 14, 1983 added 25 villages and SRO 412 dated August 27, 1984 another 14 villages with the result that 1793 villages constituted the backward areas of the State. In regard to the Actual Line of Control Zone, SCO 335 added 9 villages to the 347 villages identified earlier.
 Candidates claiming consideration under the backward areas category were required to enclose a certificate by the Tehsildar in support of their claim to that benefit.
 It was contended for the petitioners that the selection of several candidates from the backward areas categories, including areas near the Actual Line of Control Zone, w invalid as the category includes areas which were not originally included in Annex. 1-to SRO 272 but have been added subsequently, that candidates shown as residing in urban areas of cities cannot be regarded as candidates from the backward areas category even though their respective families hailed from such areas, that the absence of minimum qualifying standard renders the selection of candidates from reserved areas categories arbitrary and invalid, that the allocation of only 85 points to the written test and as many as 15 points to the viva voce of a total of 100 point gives a weightage to the viva voce test over the written test which was unreasonable, that the marks assigned to the candidates during the viva voce test had been manipulated in order to ensure that the number of candidates selected from the Valley of Kashmir corresponded in proportion to the respective strengths of the communities in Kashmir, that notwithstanding the specific order made by the Court on March 19, 1985 the respondent State had failed to produce the worksheets of the individual members of the Selection Committee, that the Selection Committee by taking into account the behaviour, 562 physical bearing and power of oral expression of the candidates under the "general intelligence" during the viva voce test, had given importance to considerations which were hardly relevant for assessing the intelligence and suitability of the candidates, that candidates with inferior merit in the select list were admitted over the head of those with superior merit, and that the nominations of candidates made by the State Government to colleges outside the State were invalid in as much as they violated the criteria laid down by this Court.
 The special leave petition had been filed by the candidates against the order of the High Court setting aside their selection because of their inferior merit in the select list.
 Dismissing the writ petitions and the special leave petition, the Court, ^ 
 HELD : 1. The State Government could not be said to haw acted arbitrarily and without reason in identifying and adding more backward villages to the number enumerated in SCO 272 dated July 3, 1982. That list was open to further enlargement, and so was the case with subsequent notifications. It is perfectly possible for the conditions of a village to change during the years, and it is quite conceivable that a village considered suitably developed at one time should deteriorate thereafter to the point of becoming backward. [570 C-E] 
 2. Temporary residence in an urban area cannot deny a candidate the right of admission on the basis of a reserved category if in fact he belongs permanently to a village in a backward area. Because of the lack of higher educational facilities a candidate belonging to a village in the backward area may have to reside temporarily in a city where such education is available. It may also be that a parent of the candidate may pursuant to his employment, have taken up residence in an urban area. That in itself does not snap the bond between the candidate's family and their village, so long as the assumption of residence in the city is occasioned by temporary necessity. The candidates who claimed the benefit of permanent residence in backward areas have filed a certificate 563 from the Tehsildar in the prescribed form in support of their A claim, and there is nothing on record ex facie to doubt the correctness of that certificate. [571 F; 572 A-C;
 571 B-C] 
 3. The advertisement calling for applications for admission prescribed the minimum percentage of marks required in the specified examinations as a condition of eligibility for candidates generally, while laying down a lower minimum percentage for candidates belonging to reserved categories. That ensured not only that candidates with sufficiently suitable academic level were alone permitted to apply but also that the minimum percentage of marks attained by candidates from the several categories in the entrance examination would not fall below a reasonable level. Though no minimum has been prescribed as the bottom line for selecting candidates from the reserved categories, no such minimum has been prescribed for selecting candidates from the general category either. The rule must be that candidates are selected for admission from the different categories according to the order of merit. [572 F-H; 573 A- C] 
 4. The allocation of only 85 points to the written test and as many as 15 points to the viva voce test out of 100 points does not give a weightage to the viva voce test over the written test. It cannot be said to create an unreasonable imbalance in the evaluation of a candidate's ability. [573 F-G] Koshal Kumar Gupta & Ors. v, State of J & K & Ors., [1984] INSC 76; [1984] 3 S.C.R. 407 referred to.
 
 5. Unless there was clear evidence to show that there was a conscious attempt to ensure that the selection of candidates from different communities corresponded to the strength of those communities in the Valley of Kashmir, it cannot be said that there was any deliberate connection between the number of candidates selected and the strength of the respective communities from which they hail. [574 C- E] Triloki Nath & Anr, v. State of Jammu & Kashmir & Ors., [1968] INSC 120; [1969] 1 S.C.R. 103 referred to 
 6. A Selection Committee conducting the viva voce test should maintain the entire record, including the original worksheets on which the marks have been recorded by each 564 member separately, for a minimum period of one year after the examination. Failure to do so could strengthen an allegation of malafides against the Selection Committee.
 [575 F-G] 
 7. Where a viva voce test is permissible for the purpose of adjudging the general intelligence of the candidates, its three components behaviour, physical bearing and the power of oral expression become relevant. The presence of mind displayed by a candidate in answering a question in an index of general intelligence, and his power of oral expression is evidence of his ability to communicate intelligently. The third component-physical bearing, possesses a somewhat remote connection with general intelligence. It denotes the physical manner in which the candidate responds to the stress ant tension experienced by him during the interview. Though tenuous, this component is not so unrelated to general intelligence that it could be said to be an unreasonable element in deciding on a candidate's suitability. [577 F-H; 578 A-Bl 
 8. The admission of candidates is liable to be quashed unless they have been selected by virtue of their merit in the select list. If a candidate not holding a position of merit has been erroneously selected, the candidate who is qualified by virtue of his position in order of merit is entitled to be admitted in his place. [579 G-H] 
 9. Nominations to medical and engineering colleges outside the State shall be made strictly on the basis of a writ in the select list. me State Government must nominate candidates in place of the vacancies arising thereafter in accordance with the merit list which was in force in the State. [579 F] Suman Gupta & Ors. v. State of J & K & Ors., [1983] INSC 124; [1983] 3 S.C.R. 985 followed.
