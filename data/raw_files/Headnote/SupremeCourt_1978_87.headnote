 The original plaintiff one Kumud Bala Dasi filed a Title suit No. 82/195 with the permission of the High Court of Calcutta against the appellant claiming, recovery of possession of the suit land and alleging that what was attached by, the executing court for realisation of the money portion of the decree obtained by the Official Receiver in an earlier Title Suit No. 317/1939 filed by him and what was sold were the structures standing on the suit land and not both the land and the structures thereon. She, therefore, prayed for a declaration to that effect and consequently delivery of vacant and Khas possession of the suit land to her by removing the structures, standing thereon and to make over to her the sum unjustly realised by the appellant by letting out the said structures. 'The trial Court dismissed the suit, but the High Court on appeal reversed the judgment of the trial Court, gave' the declaration sought for and directed that on her depositing the value of the structures to be determined by the trial Court. the same would also become her property and she would get possession of the entire property and in default of the said deposit her suit would stand dismissed.
 Dismissing the appeal by certificate, the Court.
 
HELD : 1. In cases of this nature what has got to be ascertained is what is the nature of the right, title and interest which was really intended to be sold in execution of the decree. Any misapprehension in that behalf on the part of the Court or the purchaser cannot affect the true legal effect of the sale.
 In the present case, the right, title and interest of Kumud Bala Dasi in the suit and being the subject matter of pending litigation at the time of sale, in question what was sought and intended to be sold were the structures simpliciter, which meant only the materials of the structures and not the site underneath or appurtenant thereto nor the permanent tenancy rights in the site. On a conspectus of all the facts and circumstances of the case, the sale certificate cannot be construed as Conferring any right, title or interest on the appellant with respect to the permanent tenancy rights in the suit land which was underneath and, appurtenant to the structures.
