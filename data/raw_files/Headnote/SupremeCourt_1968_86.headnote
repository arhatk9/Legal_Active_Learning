 The Regional Transport Authority renewed a stage carriage permit in favour of the appellant The State Transport Appellate Authority set aside the order in appeal, and granted the permit to the 3rd respondent. One of the considerations that prevailed with the Appellate Authority was that the 3rd respondent had offered to put into service an air cooled 1965-model vehicle. The order of the Appellate Authority was confirmed by the High Court in a writ petition.
 In appeal to this Court under Art. 136, it was contended that after the renewal of the permit in his favour by the R.T.A. the appellant acquired a 1966-model bus which would have been equally serviceable; but this fact of acquisition of a new bus was not relied upon by the appellant before the Appellate Authority. It was also contended that the appellant was entitled to preference in the matter of renewal on the facts established in the present case.
 
HELD : This Court would be reluctant to interfere with or disturb the decision of specially constituted authorities or tribunals under the Motor Vehicles Act, especially when the legislature has entrusted the task of granting or renewing the stage carnage permits to such authorities which are expected to be fully conversant with the procedure and prac- tice and the matters relevant under the provisions of the Act. This Court will not decide a matter brought before it by special leave, under Art. 136, as if it were an appellate court. It will not examine or review findings of fact unless it can be shown that they are perverse or shocking to the judicial conscience. The power being of an exceptional and overriding nature has to be exercised sparingly and with caution and only in special and extraordinary situations when justice so requires.
