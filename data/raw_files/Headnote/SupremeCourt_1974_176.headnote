 The petitioner was detained under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971. He was served with the grounds for his detention. In a petition challenging the detention the District Magistrate filed his counter affidavit stating that lie had passed the order of detention after being bona fide satisfied from the. materials on record, that it was necessary to detain him and that the grounds furnished to the detenu were the only grounds on which he based his satisfaction for making the order, though other materials were also placed before him.' This Court wanted to look into the record in order to be satisfied that the. other materials were not such as would have in any manner influenced the District Magistrate in arriving at a subjective satisfaction.
 On the contention of the respondent that this Court ought not to do so when the District Magistrate had stated that he had arrived at the satisfaction, only on the grounds mentioned in the detention order, 
HELD : There is a possibility that the materials on record would disclose. activities of the detenu which were proximate and of a serious nature having. nexus with the object of the Act. If such elements exist then this Court would, be justified in taking the view that they must have influenced the subjective, satisfaction of the detaining authority. This Court has held that where' there are several grounds and if one ground is vague then it is difficult to say whether the ground which is vague and in respect of which the detenu could not make an effective representation did not influence the mind of the detaining authority in arriving- at the subjective satisfaction, and that the detention order would therefore be invalid. If so, it would be equally invalid in a case where there are other materials on which the detaining authority could have been influenced in arriving at the subjective satisfaction but which had not been mentioned in. the grounds of detention nor communicated to the detenu. Hence, whether the.. other materials on record had any effect on the mind of the detaining authority cannot be accepted solely on his statement. because, that would be accepting the mere ipsi dixit of the detaining authority. [62E-64B] It may be that the record and bio data of the detenu may disclose materials which have no nexus or proximity or are vague or, having regard to their nature or magnitude, are not such as would have been considered by the detaining authority as essential. In such a case the validity of the detention order would not be affected. [64B-C] In the present case, the other materials are remote in time and have no, nexus with the object of detention, and if they had been stated in the grounds or communicated to the detenu, the detention would have been held invalid. The Di- strict Magistrate, therefore, quite rightly. did not rely on those other' materials and was justified in his assertion that he did not do so. [64H-65B]
