 The petitioners, after a lapse of more than three years from the date of the High Court Judgment, filed the present petitions for enhancement of the rate of compensation to 17.50 per square yard on the ground that the Supreme Court in two cases decided on April 1, 1982 had enhanced the rate of compensation to Rs.17.50 per square yard for the adjacent land acquired. Counsel for the petitioners' con tended that the Court should not be unduly technical and deprive the citizens of their legitimate claims in view of the change in law by the introduction of sections 25 and 28A in the Land Acquisition Act by the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1984.
 Dismissing the petitions, 
 HELD: There is no reason to grant special leave in these cases which are hopelessly barred by time. Merely because the Supreme Court in the two cases enhanced the rate of compensation to Rs.17.50 per square yard, could not furnish a ground for condonation of delay under section 5 of the Limitation Act. [663D-E] 
 2.1 Section 28A of the Act in terms does not apply to the case of the petitioners for more than one reason. In the first place, they do not belong to that class of society for whose benefit the provision is intended and meant, i.e.
 inarticulate and poor people who by reason of their 661 poverty and ignorance have failed to take advantage of the right of A reference to the civil court under section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The petitioners had all applied for reference under section 18 of the Act and the civil court by adopting a different basis for computation, namely, treating the land to be potential building site, substantially enhanced the amount of compensation. On appeal, there was further enhancement by the High Court and the petitioners have withdrawn large sums of money at each stage. Evidently, the petitioners felt satisfied with the enhanced amount of compensation as awarded by the High Court @ Rs. 12.25 per square yard because they did not apply for grant of special leave under Art. 136 of the Constitution for more than three years. [662H; 663A-E] 
 2.2 There is also no provision in the Act apart from section 28A for reopening of an award which has become final and conclusive. If the conditions laid down in the section were satisfied, the petitioners could have availed of the remedy provided under section 28A of the Act. In that event, section 25 would ensure to their benefit. Any other view would lead to disasterous consequences not intended by the Legislature. [663E-G] Madras Port Trust v.
