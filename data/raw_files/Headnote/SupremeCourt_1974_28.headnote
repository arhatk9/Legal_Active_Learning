 The appellant developed illicit intimacy with the deceased.
 When the deceased feigned pregnancy and pressed him to marry her, he gave her a deadly poison mixed in milk. On the death of the deceased he wrapped the dead body in a blanket and left it in a railway compartment. He was convicted and sentenced to death.
 On appeal to this Court on the question of sentence 
HELD : While murder in its aggravated form and in the absence of extenuating factors connected with crime, criminal or legal process, still is condignly visited with death penalty, a compassionate alternative of life imprisonment in all other circumstances is gaining judicial ground. [357 G-H] In the instant case a few ameliorative features fall to be noticed since judicial temper has more components than indignation against murder. The appellant is in his twenties, not irrelevant in considering death sentence.
 He was a married man. He was promiscuous with women, a salacious sin for which the deceased was a contributory.
 The latter's pressure to get him to marry her must have planted the seed of murderous thought in him. He bargained for romance, encouraged by the-victim but her pretended pregnancy upset the appellant. Some planning and treachery have aggravated the crime. Yet another circumstance is that the man was sentenced to death nearly two years ago and the specter of death penalty must have tormented his soul.
 Taken separately, none of these matters may suffice to commute but the conspectus of factors, personal and social, tilt the scales in favour of life term. L357 El
