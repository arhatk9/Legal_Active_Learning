 The appellant purchased certain quantity of wheat flour from the Military Dairy Farm, Agra, which was declared unfit for human consumption., He exposed it for sale with a sign-board that the wheat flour was unfit for human consumption. The appellant wanted to sell it for lehi or for manure or for animal consumption. on complaint by the second respondent, the District Magistrate, Agra, passed an order prohibiting the sale under section 144 of the Cr. P.C.. The appellant was also prosecuted under U.P. Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, but was acquitted. The appellant applied to the Corporation for permission to sell the wheat flour..
 On September 17, 1945, Respondent No. 1 passed an order under section 44 of the U.P. Municipalities Act permitting the disposal of the flour under certain conditions. On representation made by the appellant, Respondent No. 1 passed a second order on October 8, 1945, inter alia, directing that the flour should not be sold for feeding animals kept for dairy purposes. The appellant filed a suit for damages against the respondents for stopping the sale and for imposing illegal restrictions effectively preventing the sale, resulting in deterioration of the flour and loss of profits. The trial court decreed the suit but the Allahabad High Court set it aside. On appeal to this Court, the question for consideration was whether the order purported to be passed by respondent no. 1 under section 244 was a valid order, and whether respondent No., 1 was liable to pay damages.
 
HELD : The phrase, "an article of food or drink appears to be intended for consumption of man," does not contemplate subjective satisfaction of the inspecting officer as held by the High Court. The seller should intend to sell an article of food for human consumption. His intention is an objec tive fact which should be proved by such evidence as a reasonable man will believe that the article of foodstuff is intended for human consumption. [781F] Section 244(1) contemplates a direct sale for human consumption. It does not contemplate, as the High Court had held, an indirect sale for human consumption. The High Court held that if the flour is sold for feeding milch animals or animals whose flesh is eaten, it would be a sale for human consumption. The legislature did not intend prevention of sale for consumption of animals to be regulated by sub-section (1) of Sec. 244. [781H] The appeal was partly allowed and remanded to the High Court for ascertaining the quantum of damages.
