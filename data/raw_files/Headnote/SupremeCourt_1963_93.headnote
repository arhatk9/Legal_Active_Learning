 A jat holding ancestral agricultural land in Jhajjar Tehsil of Rohtak district in Punjab has by custom a power to transfer 900 It for consideration. Such transfer is not liable to be set aside at the instance of his son or other reversionary heir unless the sale was for immoral purposes.
 The courts have consistently recognised such a power in a proprietor having sons in spite of the observation in Joseph's Customary Law Manual that "whether proprietor with sons has the same power is a more doubtful case", and that power must now be recognised.
 There is a great deal to be said in favour of the contention that the existence of a son does not affect that power as the restriction on power to alienate where it exists, is based on the agnatic theory.
