 One K who had a 0-2-3 share in certain properties in Uttar Pradesh went to Pakistan in 1947. The competent Officer took proceedings under the Evacuee Interest (Separation) Act, 1951, to separate the share of K in the property and as the. claimants were not prepared to purchase the share of K, he auctioned the entire property under s.10 of the Act. The petitioners contended that K was not an evacuee, that the property was not composite property, that the proceedings under the Act were void and that s. 10 of the Act was void as it contravened Arts. 31 and 19(i)(f) of the Constitution.
 The respondents urged that the interest of K in the property had automatically vested in the Custodian under U. P.
 Ordinance 1 of 1649 and this vesting was continued by Central Ordinance XII of 1949, by Central Ordinance XXVII of 1949 and Central Act XXXI of 1950 and any legal defect in the vesting was cured by Central Act 1 of 1960, that the property was accordingly composite property and was properly auctioned under the Separation Act. The Petitioners replied that U. P. Ordinance 1 of 1949 and Central 92 Ordinance XII of 1949, were void for want of legislative competence and there could be no vesting in law under their provisions which could be continued by subsequent Ordinances and Acts.
 Held, that the property was composite property and was properly auctioned under the Separation Act. As K was an evacuee under S. 2(C) of the U. P. Ordinance, her property automatically vested in the Custodian under s. 5 and it was continued under the Central Ordinance XII of 1949. Even if these two Ordinances were bad for legislative incompetence the purported vesting thereunder was continued under Central Ordinance XXVII of 1949 and thereafter under Central Act XXXI of 195o and any legal defect in such vesting was cured by Central Act 1 of 1960.
 Held, further that s. 10(a) of the Separation Act did not contravene Arts. 31 and 19(i)(f) of the Constitution and was not void. As the petitioners were not prepared to purchase the share of K, the Competent Officer acted properly in selling the property by public auction.
