 The appellant was tried for murder under s. 302 of the Indian Penal Code but was convicted only under s. 304 Part 11 of the Code. In holding him so guilty the trial court and the High Court did not fully believe ,the prosecution version of the incident but accepted the appellant's version in part whereby he claimed the right of self-defence. They however held on the facts that he had exceeded the right of self-defence and convicted him accordingly. In appeal before this Court it was contended that the accused's statement under s. 342 Criminal Procedure Code should only be considered in its entirety and a part of it cannot be used for the purpose of convicting him. In support of this contention reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in Narain Singh's case.
 
HELD : Both the courts below on the facts were justified in coming to the conclusion that the appellant exceeded his right of self-defence. Neither court had relied only on the, statement of the appellant under s. 342 Cr. P.C. to arrive at the finding. There was sufficient other evidence to warrant the conclusion that the right of private defence had been exceeded. In these circumstances the rule in Narain Singh's case namely that the conviction of an accused cannot be based on his statement ,alone where the statement does not amount to a confession, was not attracted. It is permissible, for the court to rely on a portion of the state ment of the accused and find him guilty in consideration of the other evidence against him led by the prosecution.
