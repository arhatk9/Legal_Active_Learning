 The predecessors-in-interest of the appellant, who were zamindars of Pargana Goas were in possession of certain ferries and were receiving income by letting out the right to transport passengers and goods and by levying toll on the ferries. The revenue payable to the Government in respect of the ferries was separately assessed at Rs. 4800, The right to the ferries was recognised as a right to property and, therefore, when, between the years 1857 and 1860 the ferries were declared public ferries by the Government of Bengal, under Regulation VI of 1819, the then zamindar was paid Rs. 53,000 odd as compensation being ten times the income received from the ferries in the year next after the resumption by the Government. Since on the resumption no abatement of revenue payable in respect of the ferries was granted, the then zamindar claimed such abatement. The claim was not refused by the Government but they collected the revenue under coercive process.
 The appellant's predecessor filed a suit in 1945 claiming the amount of revenue recovered from him in excess of the amount lawfully due from him, and also for a declaration that the revenues stood abated. The respondent contended that the compensation paid was nearly hundred times the amount of the net annual profits from the ferries and that.
 therefore, the amount of compensation must have included the capitalised value of the abatement of revenue payable for the ferries. The respondent also contended that the suit was barred by limitation and that the civil court had no jurisdiction.
 The trial court gave a decree for Rs. 14,440/- being the amount for three years immediately preceding the date of suit and also declared that there was a complete extinction of the liability to pay revenue in respect of the ferries.
 The High Court, in appeal, reversed the decree.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) There is nothing in the correspondence relating to the resumption of ferries to indicate that the compensation was to include the capitalised value for abatement of revenue. In the absence of any evidence to prove that the Government took into account the value of abatement of revenue and that the zamindar received the compensation agreeing to pay the revenue in respect of ferries resumed, the conclusion inevitably followed that on the resumption or acquisition of the ferries by the Government, the zamindar ceased to be liable to pay the annual revenue assessed upon the ferries. No adverse inference against the appellant could be drawn from the delay in making, the claim for abatement of revenue. [545 D- G] 538 (2) A right to collect revenue which is not due cannot he acquired by prescription and if the appellant and his predecessors had been compelled to pay SLIMS of money which they were not liable to pay the claim for refund Could properly be made within three years from the date on which the payment was made, and to the claim for a declaration of it right to abatement, there is no bar of limitation. Each demand for recovery by the Government confers a fresh cause of action,[1546A-C] (3) Regulation 19 of 1816, Regulation 6 of 1819, Act 1 of 1886 and the rules in the Bengal Tauzi Manual, 1940. do not indicate that the jurisdiction of the civil court was excluded in respect of matters relating to abatement of revenue. The decision in Secretary of State for India in Council v. Maharajadhiraja Kameshwar Singh Bahadur I.L.R. 15 Pat. 246 has no hearing on the present case. [1547 F; 548 D- F; 549 A-F]
