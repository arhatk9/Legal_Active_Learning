 The plaintiff's father and the fifth defendant were brothers. During his minority, the plaintiff filed a suit alleging that the business which his father and uncle were doing was ancestral in that it was being carried on with the capital given by his grandfather, that on the death of his grandfather his uncle proposed to his father for a nominal partition of the business and other family assets to avoid income tax, that in so doing he took two-thirds share in the business as well as in other assets but gave only one-third to his father and that lastly the partition, even if true, was "unequal, unfair and unconscionable." He further alleged that the partition did not bind the interest of the minor plaintiff and his minor brothers.
 During the pendency of the suit a reference was made to arbitration. The arbitrators gave an award. But that award was impugned by the defendants alleging that it was given without any enquiry and without giving the parties a chance to adduce evidence and that the arbitrators had no jurisdiction to reopen the partition. The trial court set aside the award. The plaintiff's appeal against this decision of the trial court was dismissed by the High Court holding that there was an error of law on the face of the award because the arbitrators had found that there was neither fraud nor misrepresentation and that unequal shares had been accepted voluntarily and yet had reopened the partition.
 After remand the trial judge found that the business was not ancestral but was only a joint business and that there was a complete partition of the joint family property, and that there was neither fraud nor misrepresentation in bringing about the partition. The trial court however observed that though the plaintiff's father voluntarily agreed to accept one-third share, the partition of the business was "unequal and unconscionable." It, however, dismissed the suit on the ground that the business was not ancestral and therefore the plaintiff had no right to reopen the partition.
 On appeal by the plaintiff the High Court found that the business being ancestral the sons of the two brothers acquired interest by birth and that so far as the partition was concerned there was no fraud or undue influence vitiating the partition. It, however, affirmed the trial court's view that one-third share given to the plaintiff's father was unfair and prejudicial to the interests of the minors.
 In appeal to this Court the defendants contended that the partition could not be reopened by the plaintiff because he and his brothers were represented in the partition by their father and there was no allegation of fraud or misrepresentation.
 672 Dismissing the appeal, the Court, ^ 
 HELD : 1. It is not the practice of this Court to interfere with findings of fact arrived at by the High Court except to prevent gross miscarriage of justice. [676 B] In the instant case there is no justifiable ground to go behind the findings of fact. [676 C] 
 2. It is well established that simply because a matter has been decided at an earlier stage by interlocutory order and no appeal has been taken therefrom or no appeal did lie, a higher court is not precluded from considering the matter again at a later stage of the same litigation. The correctness of an order of remand passed by the High Court which was not questioned at that time by filing an appeal in the Supreme Court can nevertheless be challenged later in the Supreme Court in the appeal arising out of the final judgment pronounced in the action.

 Where an application under Order IX, r. 7 was dismissed and an appeal was filed against the decree in the suit in which the application was made, the propriety of the order rejecting the reopening of the proceeding might, without doubt, be canvassed in the appeal and dealt with by the appellate court. [676 G] In the present case the same principle applies and the parties could challenge in this Court in the appeal against the final judgment in the suit any finding given by the High Court at the earlier stage in the suit when the award made by the arbitrators was set aside and the suit thrown open for trial. [676H, 677A] 
 3. Even though there was no fraud, misrepresentation or undue influence a partition could be reopened at the instance of a minor coparcener, despite the fact that his branch was represented by his father at the partition, if the partition was unfair or prejudicial to the interest of the minor. The entire partition need not be reopened if the partition was unfair in regard to a distinct and separable part of the scheme of partition. In such an event the reopening of the partition could be suitably circumscribed.
