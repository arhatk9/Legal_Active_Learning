 As a measure of concession to small-scule manufacturers, Notification No. 80/80-C.E. dated 19-6-1980 issued under r.
 8(1) of the Central Excise Rules, 1944 exempted from duty certain excisable goods and, paragraph 2 thereof stipulated inter alia that the concession would not be available to a manufacturer if the aggregate value of clearances of the specified goods by him for home consumption during the preceding financial year had exceeded Rs.15 lakhs.
 Explanation V thereto provided that where any specified goods were used within the factory of production for further manufacture of any other specified goods and, where both the former and the latter categories of specified goods fell under the same item of the First Schedule to the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944, the clearances of the former category of specified goods shall not be taken into account for calculating the aggregate value of clearance under the notification.
 The appellant which was engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling electric motors, availed of the aforesaid exemption for the periods 1-4-1980 to 30-11-1980 and 1-4-198l to 30-9-198l. The Excise Authority issued a demand for payment of duty on the ground that its clearance exceeded the limit of Rs.15 lakhs. On appeal, the demand for the period 1-4-1980 to 30-11-1980 was set aside but the demand for the Period 1-4-l98l to 30-9-1981 was sustained.
 On further appeal, the Appellate Tribunal observed that for the year 1980-81 the appellant had disclosed a clearance of Rs.13,43,443.55 on account of electric motors for home consumption and Rs.6,51,138.50 on account of electric motors "for captive consumption" in the manufacture of monoblock pumps. The Tribunal held that while electric motors were mentioned under Tariff Item 30, power driven pumps were specified under Tariff Item 30-A, and therefore, the electric motors captively consumed as inputs in the PG NO 878 PG NO 879 manufacture of power driven pumps could not be excluded. The further contention that the appellant had mistakenly stated that electric motors had been used for monoblock pumps whereas only rotors and stators which were integral components of monoblock pumps had been used and therefore the same Tariff Item was attracted entitling it to the concession was also rejected by the Tribunal.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
 HELD: The contention that the goods in question could not be said to have been cleared from the factory since they were employed in the manufacture of monoblock pumps within the factory itself has no force. As soon as the manufacture of the goods was completed they must be regarded as goods available for clearance from the factory, and there is nothing to show that when fitted into monoblock pumps they were not removed to another part of the factory for that purpose. The process of manufacture of those goods is distinct, separate and complete in itself and at the end of the manufacturing process, the goods in question represent a completed product. [882E-F] Whether the goods in question were rotors and stators and whether they formed integral components of monoblock motors is a question of fact considered and concluded by the Tribunal and it cannot be entertained at this stage [882B]
