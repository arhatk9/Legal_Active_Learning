 Applications for bringing on record the legal representatives of one of the appellants in a Regular Second Appeal, were dismissed by the High Court. However, the High Court partly allowed the Regular Second Appeal.
 The present appeals have been filed against the High Court's orders. It was contended on behalf of the appellants that since the decree made was in favour of a dead man also, the decree should be set aside.
 Dismissing the appeals, this Court, 
 HELD: 1. Applications under Order 22 Rules 3 and 9 read with section 151 CPC were made to bring the heirs of the deceased on record as appellants in the main appeal and, since the appeal was allowed in part, the High Court ought to have considered the applications on merits. However, this is not a good ground for setting aside the decree. At the most, there would be a case for remand; but even that is not necessary for the applications are clearly allowable.
 There was a delay of 15 days in the application to bring the heirs on record and it was explained, supported by a medical certificate, that the third appellant, who was looking after the appeals before the High Court, has suffered from typhoid during the relevant period. [593-H;
 594-A] Harjeet Singh v. Raj. Kishore & Ors., [1984] 3 SCC 573, relied on.
