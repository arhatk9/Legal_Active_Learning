 On January 26, 1950 the Autonomous District of United Khasi- Jaintia Hills was constituted by virtue of the provisions of cl. 2 of Art. 244 and the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution of India. and the Governor of Assam was empowered to administer the said Autonomous District. Pursuant thereto the Assam Autonomous District (Constitution of District Councils) Rules. 1961 were enforced as from October 15, 1951. On June 27, 1952 a District Council and an Executive Committee was constituted for the said autonomous District.
 The District Council was empowered to constitute courts and appoint suitable persons as Presiding Officers. On June 7, 1954 the United Khasi-Jaintia Hills Autonomous District(Administration of Justice) Rules, 1953 were framed by the District Council. Under r. 9 a District Council Court was constituted for the Autonomous District. Judges were to be appointed by the Executive Committee with the approval of the Governor. In the absence of any rules framed by the District Council under r. 15 of the Constitution of District Council Rules, the Assam Fundamental Rules, subsidiary Rules and instructions were applicable to the officers and staff or the District Council. The respondent who was an Additional District Judge in the senior Grade of the Assam Judicial Service was appointed with effect from 7-1-1954 temporarily as a Judge of the District 'Council Court without the approval of the Governor. The Governor however appointed him also as an Additional District Judge, Lower Assam District. The scale of pay was Rs. 750-960-1000. On 16-2-1957 the respondent attained the age of superannuation on his completion of 55 years. Notwithstanding this the District Council continued him in service and by its order dated 22-4-1965 placed him in the regular scale of Rs. 1200-60 (E.B.)-60.1500 with effect from 1-4-1965. However subsequently the Executive Committee terminated his services with effect from August 31, 1966. The respondent challenged this order by writ petition in the High Court. Thereafter by special leave the matter came up in appeal before this Court. The question for consideration was whether in view of the definition of a permanent post under Assam Fundamental Rule 9(22) as a post 'carrying a definite scale of pay, sanctioned without limit of time', the respondent was a permanent employee.
 
HELD : The respondent's employment was temporary and was continuing as such. Merely placing him in a scale of pay which was different to the one in which he was temporarily appointed did not make him a permanent employee. To become permanent he must be confirmed but that question could never arise because under Fundamental Rule 56 which was admittedly applicable to him the date of his compulsory retirement was the date on which he attained the age of 55 years. After this he 9 0 4 could be retained with the sanction of the Government which admittedly in his case had not been given. Even if the validity of his appointment by the District Council without the sanction of the Governor which was a necessary condition for valid appointment was overlooked, he could not complain that his termination by the very Council was without the Government's sanction. [906 E-G] The argument that the Governor had invested the Respondent with powers for the Schedule Districts and lower Assam was unhelpful because this was done in 1954 long prior to his attaining the age of superannuation, when without a valid extension of the service he could not continue in service after that date. [906 H] Accordingly the appeal must be allowed and the writ petition dismissed.
 [Personal remarks by the Chief Justice of the High Court against another judge of that Court disapproved.]
