 The appellant in the appeal was the landlord. He sought an adjournment of the hearing of his appeal that was pending before the Additional District Judge on the ground of indisposition of his senior counsel. The respondent tenant was a leading member of the local bar. The Additional District Judge refused the prayer, but granted three days' time for making alternative arrangements and directed that the appeal be posted for hearing of further arguments and that on failure to urge arguments, the judgment would be pronounced. On the adjourned date, the appellant again sought adjournment on the ground that he could not secure the services of his out-station senior counsel and that his counsel would not be able to appear for at least a month and that he may be granted further time to engage another senior counsel. The Additional District Judge refused the adjournment on the ground that more than sufficient time had been granted for additional arguments, and added: "The judgment is ready which is delivered". The appeal was dismissed by pronouncing the judgment which had been kept 'ready for being delivered'.
 A writ petition to the High Court by the appellant under Art. 227 was rejected in limine.
 In the appeal to this Court, it was contended on behalf of the appellant that: (1) as the respondent was a leading and influential member of the local bar, members of the local bar were not willing to appear in the matter and that the appellant was genuinely handicapped in securing the services of an out-station senior counsel and (2) that even though the appeal was fixed for making further oral submissions on the adjourned date, the Additional District Judge kept the judgment ready and pronounced it when the appellant appeared and requested for further time to engage a senior counsel.
 918 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: The judgment rendered by the District Judge is vitiated by reason of the failure to grant reasonable opportunity of hearing to the appellant and by reason of the procedure adopted in connection with the preparation and pronouncement of the judgment. The High Court also erred in rejecting the writ petition summarily. The judgment and order passed by the High Court as well as those passed by the Additional District Judge are set aside and the matter remitted to the Court of the District Judge for being disposed of, after affording a reasonable opportunity of hearing to both the parties.
 [924-G-925 B] In the eyes of litigant a senior member of the bar when shed personally, might enjoy certain amount of sympathy with the members of the judiciary before whom he is practising day in and day out. This aspect cannot be overlooked having regard to the realities of life. [922 D] The learned Judge should have shown awareness of this dimension of the matter and bearing in mind the adage that 'justice must also appear to have been done', ought to have dealt with the request for a short adjournment with a degree of understanding. [922 E] It is common knowledge that when a leading member of the Bar is sued or sues in a personal capacity, the members of the Bar where he is practising are more than reluctant to accept a brief against the colleague and friend on account of personal relations or on account of likelihood of embarrassment. In a matter like this, the litigant pitted against a leading member of the Bar, may also want to engage a counsel of his choice and confidence for it may well appear to him that not every member of the Bar might present his case with the degree of zeal, enthusiasm sincerity and conviction which ordinarily a litigant expects from his advocate. [922 H ; 923 A] The learned Judge could not have armed himself with a readymade judgment dismissing the appeal when further arguments on behalf of the appellant were yet to be heard.
 And apparently there was no time-compulsion to pronounce the judgment on that very day. The Judgment rendered by the learned Judge is thus vitiated by reason of the failure to grant reasonable opportunity of hearing to the appellant and by reason of the procedure adopted in connection with the preparation and pronouncement of the judgment. [924 F-G] It was also not difficult to realise that a landlord is the last person interested in prolonging the eviction proceedings or the appeal arising from the order passed in such proceedings. The Additional District Judge should have shown awareness of this dimension of the matter, and under the circumstances, might well have granted a short adjournment to enable the appellant to engage a senior counsel of his choice and confidence.
