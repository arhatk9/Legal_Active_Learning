 The respondent, an income tax officer obtained goods on credit from several shops without paying for the same. He was prosecuted and convicted under s. 5(2) of the Prevention of the Corruption Act, 1947. The High Court held that no offence under cl. (b) or cl. (d) of s. 5(1) was proved.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : There was consideration for the obtaining of goods on credit and it cannot, be said that an officer if the.
 obtains, goods on credit, even if he does not intend to pay is obtaining a valuable thing without consideration. The case may be different if it is proved that there was an agreement with the trader that. the trader would not demand the money and the officer would not pay. There is no evidence to sustain such an inference in this case. [317C] The words 'pecuniary advantage' are of wide amplitude; but even so in the-context of s. 5(1) (d) obtaining goods on credit cannot be held to amount to obtaining pecuniary advantage. If there is an agreement between the officer and the trader that the officer is not expected to pay for the goods this would amount to obtaining pecuniary advantage.
 It does not appear that there was any suggestion that the respondent obtained the credit only because he was an income tax officer. [317E]
