 Respondent No. I who was a Banking Officer in the Reserve Bank of India applied for the post of Assistant General Manager in Lakshmi Commercial Bank. he was selected for the said post and he joined in March 1983. In 1985 on an application made by the Reserve Bank under Section 45(1) of the Banking Regulation Act,1949, the Central Government passed an order of moratorium under Section 45(2) of the said Act, in respect of Lakshmi Commercial Bank and it came to be amalgamated with Canara bank. The services of the employees of Lakshmi Commercial Bank were continued with Canara Bank, and respondent No. 1 was fitted in the post of Divisional Manager in Canara Bank, and respondent No. 1 was fitted in the post of Divisional Manager in Canara Bank. He claimed that he should be fitted against a higher post by virtue of his position as Assistant General Manager in Lakshmi Commercial Bank. He also claimed that he was entitled to continue in service till he attained the age of 60 years which was the age of superannuation in Lakshmi Commercial Bank. His representations were rejected by the petitioner Bank and the Reserve Bank Thereafter respondent No. 1 filed a writ petition before the High Court claiming the relief that he should be allowed to continue in service till be attains the age of 60 years.
 The High Court allowed the Writ Petition. Aggrieved against the High Court's order, the petitioner-bank has preferred this appeal by special leave.
 The appellant-bank contended that on the basis of Section 45 of the 69 Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and the consequent amalgamation of Lakshmi Commercial Bank with Canara bank, the service conditions under Lakshmi Commercial Bank would not be available to the respondent No. 1; and that the terms and conditions of service applicable to employees of corresponding rank and status in Canara Bank would only apply.
 Allowing the appeal, this Court, 
 HELD: 1. Respondent No. 1 could not claim to be governed by the age of superannuation of 60 years applicable to him in Lakshmi Commercial Bank. When his services were continued on amalgamation of Lakshmi Commercial Bank with Canara Bank, he became an employee of Canara Bank and was, therefore, entitled only to the right given by proviso (ii) to clause (i) of sub-section (5) of Section 45 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 which entitled him to the same terms and conditions of service as employees of the corresponding rank or status in Canara Bank. Age of superannuation of the employees in Canara Bank being 58 years only, Respondent No. 1 could not claim to retire at 60 years. The High Court misconstrued clause (i) and proviso (ii) thereunder of Sub-section (5) of section 45 of the Act and clauses 10 and 12 of the amalgamation scheme, to take the contrary view. [80D,E] 
 2. It is not necessary that every scheme of amalgamation framed under sub-section (4) of Section 45 must provide for continuance of service of all the employees of the banking company in the transferee bank; but where such a provision is made it must contain a provision as required by provision is made it must contain a provision as required by proviso in clause (i). This is clear from the use of the word `may' in the opening words of sub-section (5) and the word `shall' in the proviso. If the scheme for amalgamation provides for continuance of the service of the employees in the transferee bank, then beyond a period of three years from the date on which the scheme is sanctioned by the Central Government, the transferee bank cannot discriminate between such employees and its other employees of corresponding rank or status. The only right of such an employee whose service is so continued is, therefore, to claim parity with the employees of the transferee bank itself of corresponding rank or status subject equivalent qualification and experience and no more. The right of such an employee is provided in the proviso to clause (i) and not in the earlier enacting part of clause (i) of sub-section 70 (5) of Section 45 of the Act as claimed by respondent No. 1 and upheld by the High Court. [78F,G] State Bank of Travancore v. Elias Elias & Ors., [1970] INSC 175; [1971] 2 SCR 28, referred to.
 
 3. Clauses 10 and 12 of the Amalgamation Scheme merely incorporate the matter specified in clause (i) and the prviso thereunder. There is no ambiguity or conflict in those clauses of the scheme either inter se or with clause (i) and the proviso thereunder in sub-section (5) of Section 45 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
