 Section 3 of the Kosi Area (Restoration of Lands to Raiyats) Act. 1951, provides for the restoration to former raiyats by the Collector, on his own motion or otherwise, of lands which were sold for arrears of rent or from which they were ejected for arrears of rent or which were treated as abandoned between January 1, 1939 and December 31, 1950, due to floods in the Kosi river. Under s. 7, the Collector is to determine, after inquiring into any objections, the land liable to be restored to the raiyat, the amount payable by him for the restoration being the cost of improvement, if any, to whom that amount is payable, whether it should be paid in instalments, and the amount of each instalment. The instalments shall. however, be payable within a period not exceeding 5 years. Section 13 states that, subject to appeal, orders passed by the Collector are final, and s. 16 provides that the decision on appeal shall be final.
 The respondent applied for restoration of land which was sold in execution of a decree for arrears of rent. On February 17, 1958, an order for restoration was made in respect of a part of the area and compensation was directed to be paid to the appellant in three instalments. The order added that if the first instalment was not paid within the specified period, "the applicant would lose the benefit of the order of restoration". The respondent did not pay the first instalment within the time prescribed for its payment, but appealed to the Appellate Authority. The appeal was dismissed and the respondent filed a revision before the Commissioner (though the Act did not provide for a revision against the order of the Appellate Authority), and the Commissioner allowed the revision. The appellant filed a writ petition and the High Court quashed the Commissioner's order. A further appeal to the Supreme Court by the respondent was dismissed for non-prosecution. Thereafter, on October 15, 1965, the respondent applied for an order extending the time for payment fixed by the order of February 17, 1958, and for permission to deposit the entire amount then determined in one lumpsum. The respondent was allowed to do so. The appellant's appeal was allowed by the Appellate Authority. But, the High Court allowed the respondent's writ petition on the grounds, (1) that the first order of February 17, 1958 was not a final order and, therefore, time could be extended notwithstanding the expiry of the period fixed by the 1958 order for payment of the first instalment; (2) that the Court's action should not prejudice any party and, therefore, excluding the time taken for the various remedies pursued by the respondent, the application made on October 15,1965 was within the period of 5 years from the original order; and (3) in any case, the delay could be and must be deemed to have been, condoned under s. 5, Limitation Act. 1963.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court.
 ^ 
 HELD : (1) The order of February 17, 1958, made it clear that on failure to pay the first instalment within the specified period, the benefit of the order would be lost.
 This is no doubt a conditional order; it is not, however, an nterlocutory order, but is a final order. [850G] 846 (2) The principle that the "Court's action should not prejudice any party" has no relevance in the context of the present case. The remedies pursued by the respondent were steps taken by him at his own risk and he cannot, as matter of right, ask for excluding the time spent on those proceedings. [850H-851A] (3)(a) Section 5, Limitation Act cannot be invoked in connection with the application of October 15, 1965, because, (i) the officer to whom the application was made was not a Court; and (ii) there is no time limit prescribed for the application which could be extended under the section. [751-AB] (b) The application is not for extension of time to pay the instalments, but for permission to pay in a lumpsum, and hence, is a fresh application. But, successive applications are not permitted under the Act, because, (i) the finality attached to the orders would become meaningless; (ii) there would be uncertainty and confusion; and (iii) that there should be finality in litigation and that a person should not be vexed twice for the same cause, are well-established principles of general application.
