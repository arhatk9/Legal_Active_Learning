 A formal agreement executed in 1941, between the Ruler of jodhpur and the appellant provided that the State would exempt the appellant from State or Federal excise duty and income-tax, super-tax, surcharge or any other tax on income and that if the appellant had to pay any such duty or tax, the State would refund the same to the appellant. After India had attained independence, jodhpur joined the United State of Rajasthan on April 7, 1949. On January 26, 1950, Rajasthan became a Part B State. The Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944, was extended to Rajasthan from April 1, 1950, and the Union of India recovered excise duty from the appellant for the period 1-4-1950 to 31-3-1952. Similarly, the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, was extended to Rajasthan and the Union sought to assess and recover income-tax from the appellant. The appellant contended that it was not liable to pay any excise duty or income-tax on the grounds that the agreement of. 1941 with, the Ruler of jodhpur under which the exemptions were granted was law which continued in force and that even if the agreement was purely contractual, the rights and obligations thereunder were accepted by each succeeding Sovereign and under Art. 295 (1) (b) of the Constitution they became the rights and obligations of the Government of India which could not be abrogated by any law.
 The appellant further contended that under the agreement it was entitled to a refund from the State of Rajasthan of the excise duty paid by it.
 Held, that the appellant was liable to pay the excise duty and income-tax.
 The 1941 agreement was not law and did not have the force of law. I Every order' of a Sovereign Ruler cannot be treated as law irrespective of the nature or character thereof, 516 The true nature of the order has to be considered and the order, to be law must have the characteristics of 'law,' that is of a binding rule of conduct as' the expression of the will of the Sovereign, which does not derive its authority from a mere contract. An agreement which is based solely on the consent of the parties is different from a law which derives its sanction from the will of the Sovereign.
 The 1941 agreement was entirely contractual in nature and was not law, as it had none of the characteristics of law.

 The 1941 agreement contained no term and no undertaking as to exemption from excise duty or income-tax to be imposed by the Union Legislature in future. As such the question of succeeding Sovereigns accepting such a term and an obligation arising therefrom under Art.295 (1) (b) did not arise. Apart from this, the correspondents showed that neither the United State of Rajasthan nor the Part B State of Rajasthan affirmed this agreement. Even if the obligation under the agreement continued and Art. 295 (1) (b) was applicable to it, there was nothing in Art. 295 which Prohibited Parliament from enacting a law as to excise duty or income-tax altering the terms of the agreement.
