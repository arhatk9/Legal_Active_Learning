 The respondent was dismissed from government service.
 His appeal to the President against his dismissal was heard by the Minister in the Ministry of Finance, and was rejected. A single judge of the High Court dismissed his writ petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution but the division bench quashed the order of dismissal, holding that the functions and duties of the President as an appellate authority under the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules 1957, were not part of the business of the Government of India nor were they part of the President's duty under the Constitution. It further held that the Minister had no right to deal with the appeal which had been preferred to the President of India under the Rules On appeal it was contended in this Court for the respondent that hearing appeal under a statutory rule a quasi-judicial act and it could not be delegated by the President to the Minister Allowing the appeal, ^

Such a question falls within the ambit of purely executive function of the President in the case of the Union Government of the Governor in the case of State. Such a function being ultimately an ultimately an executive function of the President, the fact that final order is preceded or accompanied by a quasi-judicial inquiry held by the Minister did not affect the character of the exercise of that function by the President.
