 The petitioner was detained under the West Bengal Prevention of Violent Activities Act, 1970. The grounds for detention stated that he, along with others, on two, occasions, entered the premises of educational institutions, set fire to books, registers, furniture etc., placed bombs in the building and threatened the staff with death and thereby committed "mischief" disturbing "public order" within the meaning of S. 3(2)(b) of the Act. The petitioner's representation was received by the State Government on May 27, 1971. On June 7, 1971 the petitioner's case was placed before the Advisory Board. The State Government considered the representation and rejected it by its order dated July 1, 1971. On July 9, 1971 the Board reported that there was in its opinion sufficient cause for the petitioner's detention.
 The petitioner sent his habeas corpus petition from jail in which he denied the allegations made against him. At the hearing of the petition, the counsel for the petitioner raised two additional grounds (i) that the grounds furnished to the detenu did not constitute breach of public order., and therefore, the detention was illegal; and (ii) that the delay in considering the petitioner's representation. Nas inordinate, and therefore, was in violation of Article 22(5) of Constitution.
 Dismissing the petition, 
HELD : (i) According to the Report of the Advisory Board, there was sufficient material justifying the order and in the absence of any definite material, it is not possible lo accept the vague allegations by the petitioner. [780 E] (ii)Ordinarily grounds which (lo not find any place in the petition would not be permitted to be raised before this Court. But since this was a habea scorpus petition and furthermore, made by the petitioner from jail such grounds could be allowed to be raised. [78 F] (iii)The true distinction between the area of law and order and public order is one of degree of extent of the breach of the act in question upon society. Any contravention of law always affects order, but before it could be said to affect 'public order' it must affect the community at large. Acts similar in nature, but committed in different contexts and circumstances might affect the problem of law and order and in another, the breach of public order. The analogy of crimes against individuals and crimes against the public, though useful to a limited extent, would not always be apt.

 (iv) The distinction drawn by Clause (b) of S. 3(2) is between causing fire to building of an educational institution simpliciter and committing mischief of the same nature but such that it disturbs or is likely to disturb the even tempo of the community in that particular locality.
 The object of the acts complained of as vandalism, to disturb the working of the institution by burning its records and to create a scare so that neither the teaching staff, nor the pupils would dare attend it for prose caution of studies. In these circumstances the alleged acts did not merely constitute mischief under S. 425 of the Penal Code, but constituted such mischief which disturbed or was likely to disturb public order and, therefore, fell within the definition in Section 3(2)(b) [81 G-H] (v) In the circumstances of the present case, it cannot be held that the delay was so inordinate as to affect the validity of the detention. No doubt, the delay in deciding the representation was 34 days, but most of it was due to the fact that the representation and the record remained with the Board. In a given case, Government may not be able to reach a proper conclusion within a short time especially, where another authority has passed the questioned order. 183 F] Jayanarayan Sukul v.
