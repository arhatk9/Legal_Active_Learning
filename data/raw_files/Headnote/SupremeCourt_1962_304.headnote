 The appellant company was carrying on both life and other kinds of insurance business. On the coming into force of the Life insurance Corporation Act, 1956, by virtue of s. 7 all rights appertaining to the life insurance business of an insurer became vested in the Corporation on the appointed day, that is, September 1956. Under the provisions of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, an assessee became entitled to a refund where the tax deducted from the income of his securities or the amount by which the dividend paid to him on his shares had to be increased under 's. 16(2)of that Act for computation of his income, or both taken together, exceeded the amount of tax payable by him. By virtue of the provisions, under the orders of assessment to income-tax for the year 1955-56 and 1956-57, the appellant became entitled to certain refunds, but these assessment orders were made after September 1, 1956. The respondent Corporation claimed to be entitled to portions of the aforesaid refunds under the provisions of s. 7 of the Life Insurance Corporation Act. The question was (1) whether the right to refund was a right existing on September 1, 1956, and (2) whether it appertained to the life insurance business of the appellant within the meaning of s. 7.
 Held : (1) that the right to the refund which accrued to the appellant existed on September 1, 1956. Though the actual assessment only particularised the amounts of refund, it did not create the right, for the right came into existence as 981 soon as, according to the relevant Finance Act, it became ascertainable that the tax deducted at source or treated as paid on its behalf exceeded the tax payable.
 (2)that the right to the refund was one appertaining to the life insurance business. The income from shares and securities held by the appellant as provided by the Insurance Act, 1938, and appertaining to the life insurance business must itself be treated as appertaining to that business; and when it was refunded as having been utilised in payment of the tax in excess of what was due it could not change its previous nature, and would still remain the income of the life insurance business. The right to the return of this income would, therefore, also be a right appertaining to the life insurance business.
 The proportion in which the refund was to be distributed between the life business and the general business laid down.
