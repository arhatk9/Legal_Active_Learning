 On March 26, 1954 the Income-tax authorities issued a notice to the respondents under s. 34(1) (a) of the Indian Income- tax Act, 1922 in respect of assessment year 1945-46. The assessment made pursuant to the notice was set aside by the appellate authorities on the ground that the notice under s.
 34(1) (a) was time barred because the assessment year in question was beyond the period of 8 years covered by s.
 34(1)(a). Sub-ss. (1A) to (ID) were inserted in s. 34 by the Income-tax (Amendment) Act 1954. By sub-s. (1A) power was given to the Income-tax authorities to issue notice in respect of escaped income of the previous years within the period September 1, 1939 to March 31, 1946. By the, Finance Act 1956 with effect from April 1, 1956 s. 34(1) (a) was amended so that notices in respect of escaped income could be issued 'at any time' subject to certain conditions. On July 25, 1958 the Income-tax Officer again issued a notice to the respondents calling upon them to file a return for the assessment year 1945-46. An appeal to the Central Board of Revenue by some of respondents failed. Thereupon they filed a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution challenging the notice on various grounds. Their main contention was that no notice under s. 34(1) (a) could be issued in respect of the war years as the escaped income of the said war years was governed by s. 34(1A), whereunder notices could be issued only up to March 31, 1956. The High Court having taken a view favourable to the respondents, the Revenue appealed to this Court by special leave.
 It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the terms of s. 34(1) (a) after its amendment in 1956 were clear and unambiguous and the scope of the expression 'at any time' could not be curtailed by construction and that s. 34(lA) did not operate to restrict the operation of s. 34(1) (a) in respect of the war years. On behalf of the respondents it was contended that s. 34(lA) was a species of which s. 34(1) (a) was genus that in respect of the war years there was a conflict between the two subsections, and that in view of the maxim, generalia specialibus non derogant, s. 34(1A) should prevail.
 HELD:(i) It would not be appropriate to describe sub-s.
 (1A) as one carved out of sub-s. (1) (a) or to call it a species of which sub-s. (1) (a) is the genus. When s.
 34(lA) was enacted s. 34(1)(a) had practically ceased to function in respect of the war years. Again when s.
 34(1)(a) was amended with effect from April 1, 1956 s.
 34(1A) had practically ceased to operate as no notices under it could be issued after-March 31, 1956. There is no conflict between the two sub-sections after that date. The wide phraseology of the amended s. 34(1)(a) takes 380 in all the escaped concealed incomes during all the years commencing from 1941 and confers power on the Income-tax Officer to give notice thereunder in respect of the said income without any bar of limitation. [390 C-F] (ii)Sub-Section (1A) does not really prescribe any period of limitation. It enables the Income-tax Officer to take proceedings within a particular time, though the period of limitation had expired. It conferred a special power on the Income-tax Officer which expired on April 1, 1956. The non- obstante clause in sub-s. (1A) indicates that it was enacted to operate notwithstanding that the period of 8 years had expired. The said sub-section served its purpose only when the period of 8 years governed a notice under sub-s. (1) (a). But when that bar of limitation was ,removed, sub-s.
 (1A) had become otiose. [390 G-391 A] Further sub-s. (1B) as amended by the Finance Act of 1956 and sub-s. 4 added by the Indian Income-tax Act (Amendment) Act 1959, also reinforces the construction that sub-s. 34(1) (a) as amended in 1956 was applicable to, the war years despite sub-s. 34(1A). [391 B., D-E] (iii)The reason why sub-s. (1A) was retained in the statute even after the Finance Act of 1956 was that though no new notices could be issued under that sub-section after April 1, 1956, notices already issued before that date were pending. They could be disposed of in the manner prescribed by sub-ss. (1A), (1B), (1C), and (1D) of s. 34. All the aid sub-sections formed an integral code. The legislature, presumably, intended to keep the said sub-sections whereunder proceedings had already been initiated and make available to the said proceedings the procedure prescribed under the said provisions. It may also be that sub-s. (1A) was kept in super abundant caution. Whatever that may be, it cannot, in the circumstances, detract from the clear provisions of sub-s. (1) (,a).
