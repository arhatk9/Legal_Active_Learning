 The property in question was requisitioned by the Government of India with effect from 17 July 1942 under Rule 75(A) of the Defence of India Rules, 1939. The Government was in possession of the property until the Government decided to acquire the property in 1953. There was dispute between the Government and the appellants, in whose favour the property was held under trust, in regard to the compensation payable.
 Under s. 8(1) of the Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act 1952 the Government appointed tile District Judge, Patna as the sole Arbitrator. The Arbitrator held that the provisions of s. 8(3) (b) of the 1952 Act under which the compensation payable was twice the price which the requisitioned property would have fetched in tile open market if it had been sold on the date of acquisition, would apply for determination of compensation payable for requisition of the property. The High Court in appeal upheld the award of the Arbitrator. In appeal to this Court by special leave the question that fell for consideration was whether the compensation would be determined under clause (a) or (b) of sub-section (3) of s.
 8 of the 1952 Act. Under cl. (a) the compensation shall be the price which the requisitioned property would have fetched in the open market if it had remained in the same condition as it was at the time of requisitioning and been sold on the date of acquisition. Another contention raised by the appellant was whether the Defence of India Act 1939 having lapsed in February 1946 the year of requisition should be 1952 when the 1952 Act came into effect.
 
HELD : (i) The requisitioning of the property in question under the 1939 Act was continued by the Requisitioned Land (Continuance of Powers) Ordinance 1946 and thereafter by the Requisitioned Land (Continuance of Powers) Act 1947, the Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable Property Ordinance 1952 and eventually by the 1952 Act. Therefore the contention that the year of requisition should be 1952 when the 1952 Act came into effect, was unsound. [961F-962B] (ii) In Parekh's case this Court held that the mode of determination of compensation provided in section 8(3) (b) of the 1952 Act is arbitrary and bad. The result is that the award which was made in the present case pursuant to the provisions contained in section 8(3)(b) of the 1952 Act could not be sustained. The appellants would therefore be entitled to compensation in accordance with the provisions contained in section 8(3) (a) of the 1952 Act. In 1968 by an amendment clause (b) of section 8(3) of the 1952 Act was deleted and section 8(a) was preserved a,; sub-sec. (3) of s. 8. [962E-F] Union of India v. Kamlabhai Harjiwandas Parekh & Ors., [1967] INSC 202; [1968] 1 S.C.R. 463, applied.
 960 (iii) There was no substance in the contention on behalf of the Government that though s. 8(3)(b) was applied by the Arbitrator in substance the Arbitrator gave effect to the provisions of clause (a) of section 8(3) of the 1952 Act, [962G] (iv) The judgment of the High Court upholding the award of the Arbitrator must therefore be set aside. Compensation to the appellants must be given tinder s. 8 of the Act.
