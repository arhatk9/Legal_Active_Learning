 The respondents were employed as Head Time Keepers for a period of 3 years. Pursuant to an alleged policy to stream- line the organisation and to affect economies wherever possible, the appellant chose not to renew the contracts of service of the Head Time Keepers. There was no order termi- nating their services. According to the appellant the termination was automatic on the expiry of the contractual period of service. The respondents raised an industrial disputs which was referred by the Government of Orissa to the Labour Court. The Labour Court vacated the orders of termination and held that they were entitled to reinstate- ment with continuity of service and full back wages. The Labour Court came to the conclusion:
 (1) that the respondents were retrenched without complying with the provisions of section 25F of the Industrial Disputes Act and, therefore, retrench- ment was contrary to law.
 (2) The termination was as a result of unfair labour practice adopted by the appellant employer and was not bonafide.
 (3) It was not proved that the respondents had alternative employment after they were released from service.
 The appellant challenged the award by filing a Writ Petition in the Orissa High Court and contended:
 (1) That the services of the, respondents came to an end by efflux of time and that it was not a case of retrenchment.
 (2) That it was for the workmen to prove that they had tried to minimise their losses by obtain- ing employment elsewhere.
 (3) The Labour Court erred in awarding full back wages to the respondents without satisfying himself that they had been em- ployed.
 The High Court over-ruled the above contentions and dismissed the Writ Petition.
 In an appeal by Special Leave the appellant contended:
 (1 ) that the services of the respondents came to an end by efflux of time and that such termination of service did not fall within the definition of retrenchment in section 2(00) of the Industrial Disputes Act.
 (2) That the present appeal is covered against the appellant by the decision of this Court in the case of State Bank of India v.N. Sundata Money but that the said decision was contrary to an earlier decision of a larger Bench in the case of Hari Prasad Shiv Shankar Shukla.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
 HELD: 1. Section 2(00) which defines retrenchment makes it clear that the retrenchment means the termination by the employer of service of a workman for any reasons whatsoever.
 Under 8. 25F(a) no workman who has been in continuous 587 service for not less than one year under an employer can be retrenched unless he has been given one month's notice or wages in lieu thereof. A proviso to s. 25F(a) says that no such notice shall be necessary if the retrenchment is under an agreement which specifies a date for the termination of service. The proviso would be quite unnecessary if the retrenchment as defined by section 2(00) was intended not to include termination of service by efflux of time in terms of an agreement between the parties. [589B-H, 590A] 
 2. Hari Prasad Shukla's case does not run counter to the decision in the case of State Bank of India. In that case what this Court held was that termination of service on account of the cessation of the industry itself in a bona- fide closure or discontinuance of his business by the em- ployer does not amount to retrenchment- [590B-E] State Bank of India v.N. Sundara Money; 1976(3) SCR and Pipraich Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Pipraich Sugar Mills Mazdoor Union [1956] S.C.R. 872 ; followed Hariprasad Shivashankar Shukla v. A.D. Divikar, [1957] S.C.R. 121; explained.
 
 3. In the Writ petition filed by the appellant in the High Court the finding that the respondents had no alternative employment was not challenged. The question of mitigation of loss was not raised before the Labour Court. The High Court, therefore, rightly refrained from exercising its discretionary jurisdiction in favour of the employer.
