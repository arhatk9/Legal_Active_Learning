 In 1949 certain property was treated as evacuee property and the District Rent and Managing Officer, Jalalabad, began to recover rent in respect of it. The respondent Municipal Committee claimed the property as its own and filed a suit for a declaration to that effect. By order of the trial court the matter was referred to the Custodian General who, in exercise of his powers under section 27 of the Administration of Evacuee Property Act 1950, held that the property under dispute had wrongly been taken over as evacuee property and ordered it to be released in favour of the respondent Municipal Committee. After the Committee applied for restoration of possession of the property, the District Rent and Managing Officer sent a memo to the respondent committee stating that the property under dispute had already been transferred to the occupants and that its assessed price was Rs. 6,542. He further stated that it was not expedient or practicable to restore the property to the respondent committee and it had, therefore, been decided to transfer to it any other immovable property in the compensation pool of the equivalent amount in lieu thereof under section 20B of the Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation Act) 1954. By a writ petition, the respondent challenged the vires of section 20-B of 1954 Act as well as the validity of the Memo from the District Rent and Managing Officer, Jalalabad. The High Court, following its early decision in Kirpal Singh v. Central Government;
 I.L.R. [1967] 2 P. & H., 574, held that section 20-B was unconstitutional being ultra vires Articles 14 and 19(1)(f) of the Constitution. It held, however, that the section did not violate Art. 31(2) of the Constitution.
 On appeal to this Court, 
HELD : Section 20-B of the Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act 1954 was violative of both provisions of Art. 31(2).. Although to provide for rehabilitation of displaced persons was a public purpose, it did not serve any public purpose to provide in Section 20-B that if a displaced person was in occupation of some body's property he could not be given other property because it would not be expedient or practicable to do so. A public, purpose may be served if it had been provided that a displaced person may not be ousted because his business would be ruined or that he would be completely thrown on the street, but to provide in the section that if the Central Government does not think it expedient or practicable for its own convenience or for the convenience of a lessee or licensee who is not a displaced person it may not restore property serves no public purchase. Under the section the Central Government was entitled not to restore property to serve a purpose other than a public purpose and consequently the section was ultra vires Art. 31(2). [650 H] 646 The section was also violative of Art. 31(2) as it did not fix any compensation or Jay down any principle for compensation.
