 The appellant's brother was adjudicated insolvent by the Insolvency Judge, Barnala, Punjab on the 23rd November., 1954. Two days later it Receiver in insolvency was appointed by the Court and was directed to take possession of the property of the insolvent On the 26th and 27th November, 1954 the receive took possession of various properties and on the 21st December, 1954, the appellant filed an objection application alleging that some of the property belonged to him and was exclusively in his possession. He therefore prayed for its release and restoration to him. The insolvency Judge -rejected a contention that the application was time-barred under s. 68 of the Act but held that the property did not belong to the appellant. After first and second appeals to the District Judge, and a single Bench of the High Court, a division Bench allowed a Letters Patent Appeal on the ground that the appellant's application was. incompetent as barred by limitation.
 In appeal to this Court the question for determination was whether the appellant's application was one under s. 68 of the Provincial Insolvency Act, and as such having been made beyond the period of 21 days from the date of the act of the receiver complained of, was covered by the proviso to that section. It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the application was one under s. 4 of the Act in which there is no mention of any period of limitation.
 
HELD : The application was one under s. 68 and was incompetent on the ground of limitation after the lapse of 21 days from November 25, 1954.
 A person complaining of the act of the receiver may either apply under 68 or proceed under the ordinary law of the land. Section 4 does not prescribe any application for relief under that section. Its object is to,. define the limit,% of jurisdiction of the courts exercising powers in insolvency. A question as to whether an insolvent has any interest in the property attached by the receiver would fall within the purview of s. 4, but the application for the adjudication of such a question when the receiver acts otherwise than under the order of a court would be covered by s. 68 and as such the period of limitation of twenty-one days would be attracted to any such application. Sub-s. (1) and sub-s. (2) of s. 4 both start with the phrase "subject to the provisions of this Act" and even if it. was possible to construe that s. 4 envisaged the making of an application for relief, such application would be subject to s. 68 of the Act.
