 A lease of certain lands in Palganj estate in Bihar was granted by the Zamindar in 1928 for a period of 49 years.
 The lease was for the mining of soap stone, kaoline etc.
 There were sub-leases in 1933, 1934, and 1954-the last being in favour of the appellants. Under the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950 and the relevant notifications thereunder, the estate of Palganj and the rights of intermediaries and tenure-holders passed to the State of Bihar. Section 10(1) of the Reforms Act provided that mining leases subsisting immediately before the date of vesting were, as from that date to be deemed to be leases by the State Government to the same lessees. The terms and conditions of such leases, according to s. 10(2) were to be the same as before except for the power of modification to be found in the Central Act for the time being in force. At the time of vesting the Central Act in force was the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1948. The Mining Leases (Modification of Terms) Rules, 1956 were framed under s. 7 of the 1948 Act. The latter Act was replaced by the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957; however the 1956 Rules were continued under it. The 1956 Rules gave power to the Controller of Mines to modify 'existing mining leases';
 these according to r. 2(c) were leases granted before October 25, 1949. No mining lease according to the 1957 Act could be for a period of more than 20 years unless it was far the mining of coal,, iron ore or bauxite. Since the head lease in the present case was granted in 1928 it had according to the Controller lasted more than 20 years; by order dated July 1, 1961 he, therefore, terminated it. The appellants went in revision to the Central Board of Revenue and failing there, came by Special Leave to this Court. The main contention on behalf of the appellants was that the lease of 1928 was succeeded by a new statutory lease under s. 10(1) of the Bihar Act, and the new lease was not subject to modification by the Controller. Other contentions were that the 1957 Act was not protected by Act 31A(1)(e) of the Constitution, that the 1956 'rules providing for premature termination of leases without compensation went against the terms of the 1948 Act and were therefore invalid; and that the period of 20 years for which the lease could last was to be reckoned from the date of commencement of the 1957 Act.
 
HELD : Per Subba Rao C. J. and Sikri and Raghubar Dayal JJ.- The head lease of 1928 subsisted immediately before the date of vesting of Palganj estate in the State. Therefore the whole or that part of 708 the estate or tenure comprised in this lease was, with effect from the date of vesting, to be deemed to have been leased by the State Government to the holder of the lease i.e. the first lessee up to August 11, 1977, the lease being for 49 years. This statutory lease held by the head lessee from the State Government under S. 10 of the Bihar Land Reforms Act., 1950 was a new lease granted after October 25, 1949. [713 C; 714 E-F] The 1956 rules provided for the modification of the leases granted before October 25, 1949. It followed that in pursuance of the provisions of s. 10 the terms of the statutory lease could not be modified when the lease be held to be a new lease from the date of vesting. [713 B] When the head lease could not be modified the sub-leases also could not be modified. They too would be deemed to be new leases granted by the new lessee from the State Government, as the rights of the original lessor under the original lease had ceased on the vesting of the estate, and he is deemed to have got a new lease from the State. [714 F- G] [In view of the above finding the other contentions of the appellants did not fall to be considered by the majority.[ L714 G-H] Per Hidayatullah and Bachawat JJ.
 (i)The lease under s. 10(1) of the Bihar Act is not a new lease; the subsisting lease is continued after substituting the State Government as the lessor in place of the.
 proprietor or tenure-holder. [718 B-C] The opening words of s. 10 are 'Notwithstanding anything contained in the Act', and therefore s. 10 holds the field despite provision the Act by virtue of which estates and tenures were vested in the State. [718 A-B] The new leases under s. 9 of the Act as well as the subsisting leases under s. 10 were intended by the legislature to be in conformity with the Central Act regulating mining leases. The intention of the Legislature would be completely frustrated if it was held that the leases referred to in s. 10(2) need not be in conformity with the laws regulating mining leases. [718 F-H] Section 10A which was enacted in 1965 is on the footing that the sub-leases continued to exist. This could not be so if the leases under s. 10(1) were new leases, for the State Government could not grant a new lease as well as sub-leases in respect of the same subject matter at the same time. [719 C-D] (ii)The period of 20 years for the life of the lease had to be reckoned from the date of commencement of the lease and not from the date of commencement of the Act of 1957. [719 F-H] (iii)The 1957 Act was protected by Article 31A(1)(b) of the Constitution. The words 'winning a mineral' in the article were to be given a wide connotation so as to include extracting of minerals. [715 C-D] (iv)The 1956 Rules were framed under s. 7 of the 1948 Act and not under Entry 36 List II. In so far as the said Rules did not provide for compensation for the premature termination of a lease they were in contravention of s.
 7(2)(b) of the 1948 Act, but they were deemed to be rules under the 1957 Act and therefore their validity had to be considered in terms of the latter Act. As they conformed to the 1957 Act they were valid. [715 H] 709
