 While an application of the respondent-landlord for permission to sue for ejectment of his tenant, the appellant, under the U.P. (Temporary) Rent Control Act was pending before a Magistrate, the appellant applied for the transfer of proceedings relating to permission from that Magistrate's Court. On that transfer application an order was passed ,staying further proceedings. This stay order was not communicated to the Magistrate with the result that the Magistrate granted permission to sue. The respondent filed the suit for ejectment where the appellant -raised the plea that the permission granted subsequent to stay order was a nullity as the Magistrate dealing with the matter had lost his jurisdiction thereunder. The trial court accepted the appellant's plea, but High Court in appeal rejected it.
 In appeal to this court HELD : The appealmust be dismissed.
 An order of stay inan execution matter is in the nature of a prohibitory order and is addressed to the court that is carrying out execution. It is not of the same nature as an order allowing an appeal and quashing execution proceedings.
 That kind of order takes effect immediately it is passed, for such an order takes away the very jurisdiction of the court executing the decree as there is nothing left to execute thereafter. But a mere order of stay of execution does not take away the jurisdiction of the court. All that it does is to prohibit the court from proceedings with the execution further, and the court, unless it knows of the order cannot be expected to carry it out. As soon as a stay order is withdrawn, the executing court is entitled to carry on execution and there is no question of fresh conferment of jurisdiction by the fact that the stay order has been withdrawn. The jurisdiction of the court is there all along. In effect a stay order is more or less in the same position as an order of injunction with one difference. An order of injunction is generally issued to a party and it is forbidden from doing certain acts. [87G-88D, H] The court may receive knowledge either on receipt of an order of stay from the court that passed it or through one party or the other supported by an affidavit or in other way. [89E-F] The court can always act under s. 151 C.P.C. and set aside steps taken between the time the stay order was passed and the time it was brought to its notice, if that is necessary in the ends of justice and the party concerned asks it to do so. [90E] What have been said about execution proceedings applies with greater force to stay orders passed in transfer applications. [90H] The above principle may not be applicable where stay is made for ministerial officers. [91D] 85 Bessesswari Chowdhurany v. Horro Sunder Mozmadar (1896-97) 1 C.W.N. 226, Hukum Chand Bold v.
