 A mortgage was created over property situate in the City of Madras and the mortgage-deed conferred on the mortgage the power under S. 69 of the Trinsfer of Property Act, to sell the property without the intervention of the Court.
 Thereafter, the appellant purchased a small portion of the property from the mortgagors. The sale-deed provided that the mortgagors (vendors) should get the property sold released from the mortgage within one year, that in default thereof the. appellant (vendee) would be at liberty to enforce his to compel the vendors to do so, and that the vendors should internfor all expenses and damages;
 but, no such steps were 1the vendors or the vendee.
 After the appellant's purchase, a notice was issued on behalf of the mortgage, to the mortgagors, in terms of the mortgage deed, as required by s. 69(2), but no notice was serve on the appellant. The property mortgaged was then widely advertised for sale and was bought by the first respondent bank. The bank then filed the suit for v possession, mesne profits and other reliefs. The appellant contended that : (1) the sale was invalid and not binding on his portion in-the absence of notice to him, and (2) as a bona tide purchaser he was entitle ad, under s. 51 of the Act, to the value of improvements effected by him The High Court rejected the contentions and decreed the suit..
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) Section 69(2) lays down that the notice requiring payment of the mortgage money may be given to the mortgagor or to one of several mortgagors, where there are more than one. In the present case, the mortem had not parted with their entire interest in the property, and the appellant stood am the shoes of the mortgagors with respect to the portion purchased by him. Therefore, notice having been issued to the mortgagors the appellant was not entitled to such notice. Since he knew of the Power of sale contained in the mortgage deed and there was. no fraud or collusion-in the sale of the property to the bank, the appellant had no cause for complaint.
