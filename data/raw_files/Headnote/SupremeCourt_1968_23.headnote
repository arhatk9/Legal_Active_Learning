 The respondents filed a suit under s. 209 of the U.P.
 Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act 1950, in respect of five plots of land claiming to have Sirdari rights in one of them and Bhumidari rights in the other four. By this suit they challenged the order of the Sub-Divisional Officer purporting to be under s. 212A (6) of the Act dispossessing the, plaintiffs from he aforesaid plots and granting possession thereof to the appellant Gram Sabha. The Revenue Court framed several issues, the second of which was whether the respondents had ever acquired Bhumidhari fights in the four plots in which they claimed them. This issue was referred to the Civil Court which held that, as no suit was filed under s. 212A (7) of the Act, within six months of the dispossession as required by the Entry at S1. No. 32B of Appendix III read with Rule 338 of the U.P. Zamindari and Land Reforms Rules 1952, the respondents rights as Bhumidars, if any, stood extinguished. On receipt of this decision on issue No. 2 the Revenue Court proceeded to determine the claim of the respondents in respect of Sirdari rights in one plot and it found that these rights were never acquired. It therefore dismissed the respondents' suit without recording any finding on the remaining issues. The first appeal having failed, the respondents filed a second appeal. Therein the High Court held that the order of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate purporting to be made under s. 212A (6) of the Act was not valid because, it did not direct payment of compensation as laid down in that section. so that the rights as Sirdars and Bhumidars were not lost by the respondents. The appellant came to this Court by special leave.
 
 HELD: (i) The language of s. 212A (6) makes it clear that the order under that pro,vision must be an order for ejectment of the person in possession of the land o.n payment of such compensation as may be prescribed. In the present case no compensation having been ordered to be paid there was no valid order under s. 212A (6). Accordingly the provisions of s. 212A (7) which come into play only when a valid order has been passed under s. 212A (6), were not attracted to the case at all. In such a case a suit c/early lay against the appellants under s. 209 of the Act and such a suit could be instituted within six years from the date that unlawful possession was taken by the appellant. The present suit was admittedly brought within that period and was therefore not time-barred. [859 E860 E] (ii) The suit in respect of the: plot in which Sirdari rights were claimed by the respondents was dismissed by the trial court on the ground that such rights had never been acquired. This was a finding of fact and the invalidity of the order under s. 212A did not affect it. [860 F] 857 (iii) In respect of the four plots in which Bhumidhari rights were claimed by the respondents, the case must be remanded to the trial court for determination of the undecided issues relating to them.
