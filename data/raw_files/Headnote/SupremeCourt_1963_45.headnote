 The respondent made an application before the Deputy Registrar of Trade Marks for registering the mark, "Durex" used by it on the packing of the contraceptives manufactured and marketed by it. The registration was disputed by the appellant on the ground that it has been using the trade mark "Durex" in India since the year 1932 and its registration was renewed in the year 1954, for a period of 15 years. The Deputy Registrar of Trade Marks over ruled the objection and admitted the mark "Darex" to registration as sought by the respondent. An appeal preferred to the High Court against this order was also dismissed. The appellant's main contention in this court was that as the marks are identical, the registration had to be refused under s. 8 (a) of the Act, the provisions of which are not subject to the provisions of s. 10 (2). Further, the requirements of s. 10 (2) were not satisfied in this case and its provisions were not applicable.
 Held, that though the language of s. 8 (a) is slightly different from that of s. II of the English Art and that of s. 10 (1) from that of s. 12 (1) of the English Act, there is no reason for holding that the provisions of s. 8 (a) would not apply where a mark identical with or resembling that sought to be registered is already on the register.
 The language of s. 8 (a) is wide and though upon giving full correct to that language the provisions of S. 10 (1) would, in some respects, overlap those of s. 8 (a), there can be no judification for not giving full effect to the language used by the legislature: - Re Hack's Application, (1940) 58 R. P. C. 91; Re, Arthur Fairest Ltd's application (1951) 68 R. P. C. 197; Sno v.
 Dunn, [1890] 15 A. C. 252, referred to.
 212 Held, further, that the provision of Sub-s. (2) of s. IO are by way of an exception to the prohibitory provisions of the Trade Marks Act. Those provisions are contained in s. 8 (a) and s. 10 (1).
 Ram Narain Sons Ltd. v. Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax, [1955] INSC 41; [1955] 2 S. C. R. 483, held inapplicable.
 Bass v. Nicholson & Sons Ltd., (1932) 4 R. P. C. 88;
 Spillers Ltd's application, (1952) 69 R. P. C. 327;
 Alexander Pierice & Sons Ltd's application, (1933) 50 R. P.
 C, 147 and Re Kidax (Shirts) Ltd's application, (1960) R. P.
 C. 117 C.A., relied on.
 Held, also, that no hard and fast rule can be laid down regarding the volume of use for the purposes of Sub-s. (2) of s. 10. Ordinarily it would be sufficient if it is shown that there was a commercial use of the mark. There was such a use in this case, cannot be disputed and the honest concurrent use of the mark by the respondent for a considerable period has been established. The circumstances in this case can be properly regarded as special circumstances to justify the registration of the mark and there is hardly any likelihood of confusion or deception.
