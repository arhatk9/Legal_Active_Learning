 Respondent No. 1 challenged the election of the appellant to the Rajya Sabha on the alleged ground of corrupt practice consisting of bribery as well as offer of bribery. The Tribunal held that both the above mentioned types of corrupt practices were proved against the appellant. The High Court upheld the order of the Tribunal holding only that offer of bribe in two cases was proved. The appellant came to this Court with certificate. It was urged that (i) when the Division Bench which originally heard the appeal,, on difference arising among the Judges constituting it, asked for a reference to another bench, the Chief Justice had no power under Art. 28 of the Letters Patent to refer the matter to a single Judge, (ii) this Court should examine the evidence as to offer of bribe to certain persons for itself, as the High Court had misread the evidence and bad relied on certain irrelevant pieces of evidence, (iii) the facts proved did not justify a finding that bribe was offered by the appellant.
 
 HELD : (i) Under Art. 28 of the Letters Patent the reference of the case to a single Judge was competent. The word 'Bench' in the Article includes a single Judge. [21 H] (ii) In considering the allegations of bribery against the appellant the court was entitled to take into consideration the fact that the appellant was a man of means and that he had no political background in Bihar where he did not have a permanent residential house. There was no misreading of the evidence by the High Court and no case had been made Out for a re-appraisal of the findings. [23 B-C, H] (iii) The proposition cannot be accepted that an offer of bribery cannot be held to be such unless a specific amount is mentioned in the offer. [27 D] Emperor v.
