 Award of Collector under s.11 - Whether Government, Company or local authority can seek a reference under s. 18, except on grounds of fraud, corruption or collusion - Whether petition under Article 226 filed by Government or anyone claiming through it, challenging the Collector's order declining to make reference under s.18 maintainable.
 Pursuant to the awards made under s.11 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 by the Collector determining the compensation proposed to be paid to appellants for the acquisition of their lands, the appellants sought reference under s.18 for enhancement of compensation.
 The Central Ware-housing Corporation, at whose instance the land was acquired, also felt aggrieved by the amount of compensation determined by the Collector and sought a reference to the Civil Court under s.18 for reducing the amount. The Collector rejected this request on the ground that such a reference was barred by the proviso to s.50(2) of the Act.
 In the writ petition under Article 226, the Corporation challenged the awards. The High Court set aside the awards and itself determined the compensation at a reduced rate.
 Allowing the appeals of the land-owners to this Court, ^ 
 HELD : 1. The High Court was wrong in entertaining the writ petitions challenging awards made by the Collector under 604 the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 and claiming that the amount awarded was excessive. [609 F] 
 2. The scheme of the Act is that, apart from fraud, corruption or collusion, the amount of compensation awarded by the Collector under s.11 may not be questioned in any proceeding either by the Government or by the Company or Local Authority at whose instance the acquisition is made.
 Section 50(2) and s.25 lead to that inevitable conclusion.
 What may not be done under the provisions of the Act may not be permitted to be done by invoking the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226. Article 226 is not meant to avoid or circumvent the processes of the law and the provisions of the statute. [607 E-G] 
 3. When s. 50(2) expressly bars the company or local authority at whose instance acquisition is made from demanding a reference under s.18 notwithstanding that such company or local authority may be allowed to adduce evidence before the Collector, and when s. 25 expressly prohibits the Court from reducing the amount of compensation while dealing with the reference under s.18, it is clearly not permissible for the company or local authority to invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 to challenge the amount to compensation awarded by the Collector and to have it reduced. [ 607 G-H; 608 A] 
 4. The Collector, in making an award, acts as an agent of the Government, and the legal character of the award made by the Collector is that of a tender or offer by him on behalf of the Government and, therefore, the Government or anyone who could but claim through the Government cannot question the award apart from fraud, corruption or collusion.
