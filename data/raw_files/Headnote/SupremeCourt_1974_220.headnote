 In all the three appeals the case of the assessee is that the interest for the .period before the commencement of production on money borrowed for the purpose of acquiring and installing the machinery and Plant should be included in the actual cost of the plant and as such capitalised for the purpose. In Civil Appeal No. 1784, the contention of the assessee is that the wealth-tax payable by the assessee is allowable as a deduction.
 Allowing Civil Appeal No. 1353 of 1970 and dismissing Civil Appeals Nos. 1784 and 1785 of 1970.
 
HELD : (i) So far as the first question is concerned the legal position for determining the actual cost. for the purpose of development rebate is the same as for the purpose of depreciation. A reading of the provisions sees.
 10,10(2), 10(2)(vi), 10(5) and the explanation to sec. 10(5) will disclose that, while considering the question of deduction on account of depreciation and development rebate the written down value has to be taken into account.
 Written down value in its turn depends on the actual cost of the assets to the assessee. As the expression "actual cost" has not been defined in the Act, it should be construed in the sense which no commercial man would misunderstand. It would appear that the accepted accountancy rule for determining the cost of fixed assets is to include all expenditure necessary to bring such assets into existence and to put them in working condition. In case money is borrowed by a newly started company which is in the process of constructing and erecting its plant. the interest incurred before the commencement of production on such borrowed money can be capitalised and added to the cost of the fixed assets which have been created as a result of such expenditure. The above rule of accountancy should be adopted for determining the actual cost of the assets in the absence of any statutory definition or other indication to the contrary. [543B-D, E; 545F-H] Clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 208 of the Companies Act, 1956, gives statutory recognition to the principle of capitalising the interest in case the interest is paid on money raised to defray expenses of the construction of any work or building or the provision of any plant in contingencies mentioned in that section even though such money constitutes share capital. The same principle, should hold good if interest is paid on money not raised by way of share capital but taken on loan for the purpose of defraying the expenses of the construction of any work or building or the provision of any plant. The reason indeed would be stronger in case such interest is paid on money taken on loan for meeting the above expenses. [545H-546C] It is true that for similar fixed assets there can be different actual costs. The fact that there would be a difference in the actual cost of the plant in case its machinery is acquired and installed with the assessee's own money or in case it is acquired and installed with borrowed money does not consequently militate against the principle that interest paid in such circumstances can be capitalised and included in the actual cost of machinery and plant.

 (ii) In Travancore Titanium Product Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-Tax, Kerala [1966] 60 ITR 277, the Supreme Court held that the amount of Wealth Tax paid by an assessee on his net wealth under the Wealth-Tax Act is not a permissible deduction under sec. 10(2) (xv) of the Act in his income-tax assessment. After this decision when the matter was considered by a larger Bench consisting of five Judges in the case of Indian Almunium Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-Tax, West Bengal, Lk[ 1972) 84 ITR 735] this Court held that the WealthTax paid by the assessee which was a trading company on assets held by it for the purpose of business was deductible as a business expenditure in computing the assessee's income from business. Subiequent to this decision, the Income-Tax Act, 1961 was amended first by means of an Ordinance and later by means of the Income- Tax (Amendment) Act, 1972 (Act No. 41 of 1972). The result of this amendment is that any sum paid on account of Wealth- Tax cannot be deducted in computing the income of an assessee chargeable under the head "Profits and Gains of business, profession or Vocation" or "Income from other sources". The serving clause contained in section 5 of the amending Act provided "Where, before the 15th day of July, 1972 being the date on which the Income-tax (Amendment) Ordinance, 1972 came into force, the Supreme Court has, on: an appeal in respect of the assessment of an assessee for any particular assessment year, held that wealth-tax paid by the assessee is deductible in computing the total income of that year, then, nothing contained in sub-clause (iia) of clause (a) of section 40, or sub-section (IA) of section 58, of the principal Act, as amended by this Act, or, as the case may be, section 4 of this Act, shall apply to the assessment of such assessee for that particular year." [549F-550F] What is necessary to attract this section is that this Court should have held before July 15, 1972 on an appeal in respect of an assessment of the assesse for any particular assessment year that the wealth-tax paid by the assessee is deductible in computing the total income of that year. Once that is the effect of a decision given by this Court before July 15, 1972 the fact that the judgment in which the above finding is recorded is given in other appeals, which are heard together along with the appeal of the assessee, and the further fact that assessee's appeal is not disposed of before July 15, 1972, would not take the case of the assessee out of the purview of section 5. The case of the assessee in Civil Appeal No. 1784 is covered by 5 of the Amending Act. [5510-552A]
