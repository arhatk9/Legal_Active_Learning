 Petitioners are Assistants in Grade IV Class 11 of the Central Secretariat Service. Petitioners were appointed as Assistants during the period 1944-54. The respondent Union of India appointed a large number of persons as Assistants by direct recruitment and many of those appointed after the petitioners have been confirmed in the grade and have since been promoted to the next higher grade of Section Officer.
 In 1948, the Government framed a Scheme known as the Central Secretariat Service (Reorganisation & Reinforcement) Scheme.
 Thereafter instructions for the initial constitution of the Assistants Grade were issued in March, 1949. Thereafter, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued Office Memorandum dated June 22, 1949. dealing with the question of seniority. Para 2 of the office memorandum provided that the rule of seniority on the basis of length of service should be taken as a model in framing the rules of seniority for other Ser- vices. The main question to be determined in the present petition is whether the office memorandum of June, 1949 is applicable in determining seniority of the petitioners.
 
HELD'. Office Memorandum of June 22, 1949 is no bar lo the Government making separate provision for the mode of constitution and future maintenance of the service of Assistants. The classification made in the instructions cannot be characterised as unreasonable. There is no discrimination amongst equals nor any arbitrary exercise of powers by the Government. In the absence of any statutory rules prior to the Central Secretariat Service Rules 1962 it was open to Government in exercise of its executive power to issue administrative instructions with regard to constitution and reorganisation of the Service as long as there is no violation of Arts. 14 and 16 of the Constitution. The instructions of the Government issued from time to time do not violate any fundamental rights of the petitioners. In the present petition, the Civil List of 1962 has not been challenged as invalid. Only office Memorandum of 1971 is challenged. The said Memorandum of 1971 is based on the civil list of 1962. The validity of which is not specifically challenged in the petition. There is no infirmity in the Memorandum of 1971 simply because it is not in conformity with the Memorandum of 22-6-1949.

HELD FURTHER : Once the temporary Assistants have been absorbed in the Service after they are found to be eligible in accordance with the instructions their claim for seniority cannot be superseded by the direct recruitment if appointed after the former's absorption in the service. It appears that the quota of direct recruitment was not enforced and perhaps for good reasons. Administrative in- structions if not carried into effect for obvious and good reasons cannot confer a right upon entrants on later recruitment to supersede the claims of others already absorbed in the service in accordance with the appropriate and valid instructions. Nothing has been brought to our notice which could justify such a wholesale or en bloc discrimination in favour of those who suddenly enter the same grade of service by direct recruitment. It could if permitted be violative of Art. 16 of the Constitution. The direct recruits who are appointed after the absorption of the Assistants in conformity with the instructions on the initial constitution or in the regular temporary establishment shall rank junior to the latter.

HELD FURTHER : In view of the entire circumstances of the case and the hopes held out by the Government from time to time we are not prepared to dismiss the petition on account of delay and laches. [210B] 202
