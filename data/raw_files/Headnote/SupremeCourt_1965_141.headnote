 In exercise of the power given in s. 3 of the Import and Export (Control) Act, 1947, the Central Government issued the Exports (Control) Order, 1954 providing that no person shall export any goods of the description specified in Schedule I annexed thereto except under and in accordance with a licence granted by the Central Government or by any officer specified in Schedule 11 of the order. Under the provisions of the said order the respondents who were a firm carrying on import and export business, obtained from the Iron and Steel Controller a licence permitting them to export a certain quantity of 'steel skull scrap'. When the goods were at the port they were examined by an officer authorised by the Controller who certified the goods as 'steel skull scrap' fit for export under the said export licence. The Customs authorities however took the view that a part of the goods was not 'steel skull scrap'. S. 3 (2) of the Imports and Exports Act 1947, provides that goods whose export or import is prohibited restricted or otherwise controlled under s. 3(1) would be deemed to be goods whose export was restricted under s. 19 of the Sea Customs Act, 1878, and all the provisions of the said Act would apply accordingly. Under s. 178 of the Sea Customs Act the Customs authorities ordered the confiscation of the scrap sought to be exported by the respondents, but allowed it to be shipped on the respondents' giving a bank guarantee for payment of fine in lieu of confiscation. After giving a show cause notice the Additional Collector of Customs imposed a fine on the respondents in lieu of confiscation and also a personal penalty of Rs. 35,000. Instead of seeking remedy under the Sea Customs Act the respondents filed a writ petition in the High Court. It was heard and dismissed by a single Judge who however reduced the personal penalty to Rs. 1,000. Both sides appealed to the Division Bench. It was held by the Division Bench that since the satisfaction as to whether a particular consignment of scrap is capable of being used in India or not is to be, under the Statement of Export Policy, that of the Iron & Steel Controller the Customs authorities were not entitled to consider afresh whether that scrap was or was not usable in India. On this and other grounds the High Court allowed the appeal of the respondents and dismissed the appeal of the Customs Authorities in respect of the penalty. The Customs Authorities appealed to this Court by special leave.
 It was contended on behalf of the appellants that (1) the Customs Authorities were entitled to see whether the goods sought to be exported were in accordance with the licence, and (2) the High Court should not have exercised its jurisdiction under Art. 226 when alternative remedies were provided in the Sea Act.

HELD:(i) There is no conflict between the jurisdiction of the licensing authority under the Exports (Control) Order and that of the Customs Authority under the Sea Customs Act.
 While under the Exports (Control) Order certain articles can be exported only under a licence issued by the appropriate authority prescribed thereunder, the appropriate Customs authority can prevent the export of the articles if they are not covered by such licence. To take an extreme case, if the licence issued permitted export of iron and the licensee seeks to export gold, the Customs authorities can certainly prevent the export of gold, for it is not covered by the license. [291 C-D] (ii)However in the present case it could not be said that the goods were not covered by the licence.
 Under the Exports (Control) Order iron and steel scrap is permitted to be exported on a licence granted by the Iron and Steel Controller. Under the Statement of Export Policy iron and steel scrap other than sheet cuttings can be exported if in the opinion of the Iron and Steel Controller the material is of no use in India. The Exports (Control) Order, the schedules annexed thereto and the Statement of Export Licensing Policy do not define skull scrap at all;
 'skull scrap' is what the Officer thinks it is. The only restriction on the Controller giving a licence for export of scrap is that in his opinion it is not usable in India; his opinion is final. For the purpose of his opinion he may describe or categorize the scrap in the manner convenient to him; but that does not make it anytheless exportable scrap.
 The licence is meant only to cover scrap not usable in India. The description of the scrap has no relevance to its exportability. [292 B-F] A comparative study of other items in Schedule 1 annexed to the Exports (Control) Order shows that they are different items. Obviously the licensee cannot export a different item. But scrap is only one item and, therefore, if the appropriate authority issues a licence for the export of one variety of the same, it cannot be held that The licensee by exporting a different variety is exporting some other item.
 [292 G] In the present case the Iron and Steel Controller and his subordinates examined the goods at the time the licence was issued and at the time of loading the goods for export. The licence was therefore issued in respect of particular goods identified by the appropriate authorities. It was not possible therefore to say that goods other than those in respect whereof the licence was issued were sought to be exported. [293 A-B] What is important is not the description but whether it is scrap of iron and steel in respect whereof the licence was issued. In this view, the Customs Authorities had no jurisdiction to confiscate the scrap on the ground that the same was a misdescription. The conclusion arrived at by the High Court was therefore correct. [293 C-E] (iii)If the goods were not prohibited goods, the Customs Authorities had no jurisdiction to impose the penalty. [293 E-F] (iv)The existence of an alternative remedy does not oust the jurisdiction of the High Court but it is only one of the circumstances that the High Court may take into consideration in exercising its discretionary jurisdiction under Art. 226 of the Constitution. In the present case the High Court thought fit to exercise its jurisdiction and there were no exceptional circumstances that would justify interference with its discretion. [293 G-H] Per Raghubar Dayal, J. :-(i) The decision of the Iron and Steel Controller contemplated by the conditions of the licence is not about the identity of the scrap material but is only with respect to the possibility of the use of any portion of the scrap within the country. There is nothing in the Imports and Exports Control Act or in the Exports Control Order up.
 Sup. CI/65-4 286 which lays down among the duties of the Iron & Steel Controller the duty to check that the material collected at the docks for export tallied with the material for export of which the licence had been granted. [297 B-C] (ii)The statement of export licencing policy in laying down that export of ferrous scrap other than sheet cuttings is allowed by the Iron and Steel Controller provided he is satisfied that the material is of no use in India does not mean that if the licence is for the export of any particular type of steel scrap it may still be considered to be a licence permitting export of steel scrap of any other kind except scrap from sheet cuttings. The Statement meant only that in respect of such scrap the authorities were free to exercise discretion to allow its export if it could not be utilised in India. [298 G-H] (iii)The fact that in the Order iron and steel is mentioned as one item and its varieties are not mentioned does not mean that a licence for one kind of scrap could be utilised to export other kinds of scrap. Clause 5 of the Order empowers the licensing authority to impose while granting a licence such conditions as it considers necessary to impose and be not inconsistent with the Act or Order.
 The licensing authority could therefore provide in the licence that steel scrap of a particular variety would be exported. The exported goods will be in accordance with the licence only if they come within the specified variety. [300 D-E] (iv)The note of the Iron and Steel Controller on the shipping bill after inspection of the goods at the dock does not amount to a licence. Moreover in the present case the goods were not inspected by the Iron and Steel Controller himself but by an officer who was not entitled to issue a licence under Schedule 11. The certification of the goods by such an officer did not make them exportable. [301 G] (v)Section 3(2) of the Exports Control Act makes the provisions of the Sea Customs Act applicable in respect of goods whose export or import is prohibited, restricted or controlled by an order made under s. 3(1). The Export Control Order was made under s. 3(1) and therefore the Customs Authorities could exercise their powers under the Sea Customs Act in respect of the goods sought to be exported by the respondents. They had power to check the goods to see whether they were being exported under and in accordance with the licence. [294 F-G; 300 F] (vi)Since the Additional Collector of Customs acted within his jurisdiction in checking and confiscating the goods in question on the ground that they were not 'steel skull scrap' which alone was allowed to be exported under the licence, the High Court or the Supreme Court did not have in exercising writ jurisdiction, power to question, when mala fides was not alleged, his opinion about the nature of the goods sought to be exported. The respondents should have pursued the remedies under the Act. [300 G-H] (vii)The amount of penalty imposed by the Additional Collector was legal and its reduction to Rs. 1,000 by the single Judge was not correct. [303 D] Ranchoddas Atmaram v. Union of India, [1961] INSC 34; [1961] 3 S.C.R. 718, relied on.
