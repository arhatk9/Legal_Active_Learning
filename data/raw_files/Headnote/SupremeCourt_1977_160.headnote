 The Netherlands Selling Organisation Ltd. bought linseed oil "F.O.B. Calcutta price", from the respondent oil mills. The terms of the sale-contract provided that the oil mills would deliver the goods on a ship bound for Indonesia, and lend the use of its export-licence to facilitate the export of the goods by the Netherlands Organisation to a foreign buyer. The respondent claimed exemption from the payment of sales-tax on the ground that the sale was effected in the course of the export of goods out of the Indian territory.
 The claim was rejected by the Revenue Authorities but was allowed by the High Court, in a reference by the Board of Revenue.
 Allowing the appeal and holding that the sale was exigible to sales-tax, the Court.
 
HELD : (1) There is no privity of contract between the respondents and the foreign buyer. The export was occasioned by the contract of sale between the Netherlands Organisation and their own buyer, and not by the contract of sale between the respondents and the Netherlands Organisation. The two sales are not part of one integral transaction. [272C, D] (2)The circumstance that the contract between the respondents and the Netherlands Organisation was in the F.O.B. form and that the payment of price was to be made only after the goods were put on board the ship by the respondents, do not affect the. fundamental position that there were two independent and unconnected sales. In loading the goods on the ship, the respondents were acting as mere carriers. The fact that the place of delivery is a foreign-bound ship cannot, by itself, make a sale one in the course of export.

 (3)The bill of lading was made out in the name of the Netherlands Organisation which. obtained a complete and indefeasible title to the goods purchased by them from the respondents in India. The fact that the respondents were to lend them the use of their export licence or that the respondents paid the customs duty and the Port Commissioner's charges, does not mean that the goods were exported, by, or at the instance of the respondents.
