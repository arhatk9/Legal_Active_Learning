 The appellant was the tenant of respondent No. 1 on a piece of land and had built a cinema house thereon. On the expiry of the lease, respondent No. 1 filed a suit for rent and eviction against the appellant and his sub-lessee. The suit was decreed. Under s. 4(1) of the Madras City Tenants' Protection Act, 1921, the court determined the value of the superstructures made by the appellant, and the decree said that possession of the suit properties was to be delivered to respondent No. 1 on the latter making payment of the compensation for the superstructures as determined by the court. The decree did not specify the time during which the payment was to be made. According to s. 4(4) of the Act the compensation money had to be paid within three months of the passing of the decree in the landlord's favour, otherwise the landlord'& suit would stand dismissed. Respondent No. 1 paid the compensation money into court after the said period of three months had expired and prayed to the court that the decree be amended by specifying the time during which the payment was to be made. The court amended the decree by inserting therein that the payment was to be made within three months from the passing of the original decree. Thus respondent No. 1 remained in default under s. 4(4) and the court dismissed the suit. Respondent No. 1 appealed to the High Court which held that s. 4(4) did not come into play when the decree under s. 4(1) did not specify the period within which payment was to be made and its decision went in favour of respondent No. 1. The appellant then applied for a certificate of fitness to appeal to the Supreme Court which was granted.
 It was urged on behalf of the appellant that the provision prescribed by s. 4(4) is mandatory and any defect in the decree which is passed under s. 4(1) cannot help the plaintiff-landlord to circumvent the effect of the said provision. On behalf of the respondent No. 1 it was urged that s. 4(1) should be read as controlling s. 4(4), first a decree must be properly passed under s. 4(1) specifying the period of three months within which the amount should be paid and then only s. 4(4) could be invoked.
 
HELD : The High Court was in error in reversing the order passed by the trial court.
 (i) The controversy had to be decided in the light of the object of the Act. The object was clearly to give protection to tenants who had taken open land on lease and had built superstructures on it in the hope that as long as they paid rent they would not be evicted. [649 H] 646 (ii) Having regard to the mandatory terms in which s. 4(4) is couched it would not be reasonable to construe s. 4(1) as controlling a. 4(4). The relevant clause provides that the decree should direct that on payment by the landlord into court, within three months, of the amount found due, the tenant shall put the landlord into possession. The clause in respect of the payment by the landlord into court within three months amount to a condition which has to be satisfied by the landlord before the tenant is required to deliver to him possession of the property in question. In other words, reference to the payment by the landlord of the amount found due within the specific period in s. 4(1) is not so much a direction issued by the court as specification of a condition expressly and independently provided by s. 4(4).
 [651 D-F] (iii) In s. 4(4) the expression "the decree passed under sub-s. (1)" merely describes the sub-section under which the decree is passed, the emphasis in the context being on the date of the said decree and not so much on the strict compliance with the form prescribed in s. 4(1). The logical way to reconcile s. 4(1) and s. 4(4) would be to treat the provision prescribed by s. 4(4) as mandatory and paramount and read in the relevant portion of s. 4(1) accordingly.
 Even if the decree does not mention that the amount has to be paid within three months, the landlord's obligation to make the payment within three months is still enforceable under s, 4(4); otherwise defective decrees would deprive the tenants of the benefit intended to be conferred on them by s. 4(4).
