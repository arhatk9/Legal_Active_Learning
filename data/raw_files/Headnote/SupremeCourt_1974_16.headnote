 The appellant, an Inspector of Central Excise, was charged under s.161, I.P.C. and S.5(1)(d)read with s.5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act,1947for having accepted a bribe. He was convicted and sentenced by the Special Judge.
 The High. Court confirmed the conviction but reduced the sentence to one year's imprisonment.
 The allegation against the appellant was that he accepted a sum of Rs. 50/- as illegal gratification. At the instance of the complainant the raiding police party passed on to the appellant currency notes worth Rs. 50 smeared with a chemical substance. On recovery of the money from his pocket traces of the chemical substance were found on his fingers his kerchief and his trouser pocket.
 It was contended (i) that trapping of corrupt officials in the usual course is a polluted procedure (ii) the investigating officers are a suspect species and (iii) the chemical test was not reliable.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD: It is not possible to accede to the theory that the trapping of corrupt officials in the usual course is a polluted procedure. Our social milieu is so vitiated by a superstitious belief that any official can be activist by illegal gratification, so confidential is the technique of give and take in which the white-collar offender is an adept and so tough is the forensic problem of proof beyond reasonable doubt by good testimony in this area that the only hope of tracking down the tricky officers is by lying traps and creating statutory Presumptions. Condemnation of all traps and associate witnesses is neither pragmatic nor just, nor is it fair to denounce all public servants indiscriminately. Judicial attitudes have to be discriminating. An awkward judicial conscience and an alert critical appraisal are the best tools in this process. [202 G; 203 A] (ii) Courts are aware of the exaggerated criticisms of the police force as a whole and of the reluctance of the framers of the Criminal Procedure Code to trust statements recorded by police investigators, but these are, partly at least, the hangover of the British past. Today trust begets trust and the higher officers of the Indian police, especially in the Special Police Establishment, deserve better credence. [203 D-E] (iii) The evidence furnished by inorganic chemistry often outwits the technology of corrupt officials, provided no alternative reasonable possibility is made out. it is but meet that science-oriented detection of crime is made a massive programme of police Work, for in our technological age nothing more primitive can be conceived of than denying the discoveries of the sciences as aids to crime suppression and nothing cruder can retard forensic efficiency than swearing by traditional oral evidence only thereby discouraging liberal use of scientific research to prove guilt.
