 In February 1946, H leased his share in a grove in Uttar Pradesh to the appellant and sold to him the trees standing thereon. Similarly A, a widow, leased her share and that of her minor children in the grove and sold the standing trees to the appellant. Subsequently the proprietary right of some other co-sharers in the grove was sold to one M. The appellant instituted a suit sometime in 1946 against M. and others for injunction and alternatively for possession over the grove. Sometime in 1947 M and others also instituted a rival suit for, cancellation of the aforesaid leases on the contention that under s. 246 of the U.P. Tenancy Act the execution of a lease by some of the cosharers only, was invalid. The trial court dismissed the appellants suit and decreed M's suit. The lower appellate court granted a decree in favour of the appellant for joint possession over the share of H and A in the grove land. It was held that the lease executed by A as guardian of the minors was invalid. M filed two appeals in the Allahabad High Court.
 During the pendency of the appeals M died and his legal re- presentatives were brought on record. The appeal filed by M in his own suit was dismissed by a Single Judge of the High Court. The appeal filed by M in the appellants suit was heard by another single Judge, and was allowed with respect to the lease of grove land and dismissed as regards the:
 sale of the trees. It was held that after the commencement of the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act the appellant had no subsisting interest in the land. The appellant was granted special leave to appeal to this Court.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) As the grove in dispute was an intermediary's grove M and others who were intermediaries on the relevant date became its bhumidars. the lessee of an intermediary's grove land is not an intermediary because he does not fall within the definition of the word 'intermediary'. No other provision of the Act gives him any kind of interest in the intermediary's grove land. The appellant got no right in the grove land in dispute. [895E] Rana Sheo Ambar Singh v.

 (ii) The dismissals of M's other appeal by the High Court could not operate as res judicata in the present appeal because the questions, at issue in the two appeals were different. [895G] 894
