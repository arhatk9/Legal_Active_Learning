 The appellant was charged of committing the murder at Kulu.
 His advocate made an application to the Magistrate of Kulu u/s Sec. 464 of the Code of Criminal Procedure stating that the accused has symptoms of impairment of cognitive faculties of mind and otherwise of an abnormal behaviour, with a prayer to remove the appellant to the mental hospital. the Trial Magistrate came to the conclusion that the appellant was not suffering from unsoundness of mind, on the basis of the application made by the appellant for remitting the money seized from his person to his mother and on the basis of replies to the question put to the appellant regarding the supply of copies of documents relied on by the prosecution. A revision application filed by the appellant against the rejection of the application was dismissed by the Sessions Court. On revision to the High Court, the learned single Judge directed that the appellant should be examined and kept under observation in the Snowdown Hospital, Simla, which is a general hospital. After the examination by two psychistricts at Simla hospital, they recommended the examination of the appellant in the proper mental hospital. As the recommendation was not carried out the appellant moved the High Court under section 561(A) of the Code for the implementation of the earlier order. The High Court clarified the earlier order and rejected the application u/s 561(A) holding that the order was complied with. On an application for review, the High Court observed that whether the recommendations of the Simla Hospital should or should not be followed lay within the powers of the trial Magistrate. The trial Magistrate misunderstood the order to mean that no preliminarly enquiry, as required by Sec. 464 'was necessary and committed the appellant's case for trial by Sessions Court. The committal order was challenged by the appellant by way of revision in the Sessions Court, and then in the High Court. The High Court held that the committing Magistrate had sufficient material to believe that the appellant was not suffering from unsoundness of mind and therefore it was not necessary for him to act under Sec. 464.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : The words "reason to believe" mean a belief which a reasonable person would entertain on facts before him. The burden was on the appellant to establish that he was suffering from the unsoundness of mind. The provisions regarding the enquiry in the unsoundness of mind are mandatory and the Magistrate is bound to enquire before he proceeds with the case. Such enquiry is to be held at the threshold. The trial Magistrate did not hold such enquiry and did not call upon the appellant to establish the mental infirmity. The proper course for the Magistrate in view of the directions of the High Court and the provisions of Sec.
 464 was to send the appellant to the mental hospital for observations. [9 A] 2-L348Sup.C.I./73 2 Both the committal order and the High Court's order were set aside and the trial Magistrate was directed to hold an enquiry u/s 464 and give opportunity to the appellant to produce the evidence regarding his unsundness of mind.
