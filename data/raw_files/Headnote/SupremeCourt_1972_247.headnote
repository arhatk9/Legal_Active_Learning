 Sometime in 1944 an agreement was entered into between the appellant and the then Province of Punjab, whereby the appellant agreed to act as a Clearing Agent (Foodgrains) for the sale and purchase of food-grains on behalf of the Province on payment of a commission. The appellant obtained stock of rice from the Rationing Controllers.
 On August 14, 1947, the Governor-General issued, in exercise of his power under s.9(1)(b) of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order, 1947. Clause 8(3) of the Order provided that any contract made on behalf of the Province of Punjab, if it was not exclusively for the purpose of the Province of East Punjab in India, was deemed to have been made on behalf of the Province of West Punjab in Pakistan. On the same day, the Governor of the Provinces of Punjab also issued the Punjab Partition (Contracts) Order, 1947. Clause 2(d) of the Governor's Order provided that every contract entered into on behalf of the Governor in accordance with s.175 of the Government of India Act, 1935, shall, in so far as it relates to services to be rendered for the benefit of areas within the two new Provinces of East Punjab and West Punjab, be deemed to have been entered into with the two Provinces as two separate contracts having effect respectively in relation to the services to be rendered in each of the Provinces. The Governor of Punjab also issued another Order, the Punjab Partition (Apportionment of Assets and Liabilities) Order, 1947, for a general financial settlement between the two new Provinces. As the two new Provinces did not arrive at any agreement, the Chief Justice of the Fede- ral Court gave his award according to which 60% of the total assets were to go to the Province of West Punjab in Pakistan and 40% thereof to the Province of East Punjab in India.
 With respect to the stock supplied to the appellant, the appellant made certain payments to the respondent, and the respondent State of Punjab, sued the appellant for the balance. The appellant, while denying liability, also contended that the liability if any, was to the extent of 40% only of the amount due. The trial court substantially decreed the suit. On appeal, the High Court reduced the amount payable by the appellant to the respondent.
 In appeal to this Court.
 
HELD : (1) It could not be contended by the appellant that the respondent had no right to sue on the basis that the rights under the contract accrued under cl. 8(3) of the Governor-General's Order, in favour 583 of the Government of West Punjab in Pakistan. it is c1. 2(a) of the Governor's Order that applies to the contract. The clause deals with contracts with continuing obligations. In the period when the contract of agency was subsisting it created the relationship of principal and agent between the contracting parties, and the relationship imposed mutual obligations. The appellant was bound to render the service of acting as a clearing agent and of purchasing and selling foodgrains for the Province of Punjab. The contract was not a completed Contract, but one which imposed the continuing obligation of rendering the service of an agent on the appellant. Therefore, cl. 2(d) of the Governor's Order applied and that clause itself provided for the' bifurcation of a single and indivisible contract into two separate contracts. [588C-F; 591A] (2) The fields of operation of the two Orders, the Governor- General's Order and the Governor's Order did not overlap and therefore the question of one prevailing over the other did not arise. [589G] (3) Clause 8(3) of the Governor `General's Order dealt with the contracts which formed the subject-matter of s.177(1) of the Government of India Act, 1935, that is, with contracts made by or on behalf of the Secretary of State in Council for the purposes of the Province of punjab before the Government of India Act, 1935, was brought into force. It has nothing to do with the contracts made by or on behalf of the Governor of Punjab under s.175(3), Government of India Act, 1935, after March 1937. Clause 2(d) of the Governor's Order dealt with such contracts made by or on behalf of the Governor under s. 175(3). [589A-G] State of Tripura v. The Province of East Bengal, [1950] INSC 37; [1951] S.C.R. 1, State of West Bengal v. Shaikh Serajuddin Batley [1953] INSC 74; [1954] S.C.R. 378, Union of India v.

Union of India, [1962] 3 S.C.R. 412, explained.
 (4) (a) The arbitration award which brought about a financial adjustment between East Punjab and West Punjab did not deal with the liabilities of third parties, like the appellant, to one or the other of the Provinces. it did not direct that any amount due by a third part,,, could be recovered only to the extent of 40% of his liability. [591F- G] (b) There was no settlement between the appellant and the respondent that the former should recover only 40% of the amount due from the appellant. No such settlement could be spelt out from the correspondence between the parties.
 There was only a proposal to the appellant for settlement of the claims of the respondent and the sellers but the appellant, instead of unconditionally accepting the proposal, made an alternative proposal, with the result that there was no settlement between the parties. There was no progress beyond he stage of proposal and counter-proposal.
 [591G-H; 592G; 593A-F] (c) The appellant could not raise the pleas that the respondent had represented to the appellant that it would recover only 40% of the amount debited to the account of the erstwhile Province of Punjab, and hence was estopped from claiming a higher amount because no such plea was raised in the written statement nor was an issue framed, nor were arguments advanced in the trial court and High Court. The plea was not raised even in the statement of case in this Court. [593F-H; 594C-D] (d) But the minutes of meeting held between the representatives of the appellant and the respondent showed that the respondent had decided 584 to claim only 40% of the amount debited to the account of Province of Punjab before March 1948. The respondent could not contend that the decision to recover only 40% was subject to the condition that the appellant should pay the sellers. The minutes of the meeting can be split into two parts : (1) limiting the appellants' liability to 40%, and (ii) payment of the amounts due to the sellers by the appellant; but the first part is not dependent on the performance of the second part. The letters and subsequent conduct indicate that in spite of the absence of consent by the appellants the respondent was paying the sellers from the amount with it to the credit of the appellant, showing, that instead of insisting upon payment to the sellers, the respondent was acting accord'ing to the appellant's proposal that the sellers should be paid by the respondent from the money with it to the credit of the appellant. Therefore, the respondent had decided to recover only 40% and no more.
 It amounted to a remission of a part of the debt due by the appellant under s.63 of the Contract Act, 1872 and it is not necessary that such remission should be supported by consideration. Since, admittedly more than 40% of the total liability had already been paid to the respondent, nothing was due from the appellant and hence the appeal should be allowed.
