 Rule 22 of the Madhya Pradesh Brewery Rules, 1970 empowers the Excise Commissioner to appoint an officer-in -charge of the brewery and to appoint such other officers of the excise department as he may deem fit to be incharge of the brewery with the object of exercising a control over the breweries. It further provides that the pay of all such officers shall be met by the Government but in case the annual charges and pay of such officers exceed 5% of the duty leviable on the issue made from the brewery to the districts within the State then the excess shall be realised from the brewer.
 Demands raised under the said Rule on the appellant- brewery were challenged by it and a Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High court upheld the same holding that (i) the demand under Rule 22 was in the nature of a condition of licence for brewery: and (ii) Section 62 (2)(h) read with Section 28 of the Madhya Pradesh Excise Act, 1915 was wide enough to enable the State Government to make the impugned rule as a condition of the licence.
 In appeal to this Court, it was contended on behalf of the appellant-brewery that the excise duty leviable under the Act was a tax imposed by the State Legislature in exer- cise of its plenary powers and there cannot be 596 a further demand, which is in the nature of an additional duty, by means of a rule.
 On behalf of the State it was contended that the demand under Rule 22 was nothing but a further fee or additional consideration, apart from Licence fee, which was neither a further duty nor a further tax and the demand was referable to sections 27 and 28 of the Excise Act.
 Allowing the appeal and setting aside the judgment of the High Court, this Court, 
 HELD: 1. Rule 22 of the Madhya Pradesh Brewery Rules, 1970 to the extend it permits raising a demand, which in sum and substance is additional excise duty, without its being actually due is ultra vires the act and beyond the rule making power of the State. [604 E] 
 2. The excise duty collected goes to the coffers of the State. The pay of officers have to come out from coffers of the State. Under Rule 22 five per cent of the duty leviable is assessed to meet the pay of such officers, which the Government, but for the Rule, is otherwise supposed to meet.This part of the rule is purely internal between the Government and its officers. The licensee is least concerned as to how the excise duty leviable would be appropriated. It is only in the case of a shortfall when the excess is sought to be realised from the brewer that he gets affected. The excess is obviously the sum which falls short of the duty leviable. It cannot for a moment be suggested that when there is a shortfall, the demand is as if of an "additional fee or consideration" and not additional excise duty. It is obvious from the language of Rule 22 that in the event of the excise duty leviable falling short of the expected five per cent to meet the pays of the officers cannot be met therefrom, the state has all the same to pay. The measure under Rule 22 goes to recoup the state of the charges by demanding a sum equal to the duty leviable to that extent without lifting exciseable articles. On this understanding arrived at the demand cannot be sustained and is quashed.

 3. Though under Section 28 of the Excise Act licences are issued on the prescribed forms and on payment of such fee as prescribed and licences containing such particulars as the State Government may direct etc. this power even though wide is yet confined within its frame and can in no event assume the power to impose or levy a tax or excise duty by 597 means of a rule without the sanction of the Act. The payment asked, on the contingency of events, cannot partake the character of a fee so as to come within the purview of Section 28. And if it does not the support of Section 62(2)(h) is sterile. Seeking help from Section 27 would also be of no avail because the additional payment conceived of therein is also a payment over and above the duty leviable and as a part consideration towards the grant of any lease under section 18. The additional consideration conceived of in Section 27 is a consideration over and above the excise duty. The terms of Section 27 do not go to retrieve the situation [604 A-D] Bimal Chandra Banerjee v. State of Madhya Pradesh, [1971] ISCR 844; State of M.P. V.
