 The appellant applied for allotment of certain urban agricultural land which was a part of the evacuee agricultural land acquired under section 12 of the Displaced Persons (Compensation & Rehabilitation) Act, 1954. The appellant approached the authority for transfer of the land to him in accordance with rule 34C of the Rules. He claimed to be in possession of the land in question continuously from before January 1, 1956, although his name was not even recorded in the Jamabandi or the Khasra Girdawari. He examined some witnesses before the 'Settlement Officer, who accepted their oral evidence and by his order dated 21-81969 held that the appellant was entitled to get transfer of the land at a price to be fixed under rule 34B of the Rules.
 Several years later a reference was made. under section 24 of the Act by the Superintendent for setting aside the order of the Settlement Officer. The Chief Settlement Commissioner accepted the reference and set aside the order.
 The appellant went in revision under section 33 ,of the Act which was dismissed by the Financial Commissioner. The Writ Petition filed by the appellant before the High Court failed.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : The appellant claims that he has been cultivating the land continuously from the year 1954 onwards. He filed application in 1973 for correction of the entry in the Khasra Girdawari by recording his name therein. The Naib Tahsildar directed the correction, of the Khasra Girdawari for the period 1971-72 and 7273. He could not direct the entry of the earlier period since he could not do so in accordance with the departmental instructions. The appellant filed a suit in 1974 for correction of the entry for the earlier period. The lessees were impleaded as defendants but in spite of service of summons they did not appear to contest it. The suit was decreed ex-parte and the appellant was declared as tenant of the land in dispute since 1954. The Chief Settlement Commissioner and the Financial Commissioner did not place any reliance on the testimony of the witneses examined by the appellant in the absence of entries in the revenue record. it Is not the requirement of the rule that a person claiming transfer under any part of the rule must be one whose name is found entered in the revenue records. 'Me entry in the revenue record is an important piece of evidence on the question of occupation or possession but it is not conclusive of the factors to be decided under rule 34C nor is it the law that a subsequent valid order passed by a competent authority or court directing the correction of the entries cannot be taken into consideration.
 The Court, therefore, set aside the judgment of the Chief Settlement Commissioner and the Financial Commissioner and remanded the matter back to the Chief Settlement Commissioner for reconsideration by taking into account the order of the Naib Tahsildar and the decree of the Civil Court subject to such objections as might be raised.
