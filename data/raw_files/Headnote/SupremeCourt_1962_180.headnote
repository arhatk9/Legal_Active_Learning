 Lokamanya Tilak died on August 1, 1920, leaving a will. On August 16, 1920, his two sons and the executor appointed by him under the will executed a trust deed in respect of two newspapers "The Kesari" and "The Maharatta", and the property and the machinery pertaining thereto. Clause 1 of the trust deed recited: "This Trust deed has been made as a means to the fulfillment perpetually and uninterruptedly.
 after the death of the late Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak of that very object of his with which he took all activities after he took charge of the newspapers-the Kesari and Maratha such as of spreading political education through the newspapers and thereby making people alive to their political rights and carrying on other multifarious public activities conducive to the national ideal etc." A survey of the public life and activity of Lokmanya Tilak showed that his purpose in taking over and conducting the newspapers was political, in the sense of seeking to achieve by means of rousing the consciousness of the people to their condition, a political awareness, by which adjustments of a political character would be demanded and enforced by the persons who imbibed those truths or were influenced by such writings.
 The question was whether the aforesaid trust was a public charitable trust within the definition in S. 2 (13) read with s. 9 (4) of the Bombay Public Trusts Act, '1950, so as to justify an order by the charity Commissioner requiring the trustees to have the trust 626 Held, (Subba Rao, J., Dissenting), that a political purpose is not a charitable purpose and does not come within the meaning of the expression "for the advancement of any other object of general public utility" in s. 9 (4) of the Bombay Public Trusts Act, 1950.
 The life mission of Lokmanya Tilak which he sought to active and achieved through the two newspapers, and which was set out in the trust deed dated August 16, 1920, as the object for which the trust was founded, was a political purpose and, therefore, the trust was not required to be registered under s. 18 of the Act.
 Per Subba Rao, J.-The, object of Tilak, after he took over the newspapers, was to work for the regeneration of the country, and he thought that national education through newspapers and writings which would make people alive to their political rights, was the most important item in the uplift of the country. The trust executed to perpetuate the said object was clearly a trust for general public utility within the meaning of s. 9 (4) of the Act. The expression "object of general public utility" is very comprehensive and it includes every purpose, whether political or otherwise, provided it is an object of general public utility.
