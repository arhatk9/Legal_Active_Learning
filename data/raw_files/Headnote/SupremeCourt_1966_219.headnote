 The respondent filed a suit against his wife, the appellant, for dissolution of his marriage with her on the ground that she was living in adultery. The trial court dismissed the suit. In appeal, the High Court held that the wife was not living in adultery, but that two letters written by the co- respondent to the wife showed that there had been sexual intercourse between the wife and the co-respondent in 1955, after the marriage, and that the respondent would be entitled to claim judicial separation under s. 10(1) (f) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Relying upon the amendment to s. 13(1) (viii) by the Hindu Marriage (Uttar Pradesh Sanshodhan) Adhiniyam, 1962, the High Court also held that it was a case where a decree for dissolution of marriage could be passed. The decree of the High Court was dated 7th January 1964 on which date the marriage stood dissolved. On 7th April 1964, the wife presented a petition, for special leave to appeal to this Court. But, in ignorance of that step, the respondent married another woman in July 1964 and a son was born to her in May 1965. Meanwhile, in September 1964, the respondent to notice of the grant of special leave. In September 1966, he applied to this Court for revocation of the grant of special leave, on the ground, that because of the negligence of the wife in not informing him that she was applying for special leave, he had married again and a child was also born to his second wife who might become illegitimate if the appeal was allowed.
 
HELD: (1) Even though it may not have been unlawful for the respondent to have married immediately after the High Court's decree, for no appeal as of right lies from the decree of the High Court to this Court in these matters, still, the respondent had to make sure whether an applica- tion for special leave had been filed 'in this Court. He could not, by marrying immediately after the High Court's decree, deprive the wife of the chance of presenting a special leave petition to this Court. By doing so, be took a risk and could not ask this Court to revoke the special leave on that ground. [868] (2) The order of the High Court granting divorce should be set aside (i) Even assuming that the two letters indicated that there was some illicit intimacy between the wife and the co- respondent, the High Court was in error in granting divorce under s. 13 (1) (viii) as amended by the U.P. amendment.
 Before a decree for divorce can be granted thereunder, there must first be a decree for judicial separation and thereafter, under the amendment, a decree for divorce will follow if one of two conditions 865 is satisfied, namely, that (a) a period of two years had elapsed, or (b) the case is one of exceptional hardship to the petitioner or of exceptional depravity on the part of the other party. The amended clause therefore requires first a decree for judicial separation and thereafter a decree for divorce may follow under cl. (b) without waiting for two years. It is not open to a court to grant a decree for divorce forthwith on the ground of exceptional hardship to the petitioner or of exceptional depravity on the NO of the other party, even without a decree of judicial separation, on the assumption that a decree of judicial separation could have been passed on the ground mentioned in s. 10(1)(f).
 [870 C-H] (ii) The two letters do not however indicate that there must have been sexual intercourse between the wife and the co- respondent in 1955. Therefore, there was no ground even for a decree of judicial separation in favour of the respondent.
 [871 C] (iii) Even if there had been such sexual intercourse there was condonation within the meaning of s. 23 ( 1) (b) of the Act. In his statement under O.X, r. 2 Civil Procedure Code, the respondent admitted that he knew of the illicit relations between his wife and the co-respondent even in 1955 or 1956, but the respondent continued to live with his wife and a son was barn to them in 1957. The respondent tried to refile from that statement by stating in his evidence that what he meant was that he entertained suspicion only, but that he was definite about the illicit intimacy only in May/June 1958. But even thereafter, he admitted having sexual relations with his wife up to October - 1958. The fact that the husband cohabited with the wife even after the knowledge that she had been guilty of cohabiting with another would be sufficient to constitute condonation. Moreover the respondent also admitted that he kept her with him at the instance of his friends. Ibis was a clear indication of condonation even in the sense of forgiveness, confirmed or made effective by reinstatement.
