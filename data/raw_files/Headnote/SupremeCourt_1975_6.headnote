 The petitioner has been detained in pursuance of the order of detention passed by the District Magistrate under sub-s.
 (1)(a)(ii) of s. 3 of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971. The act imputed to the detenue is as follows :
 "That on 16-2-73 between 10-08 and 10-14 hours you, along with your other associates, being armed with gun and other weapons committed a dacoity in a 3rd class compartment of running train S 110 Dn. between Habibpur R.S. and Kalinarayanpur Junction R.S. in Ramaghat- Santipur Section and snatched away cash Rs.
 30,000/- from Shri Ashutosh Pal of Calcutta causing bullet injuries to him putting all passengers to fear of death." It was contended for the detenu that a solitary incident cannot imperil internal security and therefore, the order is illegal.
 Rejecting the contention and dismissing the writ petition 
HELD:One who reads the ground of detention, will be alarmed by the training and planning and sinister preparation of skill and spirit which has. made possible the commission of the act imputed organised dacoity in a running railway train by an armed gang equipped with fire-arms and putting, innocent passengers to Peril to life and property... Such action is so manifestly suggestive of desperate daring, organised ganging and habitual proclivity to. violence that it cannot be held unreasonable to infer therefrom a trendy course of criminal conduct-although intercepted or detected but once likely to break public order in a brazen manner and panicking the community by show of force. In this view, the petitioner's detention cannot be castigated as illegal. [194F-G] Obiter It is fair that persons kept incarcerated and embittered without trial should be given some chance to reform themselves by reasonable recourse to the parole power under s. 15. Calculated risks. by release for short periods may, perhaps, be a social gain, the beneficent jurisdiction being wisely exercised, [195F]
