 Petitioner, through Jail, filed a writ petition under art.
 32 for a writ of babeas corpus. He was ordered to be detained u/s. 3 of West Bengal (Prevention of Violent Activities) Act, 1970, with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of the State or the maintenance of public order. The grounds of detention were that the petitioner along with 50/60 other persons armed with lethal weapons raided the house of a person on October 4, 1969 at night and looted cash, ornaments etc., and on November 8, 1969 at about 10 p.m., the petitioner along with 20/30 associates armed with lethal weapons, raided the house of another citizen and killed his two brothers and looted ornaments etc.
 It was contended on behalf of the petitioner that the detaining authority had taken into consideration facts extraneous to Sec. 3 of the Act in making the order of detention and therefore, the said order was illegal and secondly, that the order of detention showed that the District Magistrate had not duly applied his mind before making the detention order as the petitioner was detained with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of the State or the maintenance of public order. According to the petitioner, the detaining authority was not sure as to whether the petitioner was detained for acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of the State or whether he was detained from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. The District Magistrate could not make an indefinite order by using the word 'or' in the detention order and so the order was bad. Dismissing the petition, 
HELD : (i) The activities of the petitioner as mentioned in the grounds of detention were not of an extraneous character but fell within, the expression acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of State or the maintenance of public order, as defined in Sub-Section (2) of Section 3 of the Act. According to the grounds of detention, the peti- tioner and his associates committed offenses punishable with death or imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term exceeding seven years or more, and as 'Such, the case of the petitioner was covered by Clause (d) of Sub-Section (2) of Section 3 of the Act. Further, the activities of the petitioner disturbed public order and the petitioner became a terror to the residents of the locality and under the circumstances, the District Magistrate was empowered to exercise his powers under Sub-Section (3) of Section 3 of the Act. [395 F] 380 (ii) The Special definition given in Sub-Section (2) of Section 3 of the Act of the expression, "acting in any manner prejudicial to the security ,of the State or the maintenance of public order', is of comprehensive nature and each one of the activities mentioned in the various clauses of the said sub-section constitutes an act prejudicial to the security of the State or the maintenance of public order. The presence of the word "or" in the definition itself tends to show that the use of that word in the order is not impermissible and there was no element of casualness or absence of due application of the mind in the making of the impugned .order. [397 D] Shelat J. Dissenting : The construction of the definition in S. 3(2) cannot mean that any one of the activities enumerated in Clauses (a) to (c) would fall under both the grounds, namely, the security of the State and the maintenance of public order.
 An act, such as, use of or instigating to use a lethal weapon for the purpose mentioned in Clause (a) (i) or causing insult to the national flag mentioned under Clause (e) would be a ground of detention, if it either affects, or is likely to affect adversely either the security of the State or public order depending upon the potentiality and the extent of the act in question. Such use or instigation or insult to national flag, might affect only public order and on a state-wide potentiality, it might affect adversely even the security of the State. But irrespective of such reach or potentiality, the clause cannot mean that such an act in itself and without anything more must be deemed to fall under the mischief of both the kinds. The result of accepting such a construction would mean that once an ,act falls under any one of the clauses (a) to (e), even if it affects or is likely to affect public order only, must also be held to affect or likely to effect the security of the State thus totally wiping off the difference between the two concepts and their respective areas of influence and that could not be the intention underlying Sub-Section (2) of Sec. 3. Therefore, it must be held that the use of the disjunctive 'or' in the impugned order rendered the order of detention vague and indefinite, indicative of the detaining authority having merely reproduced mechanically the language of S. 3(1) of the Act without applying its mind properly.
