 Clause b(i) of Fundamental Rule 56, as it stood prior to November 30, 1962 provided that a pre 1938 ministerial servant might be required to retire at the age of 55 years but should ordinarily be retained in service, if he continued efficient, upto the age of 60 years. By memoran- dum dated 31st December, 1963, the President of India decided that, subject to the right conferred by memorandum dated November 30, 1962 to retire any officer on three months' notice after he attained the age of 55 years, pre- 1938 ministerial officers governed by F.R. 56(b)(i) had to be .continued in service like all other government servants upto the age of 58 years without an annual order sanctioning their retention. The respondent was a ministerial government servant governed by clause b(i). He entered government service prior to April, 1938 and would have attained the age of 55 years on March 14, 1964. On December 18, 1963 the Collector, Central Excise passed an order retiring the respondent from service. The order gave the respondent option to retire with effect from March 14, 1964 or to proceed on leave as might be admissible or granted to him preparatory to retirements The respondent was on preparatory leave extending upto 28 months after March 14 1964 and was paid the salary that was admissible to him for this leave period. The High Court quashed the order of retirement and held that the respondent would be deemed to be in service until he attained the age of 60 years. The High Court further was of the view that the memorandum was not in the nature of executive or administrative instruction.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : The orders of the High Court that the respondent would be deemed to be- in service until he attained the age of 60 had to be upheld.
 The memorandum was given effect to in relation to ministerial servants at all relevant times subsequent to December 31, 1963. The government acted on the memorandum.
 The respondent would be entitled to the benefit of the memorandum as all other government servants were at the relevant time. To deny the respondent operation of the memorandum will be infraction of Art. 14 of the Constitution. [612 F-G] The respondent was on preparatory leave extending upto 28 months after March 14, 1964; and he was paid the salary that was admissible to him. Therefore, for 28 months he continued to be a government servant. Taking into consideration these features it is clear that the respondent was entitled to the benefit of the increased age of retirement namely 58 years and thereafter upto 60 years in accordance with the memorandum. [613 A] 609 The Court did not find it necessary to express any opinion on the question whether the memorandum was a mere executive or administrative instruction or had the force of a statutory rule.
