 Under r. 75-A of the Defence of India Rules, 1939, the respondents land and building thereon were requisitioned.
 while that requisition order was subsisting, an order for acquisition of the land and building was passed under s. 4 of the Assam Land (Requisition and Acquisition) Act (Assam 25 of 1948). Realising later that the power under s. 4 could be exercised only when there was a requisition order under s. 3, the defect was sought to be rectified by passing an order of requisition to take effect from a date anterior to the order of acquisition. The respondents applied for a reference under s. 8 of the Act and, the Subordinate Judge to whom the reference was made and the High Court on appeal held the acquisition invalid.
 In appeal to the Supreme Court, it was contended that notwithstanding the illegality the order of acquisition was saved by s. II of the Act, as an order made in exercise of power conferred by or under the Act.
 
 HELD : The power which was exercisable under s. 4 being expressly a power to acquire land which was under requisition under s. 3 and there being no effective order of requisition under that section the acquisition was not made in exercise of the power conferred by or under the Act.
 section 11 was not therefore a bar to the maintainability of the objection raised as to the validity of the acquisition.
