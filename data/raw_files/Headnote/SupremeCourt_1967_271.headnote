 The assessee was carrying on the business of supplying lime and sand, and for the purpose of procuring sand, obtained a lease of a river bed from the State Government, for a.
 period of 11 months. The lease deed provided, (a) for the payment of a large amount of lease money, (b) that the lessee (assessee) was to have an exclusive right to enter upon and occupy the land and to carry away sand within or under or upon the land, and (c) that if any mineral was discovered and the assessee -intimated his intention not to work or failed to give any intimation to work it, would be open to the Government to sublet the working of such newly discovered mineral.
 The assessee paid the lease money and in proceedings for assessment of income tax claimed it as a deduction on the basis that it was a revenue expenditure. The Income-tax Officer disallowed the claim holding that it was capital expenditure. On appeal, the Appellate Assistant Commis- sioner, after a personal investigation, found that the contract was for removal 1 of sand lying on the surface of the land and that no excavation or skillful extraction was involved in the process, and held, that no interest in the land was conveyed to, the lessee and that therefore the amount was deductible as revenue expenditure. The Appellate Tribunal confirmed the order observing that the finding of fact given by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner was not challenged before the Tribunal. On reference, the High Court, relying on the terms of the lease, reversed the finding of fact that the contract was for removal of sand lying on the surface of the land- and that no excavation or skillful extraction was involved, and held that,the assessee bad acquired a right in the land and that the amount was not deductible.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD. :(I) The clauses in the lease deed, giving an exclusive right to the assessee to enter upon and occupy the land, and referring to the right of the Government to sublet the working of any newly discovered mineral, indicate that the assessee was the lessee and that an interest in land was conveyed to him by the lease. But that is.not decisive of the question whether the money paid under the lease was a capital or a revenue expenditure. That question has to be decided on the facts of each case and the decisive factors are the object with which the lease was take and the nature of the payment which was made when obtaining the leas-.-.
 [416 C-E; 418 A] (2) In spite of the right given to the assessee to dig and excavate, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner found as a fact that the sand was lying loose on the surface and that the contract was only for removal of Sup.Cf/68 -1 2 414 that sand. The finding was affirmed by the Appellate Tribunal and is no question was referred to the High Court that it was a finding based on no evidence, the High Court was in error in not accepting it. Therefore, (a) as the lease was for a short period, and consequently, the ex- penditure incurred by the assessee was not related to the acquisition of an asset or of a right of an enduring nature or permanent character but merely to obtain his stock-in- trade in the form of sand; and (b) as the expenditure was incurred not for the reservation of a source which had to be excavated or skillfully worked but for the specific object of enabling the assessee to remove sand lying loose on the surface of the land, the expenditure was deductible as revenue expenditure.
