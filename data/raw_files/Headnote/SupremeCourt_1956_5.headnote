 As a general rule in criminal proceedings, the important witmesses on whose testimony the case against the accused has to be established must be examined in Court and usually the issuing of commission should-be restricted to formal witnesses or to such 41 322 witnesses who cannot be produced without unreasonable delay or inconvenience. The evidence against the accused should be recorded in his presence and in open Court so that the accused may have an opportunity to effectively cross examine the witnesses and the presiding officer may have the advantage and opportunity of hearing the witnesses and of noting their demeanour. Witnesses should not be examined on commission except in extreme cases of delay, expense or inconvenience and in particular the examination through interrogatories should be resorted to only in unavoidable cases.
 Before the amendment of S. 503, Code of Criminal Procedure, by s. 97, Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, (26 of 1955), no magistrate other than a District Magistrate or a Presidency Magistrate could issue a commission, and if any subordinate Magistrate found it necessary to have a witness examined on commission he had to apply to the District Magistrate who would either issue the commission or reject the application.
 Therefore in a case where important witnesses had been examined on commission through interrogatories, and the order for the examination on commission had been passed by the trying magistrate and not by the District Magistrate, the Court set aside the conviction and sentence and ordered a retrial.
