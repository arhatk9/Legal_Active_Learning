 One L was living with his sons K and j in the village. He was not in affluent circumstances. K left the ancestral home; he first joined military service and then police service. He gave up service and started a business with his savings. He brought his nephews R (husband of the respondent) and B (appellant) at differernt times and allowed them to take part in the business. At his death K left a will bequeathing all his properties to his two nephews. After the death of R, his widow, the respondent, filed' a suit against B, the appellant in a Revenue Court under the U.P. Tenancy Act, for a half share of the income of some of the villages left by K. As a dispute arose as to proprietary title the Revenue Court framed an issue there on- and referred it to the Civil Court as required by the Act. The Civil Court held that the respondent had a half share in the villages and on the basis of this finding the Revenue Court decreed, the suit. Thereafter, the appellant filed the present suit in a Civil Court for a declaration that he was the absolute owner of all the properties in suit. His case was that L, his sons and descendants constituted a joint Hiudu family, that there was never any partition in the family, that K, R and B jointly started a business and they jointly acquired some properties during the lire time of K, some after the death of K and some after the death of R, that the said pro. pretties were joint family properties and that he as the survivor was the absolute owner of all the properties. Alternatively, 441 441 he pleaded that even if there was a partition in -the family of L, a reunion should be inferred from the conduct of K, R and B during the lifetime of K and thereafter. The respondent contended that the family of.L was divided, that K started the business with the aid of his self acquisitions and purchased properties out of the income thereof, that after the death of K the two brothers R and B got his properties under his will, that they jointly acquired further properties out of the income of the business, that after the death of R, the appellant succeeded to the half share of R and that the decree of the Revenue Court operated as resjudicata.
 Held, that the suit was not barred by resjudicata by the judgment of the Revenue Court. The present suit was not within the exclusive jurisdiction of the 'Revenue Court and was maintainable in the Civil Court and as such s. 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure was attracted. The judgment of the Revenue Court on the issue of proprietary title could not operate as res judicata as the Revenue Court was not competent to try the subsequent suit.
 Venkatarama Rao v. Venkayya, A. 1. R. 1954 Mad. 788 approved.
 Held, further, that there was a partition of the family during the lifetime of I,. Every Hindu family is presumed to be joint unless the contrary is proved; but this presumption can be rebutted by direct evidence of partition or by course of conduct leading to an inference of partition. There is no presumption that when one member separates from the others the latter remain united; whether the latter remain united or not must be decided on the facts of each case. in the case of old transactions when no contemporaneous documents are maintained and when most of the active participants of the transactions have passed away, though the burden still remains on the person who asserts separation, it. is permissible to fill up gaps more readily by reasonable inferences than in cases where the evidence is not obliterated by passage of time. The conduct of the parties for about 50 years was consistent with their separation rather than with their jointness.
 Held, further, that it was not established that there was any reunion between K and his nephews. Reunion must be strictly proved. To constitute reunion there must be an intention of the parties to reunite in estate and interest.
 It is implicit in the concept of a reunion that there shall be an agreement between the parties to reunite in estate -with an intention to revert to their former status of a joint Hindu family. It is not necessary that there should be a formal and express agreement to reunite; such an agreement can be established by clear evidence of conduct incapable of explanation 442 on any other footing. In, the plaint it was not alleged that a reunion had taken place by agreement but the court was asked to hold that there was reunion on the ground that the conduct of parties amounted to a reunion. The conduct of the parties spreading over 50 years did not show that K and his nephews had consciously entered into an agreement to reunite and become members of a joint Hindu family.

 83, Venkataramayya v. Tatayya, A.I.R. 1943 Mad, 538 and Ramadin v. Gokul prasad, A.I.R. 1959 M.P. 251, referred to.
 It is not possible under the Hindu law for some members only belonging to different branches or even to a single branch of a family to constitute a subordinate joint Hindu family. Any property jointly acquired by such members cannot become joint family Property and would be governed by the terms of the agreement between them under which it was acquired. The principle of joint tenancy is unknown to Hindu law except in the case of the joint property of an undivided Hindu family governed by the Mitakshara law which under that law passes by survivorship.
