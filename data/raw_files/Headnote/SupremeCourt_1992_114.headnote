 Section 38 of the Travancore-Cochin Medical Practitioners' Act, 1953 provides that no person other than a registered medical practitioner or a practitioner whose name is entered in the list published under section 30 or in the list published under Section 25 shall practise modern medicine, homoepathic medicine, ayurvedic medicine, siddha medicine or unani tibbi medicine. It further provides that no person who is not a registered practitioner of any such medicine shall practise any other medicine unless he is also registered practitioner of that medicine. First proviso to the said section empowers the State Government to grant exemption from the application of the section by publishing a Notification in the official gazette. In exercise of the power conferred by the said proviso the Government of Kerala issued a notification dated May 4, 1977 directing that Section 38 shall not aply to persons holding degree and diploma from Kerala University in Integrated Medicine (DAM) for practising 654 modern medicine in the State. By an order dated September 28, 1978 Government of Kerala also ordered that the Diploma in Medicine and Surgery (DMS) awarded by Government of Bihar will be held at par with the integrated DAM of Kerala Uni- versity and by its notification dated April 13, 1981 the Government directed that section 38 shall not apply to holders of DMS awarded by Government of Bihar.
 The appellant challenged the validity of first proviso to section 38 and the Notifications dated May 4, 1977 and April 13, 1981 issued there-under as well as the order dated 28th September 1978 on the ground that the first proviso to Section 38 of the Travancore-Cochin Medical Practitioners' Act, 1953, a State Act, was void under Article 254 of the Constitution because it was repugnant to and inconsistent with section 15 of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956, a Central Act.
 The High Court of Kerala did not go into the validity of notification dated May 4, 1977 but it upheld the validity of the first rpoviso and the order dated September 28, 1978 as well as the notification dated April 13, 1981 by holding (a) that the Central Act does not lay down any qualification for registration and all that section 15 says is that a person whose name is not seen in the State register shall not practise medicine; (b) the proviso to section 38 does not in terms say that a person whose name is not on the rolls of the State register in one system can practise another system and it only exempts practitioners who want to practise one system without being in the concerned list from the operation of section 38; (c) that neither the Central Act nor the State Act contains any provision which prohibits a person possessing the requisite qualification to practise two systems from getting enrolled on two State rolls and a practitioner can be a registered practitioner in two regis- ters and the Central Act does not place an embargo on a State from recognising qualifications for the purpose of two systems; (d) that the definition of medicine contained in section 2(f) of the Central Act would not involve both Homoepathic and indigenous system of medicine and that the Central ACt concern itself only with the allopathic medicine and the modern system contemplated by it is the allopathic medicine. Against the judgment of the Kerala High Court appeal was filed in this court.
 Allowing the appeal in part, this court, 655 
HELD: 1. In order that Article 254(1) of the Constitution may apply, two conditions must be fulfilled. Firstly, provisions of the Provincial law and those of the Central legislation must both be in respect of a matter which is enumerated in the Concurrent List, and secondly, they must be repugnant to each other. It is only when both these reguirements are satisfied that the Provincial law will, to the extent of the repugnancy, become void. [661 B-C] A. S. Krishna v. State of Madras, [1956] INSC 76; [1957] SCR 399, Hoechst Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and Anr. etc. v. State of Bihar and Ors., [1983] INSC 63; [1983] 3 SCR 130, referred to.
 
 2. In the instant case the Central Act as well as the State Act are both laws made in respect of the medical profession which is a matter relating to Entry 26 of the Concurrent List. The field of operation of the State Act covers all the systems of medicine, namely, allopathic, ayurvedic, siddha, unani and homoepathic systems of medicine. Moreover it deals with recognition of qualifications required for registration of a person as a medical practitioner in these systems, conditions for registration of medical practitioners and maintenance of register of practitioners for each system and constitution of separate councils for modern medicine homeopathic medicine and indigenous medicine. [661 E, 665 C-D] As compared to the State ACt, the field of operation of the Central Act is restricted and it is confined in its application to modern scientific medicine, namely, the allopathic system of medicine only, wherein also it deals with recognition of medical qualifications which may entitle a person to be registered as a medical practitioner, consti- tution of the Medical Council of India to advise the Central Government in the matter of recognition or withdrawal of recognition of medical qualifications, to prescribe the minimum standards of medical education required for granting recognised medical qualifications by Universities or medical institutions in India and to appoint inspectors and visitors for inspection of any medical institution, college or hospi- tal. But the Central Act does not deal with the registra- tion of medical practitioners in the States and it proceeds on the basis that the said registration and the maintenance of State Medical Register is to be governed by the law made by the State. It cannot, therefore, be said that the Central Act lays down an exhaustive code in respect of the subject matter dealt with by the State ACt. [665 E-H] 656 
 2.1 However it can be said that the Central Act and the State Act, to a limited extent occupy the same field, viz, recognition of medical qualifications which are required for a person to be registered as a medical practitioner in the allopathic system of medicine. Both the enactments make provision for recognition of such qualifications granted by the Universities or medical institutions. [665 H, 666 A] Deep Chand v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Ors., [1959] suppl. 2 SCR 8, relied on.
 M. Karunanidhi v. Union of India, [1979] 3SCR 254, referred to.
 
 3. The High Court erred in holding that the Central ACt does not lay down the qualifications for registration of a medical practitioner. The provisions of the Central Act contemplate that a person can practise in allopathic system of medicine in a state or in the country only if he possesses a recognised medical qualification. Permitting a person who does not possess the recognised medical qualification in the allopathic system of medicine would be in direct conflict with the provisions of the Central Act.
 [668 A, 668 C] 
 4. The first proviso to Section 38 of the Travancore- Cochin Medical Practitioners' Act, 1953 in so far as it empowers the State Government to permit a person to practise allopathic system of medicine even though he does not pos- sess the recognised medical qualifications for that system of medicine is inconsistent with the provisions of Sections 15 and 21 read with Sections 11-14 of the Central Act. The said proviso suffers from the vice of repugnancy in so far as it covers persons who want to practise the Allopathic system of medicine and is void to the extent of such repug- nancy. Practitioners in allopathic system of medicine must, therefore, be excluded from the scope of the first proviso and it must be confined in its application to systems of medicines other than the Allopathic system of medicine.
 [668 C-E] 4.1. The notification dated April 13, 1981, issued under the first proviso to Section 38, which enables holders of DMS diploma to practise modern medicine cannot be upheld and is set aside. However the order dated September 20, 1978 treating the DMS diploma awarded by Government of Bihar at par with Integrated DAM of the University of Kerala for the purpose of continuing in profession only has not been issued under the 657 first proviso to Section 38 of the State Act and it does not entitle the holders of DMS diploma to get themselves regis- tered as medical practitioner in modern medicine and prac- tise modern medicine. Consequently, it does not suffer from the same infirmity as the notification dated April 13, 1981.
