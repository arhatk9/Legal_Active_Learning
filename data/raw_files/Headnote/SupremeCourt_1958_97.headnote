 The respondents who were drivers, not being owners, were found driving motor vehicles in contravention of the terms of the 'permits granted under S. 42(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act. They were prosecuted and were convicted under s. 123 Of the Act and sentenced to pay fine. The High Court held that under S. 42(1) it was the owner alone who was interdicted from using or permitting the use of the vehicle save in accordance with the conditions of the permit and that, accordingly, if the vehicle was used against the conditions of the permit only the owner, and no one else, including the driver, could be guilty of the contravention under s. 123.
 Held, that drivers of the motor vehicles were also liable under s. 123 of the Act for driving in contravention of the terms of the permits. Section 42(1) contemplates not only prohibition against the user by the owner of the vehicle or his permitting its user contrary to the conditions of the permit but it also contemplates that the vehicle itself shall be used only in the manner authorised by the permit.
 Section 123 penalises all 20 154 persons who drive a motor vehicle or cause or allow a motor vehicle to be used or let out a motor vehicle to be used in contravention of the provisions of s. 42(1).
