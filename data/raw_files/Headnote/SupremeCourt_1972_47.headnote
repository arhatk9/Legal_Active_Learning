 Because of allegations that the Inspector of a traffic barrier was demanding bribe from a lorry driver a trap was arranged. It was led by a Circle Inspector (P.W. 1). The decoy witness handed over Rs. 40 in currency notes to constable N inside the barrier office. Thereafter a signal was given to the police party. When N saw P.W. 1 approaching lie hid the aforesaid currency notes in an inner apartment of the office under an overcoat. P.W. 1 made a search of the premises and recovered the notes from Linder the overcoat. When he was preparing the Panchnama appellant U arrived on the scene and took P.W. 1 to task for having entered his office without permission or reference to him.
 He then asked N not to sign the seizure memo. While this altercation was going on appellant S, the Barrier Inspector, arrived there and be also reprimanded P.W. 1 and questioned his authority. Even though P.W. 1 asserted that authority was conferred on him to make a search, S asked him to give him in writing that he had entered the barrier office without the permission of the person in-charge otherwise he would not be allowed to go out. P.W. 1 agreed to give the writing at the Dak Bungalaw and moved out of the office but he was brought back by force and a threat to beat him with a danda was held out. Under threat from S and U P.W. 1 gave them a copy of the seizure memo as also a writing to the effect that a search was taken. On these facts, S, U and N were charged under ss. 353 and 342 of the Indian Penal Code.
 The trial Court while holding that assault, wrongful restraint and wrongful confinement were proved against the appellants nevertheless acquitted them because the provisions of s. 165 Criminal Procedure Code relating to search were not complied with. The High Court in appeal by the State held that the non-observance of the provisions of s. 165 Cr.P.C. were a mere irregularity and on this view convicted the appellants under ss. 332, 353 and 342 of the Indian Penal Code. The appellants in appeals by special leave contended before this Court that (i) since the search was made without recording reasons as required under s. 165 Cr.P.C. they had a right to obstruct it and (ii) since P.W.
 1 did not give them a copy of the seizure memo as required by s. 103 Cr. P.C. the entire investigation was vitiated and consequently any obstruction caused in the subsequent process of investigation would not constitute any offence.
 
HELD : It may be that an obstruction during the course of a search not conducted in conformity with the provisions of s.
 165 Cr. P.C. might be justified but there was no warrant for the further submission that the person in whose premises a search is made or from whom articles are seized is entitled to act in the manner the appellants had acted in.
 preventing P.W. 1 from discharging his official duties.
 Obstruction lo search 423 is to the act of the person conducting a search. It is a defensive act but where search has ended and the persons conducting the search have left the premises, to bring them back and make them do things against their will is not an obstruction to an act but a compulsion to make them act.
 [426 H; 429 H] There was no non-compliance with s. 103 Cr.P.C. by P.W. 1.
 He was preparing a copy of the seizure memo as required by the section but he was prevented from completing it by the appellants who asked N not to sign it. Moreover P.W. 1 had asked the appellants to come to the Dak Bungalow and take the copy. Section 103 does not say that the copy should be given then and there though ordinarily that will be implied.
 It could be given soon after the search so long as there is no opportunity to raise any suspicion or doubt as to the authenticity of articles seized. [429 D-E] Not to allow P.W. 1 to go to the Dak Bungalow and take him forcibly from the road into the office and threaten him with a lathi to write and give a memo that he had searched the office when he was willing to do so at the Dak Bungalow, was to wrongfully confine him during the period he did not comply with that demand., Nor can the illegality of the search continue as contended during the whole process of investigation till the filing of the charge-sheet under s.
 173 Cr.P.C. The effect of accepting such a proposition would be to thwart public justice. [429 F-G] On the facts of the case the conviction of the appellant S under ss. 342 and 353 and of appellant U under ss. 353 and 342 read with s. 34 was justified. 1430 A] [In view of the above finding the conviction of the appellants under s. 332 was set aside without going into the legality of the conviction under that section].
