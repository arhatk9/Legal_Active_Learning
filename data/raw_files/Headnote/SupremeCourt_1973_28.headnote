 The appellant was the daughter of a member of the Krishnanwaka Community by one of his two wives, and the first respondent was his son by the other wife. The appellant filed the suit claiming half share of her father's property on the basis of a custom of special kind of Patnibhagam. The special kind of Patnibhagam pleaded by the appellant was that even a daughter was entitled to a share.
 On her behalf, reliance was placed on certain earlier decisions regarding the prevalence of the customs in the community. The trial court dismissed the suit, but the first appellate court held in favour of the appellant. In second appeal, the High Court took the view that the decisions relied on by the first appellate court could not be said to have established the existence of the special custom.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD: (1) A custom which has been recognised and affirmed in a, series of decisions each of which was based on evidence adduced in the particular case may become incorporated in the general law, and proof of it then becomes unnecessary under s. 57(1) of the Evidence Act.
 [505G-H] Rama Rao v. Rajah of Pittapur, [1918] I.L.R. 41 (Madras), 778 at 785, Pramraj v. Chand Kunwar, [1947] 11 M.L.J. 516 and Ujagar Singh v. Mat. Jeo, [1959] INSC 47; [1959] 2 S.C.R. (Suppl.), 781 followed.
 (2) Among the decisions cited only one decision recognised the special kind of patnibhagam pleaded by the appellant.
 But even that decision did not proceed on the basis of the evidence in the case but relied upon the observations of the learned judges who decided Ramaswami Sadasivan v. Thanu Gouri. But those observations were pot based on a discussion of the evidence and were not necessary for the decision of that case. [50 D] Avikutti Bhagavathi & Ant-. v. Chithambaratham Mathevan, reported in 8 T.L.R. 51, Ramaswami Sulusivan v. Thanu Gouri reported in Kolappa Pillai's unreported important cases, p.
 179 and Hagaru Pillai Saraswathi Amma v. Thanu Pillai Thanu Pillai, reported in 1944 T.L.R. 710 referred to.
 (3) While it is true that the community is a very small community found in a small local area and cases reaching courts may not be many, the court cannot, on that ground, ignore the well established principle before a custom can be held as having been proved on the basis of earlier decisions. Those decisions should have been based on evidence adduced in those cases. But in the present case, neither of the two decisions which refer to the special kind of patnibhagam pleaded by the appellant was based on the evidence in the case. [508 F-H; 509 A-B]
