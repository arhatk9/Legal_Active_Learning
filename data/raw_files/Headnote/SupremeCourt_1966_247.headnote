 In the State of Mysore, before it was reorganised under the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, surveyors who were posted as officers in charge of sub-divisions were promoted as Assistant Engineers. The petitioners were placed in charge of sub-divisions between December 1945 and November 1949 and the then Government, by a notification dated 12th December 1949, ordered that their promotions were to take effect from ;that date irrespective of the dates on which they were put in charge of the sub-divisions. But, by a notification dated 17th May 1950, the Government showed a concession to a different batch of 41 surveyors, who had been placed in charge of different sub-divisions between March 1944 and January 1946, by promoting them as Assistant Engineers. with effect from ,the dates of occurrence of vacancies,according to seniority. In November 1958, another batch of 107 persons were promoted as Assistant Engineers they also were shown a concession by giving their appointments retrospective effect from Ist November, 1956, when the now State of Mysore emerged under the States Reorganisation Act.
 The petitioners filed a writ petition in the High Court, in 1964, contending that there was nothing in the service rules which prevented the Government from granting such concessions to the petitioners also, and for the issue of a writ of mandamus directing the State to fix their seniority also, on the basis that they had become Assistant Engineers from the dates on which the vacancies to which they had been posted had occurred.
 The petition was dismissed. On appeal to this Court, 
HELD:(a) The concessions shown to the batch of 41 persons who had been appointed before the petitioners and to the batch of 107 persons who had been appointed thereafter, were mere , ad hoc concessions and not something which they could claim as of right. The Court, therefore, could not issue a writ of mandamus commanding the State to show such a concession or other indulgence to the petitioners because, there was no service rule which the State had transgressed, nor had the State evolved :any principle to be followed in respect of persons who were promoted to the rank of Assistant Engineers from surveyors. [75 H-76 B] (b)The petitioners, not having filed the petition within a reasonable time after 17th May 1950 were guilty of laches, and were not entitled to any relief. [76 B-C]
