 The Representation of the People Act 1951, by Section 81 prescribes who may present an election petition. It may be by any candidate at such election, by any elector of the constituency, and by none else. Section 82 clause (a) provides that the petitioner in an election petition shall join as respondents to the petition the returned candidates if the relief claimed is confined to a declaration that the election of all or any of the returned candidates is void and all the contesting candidates if a further declaration is sought that he himself or any other candidate has been duly elected. Clause (b) of the section requires the petitioner to join as respondents any other candidate against whom allegations of any corrupt practice are made in the petition. Section 86 (4) enables any candidate not already a respondent to be joined as respondent.
 The first appellant in the appeal is the Chief Minister and appellants 2 and 3 State Ministers. They had been impleaded by the first respondent as parties to an election petition filed by him in the High Court questioning the election of the second respondent to the House of the People. It was averred in the election petition that the Chief Ministers and the State ministers who were impleaded as parties to the election petition had colluded and conspired with the returned candidate to commit various alleged corrupt practices. The Chief Minister and the other Ministers denied the commission of the various alleged corrupt practices and claimed that the election petitioner was not entitled to implead them as parties to the election petition, as they were not candidates at the election. They filed an application before the High Court to strike out their names from the array of parties in the election petition. It was dismissed on the ground that the appellants were proper parties to the election petition and therefore their names could not be struck out of the array of parties, 319 In the appeal to this Court, it was contended on behalf of the appellants that the concept of a proper party was not relevant in election law and that only those persons could be impleaded as parties who were expressly directed to be so impleaded by the Representation of the People Act 1951, and that they were entitled to be struck out from the array of parties. On behalf of the first respondent it was submitted that the appellants were proper parties to the election petition and their presence was necessary for a complete, final and expeditious decision on the questions involved in the action.
 Allowing the Appeal, ^ 
 HELD: 1. No one can be joined as a party to an election petition otherwise than as provide by Section 82 and 86 (4) of the Representation of the people Act 1951. A person who is not a candidate may not be joined as a respondent to the election petition [331 C-D] In the instant case the names of the appellants and the 7th respondent in the appeal are directed to be struck out from the array of parties in the election petition. [331 D] 
 2. A right to elect, fundamental though it is to democracy, is, anomalously neither a fundamental right nor a Common Law Right. It is a statutory right. So is the right to be elected, and the right to dispute an election. Outside of statute, there is no right to elect, no right to be elected, and no right to dispute an election. Statutory creations they are, and therefore, subject to statutory limitation. An Election petition is not an action at Common Law, nor in equity. It is a statutory proceeding to which neither the Common Law nor the principles of Equity apply but only those rules which the statute makes and applies. It is a special jurisdiction, and a special jurisdiction has always to be exercised in accordance with the statute creating it. Concepts familiar to Common Law and Equity must remain strangers to Election Law unless statutorily embodied. A Court has no right to resort to them on considerations of alleged policy because policy in such matters, as those, relating to the trial of election disputes, is what the statute lays down. In the trial of election disputes, Court is put in a straight jacket. [326 F-H; 327 A-B] 
 3. The contest of the election petition is designed to be confined to the the candidates at the election. All others are excluded. The ring is closed to all except the petitioner and the candidates at the election. Such is the design of the statute. [328 C] 
 4. While clause (b) of section 82 obliges the petitioner in an election petition to join as a respondent any candidate against whom allegations of any corrupt practice are made in the petition, it does not oblige the petitioner to join as a respondent any other person against whom allegations of any corrupt practice are made. While any candidate not already a respondent may seek and, if he so seeks, is entitled to be joined as a respondent under section 86 (4), any other person cannot, under that provision seek to be joined as a respondent, even if allegations of any corrupt practice are made against him.
 [328 A-C] 320 
 5. The concept of `proper parties' is and must remain alien to an election dispute under the Representation of the People Act, 1951. Only those may be joined as respondents to an election petition who are mentioned in section 82 and section 86 (4) and no others. However desirable and expedient it may appear to be none else shall be joined as respondents. [328 D] 
 6. The provisions of the Civil Procedure Code cannot be invoked to permit that which the Representation of the People Act 1951 does not permit. The Civil Procedure Code applies subject to the provisions of the Representation of the People Act 1951 and any rule made thereunder. Section 87 (1) expressly says so . When the Act enjoins the penalty of dismissal of the petition for non-joinder of a party the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code cannot be used as a curative means to save the petition. [328 F-H; 329 A-C] Mohan Raj v. Surendra Kumar Taparia & Ors. [1961] 1 SCR and R. Venkateswara Rao & Anr. v. Bekkam Narasimha Reddi & Ors. [1969]1 SCR 679, referred to.
 
 7. Parliament has expressly provided that an opportunity should be given to a person who is not a candidate to show cause against being 'named' as one guilty of a corrupt practice. Parliament, however, has not thought fit to expressly provide for his being joined as a party to the election petition either by the election-petitioner or at the instance of the very person against whom the allegations of a corrupt practice are made. The right given to the latter is limited to show cause against being 'named' and that right opens up for exercise when, at the end of the election petition notice is given to him to show cause why he should not be 'named'. The right does not extend to participation at all stages and in all matters, a right which he would have if he is joined as a 'party' at the commencement. [329 E-G] 8 (i) The election petitioner cannot by joining as a respondent a person who is not a candidate at the election subject him to a prolonged trial of an election petition with all its intricacies and ramifications. [329-G] (ii) Mischievous minded persons may harass public personages like the Prime Minister of the country, the Chief Minister of a State or a political leader of a national dimension by impleading him as a party to election petitions. All that would be necessary is a seemingly plausible allegation, casually or spitefully made, with but a facade of truth. To permit such a public personage to be impleaded as a party to an election petition on the basis of a mere allegation, without even prima facie proof an allegation which may ultimately be found to be unfounded, can cause needless vexation to sush personage and prevent him from the effective discharge of his public duties. It would be against the public interest to do so. The ultimate award of costs would be no panacea in such cases, since the public mischief cannot be repaired. Public Policy and legislative wisdom both point to an interpretation that the provisions of the Representation of the People Act 1951 does not permit the joining, as parties of persons other than those mentioned in sections 82 and 86 (4). [329 H; 330 A-D] 321 9 (i) The legislative provisions contained in section 99 enables the Court, towards the end of the trial of an election petition, to issue a notice to a person not a party to the proceedings to show cause why he should not be 'named' is a sufficient clarification of the legislative intent that such person may not be permitted to be joined as a party to the election petition. [330 E-F] 9 (ii) If a person who is not a candidate but against whom allegations of any corrupt practice are made is joined as a party he would also be entitled to 'recriminate' under section 97. Such a construction of the statute would throw the doors of an election wide open and convert the petition into a 'free for all' fight. The necessary consequence would be an unending, disorderly election dispute with no hope of achieving the goal contemplated by sec. 86 (6) of the Act that the trial of the election petition should be concluded in six months.
