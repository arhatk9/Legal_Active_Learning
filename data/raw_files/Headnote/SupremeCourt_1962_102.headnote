 A dispute covering claims made by the employees was referred for adjudication to the tribunal by the State Government of.
 West Bengal. The appellant raised a preliminary objection against the validity of the reference and urged that under s. 2(a) the appropriate Government which could make a valid reference in relation to the present dispute was the Central Government and not the Government of West Bengal and so, the reference was unauthorised and incompetent and the Tribunal bad no jurisdiction to deal with it. The Tribunal over- ruled this objection and the case was set down for hearing on the merits. Against this finding, the appellant preferred the present appeal by special leave and the only point raised was that the head office of the appellant at Calcutta being an integral part of the mine, any industrial dispute between the said office and its employees is an industrial dispute-concerning a mine under s. 2(a)(i) and so the appropriate Government must be the Central Government and not the State Government. The question for decision was whether the present dispute can be said to be an industrial dispute concerning a mine. It was argued that the word "industry" is wide enough to include the Head Office of a mining company though, it may be situated away from the 935 place where the mining operations are actually carried on and it is in the light of the said definition of the word "industry" contained in s. 2(j) that the words "in relation to a mine" must be construed.
 Held, that in construing the words-,,an industrial dispute" in relation to a mine, it must first be determined what a mine means and it must be done without reference to the broad definition of industry prescribed by s. 2 j). In the absence of a definition of the word "mine" in the( Act itself, what has to be taken into account is the dictionary meaning of the word "mine" or as is contained in the Mines Act and judged in that light, there can be no difficulty in holding that an industrial dispute between the employees engaged in the Head Office at Calcutta and the employer is not an industrial dispute concerning a mine. The Head Office is not a mine and so, an industrial dispute raised by the employees engaged. in the head office is not an industrial dispute concerning a mine.
 The rights conferred on the lessee under a mining lease can have no direct bearing on the construction of s. 2(a) and therefore, the tribunal rightly. held, that the present dispute between the appellant and its employees at its Head Office at Calcutta is not a dispute in relation to a mine.
 Held, further that all industrial disputes which are outside s. 2(a)(i) are _the concern of the State Government under s.
 2(a)(ii); in other words, the general rule is that an industrial dispute arising between a employer and his employees would be referred for adjudication by the State Government except in cases falling under s. 2(a) (i); and so it is the extent of one of the exception mentioned in s.
 2(a)(i) that has to be determined in the present case, and in determining the extent of the said exception, it would not be irrelevant to bear in mind the scope of the provisions of the Mines Act itself. That is why the fact that an office of a mine is outside the definition of a mine is of some assistance in interpreting the word "mine" under s. 2(a)(1) and therefore, the tribunal rightly came to the conclusion that in the present case the reference by the State Government of West Bengal was valid.
