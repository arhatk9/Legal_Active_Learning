 Respondent No. 1 constructed some godowns on the plot of land leased out to them by the Bombay Port Trust in 1933.
 As a result of explosions in 1944, some of the buildings in the area were destroyed. In order that the building con- struction work in the area might be carried out on modern lines, the Bombay Municipal Corporation formulated a scheme under the provisions of the Bombay Town Planning Act, 1915 to restrain the owners of the land from re-constructing in a haphazard manner in the devastated area. The Governor of Bombay by a proclamation issued under s. 93 of the Govern- ment of India Act. 1935, enacted the City of Bombay (Build- ing, Works and Reconstruction) Act, 1944.
 Section 3 of the 1944-Act prohibited for a period of one year from the date of the commencement of the Act, the work of erecting, constructing, reconstructing, etc. of any building, wall or other structure situate within the speci- fied area except under the written permission of the Commis- sioner and in accordance with the conditions that might be specified therein. Section 8 of the Act provided that the benefit of any written permission granted under s. 3 shall be annexed to and shall go with the ownership of the build- ing in respect of which it was granted and may be enforced by every person in whom that ownership was vested.
 In September 1947, the Municipal Commissioner granted written permission (Exhibit A) to respondent No. 1 under s.
 3 of the 1944-Act to raise temporary godowns on the land on condition that the Commissioner might at any time direct the owner to pull down or remove the work forthwith or within such time ,as may be prescribed.
 One of the godowns erected by respondent No. 1 was leased out to appellant No. 1 in 1953 and the lease was extended from time to time till 1957. In that year the State Government sanctioned a scheme called the Town Plan- ning Bombay City No. 1 scheme under the Bombay Town Planning Act, 1954 and the scheme came into operation on December 1, .1957. The final scheme became a part and parcel of the Bombay Town Planning Act 1954. Respondent No. 1 issued a notice to the appellant calling upon it to quit and give vacant possession of the godown leased out to it. On Sep- tember 19, 1953, the Municipal Commissioner,. Greater Bom- bay, issued a notice (Exhibit B) to respondent No. 1 calling upon it to pull down and remove the entire building for the construction of which permission was granted to it in 1947.
 Respondent No. 1, in turn, issued a notice to the appellant calling upon it to quit. The appellant having refused to give vacant possession of the godown, respondent No. 1 filed a suit for the appellant's eviction on the ground that the premises were required under s. 13(1)(hhh) of the 'Bombay Rents (Hotel and Lodging Houses Rates) Control Act, 1947 for the immediate purpose of demolition ordered by the local authority.
 604 The trial court ordered the appellant's eviction and delivery of immediate possession of the premises to respond- ent No. 1. The appellate court allowed the appellant's appeal. The High Court set aside the decree of the appel- late court.
 On appeal it was contended by the appellants that (i) the 1944-Act being a temporary Act, lapsed on the expiry of two years from April, 1946 and so the Commissioner was not competent to issue Exhibit B-Notice or to take steps to enforce the conditions imposed by him under s. 3 while granting written permission to construct the premises. (ii) The Municipal Commissioner having ceased to have statutory existence on the expiry of the 1944-Act, Exhibit B-notice was a nullity, (iii) Even assuming that the Municipal Com- missioner did not become non est on the expiry of the 1944- Act, the notice was ineffective because s. 489 of the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, 1888 envisages the issue of a notice only for giving effect to the requisition or order made under the section. (iv) No statutory rule or bye-law having been made under the 1944-Act, Exhibit B-notice did not constitute an order contemplated by s. 13(1)(hhh) of the Bombay Rent Control Act, 1947, (v) Under s. 13(1) (hhh) before passing the eviction order the Court must be satis- fied that the demolition was imminent and the evidence led in this case showed that the premises were not required for immediate demolition; (vi) The final scheme having been suspended and varied, there was no subsisting order and since there was no urgency for the demolition of the prem- ises, invocation of s. 13(1) (hhh) was not called for and (vii) Exhibit B- notice was ineffective because under the Town Planning Acts of 1915, 1954 or 1966, it was the local authority and not the landlord that had the power to evict.
 Dismissing the appeals, 
 HELD: 1(a) There is no force in the contention that the Municipal Commissioner was not competent to issue Exhibit B-notice. The provisions of ss. 3 and 8 of the 1944-Act were permanent as to the restrictions, rights and obliga- tions imposed, acquired or incurred thereunder. A fortiory, the rights acquired by the Municipal Commissioner by virtue of the express conditions imposed by him while granting Exhibit A permission, were not subject to a time limit and did not lapse with the expiry of the Act. [621 E; 620 H] (b) The analogy of the rule that criminal proceedings taken against a person for offences committed under a temporary statute will ipsc facto terminate when the tempo- rary statute expired cannot be extended to rights and li- abilities as in the instant case. It is settled law that transactions concluded- and completed under a temporary statute, while the same was in force, often endure and continue despite the expiry of the statute and 'so do' the rights and obligations acquired or incurred thereunder, depending upon the provisions of the statute and the nature and character of the rights and liabilities. No rigid or inflexible rule can be laid down in this behalf. [616 F:G] In the instant case, the City of Bombay (Building Works Restriction) Act 1944; as evident from its preamble and statement of Objects and ReasOns was designed to prevent the growth of buildings in a haphazard fashion which might conflict with the contemplated scheme of systematic town planning in the area devastated by explosion. Section 3 of the 1944-Act which related to the imposition of restrictions on building work in that area, including the plot in ques- tion, authorised the Municipal Commissioner to impose such conditions as he might think fit to specify while granting permission for construction of building or a structure. The Municipal Commissioner gave permission to the respondents to build on the plot subject to the express condition that the structures would be pulled down whenever required to do so to give effect to any improvement scheme that might be made under the Town Planning Act. The rights and obligations flowing from the conditions subject to which the permission to build was granted to the respondents were annexed to the ownership of the building for all time to come and were not limited to the duration of the 1944-Act.

 2. Though the 1944-Act was a temporary Act, the Commis- sioner did not cease to exist with the expiry of that Act.
 The 1944-Act was supplemental to the Bombay Municipal Corpo- ration Act, 1888. Being a creature of the 1888Act and a functionary required to be appointed from time to time in terms of s. 54 of that Act, his life did not depend upon the life of the 1944-Act. [621 F-G] 3(a) The challenge to the validity of the notice on the ground of lack of power in the Commissioner was wholly unjustified. Although Exhibit notice was purported to have been issued under s. 489 of the 1888-Act, it was really issued under Special Regulation 36 which became a part and parcel of the Town Planning Act 1954 by virtue of s. 51(3) of the Act. The notice showed that it was being issued under the Town Planning Act, 1954. The notice was, there- fore, issued under the Special Regulation No. 36. [622 A B] (b) The fact that reference to s. 489 of the 1888-Act was erroneously or incorrectly made in the notice, was immaterial. It is settled law that if the exercise of power could be traced to a legitimate source, the fact that it was exercised under a different power did not vitiate the exer- cise of the power in question.

 4. The direction in Exhibit B-notice for demolition of the premises clearly had its origin in the statutory provi- sions and it constituted an order within the meaning of s.
 13(1)(hhh) of the 1947-Act. The Municipal Commissioner had plenary power under s. 3 of the 1944-Act to authorise the construction of any building or structure in the area sub- ject to restrictions specified in the permission. The permission had been granted subject to the express condition that respondent No. 1 shall pull down or remove the tempo- rary structure when called upon. It can be enforced by the Commissioner under Regulations 36 and 38 of the Special Regulation. [624 E; 622H] 5(a) In view of the findings of fact by the court below that the premises were required for the immediate purposes of demolition, it was not open to the appellants to raise the point at this stage. [624 F] (b) There is a vital difference between cls. (hh) and (hhh) of s. 13(1). While cl. (hh) relates to the landlords bona fide intention to demolish the building of his own volition and to erect a new building in its place, cl. (hhh) relates to the compulsory demolition ordered by a local or competent authority and was aimed at preventing a landlord or tenant from impeding the Town Improvement or Town Planning Scheme framed in public interest. It is because of this difference that the ground specified in cl. (hhh) is not subject to the conditions and restrictions in s. 13(3A) and ss. 17A, 17B and 17C of the 1947-Act. [624 H] (c) The statement of the Sub-Engineer that the Corpora- tion would not expedite demolition without making alterna- tive accommodation on which the appellant relied was made as far back as 1962, and had no relevance for the purposes of the present case. [625 C] 6(a) Though the State Government had suspended certain regulations of the principal scheme, this suspension had not the same effect as withdrawal or abandonment of the scheme, which had not been done. Moreover, there had 12--502 SCI/77 606 not been a total suspension of all the regulations. Regula- tions 36 and 38 which are material for the purposes of this case were allowed to continue. [625 D-E] (b) The proposal for variation of the principal scheme having not materialised, it was not known what shape it would assume. Until it was actually carried into effect, the variation had no legal consequence. [625 F] H.L. Mehra v. Union of India [1975] 1 SCR 138, 149 referred to.
 
 7. There was nothing to show that it was the local ,authority and not the landlord who had the power to evict a tenant on the ground specified in s. 13(1) (hhh) of the 1947-Act. Under s. 507 of the 1888-Act, the landlord could get an order against a tenant to allow him (the landlord) reasonable facilities to enter the leased premises in order to enable him to comply with the notice issued by the Municipal Commissioner.
