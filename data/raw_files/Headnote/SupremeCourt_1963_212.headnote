 The respondents were assessed to sales tax under the provisions of the Orissa Sales Tax Act, 1947, by the Sales Tax Officer, who rejected their claim to certain deductions from their taxable turnover, but, on appeal, the Assistant Collector allowed the claim. The Collector of Sales Tax, however, acting under s. 23(3) of the Act revised the orders of the Assistant Collector by raising the taxable turnover allowed by him to be deducted. The respondents moved the High Court of Orissa under Art. 226 of the Constitution of India to quash the orders of the Collector on the ground that they were illegal under the Act as they had been made more than thirty six months after the expiry of the quarters in respect of which the assessments had originally been made. The High Court took the view that the orders in revision were really reassessments under sub-s. (7) of s. 12 of the Act of turnover which had escaped assessment or been under assessed and as such they were barred by limitation.
 254 Held:(i) The view taken by the High Court that the impugned orders were really reassessments under s. 12(7) of the Orissa Sales Tax Act, 1947, was erroneous.
 (ii) (per Das Gupta and Rajagopala Ayyangar, JJ., Sarkar, J. dissenting). Orders of assessment made by the revising authority must be considered to be orders passed under s. 12 as well as under s. 23 of the Act and, therefore, the period of limitation prescribed in the second proviso to s. 12 (6) became applicable.
 Gajo Ram v. State of Bihar, (1955) 7 S.T.C. 248, disapproved.
 per Sarkar, J.-(i) The time-limit of thirty-six months pres- cribed in s. 12(7) was only for calling for a return and not for making the order of reassessment in respect of escaped or under assessed turnover.
 (ii)An order made in revision under s. 23(3) was not an order of assessment and the period of limitation in the second proviso to s. 12(6) was not applicable.
