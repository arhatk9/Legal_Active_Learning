 The University of Mysore, Appellant no. 1, advertised inviting applications for 6 posts of Professors and 6 posts of Rcaders. Among them were included the post of a Professor of English and of a Reader in English. Candidates for the post of Reader were required to possess (a) a first or high second class Master's Degree of an Indian University in the subject; (b) a Research Degree of Doctorate standard or published work of a high standard and (c) experience of teaching post-graduate classes for 10 years in case of Professors and 5 years in case of Readers. Anniah Gowda, appellant no. 2, was selected by a Board of Appointment which was constituted to examine the fitness of the several applicants and he was appointed a Reader in English in the Central College, 'Bangalore.
 576 C. D. Govinda Rao, respondent, filed an application in the Mysore High Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution in which he prayed that a writ of quo warranto be issued calling upon appellant no. 2 to show cause under what authority he was holding the post of a Reader in English.
 He also prayed for a writ of mandamus or other appropriate writ or direction calling upon appellant no. 1 to appoint him Reader. His contention was that the appointment of Anniah Gowda was illegal in the face of the prescribed qualifications.
 The High Court set aside the appointment of Anniah Gowda on the ground that he did not satisfy the first qualification which required "that he must possess either a first or a high second class Master's degree of an Indian University" as he had secured just 50.2 per cent marks while the minimum required for a second class was 50 per cent. As regards the second and third qualifications, the High Court did not make a finding against Anniah Gowda. The appellants came to this Court by special leave.
 Held : (i) The decision of the High Court was incorrect in as much as the High Court did not take into consideration the Degree of Master of Arts of the Durham University obtained by Anniah Gowda. It is true that Anniah Gowda did not possess a high second class degree of an Indian University but he did possess the alternative qualification of Master of Arts of a foreign University. The High Court was in error in issuing a writ of quo waranto quashing the appointment of appellant no. 2.
 (ii) Boards of appointments are nominated by the Universities and when,recommendations made by them and the appointments following on them are challenged before the courts, normally, the courts should be slow to interfere with the opinions expressed by the experts unless there are allegations of malafides against them. Normally, it is wise and safe for the courts to leave the decision of academic matters to experts who are more familiar with the problems they face than the courts generally can be. What the High Court should have considered in this case was whether the appointment made by the Chancellor had contravened any statutory or binding rule or ordinance and while doing so, the High Court should have shown due regard to the opinion expressed by the Board of experts and its recommendations on which the Chancellor had acted. The High -Court should not have thought that the Board was acting like a quasi judicial tribunal, deciding disputes referred to it for decision. It should not have applied tests which are applicable in the case of writ of certian;
 The writ of quo warranto gives the judiciary a weapon to control the executive from making appointments to public office against law and to protect a citizen from being deprived of public office to which he has a right. These proceedings also tend to protect the public from usurpers of public office who might be 577 allowed to continue either with the connivance of the executive or by the reason of its apathy. Before a person can effectively claim a writ of quo warranto, he has to satisfy the court that the office in question is a public office and is held by a usurper without legal authority.
