 The appellant companies were engaged in mining activities and for this purpose put to use a variety of machinery including Dumpers and Rockers, within their leasehold areas. The appellants were asked by the State Government to register the said machines as vehicles under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 and to pay tax under section 6 of the Bihar and Orissa Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1930, as also under the Madras Vehicles (Taxation) Act, 1931. In section 2(c) of the Taxation Act and in the charging section 6, the definition of `Motor Vehicle' referred to the definition of `Motor Vehicle' under the Motor Vehicles Act.
 In Bolani Ores Ltd. Etc. v. State of Orissa, [1974] INSC 186; [1975] 2 SCR 138, this Court held that the definition of `Motor Vehicle' as existing prior to the 1956 amendment would be applicable as that was the one which stood incorporated in the Taxation Act. With this, the Dumpers and Rockers went out of the tax net though they were registrable under the Act, and the Tractairs were neither registrable under the Motor Vehicles Act nor taxable under the Taxation Act.
 Anticipating a spate of refund applications as a result of the abovesaid decision, the Government of the respondent State promulgated the Orrissa Motor Vehicles Taxations Laws (amendment) Ordinance, 1975. The purpose of the Ordinance was not only to kill the demand for refund of tax but also to keep exigible tax under the Taxation Act, with retrospective effect.
 983 The claims of refund got wiped out by the Ordinance.
 Fresh demands of tax were made from the appellants and claims for refund of tax involved in the earlier litigation were rejected. Appellants moved the High Court challenging the Ordinance and the consequent action. Meanwhile the Orissa Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1975 was passed replacing the Ordinance. the challenge to the 1975 Act and the retrospectivity thereof was turned down by the High Court. Aggrieved against the High Court's judgment, the appellants have preferred the present appeals by special leave.
 On behalf of the the appellants, it was contended that the Dumpers and Rockers were vehicles not adapted for use upon roads and therefore outside the scope of section 2(b) of the 1975 Act and hence not within the ambit of the charging section.
 Dismissing the appeals, this court, 
 HELD : 1. The High Court was right in concluding that Dumpers and Rockers are vehicles adapted or suitable for use on roads and being motor vehicles per se, as held in Bolani Ores case, were liable to taxation on the footing of their use or kept for use on public roads; the network of which, the State spreads, maintains it and keeps available for use of motor vehicles and hence entitled to a regulatory and compensatory tax. [991 A, B] 
 2. On the basis of materials available on record, it is seen that Dumpers in some States are granted permission to run on public roads at a speed not exceeding 16 kms. per hour and on bridges and culverts at a speed not exceeding 8 kms. per hour. Thus they have a minimum weight and safe laden weight fixed on some principles. Pictures of various types of Dumpers also indicate prominently one factor that these Dumpers run on tyres, in marked contrast to chain plates like cater pillers or military tanks. By the use of rubber tyres it is evident that they have been adapted for use on roads, which means they are suitable for being used on public roads. The mere fact that they are required at places to run at a particular speed is not to detract from the position otherwise clear that they are adapted for use on roads. They very nature of these vehicles make it clear that they are not manufactured or adapted for use only in factories or enclosed premises. The mere fact that the Dumpers or Rockers are heavy and cannot move on the roads without damaging them is not to say that they are not suitable for use on roads. The word `adapted' in the provision 984 was read as `suitable' in Bolani Ores case by interpretation on the strength of the language in Entry 57, List II of the Constitution. Thus it cannot be said that Dumpers and Rockers were neither adaptable nor suitable for use on public roads. [990 D-H] Bolani Ores Ltd. etc. v. State of Orissa etc.[1974] INSC 186; , [1975] 2 SCR 138, referred to.
