 The appellant filed a petition under Art. 226 of. the Constitution against the refusal of the Defence Ministry to `execute a lease under r. 27 of the Cantonment Land Administration Rules, 1937 in respect of a bungalow situated in a cantonment area, on occupancy land held on 'old grants lease'. The single Judge directed the respondents to execute the lease but the Division Bench held that the power to grant a lease under r. 27 was discretionary. The Division Bench therefore set aside the orders of the single Judge and issued orders to the respondents to reconsider the request of the appellants for grant of lease under r. 27 and Sch. VII of the Rules in accordance with law.. With certificate the present appeal was filed in this Court. The only question for consideration was whether the appellants were entitled to a direction against the respondents to issue a lease to them under r. 27 and Sch. VIl of the 1937 Rules.
 
HELD:Rule 27 only confers a power in general on the Military Estates Officer to grant leases and, by using the word 'may', it clearly gives, him discretion to grant leases in suitable cases. There is the further circumstance that the exercise of the power by the Military Estate Officer has been made subject to the approval of the Central Government or such other authority as the Central Government may appoint for that purpose. The power of the Military Estates Officer being subject to such discretionary approval or disapproval of another authority cannot possibly be held to be required to be exercised in all cases without any discretion. [234G235A] In the present case therefore the High Court in directing a reconsideration of the case in accordance with law was quite correct, so that the application of the appellants must be decided afresh after keeping in view the principle that the power to grant a lease under r. 27 is discretionary, but the refusal should only be in suitable cases where sufficient reasons exist for the purpose.
