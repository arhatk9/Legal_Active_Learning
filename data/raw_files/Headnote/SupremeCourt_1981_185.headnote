 Respondent R.G. Ashtekar (since dead) filed a regular suit No. 215 of 1959 for the recovery of his dues from Kamla Pictures, Kolhapur of which Bapusaheb Narayanrao Mohite (since dead) was the sole proprietor. On an application for an order of attachment before judgment under order 38 Rule S of the C.P.C. a garnishee order was issued to the appellant Apte, the mortgagee of The properties. As per the directions of the court passed on his objection he exercised his right under section 176 of the Contract Act and sold the property attached to one Madhusudan Vasudeo Bavdekar, after due notice to plaintiff Ashtekar and also after a public notice.
 The suit was decreed for Rs. 9,000 in favour of the plaintiff, who filed an application for execution and in the said proceedings Bavdekar, the purchaser, was impleaded so as to seek recovery of the properties in his hands by sale, The application was dismissed holding that the property was pledged with Apte, who validly sold it to Bavdekar and that the attachment before judgment itself was invalid. A second appeal before the High Court was rejected by the Chief Justice of Maharashtra but he granted leave to appeal under letters patent. The High Court reversed the concurrent findings of fact recorded by courts below and in view of the fact that Apte sold the property for Rs. 46,000 as against Rs. 35,000 due to him, the executing court was directed to ask Apte to deposit the excess amount of Rs. 11,000 in the executing court in the 1st instance and in case the entire amount of the decree holder was not satisfied then the executing court would call upon the heirs of Bavdekar to doposit in court the remaing amount due to Decree holder or to produce the property attached within the time allowed by the Court in the event of this failure, - the execution court shall order execution against them. Hence the appeal by appellant after obtaining special leave.
 Allowing the appeal, the Court ^ 
 HELD: 1:1. The question of drawing an adverse inference against a party for his failure to appear in court would arise only when there is no evidence on the record. Absence of Apte and Bavdekar from the court would matter only when there was no evidence on the record on the point in issue.
 [1026 G-H, 1025A] 1021 1:2 On the findings of fact recorded by the two courts below, which are final and which could not be normally set aside by the second Appellate Court, the decree-holder cannot compel Apte or Bavdekar to produce the property as before the Court or the proceeds of the sale of the property as the amount due to Apte from judgment-debtor has not still been satisfied. [1026 G-H, 1027A] The statement of the judgment-debtor, the admission of the decree-holder in cross-examination also the averments in the agreement make the position clear. [1026 A]
