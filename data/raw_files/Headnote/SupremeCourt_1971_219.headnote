 The appellant Zila Parishad sought to impose circumstances and property tax on the respondent whose factories for manufacturing sugar were situated outside the area of appellant's jurisdiction but who regularly made purchases of sugar cane in the said area. On the question whether such purchases amounted to carrying on business in the area within the meaning. of s. 121 of the U.P. Kshettra Samitis and the Zila Parishads Adhiniyam, 1961.
 
HELD : The buying of raw material in the shape of sugarcane may be a process or activity of a continuous character but it cannot be said that the respondent company was making any separate profits or income by means of purchasing sugarcane.
 Nor was the sugarcane so purchased subjected to any process resulting in a product which by itself could earn profits.
 If a manufacturing concern continuously acquires raw material not only from different parts of India but also from other parts of the world it cannot be said that it was carrying on business in all those places from where the raw materials were acquired or purchased. Such a wide connotation cannot be given to the words 'carrying on business" in s.121 (a) of the Adhiniyam [426 H-427 F] Chas J. Webb Sons & Co. Inc. Philadelphia v. Commissioner of Income-tax, East Punjab, 18 I.T.R. 33, Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay v. Ahmedebhai Umarbhai & Co. Bombay, [1950] INSC 8; [1950] S.C.R. 335 and Zila Parishad. Muzaffarnagar & Anr.
 v. Jugal Kishore Ram Swarup & Anr., (1969) All. L.J. 24, referred to.
