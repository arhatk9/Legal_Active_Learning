 The Beas Project, which was commenced in 1960, was a joint venture of the composite State of Punjab and the State of Rajasthan. All decisions on policy and administrative matters relating to the project were entrusted to a Board known as the Beas Control Board, which was constituted by the Central Government in consultation with the State Governments concerned. For the purpose of construction and completion of the Project Engineers and a large number of other categories of employees were taken on deputation from the States of Punjab and Rajasthan and some others were directly recruited by the Beas Control Board.
 In the meantime in the year 1966, the State of Punjab was reorganized and the new States of Haryana and the Union Territory of Chandigarh came into being and a part of the Punjab Territory was transferred to the then Union Territory of Himachal Pradesh. The Punjab Reorganization Act, 1966 contains a chapter on Bhakra Nangal and Beas Projects. After 1966, the Project became the concern of the State of Rajasthan and the successor States of Punjab, Haryana and the then Union Territory Himachal Pradesh.
 The Bhakra Management Board constituted by the Central Government under s. 79(1) of the Act for the administration, maintenance and operation of works specified in clauses (a) to (g) of that sub-section was empowered to employ the necessary staff for the efficient discharge of its functions. The proviso to s.79(4) of the Act states that every person who immediately before the constitution of the said Board was engaged in the construction, maintenance or operation of the works shall continue to be so employed under the Board in connection with the said works on the same terms and conditions of service as were applicable to him before such constitution until the Central Government by order directs otherwise. The Bhakra Management Board was placed under the control of the Central Government. By virtue of s.80(1), construction of the Beas Project was to be undertaken by the Central Government on behalf 421 of the successor States and the State of Rajasthan. Section 80(2) of the Act empowers the Central Government to constitute the Beas Construction Board and the Board was empowered to appoint such staff as may be necessary for the efficient discharge of its functions. The first proviso to s. 80(3) is in similar terms to the proviso to s. 79(4). By sub-s. (5) any component of the Beas Project in relation to which the construction has been completed after November 1, 1966, may be transferred by the Central Government to the Bhakra Management Board constituted under s. 79 and thereupon the provisions of s. 79 become applicable as if works transferred to the Bhakra Management Board were included in s.79(1). Sub-section (6) of Section 80 provides that the Bhakhra Management Board shall be re-named as the Bhakra Beas Management Board, when any of the components of the Beas Project has been transferred and that the Beas Construction Board shall cease to exist when all the components of the Beas Project have been so transferred.
 The Petitioners who were officers and staff of various categories and whose services were sought to be terminated by way of retrenchment on the completion of the Project work contended (1) that they were employees of the Central Government, (2) that their conditions of service were governed by rules which apply to its temporary employees and (3) that the orders of retrenchment passed against them while retaining the deputationists in service were violative of Arts. 14 and 16 of the Constitution.

 HELD : 1. (a) Though the petitioners were appointed under the orders issued by or on behalf of the Beas Control Board of the Beas Construction Board, they were employees of the Central Government. Such of them as were appointed by the Beas Control Board became the employees of the Beas Construction Board by virtue of the first proviso to s.
 80(3). It was by and on behalf of the Beas Control Board that some of the petitioners were appointed prior to the re- organization of the composite State of Punjab on November, 1966. The Beas Control Board ceased to exist and its place was taken by the Beas Construction Board constituted on October 1, 1967. Therefore by reason of the first proviso to s.80(3) the petitioners became the employees or were employed by the Beas Construction Board. [431-E-F,G, 432A] (b) By virtue of s. 80(1) the Beas Project was to be undertaken by the Central Government on behalf of the successor States and the State of Rajasthan. But the direct and immediate responsibility to construct and complete the works of the Beas Project was imposed by the statute on the Central Government and not on the successor States and the State of Rajasthan. The concerned States were only under an obligation to provide necessary funds to the Central Government and that Government is empowered to constitute the Beas Construction Board and assign to that Board such functions as it may consider necessary. Though the appointments of the petitioners might have been made in the name of or on behalf of the Beas Construction Board they were truly and in substance made for the benefit and at the behest of the Central Government. The staff appointed for discharging the functions of the Board was appointed in order to enable the Central Government to discharge its responsibility under s. 80(1). The petitioners are, therefore, employees of the Central Government. [432B, D, E, H, 433A] 
 2. The contention of the petitioners that they were quasi-permanent employees in terms of the Central Civil Services (Temporary Service) Rules, 1965 has no force. Under r. 3 a Government servant is deemed to be in quasi-permanent service if (i) he has been in continuous service for more than three 422 years and (ii) the appointing authority being satisfied, having regard to the quality of his work, conduct and character as to his suitability for employment in quasi- permanent capacity under the Government of India has made a declaration to that effect. Although the petitioners have been in continues temporary service for more than three years, it is for the appointing authority to decide whether they fulfil the second condition or not. No Government servant can claim entitlement to a declaration that he was in quasi-permanent service because the question of declaring him to be quasi-permanent does not depend merely on the fact of his being in service for a particular number of years.
 [433C-E] 
 3. The plea of the petitioners that they should be retained in service for the purposes of the Beas Project even after the transfer of the completed works of that Project to the Bhakra Management Board is without force. The petitioners were holding their employment either under the Beas Control Board or, after November 1, 1966 under the Beas Construction Board. The first proviso to s.79(4) is designed to protect the services of persons, who, prior to the establishment of the Bhakra Management Board, were engaged in the construction work connected with the Bhakra and Nangal Dams and the power houses linked therewith. The petitioners were working on the Beas Project and were not therefore entitled to the benefit of that proviso. [434A, F- G] 
 4. Though Section 80(5) requires a completed work of the Beas Project to be transferred to the Bhakra Management Board, it does not provide that persons who were employed in connection with such a work should also be transferred as employees of the Bhakra Management Board. In the very nature of things there could be no such provision because if any persons were employed for the Beas Project only their employment would normally cease on the completion of that Project. In fact, the petitioners were taken in employment on temporary posts for the purpose of completing the Beas Project. On the completion of that Project or any other works for which they were employed, their employment would normally come to an end, especially since the statute from which their rights are said to flow does not protect that employment. [435A-C] 
 5. The first proviso to s.79(4) speaks of persons who immediately before the constitution of the Bhakra Management Board were engaged in the works mentioned in s.79(1). The scheme of s. 80 shows that the Bhakra Beas Management Board was never constituted as such. The only effect which the statute brings about by s. 80(6) is the renaming of the Bhakra Management Board as the Bhakra Beas Management Board.
 The words "constitution of the said Board" cannot be substituted by the words "the re-naming of the said Board".
 The contemplation of s. 79(4) is that only a certain class of employees should receive protection in the matter of continued employment. The petitioners do not fall within that class since they were not employees of the Bhakra Management Board immediately before October. 1, 1967 when that Board was constituted. [435E-G] 
 6. There is no substance in the grievance of the petitioners that the proposed orders of retrenchment involved violation of the guarantee of equality in the matter of employment. The petitioners and the deputationists were not equals the petitioners were appointed on a purely temporary basis and their appointments were governed by the rules applicable to temporary establishment. While accepting the offers of appointment they subscribed to a declaration that they had understood and accepted the conditions of their employment. They 423 are being retrenched in accordance with the conditions of appointment and on completion of the Project for which they were appointed. The deputationsts on the other hand belonged to the services of the respective States. The concerned State Governments were responsible to provide the necessary funds to meet all the expenses of the Bhakra Management Board. Since the very basis of their claim to be treated equally with the deputationists is fallacious their claim must fail. [436C-E, 437A, B, 438C] 
 7. (a) From the very beginning of their employment the work-charged employees were engaged for execution of specified work. They are industrial workers entitled to the benefits of the provision of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. Their services automatically came to an end on the completion of the works. [439D, E] (b) Out of 36,000 work-charged employees, 26,000 had accepted retrenchment compensation in the conciliation proceedings. By reason of s. 18(3) (d) of the Industrial Disputes Act a settlement arrived at in the course of conciliation proceedings is binding on all persons who were employed in the establishment to which the dispute relates, whether they were employed on the date of the dispute or subsequently. The settlement arrived at would bind the work charged employees. [440B, C-D, E]
