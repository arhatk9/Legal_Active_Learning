 A notice under s.10(2) of the U.P. Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings Act, 1960, as amended by the U.P.
 Act No. 20 of 1976, was issued to the appellant; and his objections thereto were dismissed by the Prescribed Authority. Thereupon two appeals were filed before the appellate authority-one by the appellant and another by his wife claiming herself to be the judicially separated wife.
 It was stated that she was living separately and the appellant gave her certain lands for maintenance in respect of which she obtained a decree of injunction restraining the appellant-husband from interfering with her possession; and her ownership with respect thereto was recognised in consolidation proceeding as well as in the earlier ceiling proceedings.
 Both the appeals were dismissed by the appellate authority and the writ petitions thereupon filed by the appellants were also dismissed by the High Court.
 266 In appeal to this Court it was contended by the appellants that (1) the lands of the wife, who was living separately, could not be clubbed with the lands of the husband even though a judicial separation may not have taken place; and (2) the notice issued under s.10(2) was illegal and without jurisdiction inasmuch as ceiling area in respect of the appellants had been determined before coming into force of Amendment Act No. 20 of 1976 and the order passed in the earlier ceiling proceedings would operate as res judicata.
 Dismissing the appeals, this Court, 
 HELD : 1. In view of the provision of s.5(3) of the U.P. Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings Act, 1960, while determining ceiling area of the land belonging to a person, the land even if owned or possessed by his wife in her own right as a separate tenure-holder is not allowed to be excluded and would have to be included in the land of the husband treating the wife as a member of his family. The only exception has been made in the case of a judicially separated wife. The term 'judicially separated' wife occurring in s.3(7) of the Ceiling Act, 1960 cannot be given a meaning to include a wife merely living separately from her husband but having not obtained a decree for judicial separation, which was necessary under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. After obtaining such a decree alone it could be recognised as judicial separation.

 2.1 The provisions of s.38-A of the U.P. Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings Act, 1960 and s.30(3) of U.P. Act No.20 of 1976 authorise the Prescribed Authority to issue fresh notice under s.10(2), within a period of two years from the date of any order passed in earlier ceiling proceedings requiring the tenure holder to furnish such particulars by an affidavit in respect of the land held by him and members of his family as may be prescribed and considered necessary for enforcement of the provisions of the Ceiling Act. Section 38-B of Ceiling Act, 1960 clearly provides that any finding or decision given before the commencement of these provisions will not operate as a bar for the retrial of such proceeding or issue in accordance with the provisions of the Act as amended from time to time.

 2.2 The High Court was right in holding that if an earlier judgment is said to operate as res-judicata in the subsequent proceedings, then all the necessary facts including pleadings of the earlier litigation, must be 267 placed in the subsequent proceeding; and that the earlier notice under Section 10(2) issued to the tenure-holder along with the statement prepared in Form No.3 were neither placed before the Ceiling authorities in subsequent proceedings nor such material was produced even before the High Court in order to enable it to decide whether the second notice could be said to be illegal.
