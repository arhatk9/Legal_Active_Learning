 In the nomination papers filed by the respondent for contesting legislative assembly elections in May, 1980 from a constituency which was reserved for scheduled castes, she described herself as belonging to the scheduled caste 'Katia'. Several persons raised objection that the respondent, being a Christian by birth, could not be treated as a member of the scheduled caste. The Returning Officer rejected the objection and accepted her nomination papers.
 The respondent won the election defeating the appellant. The appellant having unsuccessfully challenged the election of the respondent in the High Court, alleged in this appeal that the respondent after being born a Christian was baptised according to Christian rites; her mother's name was Elizabeth; her marriage with Jai Prakash Shalwar, who belonged to Katia caste, was not valid and even on marriage her caste could not revive because caste was determined not by marriage but by birth. The respondent stated that she was never a Christian nor was she born a Christian. She also averred that even her father or mother were not Christians.
 On the other hand, she always remained a member of the Katia caste and was accepted as such by the members of that community because her marriage with Jai Prakash Shalwar was performed according to Hindu rites of Aryasamaj sect and was attended by a number of members of her caste and due publicity was given to the marriage.
 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: It cannot be said that at the time when the respondent filed her nomination papers, she was not a member of the Katia caste. [199 G] A caste to which a Hindu belongs is essentially determined by birth and if a Hindu is converted to Christianity or any other religion which does not recognise 177 caste, the conversion amounts to a loss of the said caste.
 In considering whether on conversion the loss of the caste is absolute, irrevocable so as not to revive under any circumstance the guiding principles are: (a) Where a person belonging to a scheduled caste in converted to Christianity or Islam, the same involves loss of the caste unless the religion to which he is converted is liberal enough to permit the convertee to retain his caste or the family laws by which he was originally governed. There are a number of cases where members belonging to a particular caste having been converted to Christianity or even to Islam retained their caste or family laws and despite the new order they were permitted to be governed by their old laws. But this can happen only if the new religion is liberal and tolerant enough to permit such a course of action, and (b) In all other cases, conversion to Christianity or Islam or any other religion which does not accept the caste system and insists on relinquishing the caste, there is a loss of caste on conversion. [190C-F; 191 B] The norms and conditions under which a caste could revive on reconversion to the old religion as laid down by the authorities of the High Courts and this Court are: (1) where the convertee exhibits by his actions and behaviour his clear intention of abjuring the new religion on his own volition without any persuasion and is not motivated by any benefit or gain, (2) where the community of the old order to which the convertee originally belonged is gracious enough to admit him to the original caste either expressly or by necessary intendment, and (3) Rules of the new Order in permitting the convertee to join the new caste. Unless the aforesaid conditions are fulfilled the loss of caste on conversion is complete and cannot he revived. But having regard to the present set-up and the circumstances prevailing in our modern society, it will be difficult to insist on the second condition, viz., the insistence on the members of the community of the caste to admit the convertee on reconversion to the original caste because such a course of action may lead to dangerous consequence and ill- concieved exploitation.

 The main test for determining the revival of the original caste on reconversion should be a genuine intention of the reconvert to abjure his new religion and completely dissociate himself from it. It may be added here that this does not mean that the reconversion should be only a ruse or a pretext or a cover to gain mundane worldly benefits so that the reconversion becomes merely a show for achieving a particular purpose whereas the real intention may be shrouded in mystery. The reconvert must exhibit a clear and genuine intention to go back to his old fold and adopt the customs and practices of the said fold without any protest from members of his erstwhile caste.[192C-E] Ganpat v. Returning Officer & Ors., [1975] 2 S.C.R.

 178 When a child is born neither has he an religion nor is he capable of choosing one until he reaches the age of discretion and acquires proper understanding of the situation. Hence, the mere fact that the parents of a child, who were Christians, would in ordinary course get the usual baptism certificate and perform other ceremonies without the child knowing what is being done but after the child has grown up and becomes fully mature and able to decide his future, he ought not to be bound by what his parents may have done. Therefore, in such cases, it is the intention of the convertee which would determine the revival of the caste. If by his clear and conclusive conduct the person reconverts to his old faith and abjures the new religion in unequivocal terms his caste automatically revives. [192 G-H;
 193 A] Another dominant factor to determine the revival of the caste of a convert from Christianity to his old religion would be that in cases of election to the State Assemblies or the Parliament where under the Presidential Order a particular constituency is reserved for a member of the scheduled caste or tribe and the electorate given a majority verdict in his favour, then this would be doubtless proof positive of the fact that his community has accepted him back to his old fold and this would result in a revival of the original caste to which the said candidate belonged.
 [193 B-C] When a person is converted to Christianity or some other religion the original caste remains under eclipse and as soon as during his/her life-time the person is reconverted to the original religion the eclipse disappears and the caste automatically revives. [193 D] Whether or not the revival of the caste depends on the will and discretion of the members of the community of the caste is a question on which we refrain from giving any opinion because in the instant case there is overwhelming evidence to show that the respondent was accepted by the community of her original Katia caste. Even so, if the fact of the acceptance by the members of the community is made condition precedent to the revival of the caste, it would lead to grave consequences and unnecessary exploitation, sometimes motivated by political considerations. Of course, if apart from the oral views of the community there is any recognised documentary proof of a custom or code of conduct or rule of law binding on a particular caste, it may be necessary to insist on the consent of the members of the community otherwise in normal circumstances the caste would revive by applying the principles of doctrine of eclipse. It may be added that where it appears that the person reconverted to the old religion had been converted to Christianity since several generations, it may be difficult to apply the doctrine of eclipse to the revival of caste.
 [193 D-G] In the instant case, on a full and complete appraisal of the oral and documentary evidence, the following conclusions are inevitable: (1) that the respondent was born of Christian parents and was educated in various schools or institutions where she was known as a Christian; (2) that 3- 4 years before the election, the respondent was reconverted to Hinduism voluntarily and married Jai Prakash Shalwar, a member of the Katia caste, and also performed the shudhikaran ceremony; (3) that she was not only accepted but also welcomed by the important members, including the President and Vice-President, of the community; (4) there is no evidence to show that there was any bar under the Christian religion which could have prevented her from reconverting herself to Hinduism; and (5) that 179 there was no evidence to show that even her parents had been Christians from generation to generation. In these circumstances, therefore, this case fulfils the conditions required for being reconverted to Hinduism from Christianity in order to revive the original caste [198 G-H; 199 A-D]
