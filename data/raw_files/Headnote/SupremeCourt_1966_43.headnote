 B and his sons constituted a Hindu undivided family which Owned certain shares in public limited comanies.The family started business in money lending in the name of a firm and in the books of account of the firm the shared which stood registered in the name of B with the companies were credited as the capital of the business. Two sons separated from the family, each receiving sum in lieu of his share, and they formed a partnership with the rest of the members of the family for carrying business in the name of the same firm.
 Under the partnership the two separated sons were entitled to their sham and the remaining shares were to belong to B as Karta of the family. Dividends received in respect of the shares were credited to the profit and loss account of the firm. In assessment proceedings, it was claimed that.
 the shares which stood registered in the name of B belonged not to the Hindu undivided family but to the firm. The claim was rejected. In appeal to this Court it was contended that where one taxable entity is the registered holder of shares in a company and the real owner, of the shares is another taxable entity, the registered shareholder alone' is liable to be assessed to tax in respect of the dividend from these shares and therefore B alone was liable to be taxed in respect of the dividend income from the shares, and not the Hindu undivided family.
 HELD: The contention must fail.
 Tax being charged by a. 3 of the income-tax Act upon dividend come and not being excluded under s. 4(3), such income would be, chargeable to income-tax under the Act in the hands of the person to whom it accrues or by whom it is received. A company for its purposes does not recognize any trust or equitable ownership in shares; it merely recognizes the registered shareholder as the owner and pays the dividend to that shareholder. But the shares may, because of a trust or other fiduciary relationship, belong to a person other than the registered share holder and the dividend distributed by the company would for the se of tax be deemed to accrue or arise to the real owner of the shares. [576 A-C] Section (2) of a. 16 does not operate as an exemption from the vale of either a. 3 or 94(1) of the Act nor does it provide that liability to tat arises only when the person by whom dividend is received from the company is the real owner of the shares. Sub-section (5) of S. 18 also does not lead to that result. In so far as it deals with dividend which is "grossed up", sub-s. (5) of s. 18 forms a corollary to s.
 16(2). Therefore when tax is paid on behalf of a shareholder and deduction Is de from dividend, it is given to the shareholder for the tax paid in his final assessment.
 But the scheme of "grossing up" is not ac- ceptible of the interpretation that the income from dividend is to be regarded as the income only of the registered shareholder and not of the real owner of the share.
