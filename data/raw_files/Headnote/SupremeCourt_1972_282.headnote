 In appeal by the State of Tamil Nadu against the judgment of the Madras High Court on the questions (i) whether the producers who supplied the Cement to the Slate Trading Corporation or its agent in gunny bags in pursuance of the directions given by the Government ire liable to pay sales- tax on the turnover relating to the price of the gunny bags, and (ii) whether the words 'charges for packing and delivery and other such like services' in r. 6(f)(ii) of the rules under the Madras General Sales Tax 1959 as it stood upto September 1963 had the effect of' granting exemption in respect of price of packing materials.
 
HELD : (i) From the relevant control orders it was clear that the Government of India was purporting to fix the piece. of the gunny bags in which the producers were required to supply cement to the State Trading Corporation.
 When the price was wholly controlled the supply of the guilty bags could not be considered is 'sales'. This position was concluded by the decisions of this Court in New India Sugar Ltd. and Cheyenne Mal Narain Das. Accordingly the price of gunny bases could not be included ,in the taxable turnover. [1021 C] New India Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Commissioner of Sales Tax, Bihar 1 4, S.T.C. 316; and Chittar Mal Narain Dass v.
 Commissioner of Sales Tax. U.P. 26, S.T.C. 344; applied.
 (ii) The charges for packing exempted under Rule 6(f) as it stood up to September 1963 included both the price of the packing material as well as the labour charges relating to the packing. The words aid other such like services' in sub-cl. (ii) of the rule referred to the word 'delivery' ,immediately preceding those words. The subsequent charges effected in the rule merely clarified the intention of the rule making authority. Therefore the contention of the appellant that the rule as it stood till September 1963, merely provided for exemption of service charges for packing and not the cost of the packing material must be rejected.
 [1023 F] State of Madras and Ors. v. Damodaran Chettiar & Co. 18, S.T.C. 451 disapproved.
 State of Madras, In re : 7, S.T.C. 355, approved and applied.
