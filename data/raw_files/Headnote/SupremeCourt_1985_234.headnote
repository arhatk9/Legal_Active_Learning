 The appellants in the appeals were holders of stage carriage permits over certain intra-state routes as well as inter-state routes. Parts of the routes on which they were plying their stage carriages were notified under Chapter IVA of the Motor Vehicles Act 1939. They contended that they may be permitted to ply their stage carriages over the entire route by imposing "corridor restrictions i.e. not picking up or setting down any passengers at any point on the nationalised part of the routes".
 In the appeals to this court the question was: where a route is nationalised under Chapter IVA of the Motor Vehicles Act 1939 whether a private operator with a permit to ply a stage carriage over another route but which has a common over-lapping sector with the nationalised route can ply his vehicle over that part of the over-lapping common sector if he does not pick up or set down passengers on the over-lapping part of the route.
 On behalf of the appellants, it was contended that a route" according to the definition in Section 2(28A) of the Motor Vehicles Act 1939 meant a line drawn between two terminii and if the portion of it had been nationalised, it would have no effect whatsoever on the permits to ply state carriages on the 662 route, and that the complete exclusion of private operators from the common sector would be violative of article 14 and also ultra vires section 68-D of the Act- It was further contended that the provisions of Chapter IV and Chapter IVA of the Act must be construed in such a manner as to allow permit holders to ply their stage carriages notwithstanding that parts of their route are also parts of notified routes.
 Dismissing the appeals and special leave petitions, ^ 
 HELD :1(a) None of the schemes contains any saving clause in favour of operators plying or wanting to ply stage carriages on common sectors. However, there is invariably a clause in the scheme to the effect that no person other than the State Government Undertaking will be permitted to provide road transport service on the route specified in the scheme. In view of this provision in the scheme there is a total prohibition of private operators from plying stage carriages on the whole or part of the notified routes. The appellants cannot therefore contend that they can ply their vehicles on the notified routes. [678 G-679 A] (b) When preparing and publishing the scheme under section 68-C and approving or modifying the scheme under section 68-D care must be taken to protect, as far as possible, the interest of the travelling public who could in the past travel from one point to another without having to change from one service to another enroute. This can always be done by appropriate clauses exempting operators already having permits over the common sector from the scheme to enable them to ply their vehicles over common sectors without picking up or setting down passengers on the common sectors. If such a course is not feasible the State Legislature may intervene and provide some other alternative. [667 F-H] 
 2. The right of the members of the public to pass and re-pass over a highway including the right to use motor vehicles on the public road existed prior to the enactment of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 and was not its creation.
 The State could control and regulate the right for the purpose of ensuring the safety, peace and good health of the public. As an incident of this right of passage over a highway, a member of the public was entitled to ply motor vehicles for pleasure or pastime or for the purpose of trade and business subject to permissible control and regulation by the State.

 3. Chapter IVA of the Motor Vehicles Act 1939 was bodily introduced by Amending Act No. 100 of 1956 to provide for the nationalisation of road transport services. Section 68-B gives over-riding effect to the provisions of Chapter IVA and the rules and orders made thereunder over the provisions of Chapter IV ant any other law for the time being in force. [667 E; 668 B] 
 4. While the provisions of Chapter IVA are devised to over-ride the provisions of Chapter IV and it is expressly so enacted, the provisions of Chapter IVA are clear and complete regarding the manner and the effect of the take over of the operation of a road transport service by tho State Transport Undertaking in relation to any area or road or operation thereof. The initial requirement of the initiation of a scheme is that the State Transport Authority must think it necessary in the public interest to provide sufficient, adequate, economical and properly Coordinated State Transport Service in relation to any area or route or portion thereof to the exclusion, complete or partial or other persons or otherwise. Even at thus stage, the State Transport Undertaking is required to apply its mind to the question of complete or partial exclusion of other persons or otherwise for operating transport services. Thereafter objection to the scheme are to be heard. All existing operators providing transport facilities along or near the area or the route proposed to be covered by the scheme are to be heard. Any operator who is likely to be affected by total or partial exclusion can thus, object to the scheme and suggest such modifications as may protect him. A hearing is required to be given and the hearing is no empty formality. Even thereafter, the State Transport Undertaking as well as the State Government are empowered to cancel or modify the scheme under section 68E. Therefore, if in the actual working of the approved scheme any difficulty or hardship is experienced by the public or by other operators such difficulty may be removed and hardship relieved by appropriate action under section 68E. Both section 68F and the proviso to section 68FF provide for the issue of temporary permits to private operators if the State Transport Undertaking has not applied for a permit temporary or otherwise in respect of a scheme published or approved. At every stage, abundant provision is thus, made to protect the public interest as also the interest of private operators by providing for consideration and re- consideration of any problems that may arise out of a proposed, published or approved scheme. It is in this context that section 68-C and 68 HH must be construed. [671C - 672B] 664 
 5. A careful and diligent perusal of sections 68-C, 68- D(3) and 68-FF in the light of the definition of the expression "route" in section 2(28A) appears to make it manifestly clear that once a scheme is published under section 68-D in relation to any area or route or portion thereof, whether to the exclusion, complete or partial of other persons or otherwise, no person other than the State Transport Undertaking may operate on the notified area or notified route except as provided in the scheme itself. A necessary consequence of these provisions is that no private operator can operate his vehicles on any part or portion of a notified area or notified route unless authorised 80 to do by the terms of the terms of the scheme itself. He may not operate on any part or portion of the notified route or area on the mere ground that the permit as originally granted to his covered the notified route or area. [672 C-E] 
 6. It is well known that under the guise of the so called "corridor restrictions" permits over longer routes which cover shorter notified routes or "overlapping" parts of notified routes are more often that not mis-utilised since it is need to nigh impossible to keep a proper check at every point of the route. Often times, permits for plying stage carriage from a point a short distance beyond one terminus to a point at a short distance beyond another terminus of a notified route have been applied for and granted subject to the 80 called "corridor restrictions" which are but mere ruses or traps to obtain permits and to frustrate the scheme. If indeed there is any need for protecting the travelling public from inconvenience, the State Transport Undertaking and the government will ha e to make sufficient provision in the scheme itself to avoid inconvenience being caused to the travelling public.
