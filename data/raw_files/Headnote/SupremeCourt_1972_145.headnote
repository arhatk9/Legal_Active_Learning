 The schools run by municipal boards and district boards in the then State of Punjab were taken over by the Punjab Government with effect from October 1, 1957. The teachers then employed in these schools, thus became' State employees. These teachers called provincialised' teachers were to be given the same grades of pay and other allowances as were given to their counterparts in government employment. The teachers in government employment were governed by the Punjab Educational Service Class III School Cadre Rules, 1955. On February 13, 1961, the Punjab government promulgated under article 309 of the Constitution, the Punjab Educational Service (Provincialised Cadre) Class III Rules, giving them retrospective effect from Oct. 1, 1957. By these Rules the provincialised teachers were treated as failing under a Cadre separate and distinct from teachers in the St-ate Cadre governed by the 1955 Rules. The `provincialised' Cadre was to be a diminishing cadre to become extinct in course of time.
 There was to be no further recruitment to that cadre and all vacancies arising in that cadre were to be replenished by direct recruitment to the State cadre. The transfer of such posts to the State cadre was to be done by splitting up such vacant posts into blocks of 7 and 6 by rotation.
 Consequently, the selection grade of 15 in the State cadre progressively increased in strength which was determined by the total cadre strength while the selection grade in the provincialised cadre progressively decreased. Thus those recruited to the State cadre had a progressively larger chance of getting into the selection grade.
 In State of Punjab v. Joginder Singh, [1963] 2 Supp. S.C.R.
 169, this Court upheld the validity of the 1961 Rules against challenge under articles 14 and 16 of. the Constitution. In the view of the majority the two cadres started as independent services, they were never integrated into one service and, therefore, the dissimilarity of the treatment by the Rules was not a denial of equal opportunity. But, the Punjab government never implemented the Rules at any time. On the reorganisation of the erst- while Punjab State into Punjab and Haryana on Nov. 1, 1966, the Haryana government put the 1961 Rules into operation.
 The petitioners, appointed in the Local Bodies Schools before 'provincialisation", challenged the validity of the 1961 Rules. Their complaint was that the Rules created, without any valid justification, two cadres, the 609 State cadre and the provincialised cadre, the former including not only the Government School teachers but also those recruited after October 1, 1957 and posted in the provincialised schools; that by reason of having two cadres and providing for both a uniform 15% for selection grade posts, coupled with making the provincialised cadre a diminishing one, the result has been that teachers deemed to have been appointed to the State cadre with effect from October 1, 1957 and even those recruited thereafter have been.promoted to the Selection grade, while those in the provincialised cadre, though senior in service and performed identical duties and had identical scales of pay, remained in the ordinary grade. According to the petitioners these Rules and their implementation contravened articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. The petitioners contended that the decision of this Court in Joginder Singh's case required reconsideration.
 
HELD: (Per Shelat, Ray, Jaganmohan Reddy, Khanna and Mathew, JJ., Palekar and Beg, JJ. dissenting) dismissing the petition, (i) The majority decision in Joginder Singh's case does not need reconsideration. [638 D] (ii) Ever since 1937, and even before, the two categories of teachers have always remained distinct governed by different sets of Rules, recruited by different authorities and having, otherwise than in the matter of pay scales and qualifications, different conditions of service. This position remained as late as February 13, 1961. On that day whereas the State cadre teachers were governed by the 1955 Rules, rules had yet to be framed for the provincialised teachers. The two cadres thus being separate, government was not bound to bring about an integrated cadre especially in view of its decision making the provincialised cadre a diminishing one and bringing about ultimately through that principle one cadre only in a phased manner. If through historical reasons the teachers had remained in two separate categories, the classification of the provincialised teachers into a separate cadre could not be said to infringe article 14 or article 16. [635 B,E] (iii) It was also not incumbent on the government to make the 1961 Rules uniformly applicable to both the categories of teachers, firstly, because, a rule framing authority need not legislate for all the categories and can select for which category to legislate, and, secondly because, it had already come to a decision of gradually diminishing the provincialised cadre so that ultimately only the state cadre would remain. That was one way of solving the intricate difficulty of inter seniority. [635 E-F] Sakhawat Ali, State of Orissa, [1955] 1 S.C.R. 1004, Madhubhai Amathalal Gandhi v. The Union of India; [1960] INSC 125; [1961] 1 S.C.R. 191 and Vivian Joseph Ferreira v. The Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay, [1972] 1 S.C.R. 70, referred to.
 (iv) The government had the power to make rules with retrospective effect and therefore could provide therein that appointments made between October 1, 1957 and February 13, 1961 shall be treated as appointments in the State cadre. That had to be done for the reason that the provincialised cadre was already frozen even before October 1, 1957, and government had decided not to make fresh appointments in that cadre since that cadre was to be a diminishing one. [635 H] (v) The logic of government decision to make the provincialised cadre a diminishing one was that as the posts in that cadre gradually diminished the number of selection posts also diminished. The proportion of 85 : 15 however.
 remained intact. and teachers in both the cadres according to 610 their seniority continued to obtain their promotional chances. No injustice in this process could justifiably be claimed as when the posts in the provincialised cadre were larger in number, its members got a larger number of selection posts. The block system was devised to implement the process of diminution in a phased manner. Whether the ratio of 11113 resulted from it or not is not material, for once the principle of that cadre being a diminished one is accepted as not violating article 14 or article 16 and so long as 15% remained untouched the block system is no more than a method to further the process of diminution. [640 C- D] (vi) The case of the respondents appointed after provincialisation and are junior in service to the petitioners, is not comparable, for, they were appointed under the 1955 Rules. They may have been posted in the provincialised Schools but that cannot mean that they were appointed in that cadre. Their appointment being in a separate cadre it is impossible to say that they Were similarly situated. By reason of their recruitment in the state cadre, their conditions of service including their promotional chances and their seniority would be governed by 1955 Rules and would only be comparable to those in that cadre only. [638H-639B] Per Palekar J : The petitions must be allowed and the rules of 1961 quashed as violative of the petitioners' fundamental rights under articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.
 (1) The decision in Joginder's case required to be reviewed.
 (2) The Punjab Government throughout considered the teachers as equal in all respects giving them the same scales of pay made them work in the same schools and endeavoured to ensure the same chances of promotion to all.
 The government thought that the best way of ensuring equal chances of promotion was to keep the cadres separate for some time and effect promotions separately in the two cadres by a formula which ensured 15% higher posts at any given time to the provincialised cadre and 15% to the State cadre.. In this way the State believed that it had effected emotional integration of both the sections of teachers. The Government, however, failed to visualise that by reason of the wide disparity of posts in the two cadres (107 in the State cadre and 20,700 in the provincialised cadre) the number of higher grade posts in the State cadre would swell by the transfer of a disproportionately large number of posts which fell vacant in the provincialised service and that juniors in Govt. service, would after completing 5 years of qualifying service become eligible to be appointed to all those higher posts in the State cadre much earlier than their seniors who were borne on the provincialised list.. The majority judgment, in Joginder's case does not appear to have been aware of the future impact of the Rules.
 If the Rules are given effect to, seniors in the provincialised service will have to remain in the lower grade while the juniors in the state cadre will go into the higher grade. Once they go into the higher grade, they will become seniors for all purposes and will block the entry of a member of the provincialised service to higher posts of Head teacher in the case of Primary schools and Head Masters in the case of Secondary schools. [658B-659A] That this was not the result the State Government had desired is clear from the government's conduct after the decision in Joginder's case. The Punjab Government did not enforce the Rules. On the other hand the government unified the two grades and with the unification, the two grades one ordinary and the other promotional disappeared and the teachers whether belonged to the State cadre or the provincialised cadre continued in one grade each one drawing his salary in accordance with the years put in the service.
 This further 611 established that the State government had always considered the two sections of teachers as equals. The unified grade continued to apply to all these teachers after the creation of Haryana State. [659-F] The minority in Joginder's case is right in holding that after the District Board and Municipal Board School teachers were taken over by the government of Punjab an amalgamated Educational Service was evolved and that the government by giving the same terms of employment had in fact constituted a single grade of teachers--State and Provincialised. After doing that, it was not open to the government, ill 1961, to seek to provide a differential treatment between the two sections constituting one unit by retrospective provision.
 On the Government's own showing the teachers were divided into the two cadres, namely, the State cadre and the provincialised cadre in 19'61, solely to give equal chances of promotion to both sections of teachers. The plan, how- ever, miscarried owing to circumstances not clearly visualised at the time and resulted in frustrating the object of securing equality in the matter of promotion..
 With that, the raison detre for the classification dis- appeared and the question of linking it with the object did not survive., The object of the Punjab state government was to evolve one service out of two parallel services the members of the two services being regarded as equal to all substantial respects. The government accepted gradualism in integration only with a view to secure the same chances of promotion to both the sections. [660A-C, G] The majority in Joginder's case does not appear to have considered the question with regard to juniors appointed after October 1, 1957 stealing a march over those who were absorbed on that date. Though it may be theoretically possible to regard the employees in the State cadre prior to October 1, 1957 as members of a distinct class, it is impossible to do so with regard to those who have been appointed in the vacancies in the provincialised schools after October 1, 1957. Being appointed in the posts' of the provincialised service, they belong to the same class as the other members of the provincialised service and it is not possible by any artificial devise to give more advantageous chances of promotion to the new recruits. Even if the classification is accepted as a reasonable classification in respect of the members of the State cadre who were in existence on October 1, 1957, the Rules, in so far as they discriminate between the petitioners and the teachers who have been appointed after October 1, 1957 in the vacancies of provincialised posts would be bad under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution are not merely concerned to see whether broad justice is done en-masse. They are also concerned with the right of an individual not to be discriminated against.

 [1965] INSC 25; [1965] 2 S.C.R. 908, referred to.
 Per Beg, J, concurring with Palekar, J; The rules of 1961 affect the interests of the petitioners so detrimentally and result in such patent injustice to them that it has to be held that the petitioner's complaints of violation of Article 16 of the Constitution, are justified. [667 C] It is not enough to hold that there is, in fact, a classification of the teachers into two cadres by finding that "the two services started dissimilarly and continued dissimilarly" in any respect, or that members of either of two cadres were for purely historical reasons. differently treated in any matter whatsoever in 'the post. These differences may be later relevant for others purposes., In the present case these largely 612 accidental dissimilarities, which have almost evaporated and disappeared, were put forward only to justify a difference made in the promotional chances of the two cadres. The qualifications of two groups of teachers considered "in bulk" or as groups, will not be very material. If a teacher is highly qualified but he happens, by mere accidents of life, to be placed in the provincialised cadre, there is no reason why this fact alone should diminish his promotional chances. He must be held to have been unfairly treated when another, with far less experience and educational qualifications, can or does get preference over him due to equally fortuitous reasons which placed him in the State cadre. Rules which have such an effect would be struck by articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. [665 B-F] Whatever may be the view of any government on the subject, if it appears to the court on an examination of all relevant facts that two groups of government employees, doing exactly the same type of work, possesing the same kind of qualifications and competence and experience ought to be placed in one category having regard to the object which the classification must serve, the court would be justified in holding that for that particular purpose, they form one class. The purpose and the basis of the qualification must be justly and reasonably correlated. [666 C-D] A division of teachers into two cadres for promotional prospects only is highly artificial, unreal and unjustifiable. The only rational classification for such a purpose is one which could be based on merit-cumseniority.
 If merit and competence are the only relevant consideration for the purpose of a particular object sought, other differences are not material for justifying the differences made in promotional chances. [666E]
