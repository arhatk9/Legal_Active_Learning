 The Ruler of the former State of Nandgaon established a mill called Central Provinces Mills Ltd. A firm purchased the said mill and changed its name to Bengal Nagpur Cotton Mills Ltd. The ruler and the appellant company entered into an agreement on March 1, 1943. By this agreement the appellant company was exempted from liability to pay octroi duty to the State or to the municipality of the area. The ruler bound himself in consideration of certain advantages promised to him by the mill. In consequence of the said agreement neither the ruler nor the municipality collected octroi from the company. On December 31, 1947, the State merged with the State of Madhya Pradesh. On September 20, 1952, the Municipal Committee passed a resolution stating therein that this committee would levy octroi duty on the appellant company as the Darbar Agreement of 1943 was not binding on this committee. The appellant challenged this resolution in a petition under Art. 226 and Art. 227 of the Constitution before the High Court. The High Court dismissed the application and hence the appeal has been filed in this Court.
 Held (i) that the agreement of 1943 cannot be regarded as law as it is in the shape of a contract between both the parties.
 191 Madhaorao Phalke v. State Madhya Pradesh, [1961] 1 S.C.R.
 957, explained.
 Maharaja Shree Umaid Mills Ltd. v. Union of India, 1963] Supp. 2 S. C. R. 515, relied on.
 (ii) that the agreements culminating in the agreement of 1943, could not be regarded as law but must be regarded only as agreements which might have bound the sovereign as a contracting party and not the Municipal Committee.
 (iii) that an indication of the will of the ruler meant to bind as a rule of conduct and enacted with some formality either traditional or specially devised for the occasion, resulted in a law, but not an agreement to which there were two parties, one of which was the ruler.
 (iv) that the Municipal Committee's rules and bye-laws though they applied to the appellant-company, remained in suspense because of the ruler's desire not to collect octroi from the appellant-comparty, but could be invoked when the ruler's wish ceased to operate.
 (v) that the ruler's desire that octroi should not be collected ceased to operate from the moment he ceased to be the ruler and therefore the resolution of Municipal Committee was in order and binding on the appellant.
