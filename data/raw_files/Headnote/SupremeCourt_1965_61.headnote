 On the basis of a promissory note and a letter of continuity executed by the appellant and respondent Nos. 2 and 3 and a hypothecation agreement executed by the respondent No. 2, the respondent No. 1--bank opened on overdraft account in the name of respondent 2. In the promissory note, the appellant and respondent Nos. 2 and 3 had "jointly and severally promised to pay" the bank or order; in the letter of continuity sent along with promissory note to the bank, the appellant, respondent Nos. 2 and 3 stated that "the said promissory note is to be a surety to you for the repayment of the ultimate balance or sum remaining unpaid on the overdraft'; and in the hypothecation agreement the bank had agreed to open a cash credit account at the request of respondent No. 2. The bank filed a suit against the appellant and respondent Nos. 2 and 3 for recovery of the amount due on the overdraft. The appellant and respect No. 3 pleaded, inter alia, that they had executed the promissory note as a surety for respondent No. 2 and that they are not co-obligants. The Trial Court held the appellant and respondent No. 3, were not merely sureties but were co- obligants and decreed the suit, which was affirmed by the High Court. In appeal by certificate;
 
HELD: The finding of the High Court was not correct. [324 C- D].
 Interpreting the language of the promissory note in the context of the letter and the hypothecation agreement, the status of the appellant with regard to the overdraft account was that of a surety and not of co-obligant. [324 A].
 If the transaction is contained in more than one document between the same parties., they must be read and interpreted together and they have the same. legal effect for all purposes as if they are one document. [323 C].
 Manks v. Whiteley, (1912) 1 Ch. 735, applied;
 The provisions of Section 92 of the Evidence Act did not apply in the present case, because the appellant was not attempting to furnish evidence of any oral agreement in derogation of the promissory note but relied on the existence of a collateral agreement in writing the letter and the hypethecation agreement, which formed parts of the same transaction as the promissory note. [325 H].
