 By a registered deed dated September 4, 1900, a group of 19 persons forming a joint family with community of property governed by the Aliyasanthana law of inheritance, formed themselves into two branches not according to natural Kavaruts but into artificial branches and divided the family properties. In 1953, the members of one of these two artificial branches instituted a suit against the sole surviving member of the other branch who was a nissan thathi kavaru for partition of all the properties comprised in the deed of 1900, allegation that the deed only effected a division for convenience of enjoyment and not an outright partition.
 On the question whether under s. 36(6) of the Madras Aliyasanthana Act, 1949, the deed of 1900 should be deemed to have effected a partition of the properties, 
HELD : The deed on its true construction, did not effect an out-right partition nor could it be deemed to be a deed of partition under s. 36(6) ,of the Act, because, the kutumba was split into two artificial groups and not according to the kavarus. [937C-D] One of the four conditions necessary as a pre-requisite for the application of the section is that the distribution of properties is among all the kavarus of the kutumba for their separate and absolute enjoyment in perpetuity. That is, the sub-section applies to a family settlement under which the kutumba is split up according to kavarus as defined in s.
 3(b) of the Act, and the kutumba properties distributed among such kavarus. [936F-G; 937B-C]
