 On February 9, 1959, the appellant Corporation passed a resolution under section 150(1) of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act 66 of 1957 for the levy of certain taxes including a tax on the consumption or sale of electricity.
 Under s. 150(2) the Central Government sanctioned the tax with effect from July 1, 1959 and also modified the rates of tax. The Corporation resolved on June 24, 1959 under s.
 150(3) to determine the rates sanctioned by the Central Government as the rates at which the tax would be leviable for the year 1959-60. The respondent challenged the levy of the tax by a writ petition which was allowed in appeal and it was held, inter alia, that the Central Government could not modify the rate,, but only withhold or grant sanction.
 Parliament then passed Act 35 of 1966 to validate the levy of the electricity tax from July 1, 1959 to March 31, 1966.
 On February 17, 1965, the Corporation passed another resolution under s. 150(1) providing for the maximum rates for the levy of tax on electricity and after obtaining the Central Government"s sanction, passed a second resolution on December 27, 1965, tinder s. 150(3) fixing the maximum rates as the actual rates. The respondents filed two writ petitions challenging the levy of tax by the resolutions of February 17, and December 27, 1965, and the vires of the Validation Act. The High Court allowed the petitions holding that though the Validation Act validated the levy and collection of tax from July 1, 1959 to March 31, 1960 it did not do so for the period from April 11, 1960 to March 31, 1966. it also held that section 150 suffered from the vice of excessive delegation of legislative power and was therefore ultra vires. The respondent appealed to this Court.
 
HELD : (i) (By the Full Court) : The Validation Act 35 of 1966 validly levies and imposes tax on consumption or sale of electricity till March 31, 1966.
 (Per Wanchoo, C. J. and Shelat, J.) : The High Court was in error in holding that levy and collection of the tax was not validated for the 252 period from April 1, 1960 to March 31, 1966 and that the Validation Act merely validated the fixation of the rate of tax for that period. When section 2(1) lays down that the rates deducible from the resolution of June 24, 1959 shall be the actual rates of tax for the entire period from July 1, 1959 to March 31, 1966 it must be understood to sanction the levy and collection of tax at the rates fixed. This is implicit in the word ..actual" which governs the words "rates of the tax". Even if there was some doubt in the matter from the words of s. 2(1), that doubt is resolved by the words of s. 2(2), which lays down that "all taxes on the consumption or sale of electricity levied or collected or purporting to have been levied or collected in pursuance of the resolution referred to in subsection (1) shall, for all purposes, be deemed to be, and to have always been validly levied or connected." This clearly shows that the validation "as not merely of the rate of tax but of levy and collection also for the entire period from July 1, 1959 to March 31, 1966. A reading of s. 2(1) and s. 2(2) together shows that Parliament not only validated what was done but also itself imposed the rates deducible from the resolution of June 24.
 1959 and authorised the levy and collection thereof for the entire period from July 1, 1959 to March 31, 1966 notwithstanding anything contained in any judgment, decree or order of any court to the contrary. 1276 H-278 B] (ii) (Per Wanchoo, C.J. and Shelat, J.) : On a consideration of the various provisions of the Act, it must be held that the power conferred by section 150 of the Act on the Corporation is not unguided and cannot be said to amount to excessive delegation. Although the delegation made in relation to the optional taxes under ss. 113(2) and 150 is wide, there are sufficient guidelines, limits, controls or safeguards provided by the legislature in view of the following : (a) The delegation has been made to an, elected body responsible to the people including those who pay the taxes; this is an important check on the elected Councillors acting unreasonably and fixing unreasonable rates of taxation; (b) the limit to which the Corporation can tax is circumscribed by the need to finance the functions,' obligatory or optional, which it has to or may undertake to perform, under the Act. It will not be open to the Corporation by the use of taxing power to collect more than it needs for the functions it performs; though the mere fact that specific purposes and functions are set out in an im- pugned Act may not be conclusive it is one of the factors which should be taken into account along with other relevant factors; (c) budget estimates have to be adopted each year as laid down in section 109 of the Act; (d) under section 150(2), the maximum rates fixed by the Corporation have to be submitted to the Central Government for its sanction;
 though therefore the legislature may not have provided that the rates of tax shall be submitted to it for approval, the fact that they have to be submitted to Government for approval and the Government in its turn is responsible to the legislature is a factor which has to be taken into account when considering whether the delegation by section 150 of the Act is excessive or not. [275 B; 271 D; 272 D; H;
 273 E] Furthermore, should the Corporation fix rates which are unreasonable it would always be open to the Courts to strike down such import. Kruse Johnson, [1898] 2 Q.B.D. 91;
 referred to. [274 E] Under certain circumstances fixation of rates of taxation can also be delegated to subordinate authorities with proper guidance and subject to safeguards and limitations.
 Pandit Banarsi Das Bhanot v. The State of Madhya Pradesh, [1958] INSC 36; [1959] S,C.R. 427; considered.
 253 There is a clear distinction between delegation of power to fix the rate of a tax like sales tax to the State Government and delegation of fixing rates of certain taxes for purposes of local taxation. The needs of the State are unlimited and the purposes for which the State exists are also unlimited.
 On the other hand, in the case of a municipality, however large may be the amount required by it for its purposes, it cannot be limited, for the amount that a municipality can spend is limited by the purposes for which it is created.
 [268 D-G] (Per Hidayatullah and Ramaswami, JJ.) : While the provisions which have been characterised as safeguards (where found necessary) are desirable, the proper test to apply is not the existence of safeguards but whether the legislative will to impose the tax is adequately expressed so as to bind those who have to pay the tax. This requires an examination of the policy and provisions of the Act with a view to determining whether the legislative will is fully expressed to invest the Municipal Corporation with the power to levy the tax subject, of course, to a proper procedure being evolved. [280 D, E] The doctrine that Parliament cannot delegate its powers must be understood in a limited way. It only means that the legislature must not efface itself but must give the legislative sanction to the imposition of the tax and must keep the control in its own hands. There is no specific provision in the Constitution which says that the Parliament cannot delegate to certain specified instrumentalities the power to effectuate its own will. The question always is whether the legislative will has been exercised or not.
 Once it is established that the legislature itself has willed that a particular thing be done and has merely left the execution of it to a chosen instrumentality (provided that it has not parted with its control there can be no question of excessive delegation. If the delegate acts contrary to the wishes of the legislature, the legislature can undo what the delegate has done. Even the courts may be asked to intervene when the delegate exceeds its powers and functions. The observations and theories in American cases cannot be applied in our country without reflection. Even in America the doctrine is much watered down especially when it is a question of investing municipalities with power of such taxation. In the present case, in addition to prescribing the mode, The legislature has kept a check by making Government, answerable to itself, the supervising authority. This is no,, a safeguard. but is indicative of the exercise of the legislative will by the legislature itself. The details of the tax are to be considered by the supervising authority and if the tax is no' what the legislature intended should be imposed, the tax cannot be imposed. [287 E-G] As local bodies are intended to carry on local self- government, the power of taxation is a necessary adjunct to their other powers. They function under the supervision of the Government. This supervision is considered necessary because Municipal Councillors as a rule are unwilling to lax in a manner likely to affect themselves. To insist that the legislature should provide for every matter connected with municipal taxation would make municipalities mere tax collecting departments of Government and not self-governing bodies which they are intended to be. [288 E, F] (Per Sikri, J.) :. Parliament has full power to delegat legislative authority to subordinate bodies. This power flows from Act. 246 of the Constitution. The, word exclusive" in that Article means exclusive of any other legislature and not exclusive of subordinate body. There is, however, one restriction in this respect and that is also contained in Art. 246. Parliament must pass a law in respect of an item or items of the relevant legislative list. Negatively, this means that Parliament cannot abdicate its functions. This was the Position under the various Government of India 254 Acts, and the Constitution has made no difference in this respect.[ 1309 H-3 I 0 B] In any event however, in the, present case there is adequate guide, or policy, in the expression "purposes of the Act" in s. 113. The Act has pointed out the objectives or the- results to be achieved, and taxation can be levied only for the purpose of achieving the objectives or the results.
 This is sufficient guidance especially to a self-governing body like the Delhi Municipal Corporation. It is not necessary to rely on the safeguards to sustain the delegation under s. 113(2) and s. 150. [310 G] (Per- Shah and Vaidialingam, JJ. dissenting) : Section 150(1) of the Act 66 of 1957 is void as permitting excessive delegation of legislative authority to the Corporation.
 Authority to legislate in respect of powers of local bodies may encompass authority to confer power upon the local bodies to tax within certain specific fields in the appropriate list. But the power conferred by the legislative entry cannot override the constitutional limitations against abdication of legislative authority.
 The expression "power" therefore does not include authority to delegate the essential legislative function without disclosing principles, policy, or standard guiding the local bodies in the exercise of the Dower. [302 C-D] The vice of delegation lies not in its capacity for abuse, but in its delegation beyond permissible limits and contrary to the constitutional scheme. Undoubtedly delegation of the authority to legislate is always subject to the rule that action of the delegate which amounts to unreasonable exercise of the powers wilt be invalid. But that does not alter the true character of the rule against excessive delegation of legislative authority. It cannot be said that this rule may be departed from on the ground that the delegate is hedged in by controls or restrictions which will prevent it from abusing its authority. Safeguards against abuse do not alter the character of unauthorised delegation of legislative power. They cannot be a substitute for the guidance which the constitutional scheme requires that the Parliament must give to a delegate. As the validity of the constitutional protection cannot be judged in the light of what the character. capacity or the special aptitude of the, delegate may be, it cannot also be adjudged in the light of the provisions made against abuse of power.
 In the present case the Act leaves it to the, Corporation by resolution to define the maximum limits of tax to be levied, the class or classes of persons, or description or descriptions of articles and properties to be taxed, the system of assessment to be adopted and the exemptions, if any, to granted. The Act discloses by express enactment no standard, no principle and no policy laid down by the Parliament to guide the Corporation in levying and collecting the optional taxes. By providing in sub-section (2) of s. 150 that the resolution will come into force on or from the date as may be specified in the order of sanction of the Central Government, an overriding authority is conferred upon the Union Executive, but that is not substitute for, guidance. [303 C-E] The Corporation is competent to levy tax only "for the, purposes of the Act", and for no other purpose, and by providing expressly what is implicit in a statute relating to municipal taxation no guidance is furnished to the Corporation in the exercise of the power delegated. It cannot be held that because the delegate is a local authority which "needs" large funds, depending upon diverse and changing circumstances, the power conferred upon the Corporation to adjust the tax to its varying needs may be regarded as an adequate guide. The circumstance that the affairs of 255 the Corporation are administered by the elected representatives responsible the people is wholly irrelevant in determining whether the rule against excessive delegation may be departed from. If that exception be true, the Parliament may justifiably delegate its power to enact laws to other bodies merely by the expedient of constituting those bodies from among the representatives of the people.
 Case law reviewed.
 (iii) (Per- Wanchoo C.J. and Shelat, J.) : There wits no force in the contention that the sanction of the Central Government given under section 150(2) was not in accordance with the Constitution as it was given by a Deputy Secretary to the Government who had no authority to do 8o. Although the words "by the orders of the Central Government" or " by ,.he order of the President" were not used above the signature of the Deputy Secretary and the authentication therefore was not quite in accordance With the provisions of Art. 77 of the Constitution, that deficiency had been made up by the affidavit filed on behalf of the Central Government in which it was stated that the resolution was approved by the then Deputy Home Minister and the Minister in the Ministry of Home Affairs to whom the work relating to the Corporation was assigned by the Home Minister.
 Furthermore, it is not necessary where business has been assigned by a Cabinet Minister to a Minister or a Deputy Minister that the matter should be put before the Cabinet Minister also after the Minister or the Deputy Minister has approved of it in accordance with the assignment made in his favour.
