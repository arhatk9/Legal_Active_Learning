 The respondent was married to appellant at Ghaziabad.
 He filed a Divorce Petition at Bombay and the appellant-wife filed applications for maintenance and expenses of the divorce proceedings. Subsequently she filed a Transfer petition in this Court for transferring the case from Bombay to Ghaziabad which was disposed by this Court directing that (i) the respondent-husband would pay Rs.2500 for wife's next visit to Bombay; and (ii) the Family Court would insist on the husband depositing the to and fro fare for the wife and her companion and also an amount sufficient for their stay in Bombay on each visit. The Family Court dismissed the wife's application for interim maintenance and expenses of proceedings on the ground that she was gainfully employed but awarded Rs. 700 as expenses and further directed that she will be paid an additional amount of Rs. 150 per day in case of her stay for more than one day at Bombay. Against this order the appellant filed a Special Leave petition in this Court. Since she was held up for attending to her petition in this Court the Family Court granted an ex-parte decree of divorce to the husband. She filed a petition in this Court as she could not attend the Court on account of her inability to meet the expenses for travel and residence in Bombay.
 Allowing the appeal, this Court, 317 
 HELD : 1. While disposing the appellant's Transfer Petition this Court had clearly directed that the Family Court will insist on the husband not only depositing the to and fro travel expenses for the wife and her companion but also an amount sufficient for their stay in Bombay on each visit. But the Family Court has been far from just to the wife who was required to travel a long distance to defend herself. Nothing has been allowed by way of transport charges and lodging and boarding charges even if she has not to stay for an additional day in Bombay. [320 D-F] 
 2. The interim order passed by the Family Court is for reasons best known to it, highly biased. This is more so because this Court's order granting expenses to visit Bombay provided sufficient guideline for determining the quantum of expenses to be awarded. Besides the Family Court has not awarded any amount to meet the cost of the proceedings on the specious plea that the appellant is gainfully employed.
 To say the least the order is far from satisfactory and has resulted in gross denial of justice. The impugned order is accordingly set aside. [321 A-C] 
 3. As the interim order made it impossible for the wife to contest the divorce petition in the Family Court and facilitated an ex-parte divorce decree in favour of the husband, in the extraordinary and peculiar circumstances of this case, the ex-parte divorce decree is set aside. [321 C- D] 
 4. Interest of justice requires transfer of the proceedings from the Family Court, Bombay to the District Court, Ghaziabad. The restored divorce proceedings will stand transferred from Family Court Bombay to the District Court, Ghaziabad. [321 E-F]
