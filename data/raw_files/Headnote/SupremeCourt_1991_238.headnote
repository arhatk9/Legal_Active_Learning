 A notification under Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 was published in respect of lands under the appel- lant's occupation. The appellant challenged the notifica- tion before the High Court and prayed for an interim stay of operation and implementation of the notification. Pending admission of the appellant's Special Civil Application, the High Court granted limited interim relief by restraining the respondent from taking possession of the lands. Meanwhile Respondent No. 2, the Land Acquisition Officer, issued a notice under Section 9(1) of the Act and proceeded to deter- mine the compensation. In the enquiry, he rejected the appellant's objection that as two years had elapsed after the publication of the notification and no award had been made within the said period, all the acquisition proceedings lapsed and were exhausted. The High Court also rejected the appellant's appeal, relying on the decision of a Division Bench of the High Court, that Section 11-A of the aforesaid Act enjoined exclusion of the entire period during which any action or proceeding to be taken pursuant to a declaration under Section 6 was stayed by an order of a competent court, and that the Explanation to the Section was not confined to the staying of the making of the award, pursuant to Section 6 of the notification, but it was widely worded and covered in its sweep the entire period during which any action or proceeding was stayed by a competent Court.
 In the appeal before this Court, on behalf of the appel- lant it was contended that by Explanation to Section 11-A the only period excluded in computing the period of two years was the period during which any action 159 or proceeding taken in pursuance of the declaration under Section 6 upto the making of the award under Section 11 was stayed and that the question of taking possession could arise after making the award and merely because the land- holder obtained an injunction restraining land acquisition authorities from taking possession that could not serve to exclude any time from the period of two years within which the award must be made.
 Dismissing the appeal, this Court, 
 HELD: The Explanation to Section 11-A of the Land Acqui- sition Act, 1894, which prescribes the period to be excluded while computing the period of two years within which the award has to be made, is in the widest possible terms and there is no warrant for limiting the action or proceedings referred to in the Explanation to actions or proceedings preceding the making of the award under Section 11 of the Act. In the first place, where the case is covered by Sec- tion 17, the possession can be taken before an award is made and there is no reason why the expression "the period during which any action or proceedings to be taken in pursuance of the said declaration is stayed by an order by a Court", in the Explanation should be given a different meaning, depend- ing upon whether the case is covered by Section 17 or other- wise. On the other hand, the Explanation is intended to limit the benefit conferred by Section 11-A on a land-holder whose land is acquired after the declaration under Section 
6. The benefit is that the award must be made within a period of two years of the declaration, failing which the acquisition proceedings would lapse and the land would revert to the land-holder. In order to get the benefit of the said provision what is required, is that the land-holder who seeks the benefit must not have obtained any order from a court restraining any action or proceeding in pursuance of the declaration under Section 6 of the said Act so that the operation of the beneficial provisions of Section 11-A is confined to cases of those land-holders who do not obtain any order from a court which would delay or prevent the making of the award or taking possession of the land ac- quired. [163 E-H, 164 A] The High Court was, therefore, right in rejecting the appellant's challenge to the continuance of the proceedings.
 [164-B] Special Civil Application No. 4314 of 1990 decided by Gujarat High Court approved.
 160 S. BavajanSahib v. State of Kerala and Others, AIR 1988 Kerala 280, disapproved.
