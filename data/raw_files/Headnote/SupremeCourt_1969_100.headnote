 The Government of the State of Bihar framed certain rules under the Bihar High School (Control and Regulation of Administration) Act 13 of 1960. Rule 41 provided that the said rules will not apply to schools established and administered by minorities whether based on religion or lan- guage. A school founded in 1854 at Bhagalpur and managed by the National Christian Council of India was asked by the Bihar Government Educational authorities to constitute its managing committee according to the directions given in the order of the Secretary to the Government dated May 22, 1967.
 This order was challenged before the High Court in a writ petition. The High Court dismissed the writ petition holding that -though the institution was administered by the Christian minority ill India it had been established by the Church Missionary Society of London, and therefore not having been established by members of a minority who were residents of India or citizens of India it could not claim the benefit of Art. 30 - Against he High Court's judgment appeals were filed in this Court and _petitions under Art.
 32 were also filed by persons interested.
 
HELD:(i) There was ample evidence on record, which showed that although assistance was undoubtedly obtained from other bodies including the Church Missionary Society London, the school was set up by the Christian Missionaries and the local residents of Bhagalpur with the aid of funds part of which were contributed by them. [178 F] (ii) The Christian Missionaries who had settled in India and the local Christian residents of Bhagalpur formed a minority community. It is true that the minority competent to claim the, protection of Art. 30(1) and on that account the privilege of establishing and maintaining educational institutions of its choice must be a minority of persons residing in India. it does not confer on foreigners not residing in India the right to set up educational institutions of their choice. Persons setting up educational institutions must be resident in India and they must form a well defined religious and linguistic minority.
 It is however not predicated that protection of the right guaranteed under Art. 30 may be availed of only, in respect of an institution established before the Constitution, by persons born and resident in British India. [179 D] Therefore the fact that the funds were obtained from the United Kingdom for assisting in setting up and developing the School or that the management of the institution was carried on by some persons who may not have been born in India was not a ground for denying the, protection of Art.
 30(1). [180 C-D] 173 (iii). The High Court was also wrong in holding that for claiming the benefit of Art. 30(1) all persons or a majority of them who established the institution should have-been "Indian Citizens" in the year 1854. There being no Indian citizen-ship in the year 1854 independently of the citizen- ship of the British Empire,, to incorporate in the, interpretation of Art. 30 in respect of an institution established by a minority the condition that it must in addition be proved to have been established by persons who would if the institution had been set up after the Constitution have claimed Indian citizenship, is to whittle down the protection of Art. 30 in a manner not warranted by the provisions of the Constitution. [180 E-F] The protection of the rights under Art. 29 may be claimed only by Indian citizens. Article 30 guarantees the right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions : the article does not expressly refer to citizenship as a qualification for the members of the minorities. [179 F-G] (iv) On the above findings the order passed by the Educational authorities requiring the Secretary of the School to take steps to constitute a managing committee in accordance with the order dated May 22, 1967 must be declared invalid.
