 The appellant Company was the sole distributing agent in India for the imported products of an American :firm. The Customs authorities used to levy import duty on the basis of the invoice price under s. 29 read with s.. 30 of the Sea Customs Act, 1878, as being the real value of the goods so imported.
 During 1954-55, the appellant Company imported several items set out in Annexure 'D' of the Special Leave Petition.
 When items 1 and 2 arrived in Bombay Port, the Custom authorities, ignoring their hitherto followed practice, refused to accept the invoice price as the real value and levied excess duty. An appeal to the Customs Collector failed, whereupon the appellant Company lodged a revision application before the Government of India.
 Pending the disposal of the said revision, several other items set out in Annexure 'D' arrived in Bombay Port and the Customs authorities charged the Appellant-Company with excess amounts as import duty. For fear of demurrage charges, the appellant-Company paid the excess duty under protest.
 In March, 1957, the Government of India disposed of the said revision, accepting the appellants' contention, and directed re-assessment of import duty on the said two items 1 and 2 on the basis of their invoice price and also ordered refund of the excess duty charged on them.
 The appellant-Company, however, did not file appeals in respect of the other items which had arrived during the pendency of the said revision, although the Customs had, levied excess duty thereon.
 The Customs authorities refunded the excess duty levied on those items, for which application for refund was made within the time prescribed under s. 40, but refused refund in respect of the rest of the items., An appeal to the Collector and a revision before the Government of India were both rejected. The appellant company, thereafter, filed a writ petition before the Delhi High Court for appropriate relief, but was without success.
 The respondent contended before the Court that whatever claims were found not in time as required by s. 40 of the Sea Customs Act have been correctly rejected by the Appraiser of Customs, Bombay, and therefore, the appellant- Company had no claim. Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) After the disposal of the revision by the Government of India, there was no doubt that the invoice prices were the real value of the consignments and the Custom authorities had no right in law to charge extra duty on the rest of the consignments. Indeed, the excess duty was charged in violation of Sections 29 and 30 and in excess of 8 12 jurisdiction. This position was also accepted by the Custom authorities when they ordered refund of excess duty charged by them in relation to items 22 to 29 and 33 to 35.
 [815H] (ii) Section 40 had no application in the present case.
 Section 40 clearly applies only to cases where duties have been paid through inadvertence, error or misconstruction, and where refund application has to be made within 3 months.. The present case is not one where the excess duty was paid through any of the 3 reasons set out in Section 40.
 The excess duty was demanded on the ground that the invoice price was not the real value of the imported goods. Since s. 40 did not apply to the facts of the case, the respondents could not retain the excess duty illegally.
