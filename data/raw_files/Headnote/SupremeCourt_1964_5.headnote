 The petitioner was enrolled in the Madras High Court under the Indian Bar Councils Act, and later admitted to the rolls of this Court under the Supreme Court Rules. In this petition, it was contended that under s. 58(3) of the Advocates Act, the petitioner was entitled "as of right to practise" in this Court, and the "right to practise" included not merely the right to plead but also to act; that the rules made-0. IV rr. 16 & 17 of the Supreme Court Rules are invalid; and that that by a rule made under Art. 145 (1)(a) this Court could neither entitle a person to practice nor impose qualifications as to the right to practise, these matters being entirely within entry 77 and therefore exclusively for parliamentary legislation.
 
HELD: (i) The words "right to practise" would in its normal connotation take in not merely right to plead but the right to act as well and if no rules had been made by the Supreme Court restricting the right to act, the petitioner could undoutedly have had a right both to plead as well as to act.
 Ashwani Kumar Ghosh v. Arabinda Bose, [1952] INSC 50; [1953] S.C.R. 1, referred to.
 (ii) Under s. 58(3) of the Advocates Act, the right conferred on Advocates enrolled under the Bar Councils Act to practise in the Supreme Court is made subject to any rules made by this Court. Section 230 52 of the Advocates Act specifically saves the powers of this Court to make rules under Art. 145. In view of the saving, repeated if s. 52 there is no question of the rule restricting the right to act to a certain class of advocates as being contrary to a law made by Parliament.
 (iii) On the express terms of Art. 145(1)(a) rules 16 & 17 of 0. IV are valid and within the rule making powers of this Court. This Court can by its rules make provision prescribing qualifications entitling persong to practise before it, and Parliament can do likewise. 'Mere is no question of a conflict between the legislative power of Parliament and the rule-making power of this Court, because by reason of the opening words of Art. 145, any rule made by this Court would have operation only subject to laws made by Parliament on the subject of the entitlement to practise.
