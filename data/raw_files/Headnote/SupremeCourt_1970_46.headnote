 According to s. 8(3)(c) of the Rice Milling Industry (Regulation) Act, 1958, no owner of a rice mill "shall without the previous permission of the Central Government, change the location of the whole or any part of that rice mill in respect of which licence has been granted under s.
 6". The lands and buildings of the appellants' rice mill in the State of Mysore were acquired under the Land Acquisition Act 1894 and the award expressly recited that the appellants were entitled to remove the machinery of the mill. The appellants were allotted a new site by the Mysore Gov- ernment. After obtaining sanction from the Tehsildar the appellant shifted their machinery to the new site.
 Thereafter the Director of Food and Civil Supplies in purported exercise, of the delegated powers of the Central Government passed an order under s. 8(3)(c) sanctioning a change in the location of the appellants' rice mill. He overruled the objection of the respondents whose rice mill was situated near the new site. The, respondents challenged the order before the High Court in a writ petition. The High Court having allowed the same the appellant obtained special leave and appealed to this Court. The questions that fell for consideration were : (i) whether the shifting of the appellants' rice mill to the new site without prior permission of the Central Government as required by s. 8(3) (c) of the Act,- was legal, and if not whether it affected the respondents' right under Art. 19(1) (g) of the Constitution; (ii) whether the order under s. 8 (3) (c) was bad for the reason that it did not take into consideration the relevant factors such as mentioned in s. 5(4) of the Act.
 
HELD : (i) Section 8(3) (c) is merely regulatory : if it was not complied with the appellants may probably be exposed to a penalty, but a competitor in the business could not seek to prevent the appellants from exercising their right to carry on business, because of the default, nor could the rice mill of the appellants be regarded as a new rice mill.
 Competition in the trade or business may be subject to such restrictions as are permissible and are imposed by the State by a law enacted in the interests of the general public under Art. 19(6), but a person cannot claim independently of such restriction that another person shall not carry on business or trade so as to affect his trade or business adversely. The appellants ,complied with the statutory requirements for carrying on rice milling operations in the building on the new site. Even assuming that no previous permission was obtained, the respondents would have no locus standi for challenging the grant of the permission, because no right vested in the respondents was infringed. [851 G-H] (ii) The considerations which arc prescribed by sub-s. (4) of s. 5 only apply to the grant of a permit in respect of a new rice mill or a defunct 84 7 rice mill. They have no application in considering the shifting the location of an existing -rice mill. In respect of a new or defunct mill a permit and a licence are both required : in respect of an existing rice mill only a licence is required. The conditions prescribed by sub-s.
 (4) of s. 5 only apply to the grant of a permit and not a licence. By s. 8 (3) (c) it is made one of the conditions of the licence that the location of the rice mill shall not be shifted without the previous permission of the Central Government. It is true that the appropriate authority clothed with the power must consider the expediency of permitting a change of location. But there is no statutory obligation imposed upon him to take into consideration the matters prescribed by sub-s. (4) of s. 5 in granting the permission to change the location. [852 E-G] On the facts of the present case the permission granted under s. 8 (3) (c) could not be said to be granted without considering the relevant circumstances.
