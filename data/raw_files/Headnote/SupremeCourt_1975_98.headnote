 This Court in the case of Baij Nath Kedia declared the second proviso to section 10(2) of the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950 unconstitutional on the ground that the Bihar Legislature had no jurisdiction to enact it and that Parliament alone was competent to legislate. This Court also held that rule 20(2) framed by the Bihar Government as delegate of the Parliament under section 15 of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act of 1957 was unconstitutional since the rule making power conferred by section 15 of the Central Act did not contemplate alteration of terms of leases already in existence before the Act was passed.
 Second proviso to section 10(2) of the Bihar Land Reforms Act reads as under "Provided further that the terms and conditions of the said lease in regard to minor minerals as defined in the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957 (Act LXVII of 1957) shall, in so far as they are inconsistent with the rules of that Act, stand substituted by the corresponding terms and conditions by those rules and if further ascertainment and settlement of the terms will become necessary then necessary proceedings for that shall be undertaken by the Collector." Rule 20(2) authorises the alteration of the term of leases which were in existence before the Central Act was passed.
 After the judgment in Baij Nath Kedia's case was delivered, the Parliament passed a Validation Act of 1969. Section 2(1) and (2) of the Validation Act reads as under "21(1). The laws specified in the Schedule shall be and shall be deemed always to have been, as valid as if the provisions contained therein had been enacted by Parliament.
 2(2). Notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any court, all actions taken, things done, rules made, notifications issued or purported to have been taken, done, made or issued and rents or royalties realised under any such laws shall be deemed to have been validly taken, done, made, issued or realised, as the case may be, as if this section had been in force at all material times when such notifications, were issued, or rents or royalties were realised, and no suit or other proceedings shall be maintained or continued in any court for the refund of rents or royalties realised under any such laws." In the Schedule to the said Validation Act, section 10 of the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950 and sub-rule (2) of Rule 20 of the Bihar Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1964, inter alia, have been set out.
 10 SC/75-11 152 In the present petition under Article 32, validity of the Validition Act has been challenged by the petitioner on the grounds :
 "If a law is void as being passed by an incompetent Legislature, validation by a subsequent Act passed by a competent legislature can only be effected by the subsequent law enacting the provisions of the old Act expressly or by incorporation. It cannot be done by a competent Legislature, laying down in the subsequent Act that the former Act passed by the incompetent Legislatam is deemed to be valid.
 No liability to levy rent or royalty can be created retroactively without two clear stages or steps: firstly, a law must be enacted creating the liability; next, such provision should be made retrospective. This two-stage procedure is absent in the statute under attack and fore the purpose, whatever it be, has misfired." The respondent contended that the Parliament adopted the form of incorporation refrencially to a State Act and subordinate legislation given in the schedule to the Validation Act. The Validation Act was a product of the Parliament It was not a case of Parliament simply validating an invalid law passed by the Bihar Legislation. The Parliament reenacted the Validation Act with retrospective effect in its own right adding one Central Act to tin Book.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) Incorporation of Acts is permissible in the absence of other disabling factors. The Bihar Act qua the Bihar Legislature could not be resuscited by Parliament conferring such power through a law, as far as provisions of second proviso to section 10(2) of the Bihar Land Reforms Act is concerned. As far as rule 20(2) is concerned, the position is different since that is a rule framed by Parliament through its delegate the State Government although rule was ultra vires being in excess of the power conferred by section 15 of the Central Act. The Parliament had, therefore, passed a Validation Act to validate the void provisions of Bihar Land Reforms Act and the ultra vires sub-rule 2 of rule 20 as well as action taken and things done in connection therewith. The power of a Legislature to pass a law obviously includes the power to pass it retrospectively. Earlier, the Bihar Act or Rules framed by the State Government under the Central Acts do not have to be valid for sustaining the Validation Act made by the Parliament. [162E-F, 163B] (ii)What is the intention of Parliament is mainly to be gathered from the language used, tested by approved cannons of construction. Unhappy wording, infelicitous expression of imperfect or inartistic drafting may not necessarily defeat for that reason alone the obvious object of the validating law and its retrospective content. The real question is whether the Court can speculate on presumed intent of the Parliament and rewrite that object with implicit sense. We listen largely to the language of the Statute but where, as here, clearing up of marginal obscurity may make interpretation surer if light from dependable sources were to beam in, the Court may seek such aid. In the instant case, we are satisfied that the Parliament desired to validate retrospectively what the Bihar Legislation had ineffectually attempted. It has used words plain enough to implement its object and, therefore, the validating Act as well as the consequential levy are good. Rule 20(2) of the Mineral Concession Rules stands on an assured footing. This sub-rule has been made by the Bihar Government purely as a delegate of Parliament Therefore, Parliament could validate it and has done so.
 [166AB, 156H] (iii)Under our scheme of distribution of the legislative powers, particularly when subjects of national and provincial concern are involved, an and the States a lesser role, the present case of mines and minerals being an instance in point. [155CD] (iv)The impugned legislation, levy and other actions are good. [168B] 153
