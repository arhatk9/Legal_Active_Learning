 The appellant, along with others, was charged with offence under s. 120B, I.P.C. read with s. 167(81) of the Sea Customs Act, 1878, and s. 5 of the Imports and Exports Control Act, 1947, and the prosecution had to examine certain witnesses in West Germany on Commission. The High Court ordered the issue of the Commission. The appellant appealed to this Court against the order and the appeal was confined to the payment of expenses to his Counsel. This Court allowed the appeal and ordered payment of the expenses by the prosecution. This Court allowed the appeal and ordered payment of the expenses by the prosecution. While the appeal was pending and thereafter, this Court extended the time for return of the Commission.
 On a further application by the prosecution for extension of time, 
HELD : (1) the provisions contained in ss. 504 and 508A, Cr.P.C. contain complimentary provisions for reciprocal arrangements between the Government of our Country and the Government of a foreign Country for Commission from Courts in India to specified courts in the foreign Country for examination of witnesses residing in the foreign Country and similarly for Commissions from specified courts in. the foreign Country for examination of witnesses residing in our Country. In the present case, no notification under s. 508A has been published specifying the Courts in West Germany by whom commissions for examination of witnesses residing in India may be issued. The notification under s. 504 was issued in anticipation of an arrangement between the Governments of India and West Germany, and was not based upon any existing reciprocal complete arrangement between the Government of India and the Government of West Germany for examination of witnesses residing in West Germany. When this Court finds that there are no arrangements in existence within the meaning of ss. 504 and 508A, Cr.P.C. this Court will not make any order. [124A-G, F-H] (2) Even after the disposal of the appeal, this Court may, if it were so inclined pass orders for extension of time as it would only be supplemental to and in continuation of the time originally fixed by this Court.
