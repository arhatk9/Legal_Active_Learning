 The appellant stood charged for trial under s. 302 of the I.P.C. for having caused the death of his wife by sprinkling kerosene oil and setting her clothes to fire. The Addl. Sessions Judge relying on the dying declaration which was corroborated by the circumstantial evidence of the narration about the incident by the deceased to her parents PW-1 and PW-2 just before her death, found him guilty of the offence with which he was charged and sentenced him to life imprisonment. The appeal preferred by the appellant to the High Court having proved abortive, the appellant came up before this Court by special leave.
 Dismissing the appeal the Court, ^ 
 HELD : (1) The circumstantial evidence in order to sustain conviction must be complete and must be incapable of explanation on any other hypothesis other than that of guilt of the accused. [781C-D] (2) The dying declaration which is not recorded by a Magistrate has to be scruitinised closely, but it is well settled that if the Court is satisfied on a close scrutiny of the dying declaration that it is truthful it is open to the Court to convict the accused on its basis without any independent corroboration. [781D] Khmushal Rao v. The State of Bombay, [1957] INSC 78; [1958] SCR 552;
 Lallubhai Devchand Shah & Ors. v. The State of Gujarat, [1971] 3 SCC 767; Vithal Somnath Kore v. State of Maharashtra, [1978] 1 S.C.C. 622, referred to.
 (3) (a) In the instant case there is no direct evidence regarding the guilt of the appellant and the prosecution case rests wholly on the circumstantial evidence and the dying declarations made by the deceased before the Sub- Inspector Din Dayal and Roshan PW-1 and Phool Vati PW-2.
 [781B-C] (b) On a careful consideration of the evidence it is clear that the dying declaration Ext. PW 21/F, the genuineness of which is verified by Dr. Avtar Singh Gill PW- 18 is truthful and convincing and it cannot be brushed aside merely on the ground that it was not recorded by a Magistrate especially when it was recorded by Sub-Inspector Din Dayal in the presence of the duty doctor viz. Avtar Singh Gill at the time when the deceased was in great agony and the life in her was fast ebbing away. The testimony of the parents of the deceased viz. Roshan P.W. 1 and Phool Vati PW-2 also lends strong corroboration to the dying declaration. They have categorically stated that the relations between the deceased and the appellant were strained as the latter was ill-treating the former and was carrying on with another woman from Shahdara.
 778 The dying declaration also receives corroboration from the report of the Chemical Examiner and post mortem report of PW-11 which indicate that the cause of death of the deceased was shock and toxemia due to burns. [781E-H, 782A, E, F] (4) The evidence in the instant case inevitably points to the conclusion that it was the appellant and the appellant alone who intentionally caused the death of the deceased and the plea sought to be raised by him that the fire was accidental is an after thought and stands refuted not only from the recovery of the bottle containing kerosene oil, burnt match sticks, match box and half burnt clothes of the deceased but also from the fact he did not come with this plea either to PW-4 or PW-5.
