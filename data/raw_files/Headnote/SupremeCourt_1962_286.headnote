 The appellants had not paid advance tax according to their own estimate of the income for the assessment years 1951-52 and 1952-53 and they were liable to penal interest under s.
 18A (8) of the Income Tax Act. The Income Tax Officer overlooked this fact and did not add penal interest to the tax leviable. In 1956, lie started proceedings under s. 35 of the Act for the rectification of the assessment and ordered the levy of penal interest without sending notice to the appellants. Against this order the appellants moved the Commissioner of Income Tax in revision. They were not heard by the Commissioner and were informed by the Income Tax Officer that their applications were rejected. The appellants challenged the orders before the High Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution, and the petitions were dismissed. It was urged by the respondents in this Court that the fifth proviso to sub-s.(6) could not apply to a case of penal interest leviable under sub-s (8) of s. 18A since that sub-section was mandatory and that the fifth proviso to s. 18A (6) did not override the mandatory character of sub-s. (8).
 Held, that the fifth proviso to', sub-S.(6) does apply to a case arising under sub-s. (8). Sub-section (6) is expressly made applicable and the discretion contemplated under the fifth proviso read with r. 48 is open not only in cases arising under sub ss.(2) and (3) of s. 18A but also in cases arising under sub-s(8). There is nothing to show that in applying sub-s. (6) any of the provisos are to be left out.

 Lata Mangeshkar v. Union of India, [1959] 36 I.T.R. 52 7.
 held inapplicable.
 Held, further, that the authorities acting under the Indian Income-tax Act have to act judicially. In the present case the proviso to s. 35 itself makes it incumbent upon the Income-tax Officer to give notice and a hearing to the assessee when the effect of the rectification would be the enhancement of the assessment. The appellants did not receive a notice and were not heard and there was a clear breach of the principles of natural justice.
