 The landlords of certain premises gave notice to their tenants terminating the tenancy. After the period fixed in the notice for vacating the premises expired, the landlords filed a suit for eviction under s. 28 of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947, in the Court of the Judge of Small-Causes. The suit was based on two grounds, namely : (i) that the rent was in arrears for six months, and (ii) that there was unlawful sub-letting by the tenants to the appellant. The tenants contended that the rent was not in arrears and that there was no sub- letting to the appellant, but that he was a partner of their firm. The appellant's contention was that he was not a sub- tenant but the tenant of the landlords because of a transfer by the tenants of their interest to him, and that, there were no arrears of rent. The trial Court held that, (i) there were no arrears of rent, and (ii) that the appellant was a sub-tenant, but that he could not be evicted because of s. 15(2) of the Act. In appeal by the landlords the appellate Court also held, (i) that there were no arrears but (ii) that since the appellant himself denied that be was a subtenant he could not be held to be a sub-tenant; and, as he bad failed to prove the assignment in his favour he was a mere trespasser. It therefore ordered his eviction on the ground that the benefit of s. 15(2) was available only to a sub-tenant. 'Me appellate Court, however, did not order the eviction of the tenants-in-chief. When the appellant took the matter to the High Court, in revision under s. 115, Civil Procedure Code, the High Court held, (i) that the appellate Court was not right in setting aside the finding that the appellant was a sub-tenant. and that the finding that the appellant was a sub-tenant stood unchallenged; but (ii) that the tenants and the sub-tenant, namely the appellant, were liable to be evicted because the rent was in arrear.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD :(1) Assuming that the finding that the appellant was a trespasser could not be assailed in revision, the High Court erred in not setting aside the decree for eviction, because, the appellate Court had no jurisdiction to pass any decree against a trespasser in a suit brought under s. 28. Such a decree against a trespasser could only be passed by an ordinary civil court in a regular suit under the Civil Procedure Code. It could not be passed by a Judge of the Small Causes Court before whom, as a special forum, a suit for eviction under s. 28 of the Act is brought. That section gives power to that Court to order eviction of a tenant (along with whom a sub-tenant will go) provided the provisions of s. 12 or s. 13 of the Act are satisfied. As far as the appellate Court was concerned,- though it was the Court of Extra Assistant Judge, its jurisdiction could not be wider than that of the trial Court. (347H; 348A-D].
 (2) Even on the assumption that the appellant was a sub- tenant the High Court should have held that the appellate Court had no jurisdiction 344 to order the appellant's eviction when there was no order evicting the tenants-in-Chief. [348G] Under the Act, the landlord cannot sue a sub-tenant alone for eviction. He has to sue the tenant, and if he succeeds against the tenant, the subtenant would be evicted along with the tenant-in-chief, unless he can take advantage of some provision of the Act. [348F] (3) It could not be said that the interest of the tenants- in-chief was determined by the notice given by the landlords, that thereupon the appellant, who was a sub- tenant, -became a tenant by virtue of s. 14 and that therefore, it was unnecessary to order the eviction of the tenants-inchief. [349D, F] Section 14 would come into play in favour of the sub-tenant only after the tenancy of the contractual tenant has been determined by notice and the contractual tenant has been ordered to be evicted under s. 28 of the Act on any of the grounds in ss, 12 or 13. Till that event happens, or till he gives up the tenancy himself, the interest of a tenant who may be a contractual tenant for purposes of s. 14 cannot be said to have been determined, that is, come to an end completely, in order to give rise to a tenancy between the pre-existing sub-tenant and the landlord. The interest of a tenant comes to an end completely only when he is not only no longer a contractual tenant but also when he has lost the right to remain in possession which s. 12 has given him and is thus no longer, even a statutory tenant. The words in s.
 14, namely "is determined for any Yea,-,on" mean, that the interest of the tenant "comes to an end completely." They do not mean a determination by notice as in s. 111(h) of the Transfer of Property Act. [349H; 350A-E] Anand Nivas (Pvt..) Ltd. v. Anandji Kalyanji Pedhi [1963] INSC 189; [1964] 4 S.C R. 892, explained.
 (4) The High Court was also not justified in interfering with the concurrent finding of fact of the lower courts that there were no arrears of rent.
