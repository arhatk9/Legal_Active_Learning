 The Appellant was a dealer in hides and skins at Madras. Up to March 31, 1959 sales tax on dealers in the State of Madras was leviable under the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939. The appellant's turnover for the assessment year 1958-59 thus stood charged with liability to pay tax as leviable under the 1939 Act. The 1939 Act was repealed by the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1959 which came into force on April 1, 1959. The appellant was assessed for the year 1958-59 on March 24, 1961. By an order dated August 16, 1962 the Appellate Assistant Commissioner while disposing of the appeal against the said assessment order enhanced the assessment under power conferred on him by s. 31 of the 1959 Act. The Tribunal accepted the contention of the assessee that the Appellate Assistant Commissioner had no power to enhance the assessment. The High Court in revision held that since under the 1939 Act the appellate authority while exercising its appellate powers had no power to enhance the assessment and the said immunity or protection was a vested right in the assessee, the same not having been taken away either expressly or by necessary implication by the 1959 Act, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner could not have enhanced the assessment. it further held that the immunity or protection was a right or privilege protected by s. 61(1) of the 1959 Act as amended in 1963, which amendment was retrospective in its operation. In appeal to this Court by certificate, 
HELD: (i) In the matter of assessment the purpose of the 1939 as well as the1959 Act is identical. That purpose was and is to see that neither theassessee is over assessed nor the State is deprived of the Revenue towhich it is entitled. Under the 1939 Act an aggrieved assessee could first appeal to the Appellate Authority and then to the Tribunal. Further he could on questions of law go up in revision to the High Court. Rule 13(1) of the Madras General Sales Tax Rules, 1939 prescribed that subject to the provisions of s. 11 any person aggrieved by any original order passed by the Assistant Commercial Tax Officer may appeal to the Commercial Tax Officer of the District. Thus the Commercial Tax Officer had both the powers of the appellate authority as well as the, special powers conferred on him under s. 12(1) of the 1939 Act. By the exercise of those two powers he could have confirmed, altered, amended or enhanced the assessment made. Under the 1959 Act the Appellate Assistant Commissioner who primarily took over the quasi-judicial functions of the Commercial Tax Officer was conferred with power not only to confirm, vary, or annul the assessment but also the power to enhance the assessment.
 The power conferred on him under 3-1-3Sup.C.I./72 578 s.31 of the 1959 Act combines to an extent both the appellate power as well as the special power the Commercial Tax officer had under s. 11 and s. 12(1) of the 1939 Act.
 Hence the changes effected by the 1959 Act in the machinery sections do not touch the substance of the matter. The 1959 Act merely simplified the procedure without touching the Substance of the right of the parties. [582C-583A] No assessee has any vested right in the procedure prescribed under the 1939 Act. So long as the new procedure laid down in the 1959 Act ,does not interfere with any of his vested rights, an assessee has no right to claim that his case must be dealt with under the provisions of the repealed Act. It is well settled that the new procedure prescribed by law gover ns all pending cases. The assessee in the present case filed its appeal under s. 31 of the 1959 Act and not under s. 11 of the 1939 Act. its right of appeal under the 1959 Act does not take away in any manner .any of its vested rights under the 1939 Act [585 B-C] The appeal must accordingly he allowed.
 Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Tax, Madras Division v. N.
 Balasundaram & Co. 14, S.T.C. 996, disapproved.
 Observations contra in Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Madras Division v. Sri S. Swami & Co., 13 S.T.C. 468, held incorrect.
 (Since it was held that no vested right of the assessee was infringed by the provisions of the 1959 Act the Court did not find it necessary to consider the meaning of the words 'any right privilege..... accrued......under the Act' in s.
 61 (1) (ii) (c) of the Act or to examine the scope of s. 61(2) thereof]
