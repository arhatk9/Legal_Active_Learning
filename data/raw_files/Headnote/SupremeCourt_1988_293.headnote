 The petitioners who have been convicted for the offence punishable under s. 302 of the Indian Penal Code and have been sentenced to life imprisonment, claim entitlement to the benefit of s. 5 of the Act.
 Dismissing the writ petitions, 
 HELD: The Punjab Borstal Act, 1926 does not have application to an offence punishable under s. 302 of the Indian Penal Code. [143G] The offence of murder is punishable with death even though the punishment awarded is not death but imprisonment for life. [144H] 'Punishable' in s. 2(4) of the Act carries a meaning 'liable to be punished'. Since the offence under s. 302 is punishable with death, the provisions of the Punjab Borstal Act would not cover an offence under s. 302 of I.P.C. and the benefit would not, therefore, be available to an accused convicted for the offence under s. 302 I.P.C. [145E] Subhash Chand v. State of Haryana & Ors., [1988] INSC 2; [1988I SCC 717 applied; Hava Singh v. State of Haryana & Anr., [1987] INSC 225; [1987] 4 SCC 207; State of Andhra Pradesh v. Vallabhapuram Ravi, [1984] INSC 169; [1984] 4 SCC 410 and Kunwar Bahadur & Ors. v. State of Uttar Pradesh, [1980] (Supp.) SCC 339, distinguished.
