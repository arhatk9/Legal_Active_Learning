 The Nagpur Handloom Cloth Market Company Ltd. constructed in the City of Nagpur on plots owned by it a number of buildings with two floors, the ground floor intended to be used as shops and the first floor to be used for residential purposes. For the use of the shops lavatories connected with the sewers of the corporation drainage system were constructed and water supply for the shops was obtained from a corporation water standards The corporation levied among other taxes, under s. 114 of the City of Nagpur Corporation Act, 1948, conservancy tax and water rates on the is of the letting value of 797 the buildings. Most of the shops were occupied by shop- keepers and in the year 1953 the corporation served notices of assessment on individual' shop-keepers of the respective shops. Some of the shop-keepers filed objections against the notices served on them and on rejection of these objections filed appeals under. ss. 387 and 130 of the Act but without success. Nearly two years after these proceedings the company and one of the shopkeepers filed a writ petition in the High Court of Bombay to quash the order of demand dated February 2, 1958, and to prohibit the Corporation from applying r. 10 (a) of the Assessment Rules.
 The High Court allowed the writ petition holding that r. 10 (a) applied only to residential houses and not to houses occupied for non-residential purpose-; and therefore separate assessment of the shops in the occupation of the shop. keepers was invalid. The contention of the Corporation that in view of the great delay in filing the petition, the petition should fail was rejected by the High Court. The present appeal came before this Court by way of special leave.
 Held, that the expression "building" in s. 5 (7) of the Act would include a part of a building. By reason of s. 5 (7) and the implication of r. 10 (a) and r. 10 (c) the Corporation is competent to treat each tenement occupied by a different person as a separate building for levy of tax.
 The expression 'family' in r. 10 (a) does not in the setting of the rules postulates the existence of relationship either by blood or by marriage between the persons residing in the tenement. Even a single person may be regarded for the purpose of the rule as a family and a master and servant would also be so regarded. The expression "occupying" in r.
 10 (a) applies equally to uses residential and non- residential.
