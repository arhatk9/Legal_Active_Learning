 By virtue of the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution the United Khasi Jaintia Hills District has been constituted into an autonomous district with a District Council. Para 3(1)(a) of the Schedule authorises the District Council to make laws "with respect to" "the allotment occupation or use, or the setting apart, of land", for the purposes mentioned therein. The District Council passed the United Khasi-Jaintia Hills District (Transfer of Land) Act, 1953 section 3 of which provided that "no land, within -the District shall be sold, mortgaged leased bartered gifted or otherwise transferred........ The preamble to the Act recited that it was "necessary to make provisions in the Autonomous District of the United Khasi Jaintia Hills with respect to the transfer, allotment, occupation or use of land for any purposes likely to promote the interests of the inhabitants thereof". On the question whether para 3(1)(a) of the Sixth Schedule confers on the District council power to make laws with respect to transfer of land, 
HELD : The subject of transfer is clearly beyond the scope of the law-making power conferred on the District Council by the Constitution and therefore, s. 3 of the impugned Act is void being beyond the jurisdiction of the District Council.
 The bracketing together of the words "allotment, occupation or use, or -setting apart of land" for the purposes mentioned therein without using words like "transfer" or "alienation" is clearly indicative of the Constitution makers' intention to restrict power of the District Council only to make laws with respect to actual use or occupation of the land allotted or set apart for the purposes stated therein. It was not intended to extend to "transfer of land". Nor can the words used in para 3(1)(a) of the Schedule be read as implying transfer. The purpose, object and scheme of making such provision for the hill areas also goes against inclusion of the power of transfer. And the addition, in the preamble to the Act, of the word "transfer" to the words allotment occupation or use of land" used in para 3 (1) (a) of the Schedule is indicative of an intent to enlarge the scope of the object and purpose of enacting the impugned Act beyond the limits of the power conferred by the Constitution. [404 G-H, 405 B, 404 B] It is clear from Para 12 of the Sixth Schedule read with para 3 (1) (a) that the District Councils, unlike the Parliament and the State Legislatures are not intended to be clothed with plenary power of legislation. Their power to make laws is expressly limited by the provisions of the Sixth Schedule which has created them and they can do nothing beyond the 399 limits which circumscribe their power. it is beyond the domain of the courts to enlarge constructively their power to make laws. [407 A-B] Further, the proviso to para 3(1)(a) merely serves to ensure that no law made by the Regional and District Councils with respect to allotment, occupation or use or setting apart, of land, as mentioned in that clause, shall have, the effect of preventing compulsory acquisition of land for public purposes, by the Government of Assam in accordance with the law in force authorising such acquisition. The proviso does not in any way after the operative effect of clause (a).
