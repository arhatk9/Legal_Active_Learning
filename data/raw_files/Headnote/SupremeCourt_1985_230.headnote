 The respondent-landlord filed a petition under 8- 12 read with 8- 16 of the U-P- Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent and Eviction) Act, 1972 against the appellant- tenant in respect of a shop situated in the district Of Bulandshahr. He claimed a declaration that the shop had fallen vacant and that it should be released to him on the ground that the appellant-tenant had sub-let the shop to one Yadram and had allowed it to be occupied by Yadram and his son Madan Lal, neither of whom was a member of the appellant's family. The prescribed Authority dismissed the respondent's petition, holding (i) that the respondent had failed to prove that the appellant had sub-let the shop and that it could be deemed to be vacant; and (ii) that the appellant had established that he was conducting his business of selling vegetables in the shop and that Madan Lal sat in on his behalf. An appeal by the respondent was also dismissed by the Second Additional District Judge, Bulandshahr. However, the High Court in a Writ Petition filed by the respondent, remanded the case to the prescribed Authority for passing orders on the respondent's application for release of the property from allotment on the ground that the appellant had been unable to establish any legal relationship of agency between himself and Madan Lal or Yadram and therefore it must be taken that it was Madan Lal who was occupying the shop within the meaning of S. 12 (l)(b) of the U.P. Act.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 635 ^ 
 HELD: 1. It is well known that a writ in the nature of certiorari may be issued only if the order of the inferior tribunal or subordinate court suffers from an error of jurisdiction or from a breach of the principles of natural justice or is vitiated by a manifest or apparent error of law. There is no sanction enabling the High Court to reappraise the evidence without sufficient reason in law and reach findings of fact contrary to those rendered by an inferior court or subordinate court. When a High Court proceeds to do so, it acts plainly in excess of its powers.
 [637 A-C] In the instant case, the finding is that Madan Lal sat in the shop conducting the vegetable selling business on behalf of the appellant. The findings of fact by both authorities rested-on evidence, and there was no warrant for disturbing that finding of fact in a writ petition. [636 G- H] 
 2. Under s. 12(1)(b) of the U.P. Act a tenant of a building is deemed to have ceased to occupy the building if he has allowed it to be occupied by any person who is not a member of his family. The occupation of a person envisaged here cannot possibly include the occupation by any person as the agent of the tenant. When a person sits in the premises and carries on a business on behalf of and for the original occupant, it cannot be said that the original occupant has thereby allowed the accommodation to be occupied within the meaning of s. 12 (l)(b).
