 The appellant-company, a manufacturer of footwear in Bombay, purchased rubber from certain dealers residing in the State of Cochin. The goods were shipped by the Cochin sellers from Cochin to Bombay under bills of lading in which the sellers themselves were named as consignees. The invoices however showed that the goods were shipped at the risk of the appellant which was to pay insurance as well as freight and other charges. For the period April 1, 1954 to March 31, 1955, the appellant was assessed to purchase tax under s. 10(a) of the Bombay Sales-tax Act (3 of 1953). The appellant's appeal under s. 30 of the Act failed. In a reference under s. 34(1) of the Act the High Court held that the property was intended by the parties to pass in Bombay and the appellant was liable to purchase tax. The appellant then came to this Court by special leave.
 It was contended on behalf of the appellant that (1) the property in the rubber consignments had passed to the appellant in Cochin, (2) the term 'person' in s. 10(a) should be read as meaning a 'dealer who carries on business in Bombay but who is not registered under the Act and (3) s.
 10-C and not s. 10(a) applied to the transactions in question.
 
HELD : (i) The ordinary rule that unascertained goods are unconditionally appropriated to the contract and property passes to the buyer on the delivery of the said goods to the common carrier, does not apply to cases where goods are shipped under a bill of lading. In the latter case delivery by the seller is not delivery to the buyer but to the Captain of the ship as bailor for delivery to the person indicated in the bill of lading. The seller may take the bill of lading to his own order. The effect of such a transaction would be to control the possession of the Captain as bailee and make him accountable for delivery of the goods to the seller. The seller thus keeps to himself the right of demanding possession from the Captain and this is consistent even with a special term that the, goods are shipped on account of and at the risk of the buyer. Section 25 of the Indian Sale of Goods Act itself states that where goods shipped are and by the bill of lading they are deliverable to the order of the seller or his agent, the seller is prima facie deemed to reserve the right of disposal. [848 E-G] Gabarron v. Kreeft. (1875) L.R. 10 Ex. 274, referred to.
 The fact that the goods were shipped at the risk of the buyer would not necessarily imply that property in the goods had passed to the 846 buyer, The endorsement to that effect in the invoice only indicated that the insurance charges were to be paid by the appellant. The clause had no bearing on the question of passing of title. [849 G-H] Shephered v. Harrison, 1871 L.R. (V) H.L. 116, relied on.
 (ii) There is nothing in the context or language of s. 10(a) for importing any qualification on the plain meaning of the word 'person' in that section. The section plainly states that purchases made by a dealer from a person who is not a registered dealer will be subject to purchase tax. The appellant was a dealer and it had made the purchases in question from sellers who were not registered dealers. The provisions of s. 10(a) of the Act were thus clearly attracted and the purchases were liable to tax. [852 F] (iii) The contention that s. 10-C governed the transactions in question could not be sustained. Section 10-C reproduces the Explanation to Art. 286(1)(a) of the Constitution and would apply only where under general law the sale takes place outside the State but the goods are delivered as a direct result of the sale for consumption within the State of Bombay.
