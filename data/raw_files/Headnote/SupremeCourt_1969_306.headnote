 The appellant informed the respondents, its workmen, of its decision to close its business. The reasons for the closure were : (i) financial condition of the appellant, (ii) nonavailability of orders for supply of goods; and (iii) non-cooperation of the respondents in certain matters. The dispute whether the closure was justified was referred to the Industrial Tribunal. The Tribunal held on the evidence : (1) that the appealed's undertaking was closed down completely and that there was a final and irrevocable termination of the business; (2) but that the closure. was not bona fide and was a lock out; and (3) that the closure was not due to unavoidable circumstances beyond the control of the appellant.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) In the case of a closure, the employer does not merely close down the place of business, but he closes the business finally and irrevocably. The closure has to be genuine bona fide and effective, and not a mere pretence.
 The motive however, behind the closure is immaterial. In the present case the circumstances showed that there had been in fact a closure of the business, and therefore, the further finding of the Tribunal that it was a lock-out should be set aside.
