 The appellant-Income-tax Officer issued a notice to the assessee company to show cause why an order under s. 23A of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 should not be made for the assessment year 1957-58. The assessee applied to the High Court for 'a writ to restrain the appellant from giving effect to the notice. The High Court held that an order un- der s. 23A of the Act after its amendment by the Finance Act, 1955, was an "order of assessment" to which the period of limitation prescribed by s. 34(3) applied and since such an order could not be made after the expiration of four years from the end of the assessment year 1957-58 the proceedings initiated against the; assessee in respect of the assessment year 1957-58 after March 31, 1962 was without jurisdiction.
 
HELD Section 23A is not a charging section and an order made thereunder is not an "order of assessment" to which the period of limitation prescribed by s. 34(3) applied.
 Section 23A before it was amended by Finance Act, 1955 was procedural. Section 23A(1), after it was amended by the Finance Act. 1955 provides within itself machinery for imposition of liability to pay additional super tax, but it has not on that account been made a charging section. A charge to tax arises under ss. 3, 4 and 5 of the Act for payment of income-tax and super tax and not under s. 23A.
 [47 E] Section 23A does not use the expression "assessment" in the body of cl. (1) : and to the title of the section after it was amended, viz. "Power to assess companies to super-tax on undistributed income in certain cases", it is impossible to give any exalted meaning so as lo convert what is an order directing payment of tax into an order of 'assessment within the meaning of s. 34(3) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922. Every order which contemplates computation of income for determination of the amount of tax payable is not an order of assessment within the meaning of the Act : -nor does prescribing of procedure for determining and imposing tax liability make it an order of assessment. 'Me Income- tax Act contemplates making of diverse orders by Income-tax Officers directing payments of sums of money by tax payers which are of the nature of orders for payment of tax, but still are not orders of assessment.
