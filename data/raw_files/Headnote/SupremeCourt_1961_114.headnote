 In order that an adoption may be valid under the Hindu Law there must be a formal ceremony of giving and taking. This is true of the regenerate castes as well as of the Sudras.
 Although no particular form is prescribed for the ceremony, the law requires that the natural parent shall hand over, the adoptive boy and the adoptive parent must receive him, the nature of the ceremony varying according to the circumstances. After exercising their volition to give and take the boy in adoption, the parents may, both or either of them, delegate the physical act of handing over or receiving to a third party.
 Consequently, in a case where the natural father merely sent the boy in another's company to the house of adoptive father who received him but there was no delegation of the power to give in adoption or the ceremony of giving and taking, 478 Held, that no valid adoption bad taken place.
