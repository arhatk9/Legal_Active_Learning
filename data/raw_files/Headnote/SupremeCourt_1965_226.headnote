 In pursuance of the recommendation of a Committee, appointed on a representation by the Tea Producers in the Cachar District to investigate into the difficulties of the Industry as a result of steep fall in prices, a notification was issued providing that there shall be no issue of food- stuffs at concessional rates and no cash compensation as such in lieu thereof, but the existing dearness allowance was raised temporarily for all estates in the district.
 Thereupon the condition of the industry which was on the verge of collapse improved; many gardens which had closed down started refunctioning and many of the workmen who were retrenched were taken back in employment. Upon rival contentions, the Industrial Tribunal held that, (i) the financial crisis was genuine and was not a result of any manipulation and that the management was entitled under cl.
 8(a)(i) and (iii) of the Standing orders to lay off the workmen for an indefinite period, (2) the management was also entitled to. retrench workmen under cl. 9 of the Standing orders, and (3) even if the lay off and retrenchment were bona fide and justified, the workmen were entitled to a reasonable compensation, and the Tribunal fixed the quantum of compensation. In appeal to this Court :
 
HELD : (i) The lay off in the present case, was justified by cl. 8 (a) (i) and (iii) of the Standing orders. The last part of cl. 8 (a) (i) which refers to "other cases beyond his control" would cover a case of sudden slump in the world market and consequent financial difficulties of the tea industries [350 B] Workmen of Dewan Tea Estate v. Their Management. [1963] INSC 229; [1964] 5 S.C.R. 548, distinguished.
 (ii) The management had also the additional power to retrench workmen under cl. 9 of the standing orders. [350 C] (iii) In the present case, the Tribunal had not committed any error of law or legal principle in deciding the amount of compensation. [351 G] The quantum of compensation is a matter primarily for the Tribunal to estimate and it is not open to this Court to go into this question unless it is shown that the Tribunal has committed any error of law or legal principle indeciding it.
