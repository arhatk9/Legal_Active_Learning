 The appellant, a qualified medical practitioner, was convicted for nine gruesome, murders of his friend, the latter's wife, aged parents, two sons and three daughters of the age of 16, 13, 8, 5 and 3 respectively, entirely on circumstantial evidence and was sentenced to death. The entire family was exterminated due to greed for cash, ornaments and other valuables. The Sessions and the High Court gave convincing and special reasons for passing the death sentence.
 Dismissing the special leave which is limited to the question of sentence, the Court, 
HELD : Law directs the course of the court. After enactment of the Criminal Procedure Code in 1973 (Act 2 of 1974), the judgment in a murder case "shall state the special reasons" for a sentence of death, only in special cases with recording of reasons so that these may be examined by superior courts. None of the guidelines indicated by this court in several decisions in this is problem area of life and death as a result of judicial verdict can be cut and dry nor exhaustive. Each case will depend upon the totality of the facts and circumstances and other matters revealed. In the instant case the horrid enormity of the crime with a deliberate motive of wrongful gain cannot be minimised when considering the appropriate sentence. The special reasons mandated under the law are duly recorded by both the High Court and the Trial Court and those are adequate to justify the sentence of death in these cruet and diabolical murders [561 E-F, 562 F]
