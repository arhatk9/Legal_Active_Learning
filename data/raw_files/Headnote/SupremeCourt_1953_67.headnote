 The assessee, the Royal Western India Turf Club Ltd. was formed inter alia for the purpose of carrying on the business of a race course company in all its branches and to establish clubs, hotels and other convenience in connection with the property of the company. It had two classes of members, club members, whose number was limited to 350 and stand members who were elected by ballot. Every member Paid an entries fee and an annual subscription. The liability of the members was limited by guarantee and if there was any surplus on winding up, it was to be paid to the members in equal shares. An admission fee was levied from the members for admission to the Members' Enclosure, and from non- members for admission to the other Enclosures, and in each Enclosure there was a totalisator. The money's received from members as well as non-members were included in one pool and distributed amongst the holders of the winning tickets. In each Enclosure refreshments were supplied on payment. The company admitted that moneys realised from non-members were receipts from business and taxable, but contended that the following items of receipts received from members were not assessable to income-tax, viz., (1) season 0admission tickets from members, (2) daily admission gate tickets from members, (3) use of private boxes by members (4) income from entries and forfeits received from members whose horses did not run. The High Court of Bombay held that items 1, 2 and 3 did not fall either under s. 10(1) or s. 10(6) of the Income-tax Act and were therefore not taxable, but item 4 fell within s. 10(1) and s. 10(6) and was taxable. The Commissioner of Income-tax appealed;
 Held, (i) that the principles of Styles' case as explained by subsequent cases had no application to the company as there was no mutual dealing between the members inter se in the nature of mutual insurance and no contribution to a common fund put up for payment of liabilities undertaken by each contributor to the other contributors, and no refund of surplus to the contributors, but on the other hand, the company realised moneys both from the members and non-members for the same consideration, namely, by the giving of the same or similar facilities to all alike in the course of one and the same business carried on by it;
 (ii)that, as the company was formed for carrying on a business it had dealings with its members also in the ordinary course of business, and give the same or similar amenities to members and non-members, and there were no mutual dealings between the members or a common fund for the discharge of common obligations to each other, the principle applicable to the surplus of contributions made by members of a club for Providing themselves with amenities was also not applicable to the case;
 (iii) a "trade association" means an association of tradesmen businessmen or manufacturers for their common protection and advancement, and the assessee was not therefore "a trade or similar association" within s. 10(6) of the Income-tax Act;
 291 (iv) that all the abovementioned 4 item of receipts from members were received by the company from business carried on by it with its members within the meaning of s. 10(1) and none of them was received by the company as a trade, profes- sional or similar association within the meaning of s.
 10(6), and ail the items were accordingly assessable to income-tax.
