 Three private limited companies in which the assessee held shareswent into voluntary liquidation in December 1959, ID the course of the liquidation proceedings the liquidators made distribution in the year of account relevant to the assessment year 1961-62, and the assessee company got cash or assets in lieu of the amounts due in respect of the three companies. The Revenue took the view that by reason of the distribution of assets of the three private companies under liquidation by the liquidators there had been a capital gain which was assessed by the Income-tax Officer at Rs.
 95,944/-. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner upheld the order of the Income-tax Officer. He took the view that the surplus arose out of the exchange of shares held by the assessee company in the three companies and therefore the surplus ought to be brought to tax. In further appeal the Tribunal held that there was no exchange or transfer of shares and assets in question but the transaction could be viewed as a relinquishment. The High Court held, in reference, that where a liquidator distributes the assets of the company which has gone into voluntary liquidation he is performing a legal function and there is no element of sale,, transfer, exchange or relinquishment involved in such distribution. The Revenue appealed to this Court, Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) The distribution of the assets of the companies in liquidation does not amount to a transaction of sale, exchange, relinquishment or transfer so as to attract section 12B of the Act. When a shareholder receives money representing his share on distribution of the net assets of the company in liquidation, he receives that money in satisfaction of the right which belonged to him by virtue of his holding the shares and not by operation of any transaction which amounts to sale, exchange, relinquishment or transfer. In the circumstances it was difficult to bold that the assessee company was liable to pay tax on capital gains as contemplated by section 12B of the Act in respect of the amount of Rs. 95,944/- [667D] (ii) If the language of subsection (1) of section 12B of the Act is clear and does not warrant the inference that distribution of assets on liquidation of a company constitutes sale, transfer or exchange the said transaction of distribution of assets would not change its character and acquire the attributes of sale, transfer or exchange because of the omission of a clarification in the first proviso to sub-section (1) of section 12B of the Act, even though such a clarification was there in 663 the third proviso of the section inserted by the earlier Act (Act 22 of 1947). it is well settled that considerations stemming from legislative history must ,not be allowed to override the plain words of a statute. A proviso cannot be construed is enlarging the cope of an enactment when it can be fairly and property construed without attributing to it that effect. Further if the language of the enacting part of the statute is plain and unambiguous and does not contain the provisions which are said to occur in it, one cannot derive those provisions by implication from a proviso.
