 The workmen claimed bonus for the years 1952-53 and 1953-54.
 The employers contended that on a proper working 1003 out of the Full Bench formula there 'was no available surplus and so no bonus was payable. The Tribunal held that the formula was not binding on it and on genuine considerations Of social justice it rejected the claim of the employers for rehabilitation and awarded bonus at the rate of and I/3 annual basic wages for 1952-53 and 1953-54 respectively. Alternatively, the Tribunal found that in case the claim for rehabilitation had to be allowed there would be no available surplus in either of the relevant years.
 Held that, the Tribunal was bound to give effect to the Full Bench formula and to allow the employer's claim for rehabi- litation.
 A.C.C. Ltd., Bombay v. Their Workmen, [1959] S.C.R. 925, followed.
 In the calculations made by the Tribunal on its alternative finding it had acted on correct principles. It had rightly taken into account the price level prevailing in 1956 and not merely that prevailing in the two bonus years. The amount of rehabilitation allowed in previous years had to be brought into account if it had not been used up but it was not shown that had not been in the present case.
 In calculating the average life of the buildings, machinery, etc., the method of weighted average was scientifically more accurate and gave a more accurate and realistic result. The rehabilitation costs of those assets which had spent their lives and were exhausted was also admissible in making calculations under the weightage method if in the relevant year such assets were in existence and use.
