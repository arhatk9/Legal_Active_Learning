 The appellant, a goldsmith, while travelling in a train from Calcutta was searched and found to be in possession of gold weighing 290.6 tolas valued at Rs. 29,835. The gold was seized as it was reasonably believed to be smuggled gold.
 After service of a show cause notice and after due enquiry the Collector passed an order for the confiscation of the gold under s. 167(8) of the Sea Customs Act. The appellant contended that the presumption under s. 178A of the Act could not be raised as on the facts of this case there could be no reasonable belief that the gold was smuggled gold, that the gold could not be confiscated as the appellant was not the importer thereof and that s, 167(8) was not applicable to the facts of the case.
 Held, that the order of confiscation of the gold was validly and properly made.
 Section 178A of the Act imposed the burden of proving that the gold was not smuggled gold on the appellant if it was seized under the Act in the reasonable belief that it was smuggled gold. Though the question whether there was a reasonable belief or not was justiciable, the Court was not sitting in appeal over the decision of the officer and all it could consider was whether there were ground which prima facie justified the reasonable belief. The facts that a large quantity of gold was recovered from the appellant, that the authorities had precise information about the appellant and that he was travelling without a ticket were sufficient to justify the reasonable belief.
 Section 167(8) of the Sea Customs Act provided for the confiscation of any goods the importation of which was pro- hibited or restricted if they were imported contrary to the prohibition or restrictions For the confiscation of the goods it was not required that they should be necessarily found with the person concerned with their importation.
 867 Under s. 8(1) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947, the Government of India issued a notification in 1948 which prohibited the bringing. into India of gold from outside except with the general or special permission of the Reserve Bank. Section 23A of this Act provided that the restrictions imposed under s.8 thereof shall be deemed to have been imposed under s.19 of the Sea, Customs Act. Thus the 1948 notification had the force of a notification under s. 19 of the Sea Customs Act and gold imported in contravention thereof was liable to be seized under s. 178 and rendered the gold liable for proceedings under s.
 167(8). Since the gold was smuggled gold in view of the statutory presumption under s.178A it was properly confiscated under s. 167(8).
