 The accused,a compounder in a hospital was charged with the offence under s. 328 I. P. C., of administering poison to one of the two doctors of the hospital. He was acquitted by the trial court but found guilty by the High Court.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The critical rule of proof by circumstantial evidence, is that such testimony can be the probative basis for conviction only if one rigorous test is satisfied, namely, that the circumstances must make so strong a mesh that the innocence of the accused is wholly excluded and on every reasonable hypothesis the guilt of the accused must be the only inference. Every evidentiary circumstance is a probative link, strong, or weak, and must be made out with certainty. Link after link forged firmly by credible testimony may form a strong chain of sure guilt binding the accused. Each link, taken separately, may just suggest but when hooked on to the next and on again may manacle the accused inescapably. Only then can a concatenation of incriminating facts suffice to convict a man. If a reasonable doubt arises regarding the guilt of the accused, benefit of that doubt cannot be withheld from him. But proof beyond reasonable doubt cannot be distorted into a doctrine of acquittal when any delicate or remote doubt flits past a feeble mind. [61 1E, G-H, 612A-B] In the present case, the accused bore a grudge against the victim. When he was requested by the victim to bring aspirin he brought it in two packets. There were traces of strychnine crystals in the paper of the packet from which the victim had swallowed what he thought was aspirin, and an analysis of the stomach wash showed that he had consumed strychnine. The accused falsely denied that there was any stock of strychnine, He took a quarter of an hour to get the aspirin, suggesting that he went into the store room to take out a little strychnine. The circumstance that the two packets contained different substances-aspirin in one and strychnine in another-shows that the accused took the powders from 2 different bottles, eliminating the possibility of an accident. When another doctor asked him a searching question about the aspirin the accused was seen to be trembling. The accused never showed any anxiety to save the victim. In the commital court he took a false plea of denial and modified his plea in the Sessions Court to present a plausible defence. These circumstances lead to the only reasonable inference that he is guilty, and the other likelihoods are mere possibilities. [612C-G] S.S. Bobade v.
