 The Government of Maharashtra passed a resolution on 23.5.1974 providing for reservation for certain section of backward classes at the stage of promotion in the service under the State. The appellant Corporation adopted that reservation policy in its Resolution No. 567 dated I2.9.1975. That resolution, however, could not be brought into force immediately. The Corporation passed Resolution No. 1652 on 4.3.l977 making the Resolution No. 5677 applicable with effect from 23.5.1974.
 Respondent No. 1, who belonged to one of the backward classes, was promoted to the higher post on 21.3.1977 in pursuance of the said resolution. She instituted a writ petition in the High Court seeking a direction to the appellant Corporation to promote her with effect from 23.5.1974, which was accepted by the Single Judge. An appeal therefrom was dismissed by the Division Bench.
 In this appeal by special leave it was contended for the appellant Corporation: (i) that the High Court was wrong in issuing direction to promote the first respondent with effect from 23.5.1974 since that would have the effect of disturbing the promotions made between23.5.1974 and 21.3.1977, and (ii)that in any event the promotions made prior to 12.9.1975 could not be disturbed and that the first respondent could not be promoted from a date earlier than 1.9.1975.
 Modifying the writ issued by the High Court, 
 HELD: The 1st respondent shall be deemed to have bee promoted with effect from 12.9. 1975 and not from 23.5.1974, as directed by the High Court. [684C-D] PG NO 679 PG NO 680 The Government Resolution dated 23.5.1974 did not come into force as far as the services under the Corporation were concerned on the date on which it was passed by the Government. It could only come into effect after the Corporation passed its resolution on 12.9.1975. When once the Corporation passed the resolution dated 12.9.1975 any promotion made thereafter in the services of the Corporation could only be made subject to the reservation policy adopted by the Corporation. [683B-C] The mere fact that there was some delay in the collection of statistics and other particulars necessary for giving effect to the resolution dated 12.9.1975 could not have the effect of denying the benefit of the reservation to the employees belonging to the backward classes concerned with effect from 12.9.1975. [683D] Though service conditions of employees could be modified retrospectively, no modification which would have the effect of depriving them of their vested rights can be made retrospectively except under a valid law. No such law is placed before the Court in the instant case. The seniority of the employees who had been lawfully promoted between 23.5.1974 and l2.9.1975, therefore, cannot be disturbed.
