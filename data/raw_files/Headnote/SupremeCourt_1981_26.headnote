 Allowing the appeal and answering against the respondent municipality both on the question of title and adverse possession, the Court.
 ^ 
 HELD: 1. The order of remand by the High Court being an interlocutory judgment which did not terminate the proceedings, it is open to the appellant to assail even the first judgment of the High Court and if it is held that the first judgment was legally erroneous, then all the subsequent proceedings, namely, the order of remand, the order passed after remand, the appeal and the second judgment given by the High Court in appeal against the order of remand would become non est. [767 D-F, 767 A-B] Keshardeo Chamria v. Radha Kissen Chamria & Ors. and (vice versa) [1952] INSC 52; [1953] SCR 136; Satyadhyan Ghosal & Ors. v.
 Smt. Deorajin Debi & Anr. [1960] INSC 81; [1960] 3 SCR 590, followed.
 2: 1 All that the law of adverse possession requires is that the possession must be continuous, open and without any attempt at concealment. It is not necessary that the possession must be effective so as to bring it to the specific knowledge of the owner. Such a requirement may be insisted on where an ouster of title is pleaded, but that is not so in the instant case. [768 B-C] 2:2. If a person asserts a hostile title even to a tank and despite the hostile assertion of title no steps were taken by the owner to evict the trespasser, his title by prescription would be complete after thirty years. [769 F-G] 
 3. The High Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the second appeal or findings of fact even if it was erroneous.
 In the instant case, the High Court clearly exceeded its jurisdiction under Section 100 of the Civil Procedure Code in reversing concurrent findings of fact given by the trial court and by the appellate court.
