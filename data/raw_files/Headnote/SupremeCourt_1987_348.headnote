 % The petitioners were convicted and sentenced by the General Court Martial under the Army Act, 1950 and lodged in Civil Jails. They sought a set-off of their pre-trial detention against the sentence of imprisonment. The jail and army authorities rejected their claim. They moved this Court for relief by writ petitions.
 Dismissing the petitions, the Court, ^ 
 HELD: The petitioners have been convicted and sentenced under the Army Act. The Army Act is a special enactment containing elaborate procedure for the trial of the persons covered thereunder. In view of the various provisions in the Army Act, the petitioners cannot call into aid section 428 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. They may be entitled to remissions as provided in the jail manuals but not a set-off under sec. 428. The benefit of section 428 cannot be claimed by a person convicted and sentenced by a Court-Martial under the Army Act, as held by the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Bhagwan Singh v. The Asstt. Superintendent, [1977] 79 Punjab Law Journal 19. The High Courts of Delhi and Madras have also held likewise. But in Subramonian v. O.C. Armoured Static Workshop, [1979] Crl. L.J. 617-a contrary view has been taken by the Kerala High Court which cannot be said to have laid down the law correctly. [42G-H; 43A-C]
