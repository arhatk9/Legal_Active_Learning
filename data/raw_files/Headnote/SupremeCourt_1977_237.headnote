 The appellant was prosecuted under section 471 read with section 461 and section 408 and 477A of the I.P.C. According to the prosecution there is a Rosary Cooperative Housing Society Limited, in Bombay. It owns a building having 48 Rats. Doongaji was elected as the Chairman of the Managing Committee of the Society. Mr. K N. Singh was working as the figure-head Secretary of the Society. The Society had a Bank Account which was operated jointly by Doongaji and K.
 N. Singh. One B. A. Sagar was working as the estate Manager of the Society and he retired due to old age. The appellant, who was working as Accounts Clerk in Sir Dorabji Tata Trust was appointed by Doongaji as an Honorary Accountant of the Society. A bill for Rs. 7.50 was submitted by M/s A. G. R. Patni & Co. The bill was forged by adding the figure 160 before the figure 7 inflating the amount to Rs. 1607.50 in figures without altering the amount in words. The prosecution case further was that an inflated voucher/receipt was also brought into existence. The prosecution case further was that for the sake of convenience and facility of work a practice was followed in the Society that at a time about 8 to 10 blank cheques used to be signed by Doongaji and Singh and these used to remain with the appellant who used one of such cheques for making purported payment of- the inflated bill on the strength of the inflated voucher/receipt but converted to his own use the proceeds thereof. The prosecution case further was that the appellant wilfully find with an Intent to defraud falsified the books of account of the Society, namely, the cash book by making therein a false debit entry.
 The defence of the appellant was that there was no practice to keep in his custody. the cheque book of the Society containing blank cheques signed by Doongaji and K. N. Singh.
 According to him the amount of Rs. 1607.50 was paid in cash by him to Sagar P.W. 2 on the instruction from Doongaji.
 The Trial Court came to the conclusion that the prosecution had failed to establish any of the charges against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. The Trial Court observed that though there was a ring of plausibility and possibility in the case of prosecution in respect of the charges levelled against the appellant conviction could not be based merely on possibilities unless the charges were established against an accused beyond reasonable doubt.
 In appeal, the High Court reversed the acquittal recorded in favour of the accused and convicted him of all the charges that were levelled against him. The High Court, however, imposed only one day's imprisonment and a fine of Rs.
 2000/-.
 The appellant contended (1) The High Court had erred in interfering with the acquittal,recorded by the Trial Court. The High Court before reversing the acquittal should have given cogent reasons for rejecting the reasoning of the Trial Court.
 Reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in Rajendra Prasad v. State of Bihar.
 (2) The entire prosecution case was based on the theory that about 8 to 10 blank cheques at a time signed by Doongaji' and K. N. Singh used to be kept in the custody of the appellant. The Trial Court rightly rejected that theory.
 4 80 (3) The Trial Court rightly held that the reasons which Sagar mentioned why he handed over the bill of Rs. 7.50 to the appellant were unacceptable.
 The Counsel for the respondent contended (1) The reasons given by the Trial Court while recording the acquittal .were clearly found to be erroneous by the High Court and High Court had given proper reasons for reversing such acquittal.
 (2) The High Court was right in coming to the conclusion that the prosecution had established its case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt and therefore, rightly interfered with the order of acquittal passed by the Trial Court.
 Dismissing the appeal 
HELD 1. Rajendra Prasad's decision related to a case dealing with direct testimony of witnesses whereas the instant case could not be treated as a case where direct testimony of witnesses was required to be appreciated. [487FG] Rajendra Prasad v. State of Bihar, [1977] INSC 69; (1977) 2 SCC 205;
 distinguished.
 Vasisdeo Kulkarni v. Surya Kant, Bhatt and Anr., (1977) 2 SCC 208; reiterated.
 The High Court rightly convicted the petitioner for the following reasons (i) It was the duty, of the appellant to write and maintain books of accounts of the Society. [488E] (ii)It was not disputed that Patni & Co. had submitted the 'bill for Rs. 7,50 and had received neither Rs. 1607.50 nor Rs. 7.50.
 [488F] (iii)Any one who came across the bill of Rs.
 7.50 would have knowledge and reason to believe that the same was forged. [488G] (iv)The voucher bore forged signature of Sagar and forged initials of Doongaji whose evidence corroborated the Handwriting Expert's opinion. [489A] (v) There was a practice of both Doongaji and K. N. Singh signing the blank cheques and keeping them with the appellant. [491A-B] (vi)The oral evidence is corroborated by the documentary evidence.
 [492E] (vii)But for the fact that the blank cheques were signed beforehand there was no need to write under verbal orders of Mr. RDD", in the counter foil of the cheque book. [492G-H] (viii)The Trial Court overlooked important aspect of the case and therefore the High Court was justified in having a reappraisal of the evidence and coming to its own conclusions. [495F-G] (ix)There was ample evidence to prove that the appellant bad mis-_appropriated the proceeds of the bearer cheques after the same were handed over to him by the peon Shivram Lad.
