 The appellant manufactured and supplied a large quantity of bricks to a company under a contract according to the specifications contained in it. The contract provided that land would be given by the company to the appellant free for providing earth for the manufacture of the bricks.
 Held that the supplies constituted a sale of goods and were liable to be subjected to sales tax. The proper interpre- tation of the contract was that the earth supplied by the company to the appellant became the latter's property and that the bricks that the appellant manufactured were also his property and these brick,; were what he sold to the company under the contract and the contract was not, therefore, one only for labour supplied or work done.

 Nor was the contract one of work done and materials found.
 Whether a contract is one of work done and materials found or one for sale of goods depends on its essence. If not of its essence that a chattel should be produced and transferred as a chattel,, then it may he a contract for work done and materials found and not a contract for sale of goods. The contract in this case no doubt required the appellant to bestow a certain amount of skill and labour in the manufacture of bricks but the object of the contract nevertheless remained the delivery of bricks manufactured, as chattel.
