 Sub-section (3) of 8.33 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 provides that no employer shall, during the pendency of any proceeding in respect of an industrial dispute, take action against any protected workman concerned (a) by altering, to his prejudice the conditions of service applicable to him immediately before the commencement of such proceedings, or (b) by discharging or punishing, whether by dismissal or otherwise, such protected workman, save with the express permission in writing of the authority before which the proceeding is pending. F The appellant, a protected workman, was found guilty after a disciplinary enquiry of the act of misconduct alleged to have been committed by him. The management made an application before the Industrial Tribunal under sub- s.(3) of 8.33 of the Act for permission to dismiss him. He was, however, suspended from service with effect from August 13, 1979 pending disposal of the application but without any wages or allowances. The appellant thereupon filed a col plaint before the Tribunal under 8. 33A of the Act alleging violation 1060 Of s.33 by the management. In the standing orders governing the appellant there was no provision for payment of any subsistence allowance during the pendency of an application under 8.33(3). The Tribunal while disposing of both the applications granted permission to the management to dismiss the appellant from service.
 In these appeals by special leave it was contended for the appellant that the permission accorded to the management was vitiated as the non-payment of subsistence allowance had resulted in denial of reasonable opportunity to the appellant to defend himself effectively before the Tribunal in the proceedings under s.33(3) of the Act.
 Allowlng the appeal, the Court, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The workman against whom an application is made under s.33(3) of the Industrial DisputeY Act, 1947 should be paid reasonable amount by way of subsistence allowance to enable him to maintain himself and the members of his family, and also to meet the expenses of litigation before the Tribunal. If no amount is paid during the pendency of such an application, the workman concerned can be said to have been denied a reasonable opportunity to defend himself in the proceedings before the Tribunal. Such denial leads to violation of the principles of natural justice and consequently vitiates the proceedings before the Tribunal and any decision given in those proceedings against the workman concerned.[l066 B-D] 
 2. A workman does not cease to be a workman until the Tribunal grants permission under 9.33(3) of the Act to dismiss him and the management does so pursuant to such permission.[l065 B-C] An order of suspension by itself does not put an end to the employment. The workman continues to be an employee during the period of suspension. Though such an order prevents the employee from rendering his services but that does not put an end to the relationship of master and servant between the management and the workman.

 3. If the order passed at the conclusion of a domestic enquiry is only one of suspension (even though the management has decided to dismiss him) where the workman has a chance of being reinstated with back wages on the permission being refused under 8.33(3) of the Act, it cannot be said that the workman is not entitled to any monetary relief at all. In such a case the right of the workman to receive 8 Q reasonable amount, which may be fixed either by the standing orders or in the absence of any standing order by the authority before which the application is pending by was of subsistence allowance during the pendency of the application under 8.33(3) of the Act, with effect from the date of suspension should be implied as a term of the contract of employment. [1070 D-F] 
 4. The case falling under 8.33(1) of the Act is not in any way different from a case falling under sub-s.(3) of 8.33 and in both these cases previous permission of the authority concerned should be obtained before any action is taken against the workman concerned. In a case where the proceedings are completed and the order of dismissal is successfully challenged on the ground of non-payment of subsistence allowance for the period of suspension during the pendency of the application under 8.33(1) or 8.33(3) of the Act, it shall be open to the management to ask for the permission of the authority again under 8. 33(1) or 8.33(3) of the Act after paying or offering to pay to the workman concerned within a reasonable time to be filed by the authority the arrears of subsistence allowance. [1071 A-D] F In the instant case, no material has been placed before the Court to show that the appellant had sufficient means to defend himself before the Tribunal. He has not been paid even the barest subsistence allowance during the pendency of the application under 8.33(3) of the Act. Having regard to the circumstances of the case, grant of an opportunity to the management to apply for permission again under s. 33(3) of the Act is declined. The punishment of dismissal i posed on the appellant appears to be excessive. The order/award of the Tribunal is set aside. The application made by the management H 1062 under s. 33(3) of the Act 18 dismissed, and the complaint filed by the appellant under s. 33A of the Act accepted. The management is directed to reinstate the appellant in service with effect from the date of suspension and to pay him all the wages and allowances, as if there was no break in the continuity of his service.
