 The appellant Company which was engaged in the manufacture of aluminium products, entered into a contract with another company in Montreal, Canada, for the supply of technical know-how etc. for the development of its production. This agreement provided for payment of a retainer fee by the appellant on an annual basis and there was no, condition or stipulation that the fee would be payable by the assessee without deduction of income tax. In 1951 the Income Tax Officer treated the assessee as being in default under section 18(7) of the Income Tax Act, 1922 in respect of a sum of Rs. 1,24,199 which the appellant was liable to deduct from the payments made to the Montreal Company under the provisions of sections 18(3-A), 18(3-B) and 18(3-C). The appellant was- required to pay this amount and the Montreal Company refused to accept its claim for reimbursement. The appellant claimed the amount as a deduction from its business income under S. 10(1) or 10(2)(xi) or 10(2)(xv) of the Act. Although this claim was allowed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, the Tribunal, in appeal, held that the amount in question was neither expenditure incidental to the business nor was it wholly and exclusively laid out for that purpose; and nor was it claimable as a bad debt in view of the fact that it had not been incurred as a trade debt in the course of the business.
 The High Court. upon a reference made to it, held against the assessee. On appeal to this Court, 
HELD : Dismissing the appeal, (i) It is well settled that a business or trading debt should spring directly from the carrying on of a business or trade and should be incidental to it and it cannot be just any loss sustained by the assessee even if it has some connection with his business. [355 E] Although the retainer fees were paid by the assessee to the Montreal Company for technical assistance which had a connection with the business of the assessee it was not possible to regard 'the amount which the assessee was bound to deduct from the payment made to the Montreal Company under s. 18(3-B) of the Act and which it failed to recover from that company, as a debt which could be deducted under s. 10(2) (xi). The debt was not incidental to the business because it arose out of noncompliance with the provisions of the Act. The payment which the assessee made to the income tax authorities and which it failed to recover from the Montreal Company was more a matter of commercial expediency and proceeded out of motives of business relationship, because the assessee was anxious not to annoy or offend the Montreal Company So as to avail of its continued technical assistance and advice. [355 G] 352 A. V. Thomas & Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax, 48 I.T.R. 67 at p. 75, referred to.
 (ii) The assessee was presumed to know the relevant provisions of the Act at the time when it entered into an agreement with the Montreal Company. There was no provision in the agreement with the Montreal Company which created a contractual obligation on the assessee to make payment of the taxes deductible under s. 18(3-B). A payment made under a statutory obligation, because the assessee was in default, could ;lot constitute. expenditure laid out for the purpose of the assessee's business and was not therefore deductible under s. 10(2) (xv).
