 The High Court quashed the appointment of the second respondent as Presiding Officer of an Industrial Tribunal on the ground that he was not an Additional District Judge for three years as -required by s. 7A(3)(aa) of the Industrial Disputes Act. In appeal to this Court,, the appellant-State contended that though the respondent did not work as Additional District Judge, for the full period of three years he satisfied the -requirement of the section, since, while officiating as Registrar of the High Court he held the office of an Additional District Judge.
 
HELD : The second respondent was duly qualified for appointment under s. 7A(3)(aa) of the Industrial Disputes Act. To satisfy the requirements of the section it was not necessary that the person must have actually worked as an Additional District Judge for that period. [487 B] Section 7A(3)(aa) inserted by the Central Act prevails over cl. (aa) of s. 7A(3) of the Assam Amendment to the Industrial Disputes Act and it does not require any consultation with the High Court regarding appointment to a Tribunal. [487 D-E] Though the respondent was the Presiding Officer of a Labour Court he was not qualified otherwise for appointment under s. 7A(3), because a Labour Court is not a Tribunal within the meaning of s. 7A(3) (b) read with s. 2(r).
