 The appellant's house in Allahabad was let out to the State Government for a period of five years. Soon after the expiry of the period of lease in September 1969 the District Magistrate passed an order under s.3 of the U.P. (Temporary) Accommodation Requisition Act 1947 requisitioning the house to provide accommodation to a public servant. The appellant was asked to hand over possession of the house 'Within 24 hours after the expiry of 15 days from the date of the service of the order on him. He challenged the order in a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution on the ground that the order was issued without issuing any notice to him and without giving him a hearing. The High Court dismissed the petition taking the view that since the house was taken away from the appellant's use for a temporary period only he did not stand deprived of his property, and, therefore a detailed procedure was not necessary. The appellant filed an appeal in this Court by special leave.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : Although s.3.of the Act does not contain an express provision for notice and hearing before the making of the requisitioning order. such a provision is to be read there by necessary implication. The object of the provision is to requisition an immovable property. Requisitioning of the property deprives the owner of the property of the right to hold and enjoy the property as lie likes. The right to hold and enjoy the property is a cherished right. It is difficult to assume that the legislature would have intended to deprive him of his cherished right without notice and hearing. [613C] Under the main part of s.3, the District Magistrate, after making up his mind as to the existence of a public purpose to warrant the making of an order of requisition,, has to decide whether, in view of that public purpose, he has to requisition a particular accommodation. He has to consider the suitability of the accommodation in the light of its location, size and compensation payable. These are objective factors, and, there is no reason why the District Magistrate should not hear the owner of the accommodation proposed to be requisitioned on these matters. Under the first proviso to the section, the District Magistrate has to consider whether the building or part of a building is used for religious worship. Under the second proviso the District Magistrate is to see whether suitable alternative accommodation is available for the person in actual possession of the property. These matters cannot be fairly and satisfactorily determined without giving a hearing to the owner or the person in occupation of the property. [613 H-614 G] It is necessary to bear in mind that the Act does not provide for any appeal or revision from the order of the District Magistrate under s.3. The District Magistrate is constituted the plenary authority. It seems reason- 611 able to think that the legislature intended that an order under s-3 should be made after notice and hearing, so that no unfairness is done to anyone.
 An elaborate procedure is not necessary. The barest minimum, however is a fair hearing. Notice should be given to the person who will be affected by the order of requisition asking him to show cause why his accommodation should not be requisitioned. He should be given reasonable time to file his reply to the notice. In some cases it may be necessary to give him an opportunity of producing his oral and documentary evidence. [615B] The contention that since an order under s.3 is administrative it is not necessary to hear the affected party could not be accepted. This Court, in Kraipak held that rules of ,natural justice will apply to administrative enquiries. The decisions in Daud Ahmad and K. R. Err v hold that in an enactment which deprives a person of his property, there 'is necessarily implied the pre-requisite of a hearing. [617F] The order of requisition in the present case having been made without a heating must be held to be illegal.
