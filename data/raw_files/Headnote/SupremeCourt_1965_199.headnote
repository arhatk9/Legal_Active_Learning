 By incorporating Ch. XXII-A in the Indian Income-tax Act, 1961 an annuity deposit scheme was introduced requiring certain classes of taxpayers in the high income group to make deposits at specified rates on the adjusted total income with the Central Government. The amount deposited is made retumable with interest in annual instalments and the instalment is taxable in the year of refund. The tax-payer has the option not to make the deposit, but in that case he has to pay tax on his total income and fifty per cent of the amount saved by not making the deposit. A tax payer who is more than seventy years of age, is exempt from payment of this additional tax. The petitioner challenged the validity of the annuity deposit scheme on the grounds that, (i) the Parliament was not competent to incorporate in the Income- tax Act, a provision which was substantially one related to borrowings by the Central Government from a class of tax payers (ii) enactment of Ch. XXII-A was a colourable exercise of legislative power, and the provisions thereof were so harsh and unconscionable that they wore expropriatory and hence not within the legislative competence of the Parliament; and (iii) s. 280 and Sch. 11 were discriminatory and infringed Art. 14 of the Constitution.
 HELD: (Per Full Court). The petition must be dismissed.
 (Per Gajendragadkar, C. J., Wanchoo, Shah and Sikri, JJ.) :
 (i) The Parliament has by Art. 246 read with entry 82 in List I of the Seventh Schedule power to levy "tax-es on income other than agricultural income". The Indian Income- tax Act, 1961 and the provisions of the annual Finance Acts of Parliament which authorise levy of income-tax at the rates prescribed thereby are undoubtedly enacted in exercise of the powers conferred by entry 82 in List I. Granting that the scheme of Ch. XXII-A is for borrowing money by the Central Government from the tax payers in the higher income group which is repayable in instalments, power to legislate in that behalf is still within the competence of Parliament by virtue of Entry 97 of List I of the Seventh Schedule. If Parliament has the power to legislate for collecting annuity deposits from tax payers, there is nothing in the Constitution which disentitles Parliament,- as a matter of legislative arrangement, to incorporate the provisions relating to borrowing from tax-payers in the Income-tax Act or any other statute. There is no probibition -against Parliament enacting in a single statute, matters which call for the exercise of power under two or more entries in List I of the Seventh Schedule. [27 B-F] (ii)In exercising power to legislate for collecting annuity deposits,, Parliament has not sought to resort to any pretence, disguise or subterfuge with the object of trespassing upon power not vested in it by the Constitution.
 The doctrine of colourable legislation therefore can have no 23 application where Parliament is invested with the authority to legislate in respect of annuity deposit and it exercises that power. [29 C-D] A taxing statute is subject to Art. 13 of the Constitution;
 it is therefore open to challenge on the ground that it is expropriatory or that the statute prescribed no procedure or machinery for assessing tax, but it is not open to challenge merely on the ground that the tax is harsh or excessive.

 K. C. Gajapati Narayan Deo & Ors. v. State of Orissa, [1953] INSC 49; [1954] S.C.R. 1, referred to.
 (iii)The exemption of persons who have attained the age of seventy years from liability to pay additional tax cannot be said to be discriminatory against tax-payers below the age of seventy years who have exercised the option. The classification is prima facie reasonable, and there is nothing to show that it had no rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved by Parliament. [31 D] Per Hidayatullah, J.-(i) The provisions relating to annuity deposit come under Entry 82 of List I dealing with taxes on income. The annuity deposit is an alternative to paying income-tax and is a means of reduction in the amount of income-tax. The money collected is returnable with interest in equal instalments spread over ten years and the amount is taxable in the year of refund. It is not borrowing within the meaning of Art 292 of the Constitution for borrowing under this Article is an executive action and not legislative power except in so far as to fix the limits of borrowing and of giving guarantees within such limits.
 Entry 97 conferring residuary powers can only be invoked when there is no other entry in any of the three Lists under which the impugned legislation could come [33 B-E].
 (ii)The provisions are neither colourable nor discriminatory. They are not colourable, because, though called annuity deposits, they only defer payment of tax on a part of assessable income. [33 E-F]
