 The Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1952 by sub- section (1) of section 18 declares that the provisions of Chapters III and IV shall not apply to nontransferable specific delivery contracts for the sale or purchase of any goods. Sub-section (3) of section 18 however, provides that if the Central Government is of opinion that in the interest of the trade or in the public interest, it is expedient to regulate and control such contracts in any area, it may by notification in the Official Gazette, declare that all or any of the provisions of Chapters III and IV shall apply to such class or classes of non-transferable specific delivery contracts in such area and in respect of such goods or class of goods as may be specified in the notification and may also specify the manner in which and the extent to which all or any of the said provisions shall so apply.
 On July 17, 1958 the Central Government issued three notifications under the Act. The first notification S.O.
 1384-B issued under section 17 read with section 16 of the Act prohibited forward contracts for the sale or purchase of certain specified goods, including Tur (Arhar). The second notification S.O. 1384-C issued under sub-section (3) of section 18 declared that section 17 would apply to non- transferable specific delivery contracts in respect of the goods specified in the notification, and these included Tur (Arhar). The third notification, S.O. 1384-D, issued under sub-section (1) of section 17 declared that no person could, save with the permission of the Central Government, enter into any non-transferable specific delivery contracts for the sale or purchase of the goods specified therein, and these included Tur (Arhar).
 The appellants were prosecuted for various offences under section 20 and section 21 of the Act on the ground that three transactions of purchase of Tur (Arhar) were entered into by them in violation of the aforesaid notifications. The appellants challenged the validity of the notifications but the Sub-Divisional Magistrate and the Sessions Judge in revision took the view that the challenge was premature.
 A Division Bench of the High Court dismissed the appellant's petition under section 561A read with section 435 Code of Criminal Procedure, upheld 15 the validity of the notifications, and rejected the plea of the appellants that the notifications were invalid as they did not specifically mention the area over which they were to operate.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, ^ 
 HELD: 1. What sub-section (3) of section 18 requires is that before issuing a notification under that provision the Central Government must satisfy itself that the regulation and control of non-transferable specific delivery contracts in a particular area are in the interest of the trade or in the public interest. The determination of the area over which the regulation and control will extend is a vital component to which the Central Government must apply its mind when deciding to issue a notification, and when a notification is in fact issued the area must be communicated by specifying it in the notification. [18 D] 
 2. The area specified may be comprehended from material expressed or implied in the notification. The sub-section does not require that the area must be expressly specified in the notification. If it is possible to define the area by necessary implication, that is sufficient compliance with the requirement of the sub-section. [18 E] 
 3. A notification may operate over part only of the territory to which the Act extends, or it may be intended to operate throughout that territory. Ordinarily, whether the notification extends over part only of the territory or throughout the territory would be specified in the notification. If the notification is intended to operate over part only of the territory to which the Act extends, the notification must necessarily define that limited area.
 When it contains no express signification of the area, it may be implied that it is intended to operate throughout the territory covered by the Act. That is a construction by implication. It is not mandatory in such a case that the notification should specify that it operates throughout the territory to which the Act extends. [18H- 19 A] In the instant case the absence of any express reference to a specific area constituted a ground in the High Court for alleging that the Central Government did not apply its mind to the "area" ingredient when deciding on the notification. The large volume of material produced by the respondents shows that the Central Government did apply its mind to the fact that the notification should cover the entire country. [19 C-D]
