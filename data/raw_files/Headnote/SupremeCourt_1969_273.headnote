In appeal the High Court determined the damages under s. 1A at Rs. 5,000 and under s. 2 at Rs.

HELD : Compulsory damages under s. IA of the Act for wrongful death must be limited strictly to the pecuniary loss to the beneficiaries and under s. 2 the measure of damages is the economic loss sustained by the estate. There can be no exact uniform rule for measuring the value of human life and the measure of damages cannot be arrived at by precise mathematical calculations but the amount recoverable depends on the particular facts and circumstances of each case. The life expectancy of the deceased or of the beneficiaries whichever is shorter is an important factor, Since the elements which go to make up the value of the life of the deceased to' the designated beneficiaries are necessarily personal to each case in the very nature of things, there can be no exact or uniform rule for measuring the value of human life. In assessing the damages the court must exclude all considerations of matter which rest in speculations or fancy though conjecture to some extent is inevitable. As a general rule parents are entitled to recover the present cash value of the prospec- tive service of the deceased minor child. In addition they may receive compensation for loss of pecuniary benefits reasonably to be expected after the child attains majority.
 In the matter of ascertainment of damages, the appellate court should be slow in disturbing the findings reached by the courts below, if they have taken all the relevant facts into consideration.

 (ii) In the present case although the deceased was a bright child, it was uncertain how much assistance he would have given after growing up to his parents. The father was a prosperous business man and hardly needed assistance. There was no material on record as to the age of the parents and their state of health. On the basis of the evidence on record it could not be said that the damages ordered by the High Court were inadequate. [696 C]
