 The appellant was in the service of the Government of India in the P.& T. department and he was posted as an officer on special duty in Goa after its liberation on 20th December, 1961. The appellant was working in that capacity from 25th December, 1961 to 11th August, 1962 when he was transferred to Allahabad.
 While he was in Allahabad. he was suspended from service by an order dated 11th April, 1963 made by the President under sub-r. (1) of r. 12 of the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules 1957 on the ground that a case against the appellant in respect of criminal offence was under investigation. On the completion of the investigation by the Special Police Establishment the Government of India sanctioned the Prosecution of the appellant and accordingly, the appellant was prosecuted in the Court of Special Judge, Greater Bombay along with another. The principal charge was that while the appellant was on special duty in Goa, he had sent 4 consignments specifically described in the charge, in trucks and railway wagons. and concealed in postal bags from Goa to Bombay and thereby committed an offence punishable under S. 5(2) read with s. (1) (d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1947.
 Whilst the criminal case was pending the Government of India issued a Memorandum dated 8th March. 1965 to the appellant intimating that the President proposed to hold an enquiry against the appellant under r. 15 of the Rules. The allegations were set out in the statement of allegations enclosed with the memorandum and the charges framed on the basis of the allegations were enumerated in the statement of charges. These charges were based on wholly different allegations and had nothing to do with the charges on which the appellant was being prosecuted in the criminal case.
 The learned Special Judge held the appellant guilty on the second charge so far as it related to the first, second and fourth consignments referred to in that charge and convicted him. On appeal the High Court confirmed the conviction of the appellant and maintained the sentence; but a certificate to appeal to the Supreme Court was granted by the High Court. During the pendency of the appeal, the President, passed an order dated 26th October, 1967, dismissing the appellant from service with immediate effect under R. 19(1) of the Rules, 1965.
 The appeal against the conviction was, thereafter, heard by this Court and this Court allowed the appeal and set aside the conviction on the ground that no custom duty was leviable on dispatch of goods from Goa to other parts of India and therefore, the appellant could not be held guilty of evading payment of customs duty etc.
 The President, thereafter, passed an order setting aside the dismissal order; but since an enquiry was pending against the appellant under the Rules, the President ordered continuance of the enquiry and directed continuance of the suspension until further orders.
 The appellant, thereafter, filed a writ petition before the Delhi High Court challenging the validity of the order.
 While the writ petition was pending, the Government issued another memorandum by which it directed enquiry only in relation to charge 11 of the earlier memorandum; but added 3 more charges set out in the statement of charges enclosed with the second memorandum. No progress, was, however, made because of the writ petition before the High Court. The Delhi High Court. dismissed the writ petition of the appellant and hence the appeal to this Court.
 139 The impugned order dated 9th June, 1971 consisted of 3 parts-the first part set aside the dismissal order, the second part directed continuance of the enquiry and the third part continued the suspension of the appellant under sub-rule 5(b) of Rule 10 of the Rules. 1965.
 The only question debated before this Court was whether the third part of the impugned order was valid and whether President was competent to continue the suspension of the appellant under sub rule 5(b) of Rule 10 of the Rules. It was agreed that the validity of the order of suspension was to be judged by reference to 1965 Rules and the only provision in the Rules of 1965 which deals with suspension is Rule 10 and 5(b) of Rule 10 provided, inter alia, that :- Where a Government servant is suspended etc. in connection with any disciplinary proceedings etc. and any other disciplinary proceedings is commenced against him during the continuance of such suspension, the authority may direct that the Government servant shall continue to be under suspension until the termination of all or any of such proceedings." Partly allowing the appeal.
 
HELD : (i) Before action can be taken under sub-rule 5(b) of Rule 10 of the Rules, 1965, two conditions must co-exist;
 one is that the Government servant must be under continuing suspension and the other is that during the continuance of such suspension "any other disciplinary proceeding" should be commenced against him. [146D] (ii) When an order of suspension is made against a Government servant, pending an enquiry, the relationship of master and servant does not come to art end. The Government issues a direction forbidding the Government servant from doing the work which he was required to do under the terms of the Contract of Service, at the same time keeping in force the relationship of master and servant V. P. Gindronlya v. State of Madhya Pradesh & ors. [1970] 3 S.C.R. 448 referred to;
 but when an order of dismissal is passed the Vinculum Juris between the Government and the servant is dissolved; the relationship of master and servant between them is extinguished and the order of suspension, a fortiorari comes to an end. It follows, therefore. that once the suspension comes to an end by an order of dismissal, it cannot be revived by mere subsequent setting aside of the order of dismissal in the absence of a statutory provision or rule to that effect. [147B-D] Om Prakash Gupta v. The State of U.P. [1955] INSC 33; [1955] 2 S.C.R. 391, referred to.
 Under the circumstances, the third part of the impugned order could not be justified under sub-rule 5(b) of Rule 10.
 [149B-C] (iii) The third part of the impugned order continuing the suspension of the appellant cannot also be justified under any of the sub rules of Rule 10. For example, sub rule 4 is not attracted in the present case. This sub-rule requires 2 conditions (i) the order of dismissal must be set aside in consequence of a decision of a court of law and (ii) the disciplinary authority must decide to hold a fresh enquiry on the allegations on which the order of dismissal was originally passed. In the present case, the second condition is not fulfilled because the enquiry revived and continued under the second part of the impugned order was not an enquiry on the allegations on which the penalty of dismissal was originally imposed on the appellant.
 Similarly sub Rule 5(a) is also not attracted because this sub-rule only operates within the framework of the relationship of master and servant. Once that relationship comes to an end, sub-rule 5(a) cannot be sustained. [149F- 15OF; 151C-D] (iv) Therefore, in the present circumstances, the third part of the impugned order continuing the suspension of the appellant must be held to be void and inoperative: but this does not mean that the President cannot pass a fresh order of suspension under sub-rule (1) of Rule 10. if he so thinks fit. But until such action is taken, the appellant would be entitled to his salary under the conditions; of service applicable to him. [152C-D] 140
