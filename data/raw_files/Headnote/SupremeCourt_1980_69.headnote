 Section 3(2) of the U.P. Sugarcane Cess Act, 1956 provides that the owner of a sugar factory shall pay cess on sugarcane coming into the premises of a factory for use therein, on such date and at such place as may be prescribed. Sub-section (3) provides that if the cess is not paid by the specified date, interest at six per cent per annum is payable on the arrears from the specified date to the date of payment. Where a person is in default in making the payment of the cess, sub-section (5) provides that in addition to the amount of the arrears and interest a sum not exceeding ten per cent shall be recoverable by way of penalty from the person liable to pay the cess.
 In respect of three assessment years the appellant- assessee, a manufacturer of sugar, in its income tax returns claimed deduction of certain sums paid by it by way of interest on arrears of cess due under the U.P. Sugarcane Cess Act, 1956. The Income Tax Officer disallowed the claim.
 The Appellant Assistant Commissioner, whose view was upheld by the Appellate Tribunal, held that the payment of interest constituted a permissible deduction.
 On reference the High Court held that the interest paid on the arrears did not fall within the scope of s. 10(2) (xv) of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 for the reason that it was paid by way of penalty for an infringement of the law.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD : The interest paid under s. 3(3) of the Cess Act cannot be described as a penalty paid for an infringement of the law. The assessee is entitled to claim the sum as a deduction under section 10(2) (xv) of the 1922 Act as expenditure laid out wholly or exclusively for the purpose of the business. [427E] (a) The interest payable on arrears of cess under s.
 3(3) is in reality part and parcel of the liability to pay cess. It is an accretion to the cess. Under s. 3(3) this enlargement of the cess liability is automatic and no specific order is necessary in order that the obligation to pay interest under this sub-section should accrue. The liability to pay interest is as certain as the liability to pay the cess. The interest payable is in the nature of compensation paid to the Government for delay in the payment of cess. It is not by way of penalty. [425G-H] 422 (b) Interest on arrears of cess is not a penalty because provision for imposing penalty has been made separately by s. 3(5). It is also not a penalty within the meaning of s. 4 which provides for criminal liability and criminal prosecution. The penalty payable under s. 3(5) lies in the discretion of the collecting officer or authority.
 For imposing penalty under s. 4 no prosecution can be instituted unless a complaint is made by or under the authority of the Cane Commissioner under s. 5(1) of the Cess Act. [426A-B] (c) The procedure for collecting interest on arrears is different from the procedure for recovering penalty imposed under s. 3(5). The Collector proceeds to recover the arrear of cess as if it were an arrear of land revenue on receipt from the authority concerned of a certificate under s. 3(6) specifying the amount of arrears including interest due. The words "specifying the amount of arrears including interest" show that the interest is part of the arrears of cess. In the case of penalty imposed under s. 3(5) a separate provision for recovery has been made under s. 3(7). Although the manner of recovery of penalty provided by s. 3(7) is the same as the manner for recovery provided by s. 3(6) the Legislature has dealt with it as some thing distinct from the recovery of arrears of cess including interest.
