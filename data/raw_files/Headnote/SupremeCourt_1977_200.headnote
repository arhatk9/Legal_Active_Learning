 The respondent/plaintiff issued a notice u/s. 80 C.P.C. to the appellant/ defendant for referring certain claims to Arbitration as per the contract. There being no response, a suit was filed under the Arbitration Act and summons taken out to the Chief Secretary. In the ex parte proceedings taken, on the refusal of the summons issued, the Government later applied for staying of the proceeding u/s. 34. The Subordinate Judge declined to stay the proceedings. In appeal, the High Court refused to interfere against the said order.' Dismissing the special leave petition, the Court, 
HELD : (1) A statutory notice of the proposed action u/s. 80 C.P.C. is intended to alert the State to negotiate a just settlement or at least have the courtesy to tell the potential outsider why the claim is being resisted. As a matter of law, mere silence on the part of the defendant when a notice u/s. 80, C. P. C. is sent to him may not more, disentitle him to move u/s. 34 of the Arbitration Act and seek stay. [747 E, G] (2) Where parties have, by contract, agreed to refer their disputes to arbitration, the courts should as far as possible proceed to give an opportunity for resolution of disputes by arbitration rather than by judicial adjudication. Even so. there is a residual discretion vested in the court to stay or not to stay having regard to the totality of circumstances. One weighty factor obviously to find out whether the party who invokes the arbitration clause has expressed his readiness to rely on it at the earliest stage.
 In the instant case there is no gross error justifying the grant of leave since an opportunity for settling the dispute through arbitration was thrown away by sheer inaction by the appellant.[747- C-D] Observation :
 Government must be made accountable by Parliamentary social audit for wasteful litigative expenditure inflicted on the community by inaction. A litigative policy of the State involves settlement of Governmental dispute with citizens in a sense of conciliation rather than a fighting mood.
 Indeed, it should be a directive on the part of the State to empower its law officer to take steps to compose disputes rather than continue them in court. Litigation in which Governments are involved adds to the case load accumulation in courts for which there is public criticism. [747 F-H, 748 A] [The Court expressed its hope that a more responsive spirit will be brought to bear upon governmental litigation so as to avoid waste of public money and promote expeditious work in courts of cases which deserve to be attended to.]
