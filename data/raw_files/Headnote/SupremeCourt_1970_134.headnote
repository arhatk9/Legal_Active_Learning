 The Vice-Chancellor of Patna University after obtaining the approval of the Chancellor for filling up the vacancy for the post of Professor of Political Science by direct recruitment, got the post advertised through the Bihar Public Service Commission. The Public Service Commission issued an advertisement in which the required qualification was "first or second class Master's degree in the subject." Since the relevant University statute had no such requirement the Vice-Chancellor got published through the Commission another advertisement in Which the qualification mentioned was "first or second class Master's degree in Political Science or in an allied subject." The Commission recommended the name of respondent No. 1 for appointment after consulting two experts, only one of whom was Present atathe interview, the other having sent his opinion by post.
 The Syndicate of the University at its meeting of May 7, 1963 considered the Commission's recommendation. The minutes of the meeting as originally recorded stated the resolution said to have been passed by a majority of 9 to 8 in the following terms : "Not to proceed with the question of making this appointment". Construing the Syndicate's decision to mean that the said candidate had not been approved for appointment the Vice-Chacellor requested the Public Service, Commision to reconsider its recommendation.
 This the Commission refused to do. At the next meeting of the Syndicate on July 3, 1963, 16 out of the 17 members who had attended the previous meeting were present. They authorised the correction of the minutes of the last meeting to read "not to accept the recommendation of the Commission" in place of the words "not to proceed with the question of making his appointment". Thereafter by resolution it appointed respondent No. 1 to the Post in question. The appellant made a representation to the Chancellor of the University challenging the appointment. The Chancellor purporting to act under s.9(4) of the Patna University Act 3 of 1962 annulled the Syndicate's resolution making the appointment on the following grounds : (i) that the revised advertisement was unauthorised inasmuch as it- was against the statute and sought to amend it. as also because it was issued without the prior aprroval of the Chancellor; (ii) that since only one of the experts associated with the selection was present at the interviews s.26(2) of the Act was violated: (iii) that the Vice-Chancellor's action in referring the. matter for reconsideration by the Commission was without the authority of the syndicate and was not warranted under s 26(4) (iv) 587 that under a prior resolution of the syndicate a decision taken at its meeting could not be revised for a period of six months therefrom; therefore its resolution of May 7, 1963 not accepting the recommendation regarding the respondent could not be substituted by its resolution dated July 3, 1963 by which he was appointed. Respondent No. 1 challenged the Chancellor's order in High Court which held it to be invalid. In appeal by certificate, 
HELD : (i) In a writ petition for certiorari a superior court would not interfere on the mere ground of an error of fact or even of law, but it: the error of law is apparent on the, record'or consists of a misconstruction of a law on which assumption of jurisdiction is made which otherwise does not exist. a certiorari can issue. In the instant case the Chancellor on the four grounds on which he annulled the Syndicate's resolution appropriated to himself the jurisdiction to interfere which he did not have under s.
 9(4) of the Act. The High Court rightly held that the Chancellor's assumption of jurisdiction was based on a wrong interpretation of the statute and that there was an apparent error of law on the record. [592 D-E] (ii)Under s. 85 of the Patna 'University Act, 1962 until statutes. Ordinances, Regulations and Rules were made under the Act, Regulations made under the Bihar State University Act 14, 1960 were to continue to be in force. That statute did not say that the Master's degree which a candidate for the post of Professor was required to possess had to be 'in the subject' for which the candidate would be appointed..
 Therefore in issuing the revised advertisement the Vice- Chancellor did not purport to modify or alter the statute relating to the qualifications but on the contrary clarified the correct position. The Chancellor could not on a wrong interpretation of the statute hold that the revised advertisement was a modification of the statute. [592 G-H;
 593 G-H] The Vice-Chancellor had obtained the approval of the Chancellor forfilling up the vacancy by direct recruitment and also for the advertisement in terms of the statute.
 Once such an approval had been obtained no further approval was necessary for the various consequential steps which would' have to be taken to bring about the appointment and fill up the vacancy including revision of the advertisement for bringing it into conformity with the statute. The Chancellor was therefore wrong in holding that the revised advertisement required his approval. [594 D-G] (iii)Section 26(2) (iii) of the Act does not say that the experts required to be 'associated' with the selection had to be present at the interviews. No such reference could be drawn from the provision that they would not have the right to vote. The Chancellor was therefore in error when he held that the recommendation of the Commission was invalid be- cause one of the experts consulted was not present at the interviews. [595 A-F] (iv)It is only when the Syndicate declines to accept the recommendation of the Commission that the question of sending back the matter for reconsideration arises under S.
 26(4). There can be no question of sending back the matter when the Syndicate either accepts the recommendation or decides not to proceed with making the appointment. There was ample material on record to show that on May 7, 1963 the Syndicate in fact decided not to accept the. commission's recommendation. At its subsequent meeting the Syndicate corrected the minutes to this effect. The Vice-Chancellor had rightly understood the Syndicate's decision and for reconsideration. [595 H-596 E] 588 When a decision is taken at a meeting and is minuted and such minutes are signed by the Chairman they become prima facie evidence of what took place at the meeting. After such signature the minutes cannot be altered. But before the minutes are signed they can be altered if found to be inaccurate or not in accord with what was actually decided.
 If ,,that were not so it would result in great hardship and inconvenience for however inaccurate they are, they cannot be altered to bring them in conformity with the actual decision. This was precisely what was done at the meeting of july 3, 1963 [597 A-D] The view of the Chancellor that the alteration of the minutes on July 3, 1963 constituted a revision or rescission of the earlier decision or that such revision or recession could not be made before the expiry of six months as provided by the rule passed by the Syndicate. was unsustainable.
