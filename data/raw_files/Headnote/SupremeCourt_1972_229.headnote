 The respondent is a private company. The assessment 'was for the years 1958-59 and 1959-60 of which the accounting year ended on 30th June 1957 and 30th June 1958 respectively. The Company had declared dividend after the 12 months following the accounting year, and hence, the Income Tax Officer subjected the Company to Super Tax in terms of the latter part of S. 23A(1) of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 by including the dividends of Rs. 15,000 and Rs. 90,000 declared and paid by the Company in respect of relevant accounting years.
 The respondent contended that once dividend is declared before: an order is made under S. 23-A(l), no Super-Tax can be levied in respect of those dividends. This submission was rejected by the I.T.O., who sought to assess the respondent by including the dividends already declared and paid. An appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, was unsuccessful. The Tribunal, however, referred the following question to the High Court under S.66(1)of the Indian Income Tax Act 1922:"whether, on the. facts of the case, the Tribunal was right in holding that in the matter of calculation of undistributed balance of the total income of an assessee for the purpose of levy of Super Tax, in terms of S.23-A(1) of the income-tax Act, 1922, the I.T.O.
 should take into consideration dividend declared by the Company after the period of twelve months immediately following the expiry of the previous years relevant to the assessment years, 1958-59 and 1959-60, but before the date on which the orders under S.23-A(1) had been made by the Income Tax Officer;". The High Court has answered that question in the affirmative and against the Department. The question before this Court was whether the High Court was right in answering the question in the affirmative referred to by the Tribunal. Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) S.23-A(1) has been enacted with a view to deter private Companies which do not distribute more than 60% of their able income; otherwise their undistributed balance of the net income will by subjected to additional Super Tax.
 The object of the Section is to prevent the share-holders in adopting device to avoid payment of Super Tax inasmuch as the rates of Super Tax for the Companies being lower, there may be temptation to get the Company accumulate profits and capitalise them, such as, for instance, to issue bonus shares, which were not assessee able as income in the hands of the shareholders., It is done to avoid these artifices and force such companies to declare the, minimum statutory dividends. in cases where the provisions have not been complied with, the I.T.O., with the previous approval of the inspecting Assistant Commissioner, may make an order if at the time of the passing of the order, it is found that the company has not distributed its dividends within 12 months immediately following the accounting year less than the statutory percentage of its total income of the accounting year as reduced by the amount of taxes payable by the company. Though the I.T.O. has jurisdiction to pass an order under Sub-Section (1), he has to make a regular assessment of the company under S. 23, which be cannot do if in fact, a 373 dividend had been declared before the making of that order, as otherwise, the company's undistributed balance which is assessed by the I.T.O. would exceed its commercial profits.
 There is also a likelihood of double taxation because not- only the company is charged Super-Tax for not distributing the dividends, but also it. will be assessed on the dividends it has in fact distributed, to income tax and once again, to the Super-Tax. Such a result was not intended as the company can declare dividends in General Meetings from the profits, earned by it and when that is declared and paid, the I.T.O., though for the nonfulfillment of the conditions prescribed in the Section, may seek to reopen it, he cannot make an assessment in cases where the dividend has. actually been declared and paid, before the date of his order.
