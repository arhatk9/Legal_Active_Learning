 The assessee firm which carried on business as share brokers and paper merchants, together with D who was a partner in a firm of Chartered Accountants and R who was a partner of a firm of Solicitors, started negotiations for the purchase of shares representing the controlling interest in S company.
 At the same time M was also carrying on negotiations to secure the same interest and wrote a letter to D to the effect that he, together with his associates was desirous of purchasing the controlling interest in the S company and that in the event of D and his associates securing the same for them and giving up all claims to purchase the same, M and his associates would pay a sum of Rs. 6 lakhs upon completion of the purchase. M eventually purchased the shareholding in S company for just over Rs. 4 crores. A sum of Rs. 6 lakhs was thereafter paid by M of which the assessee firm received Rs. 2 lakhs as their share.
 In the course of their assessment to income tax for the year 1947-48 the assessee firm claimed that the sum of Rs 2 lakhs received by them was exempt from tax under s. 4(3) (vii) of the Income-tax Act, 1922 or, alter- natively, was a capital and not a revenue receipt. The Income-tax Officer rejected this claim and his order was confirmed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. In appeal, on a difference of opinion between the two members constituting the Appellate Tribunal the- matter was referred to a third member, who, after calling for certain findings on evidence from the Appellate Assistant Commissioner disposed of the entire appeal against the assessees, holding that the, amount was received by them for services rendered -and not as consideration for refraining from competing in the purchase of the controlling interest. The High Court, on a reference; confirmed the view taken by the Tribunal.
 On appeal to the this Court, 
HELD : Dismissing the appeal, (i) On the finding recorded by the Tribunal, the receipt of Rs. 2 lakhs arose from the business of the assessees and was not exempt under s. 4(3) (vii).
 In view of the terms of the letter written by M, the fact that the principal business of the assessees was in paper, and as it was not shown how it was intended to finance such a large transaction, the conclusion recorded by the Tribunal that the assessees and their two associates had no intention to acquire the, controlling interest, but were seeking to associate themselves in a venture in the nature of trade could not be said to be without evidence.
