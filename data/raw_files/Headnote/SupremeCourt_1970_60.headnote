 K's son C died in 1925 and was succeeded in the ownership of his properties (inherited from K) by his mother B. B continued in possession till her death in 1946. Her daughter M took possession of the properties as heir. M died in 1950. The respondent-plaintiff was the son of M. In 1955 he filed a suit alleging that the defendant, after the death of B claiming to be entitled to the properties as a collateral and revisioner of K, had got mutation of the aforesaid properties effected in his name. As daughter's son of K the respondent-plaintiff prayed for declaration of his title to the suit properties; he also prayed for recovery of possession thereof from the defendant. The defendant contended that he was a collateral of K and was entitled to succeed to the properties after the termination of the life-estate of his widow B on her death in 1946. The trial court held that in view of the provisions of the Hindu Law of Inheritance (Amendment) Act 1929 (Act 2 of 1929) the plaintiff as sisters' son of C the last male holder, had a preferential claim to that of the defendant who was only a paternal uncle of C. The first appellate Court upheld the decree of the trial Court. In second appeal by the defendant before the High Court the learned Single Judge held that as C the last male owner had died in 1925 his heirs must be found on that date. On that date according to the learned Judge the heir of C was the defendant. The fact that the life-estate of the moth& and sister of C intervened after his death would not affect the rights of the defendant as the Act of 1929 had no retrospective operation. In Letters Patent Appeal the Division Bench reversed the judgment of the Single Judge. The legal representatives of the defendant appealed to this Court by certificate. The question of law that fell for consideration was whether the Act applies only to the case of a Hindu male dying intestate on or after February 21, 1929 when the Act came into force or whether it also applies to the case of a Hindu male dying intestate before the Act came into operation and succeeded by a female heir who died after that date. It was not disputed that C held the property absolutely and he died.
 intestate.
 
HELD:Applying the rule laid down by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Lala Duni Chand's case the appeal must be dismissed.
 The point of time for the applicability of the Act is when the succession opens viz. when the life estate terminates.
 In consequence the question as to who is the nearest reversionary heir, or what is the class of reversionary heirs will fall to be settled at the date of the expiry of the ownership for life or lives. The death of a Hindu female life-estate owner ovens the inheritance to the reversioners and the one most nearly related at the time to the last full owner becomes entitled to the estate. [961 E] LI 10SupCI(NP )70-16 9 5 4 The Act accordingly must be held to apply to the case of a Hindu male dying intestate before the Act came into operation and succeeded by a female heir who died after that date. In this case as decided by all the Courts the last female heir died only on March 25, 1950 and, under the Act, the plaintiff as the sister's son of C, was entitled to succeed to his estate, in preference to the defendant who was only a paternal uncle. Under the Act the paternal uncle is postponed to the four relations referred to in the Act, the last of whom is the sister's son. [961 G] It may also be stated, though the question was not raised by the parties, that in this case the succession can be considered to have opened even in 1946 on the termination of the life-estate of C's mother and accordingly C's sister must be considered to have succeeded to the property of her brother, in her own right as a preferential heir under the Act, though the estate taken by her was also under s. 3 (b) only a life estate.[961H] Lala Duni Chand v.
