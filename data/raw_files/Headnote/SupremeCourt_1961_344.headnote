 By s. 70 of the Contract Act, "where a person lawfully does anything for another person, or delivers anything to him, not intending to do so gratuitously; and such other person enjoys the benefit thereof, the latter is bound to make compensation to the former in respect of, or to restore, the thing so done or delivered". Under s.
 175(3) of the Government of India Act all contracts made in the exercise of the executive authority of a province shall be expressed to be made by the Governor of the province and shall be executed on behalf of the Governor by such persons and in such manner as he may director authorise.
 The respondent, a firm of building contractors doing construction works for the Provincial Government did certain additional construction on the request of its officers. Its bills for these latter works were not paid and it sued the Government basing its claim on contract and in the alternative on s. 70 of the Contract Act. The defence of the Provincial Government, inter alia, was that there was no valid and binding contract and s. 70 had no application. The trial Judge 877 found that although there was no valid contract under s.175(3) of the Government of India Act, 1935, the claim was justified under s.70 of the Contract and decreed the suit. The Court of appeal affirmed that decree. The State appealed by special leave.
 ^ Held (Per curiam), that the courts below were right in holding that s.70 of the Contract Act applied to the case and the appeal must fail.
 Per Gajendragadkar, Wanchoo and Ayyangar, JJ.-Whether a mandatory provision in a statute is merely directory or obligatory should be decided on a careful examination of the scope of the statute and the object of the particular provision. In enacting s.175(3) of the Government of India Act, 1935, the intention of the parliament was that the state should not be burdened with liability based on unauthorised contracts. The provision made was in public interest and so the word 'shall' used therein must be held to make it obligatory and not directory.
 Seth Bhikraj Jaipuria v. Union of India, [1961] INSC 228; [1962] 2 S.C.R. 880, approved.
 Chatturbhuj Vithaldas Jasani v. Moreshwar Prashram [1954] INSC 14; [1954] S.C.R. 817, explained.
 In order that a person can invoke s.70 of the Contract Act he must be able to show (1) that he acted lawfully,(2) that he did not intend to act gratuitously and (3) that the other person enjoyed the benefit.
 A claim for compensation under s.70 therefore is not one based on any subsisting contract but proceeds on the basis that something was done or delivered to another who voluntarily accepted it even though he had always the option to refuse the same.
 Recognition of the claim in the present case, could not therefore, amount to a contravention of s.175(3) of the Government of India Act, either directly or indirectly.
 The word 'lawfully' in s. 70 of the Contract Act means that after something is done or delivered by one person to another and is voluntarily accepted and enjoyed by the latter, a lawful relationship arises between the two which attracts s.70 of the Contract Act. In cases falling under the section, there cannot, therefore be any scope for claims for specific performance or for damages for breach of contract, the claim for compensation under the section being on the footing that there has been no contract and the conduct of parties has created a relationship resembling that arising out of a contract.
 878 There is nothing in s. 175(3) of the Government of India Act, tested in the light of s.
 23 of the Contract Act, that forbids a claim under s. 70 of the Contract Act, There is no conflict between the two sections, each covering a distinct and separate field and s. 70 Contract Act should be regarded rather as supplementing s. 175(3) of the Government of India Act.
 Chedi Lal v. Bhagwan Das, (1889) I.L.R. 11 A11. 234, disapproved.
 Held, further, that in construing a specific statutory provision such as s. 70 of the Contract Act it would be unreasonable to seek assistance from English decisions on statutory provisions contained in English law.
 Ramanandi Kuer v. Kalawati Kuer, (1927) L.R.
 55 I.A. 18, referred to.
 The State Government, as much as an ordinary citizen, must be subject to s. 70 of the Contract Act and it was wrong to suggest that its position was like that of a minor and, therefore, it was outside the scope of s. 70 of the Act.
 Suchand Ghosal v. Balaram Mardana, (1911) I.L.R. 38 Cal. 1, referred to.
 Case law referred to.
 Per Sarkar and Das Gupta, JJ.- The question in the instant case was whether the three requisites of s. 70 of the Contract Act had been satisfied. There was no dispute that the Government had taken benefit of the work it urgently needed the work and put it to its use immediately. It was also clear that the respondent did not intend to do the work gratuitously. What the request made by the officers did was to inform the respondent that the Government needed the work immediately and would pay for it when done, and works similar the respondent, who had previously done and been paid for, readily acted on it.
 There can also be no doubt that the work was done lawfully. Even assuming that work done under a contract invalid under s. 175(3) of the Government of India Act, would be unlawful because of evasion of it, that section does not say that work done without any contract at all, as in the instant case, would be work unlawfully done nor does it make it unlawful for the Government to take benefit of work done for it without any contract at all.
 Section 175(3) of the Government of India Act applies to a consensual contract which the Government makes and not to something which is also called a contract but which the 879 law brings into existence by a fiction irrespective of the consent of the parties.
 Section 70 of the Contract Act applies where its requisites exist, if it is necessary to imply a contract or contemplate a quasi-contract for applying the section that must be done and neither s. 175(3) of the Government of India Act nor any other impediment can stand in the way.
 Held, further, that a resort to English Law is not justified for deciding a question arising on an Indian statute unless it is such that it cannot be reasonably understood without such assistance.
