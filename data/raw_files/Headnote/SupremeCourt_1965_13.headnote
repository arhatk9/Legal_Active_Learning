 A testator, who professed the Jain religion, gave directions in his will that certain amounts should be spent annually on religious and charitable objects specified by him, and that an annual feast should be given to members of his caste in certain specified villages. He died in 1916 and by 1955 there was a large accumulation of unexpended income mainly because of discontinuing the feast, and so, the Charity sioner filed an application before the District Judge, under ss. 55(1)(b) and 56 of the Bombay Public Trusts Act, 1950 for directions for the utilization of that sum. The District Judge directed a division of the amount between an educational institution and a hospital. The appellants, who were of the same caste as the testator and who objected before the District Judge to the diversion of the sum appealed to the High Court, but the appeal was dismissed.
 In their appeal to the Supreme Court, the appellants challenged the propriety and legality of the directions given by the District Judge and confirmed by the High Court.
 
HELD : The directions should be set aside, as the respondent had not made out a case for such diversion of trust funds, and the directions were objectionable on the ground that they did not take into account the original objects of the trust. [821 H; 822 A] On an application either under s. 55(1)(a) or s. 55(1)(b) read with s. 56(2) the Court is bound to give direction in respect of all public trusts. Section 56(1) provides that in giving the directions. the Court shall, so far as may be expedient, practicable, desirable, necessary or proper in the public interest, give effect to the original intention of the author of the trust or the object for which the trust was created. Under the latter part of s. 56(1), if the Court finds that the carrying out of the original intention or object wholly or partially, is neither expedient nor practicable nor desirable nor necessary nor proper in the public interest, the court may direct the property or income of the trust or any portion thereof to be applied by press to any other charitable or religious object. One of the objects for which the trust was created in the instant case, was the annual feast to the members of the testator's caste.
 Looking at the interest of the community, it was certainly expedient, practicable, desirable and proper to give the feast. Even if it was not a religious act, it was a meritorious one prescribed by the scriptures of the Jains.
 In the wider public interest also it was expedient, practicable, desirable and proper to respect the sentiments and interests of that section of the Jain public and to give effect to the charity. [818 B-C, D-E, F, G-H] 812 Further, the overriding intention of the founder of the trust was that the amount set apart by him should be devoted to the objects mentioned in the will, so that those objects may be continued and carried out for ever. In accordance with the intention of the founder the surplus should be applied, as nearly as possible to the original uses and purposes of the trust. The savings should be applied suitably for carrying out the same objects in future or to increase the amounts spendable for the surviving objects of the trust, instead of diverting them for other purposes [820 C, F, H] [Suitable directions were given by the Court in lieu of those set aside, for utilising the accumulations].
