 The appellant carried on the business of generating and distributing electrical energy within a specified area tinder a licence granted to it under the Indian Electricity Act, 1910. The respondent, Gujarat Electricity Board agreed with the second respondent company to give direct supply of electricity to its factory which was within the area of supply of the appellant. The appellant brought a suit against the respondents for declaration that the agreement between the first and the second respondents without its consent was illegal and ultra vires the powers of the first respondent under the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, and sought an injunction restraining the first respondent from implementing the decision.
 The appellant's case was that the first respondent was not entitled to give direct supply to the second respondent as the "maximum demand" of the appellant at the time of the request of the second respondent was 262 to 349 KVA between September and December, 1959, and therefore. make than twice the "maximum demand" of the second respondent which had never exceeded 40 to 45 KVA. The first respondent contended, however, that the "maximum demand" of the appellant company at the time of request was less than twice the "maximum demand" of 398 KVA asked for by the second respondent from the first respondent. The trial court held that the first respondent's decision to give direct supply to the second respondent was ultra vires its power under section 19 (1)(b)(ii) of the Act. However, the first appellate court allowed an appeal and the High Court dismissed a further appeal holding, inter alia, that by virtue of s. 19(1)(b)(ii) the comparison required to be made was between the maximum demand of the licensee on the Board at the time of request for direct supply based on electricity actually supplied and taken during some reasonable period immediately preceding the time of request for direct supply, and the maximum demand which the applicant wants to keep the Board ready on tap when supplying electricity to the applicant.
 On appeal to this the Court, 
HELD : The appellant was entitled to the grant of a decree in terms of the trial court's decree.
 The "maximum demand" as defined in section 2(8) of the Act has relation only to an existing state of facts and there can be no maximum demand in relation to a future period. On a true construction of section 19(1)(b)(ii), what is required to be compared for determining the applicability of the clause with the maximum demand of the licensee on the Board at the time of request for direct supply, was the "maximum demand" by the applicant on the licensee at that time and not any hypothetical or anticipated demand which the applicant may call upon the Board be ready to supply.
 The phrase "supplied and taken" in s. 2(8) shows that the ascertainment of maximum demand is dependent upon the electricity actually supplied and taken. in any particular period in the past and not electricity which may be supplied and taken in a future period, [444B] 439 There was no force in the respondent's contention that the words "asked for by any such person" must be construed to mean any hypothetrical or anticipated demand which the applicant may call upon the Board ,to be ready to supply.
 Such an interpretation would be inconsistent with the definition of "maximum demand" in section 2(8) of the Act.
 There was no reason why the phrase "maximum demand" in section 19 (1) (b) (ii) of the Act should be given two different meanings one for the licensee and the other for the consumer asking for the maximum demand. It cannot be supposed that the legislature contemplated that the phrase "maximum demand" should be given two different meanings in the same clause. [444G]
