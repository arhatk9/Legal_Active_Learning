 Respondent No. 1 was owner of two survey numbers situate in the district of Panchmahals in Gujarat to which the Bombay Tenancy and agricultural Lands Act 57 of 1948 was applicable. On May 15, 1956 the appellant voluntarily handed over possession of the said lands to respondent 1.
 The surrender was not, however, in writing and the procedure of inquiryand verification required by s. 15 of the aforesaid Act was notthrough. Respondent 1 thereafter personally cultivated the said lands. On January 16, 1961 the appellant applied to the Deputy collector under a. 84 of the Act for summary eviction, of respondent 1. the Deputy Collector dismissed the application holding that the- tenant's remedy lay under s. 29(1) of the Act. The Gujarat Revenue Tribunal, however, in, a revision by the tenant held that s. 84 and not s. 29(1) applied. The High Court in a petition under s. 227 of the Constitution it aside the Tribunal's order holding that s. 84 did not apply. In appeal, by special leave, the question was as to the nature of the remedies under 3. 29(1) and 84 and whether a tenant who had remedy under s. 29(1) could still apply to the Collector under s. 84.
 HELD:The appeal must be dismissed.
 (i) In the case of a surrender which is not valid and binding on the tenant there is no termination of tenancy, and therefore , the landlord is not entitled to retain the land even though possession thereof has been handed over to him or has been voluntarily taken by him. The position a such a case is that the tenant has a right to apply to the Mamlatdar or restoration of possession to him claiming that there has been no termination. of tenancy, that his possession continues to be protected by the provisions of the Act and that therefore, the possession should be restored to him. Such an application lies under s. 29(1) and, when so 'made, it becomes the duty of the Mamlatdar under s. 70, cl. (n) read with s. 29(1) to put the tenant in possession of the land in question "under the Act". In such a case the tenant is claiming possession under the provisions of the Act and not on the strength of his own title as when he applies for possession against a trespasser. [314 E-G] (ii)The words "any person unauthorisedly occupying or wrongfully an possession of any land' in s. 84, no doubt, are-words of wide import and would include a landlord who is in unauthorised occupation or is wrongfully in possession. But then s. 84 in express terms limits its Application to three types of cases only, namely, of a person unauthorisedly occupying or wrongfully in possession of the land (a) the transfer or acquisition of which its.is invalid under the Act, or (b) the management if which has been assumed under the Act, or (e) to the use and occupation of which he is not entitled under the provisions of the Act and the aid provisions do notprovide for the eviction of such person. [314 H-315B] In the present casecl. (b) obviously could not apply as as the land in question was not one,, the management of which was assumed under the provisions of the Act. Clause (a) applies only to transfers or acquisitions 310 which are in breach of provisions of Ch. v and possession or occupation whereof has been obtained under such invalid transfers and acquisitions. That being the position, the instant case would fall only under cl. (c) and therefore the condition that s. 84 would only apply to case,, for which there is no other remedy under any of the provisions of the Act must apply to the present case. This condition shows that while giving drastic powers of summary eviction to an administrative officer the Feature was careful to restrict this power, firstly, because the result otherwise would be to deprive the person evicted under s. 84 of his remedy of appeal before the Collector- which he would have if the order were to be passed under s. 29(1) _and secondly, because it would enable a tenant to by-pass a judicial enquiry by the Mamlatdar udder s. 29(1) by directly applying to the Collector under s. 84. Such a result could not have been intended by the legislature. Therefore, the contention that as. 29(1) and 84 provide alternative remedies and a choice to the tenant cannot possibility be correct.
