 The respondents were the four partners of a firm M, which I was registered under the Indian Income Tax Act. Three of these four partners held amongst them forty shares in private limited company which was registered in the Phaltan State.
 For the account year ending 30-9-1943 the Phaltan Company disclosed a net profit, butt did not declare any dividend out of these profits but paid income-tax and super-tax thereon. After the merger of Phaltan State in the Indian Union, the Income-tax Officer issued notice to the Phaltan Company under s. 34 of the Act and acting tinder the provisions of s.23A directed that the undistributed asscess- able income of the company should be deemed to have been distributed as dividend among the shareholders. Before the date of this order, the assessment of the firm M and the individual assessment of its four partners had been completed. In order to bring to tax the undistributed dividend deemed to be declared under s.23A among the shareholders of the company, notices were issued to the four partners under s..34 of the Income-tax Act. In response to the notice, the partners appeared and contended that the forty shares held by the three of the four partners were in fact the property of the registered firm M. This contention was accepted by the Income-Tax Officer who thereupon treated the dividend attributable to the total of the forty shares as the dividend income of the firm and proceeded to the apportion the said income among the four partners in proportion of the shares which each of them held in the firm and added this to the income already assessed. In doing so however, the Income-tax Officer committed an error. In recomputing total income of each of these four assessees he included only the net dividend "deemed to 456 be received" by each but as again this addition he allowed a deduction of the tax paid by the company attributable to such dividend. Subsequently this mistake was discovered and thereupon the Income-tax Officer issued notice pointing out the error in including in the income the net dividend without being grossed up, while at the same time allowing credit for the tax deemed to have been paid thereon, and averred that this was a mistake apparent on the record" which he proposed to rectify under s.35 of the Act.
 Held, that in view of the decision in M/s. Howrah Trading Co. v Commissioner of Income-tax, it is only the registered shareholders who are entitled to the benefit of the credit for tax paid by the company under s.18(5.) as well as the corresponding grossing up under s. 16(2). On that basis the only persons who were entitled to be treated as shareholders to whom the provisions of s.16(2) and s. 18(5) of the Income-Tax Act were attracted were the three partners in whose name the forty shares stood registered.
 Held, further, that the Income-tax Officer and jurisdiction under s.36 to rectify errors but not to effect merely readjustment so as to avoid the illogically in an error which is still permitted to continue.
 Held, also, that it is not possible- to correct the initial error in the proceedings because the notice under s.35 issued to the parties which is the foundation of the jurisdiction to effect the rectification, sought not the correction of the error but the perpetuation of it though in an altered and a less objectionable from the point of view of Revenue.
 Messrs. Howrah Trading Co., Ltd. v. The Commissioner of Income-tax, Calcatta [1959] Supp. 2. S. C. R. 448 applied.
