 Certain clerks in the Posts and Telegraphs Department, were selected and appointed as Wireless Licence Inspectors and Town Inspectors tinder rules 279/4 promulgated by the Director General of Posts and Telegraphs. When the incumbents of these posts were brought back to their original posts after the expiry of 3 years as provided in the rule. they contended that the Government of India, by their decision dated November 15, 1958, deleted the posts of Wireless Licence and Inspectors from the list of tenure posts and that therefore they became entitled to hold the posts without any limit subject to the condition that they may be transferred from one place to another according to what is called the rule for rotational transfers.
 Rejecting the contention, 
HELD: The Director General of Posts and Telegraphs was competent to pass the rule and it is not in any way inconsistent with the decision of the Government of India.
 [122 B-C] (a) The posts of Wireless Licence Inspectors and Town Inspectors were removed from the list of tenure posts because, they, not being permanent posts, did not fall within the definition of 'tenure posts'. The deletion was not on account of any decision of tge Government of India to make the appointments of incumbent's of those posts permanent. [119 F-G] (b) There is no provision for constituting the posts into separate cadres. There is nothing to show that they have been sanctioned as separate units. No separate time scale has been provided for Wireless Licence Inspectors and Town Inspectors, and the time-scale clerks, who were appointed to the posts, continued in the same time scale of pay of clerks. They were entitled to a special pay in addition to the time scale pay of clerk, and this shows that they continue in the cadre of time-scale clerks and were not constituted into a separate cadre of Wireless Licence Inspectors and Town Inspectors. The appointments were not transfers from one cadre to another or promotion from a lower to a higher cadre or from a lower to higher post.
 Though for directly recruited Wireless Licence Inspectors there is an avenue of promotion from these posts to those of Wireless Investigating Inspectors, there is no such avenue for Wireless Licence Inspectors appointed from amongst time scale clerks, their avenues of promotion being from their substantive posts of time scale clerks. Therefore, the posts of Wireless Licence Inspectors are only in the cadre of time-scale clerks carrying a special pay on account of additional work. [120 D-E, G-121 B] (c) The mention of these posts or the specification of their pay along with those of the time-scale clerks in the Central Civil Services (Revised Pay) Third Amendment Rules, 1973, would not show that the posts were separate cadre posts. [121 B-C] (d) The direction in the decision of the Government of India to include the posts among the posts mentioned in r.
 60 of Chap. 1 1 of the Posts and Telegraphs Manual, by amending the rule was not intended to confer on the incumbents the right to hold them till superannuation. [121 D] 116 (i) Rule 60 does not speak of rotational transfers. It only provides that posts included under the rule 'should not be occupied by the same officials continuously for more than the period shown against each'. It does not also deal with the places in which an incumbent could be rotated. The purpose of including these posts among those covered by r.
 60 was not to affect the term of employment of the Wireless Licence Inspectors and Town Inspectors, but only to provide that they can occupy the posts only for the period specified, namely, 3 years at a time. [121 E-F; 122 A-C] (ii) Assuming the rule deals with rotational transfers and the expression 'rotational transfer' means transfer from one place to another and from one division to another, since the posts of Wireless Licence Inspectors and Town Inspectors form part and parcel of the Clerical Cadre they will be rotated only in clerical posts which are in the same cadre.
 [121G] (iii) But, the expression 'rotational transfer' does not mean transfer from one place to another or from division to another in the Same post. it means transfer from one post to another and that after the incumbent has spent some time in the post to which he has been transferred, he should be brought back to the original post, and that is precisely what has been done, in the present case.
