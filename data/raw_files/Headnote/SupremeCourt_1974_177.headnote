 A vote of no confidence was moved by respondent no. 1 against the appellant who was the elected President of a Municipality. The appellant's party claimed that the motion was lost while the respondent no. 1 claimed that it was carried. Since the appellant did not vacate his office respondent no. 1 filed a writ petition under article 226 of the Constitution. Before the High Court a number of affi- davits had been filed on behalf of the appellant and the respondent. After cross-examining six persons. for respondent and two for the appellant the High Court held that the appellant had ceased to be the President.
 On appeal to this Court it was contended (1) that as the dispute between the parties involved questions of fact the High Court should have referred the parties to a separate suit, (2) that the High Court should have permitted cross- examination of all deponents, (3) that as the cross- examination of only a few of the deponents had been permitted the affidavits of others who were not cross- examined could not be taken into consideration; (4) that the High Court was wrong in relying upon the version of respondent no. 1 that one of the councillors who was a supporter of the appellant had supported the motion of no confidence; (5) that the councillors had to stick to the ground specified in the notice and could not depart from it in passing the motion of no confidence.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) (a). The appellant could not be heard to say that the Court should have relegated respondent no. 1 to the remedy of a suit. Had the respondent no. 1 been directed to seek his remedy by way of a suit the relief secured by him would have been wholly illusory because by the time he would succeed in the litigation, the term of the office of the President would have either already expired or be about to expire. The appellant in that event would have continued as the President of the Municipality even though he had ceased to enjoy the confidence of the requisite number of councillors. The entire concept of a democratic institution would thus have been set at naught. [79H; 8OB-C] (b)In a petition under Art. 226 the High Court has jurisdiction to try issues, both of fact and law. The words "as far as it can be made applicable" occurring in s. 141 of the Code of Civil Procedure make it clear that in applying the various provisions of the Code to proceedings other than those of a suit, the court must take into account the nature of those proceedings and the relief sought. The object of article 226 is to provide a quick and inexpensive remedy to aggrieved parties. Power has consequently been vested in the High Courts to issue orders: or writs. If the procedure of a suit had also to be adhered to in the case of writ petitions the entire purpose of having a quick and inexpensive remedy would be defeated. A writ petition under article 226 is essentially different from a suit and it would be incorrect to assimilate and incorporate the procedure of a suit into the proceedings of a petition under article 226. The High Court is not deprived of this jurisdiction to entertain a petition under article 226 merely because in considering the petitioner's right of relief, questions of fact may fall to be determined.

 (2)It is difficult to accede to this contention. Normally writ petitions, are decidedon the basis of affidavits.
 In some cases, however, where it is not possible for a court to arrive at a definite conclusion on account of there being affidavits of either side containing 'allegations and counter-allegations it would not only be desirable but in the interest of justice, it is the duty also of the court to summon a deponent for cross-examination in order to arrive at the truth. The fact that the court permits cross- examination of some of the deponents in a petition does not warrant the proposition that the court is bound to permit crossexamination of each and everyone of the deponents whom a party wishes to cross,examine.

 In the present case the discretion exercised by the High Court in selecting for cross-examination those deponents whom it considered to be crucial was proper and judicious.
 No prejudice was caused to any of the parties by the procedure adopted by the High Court. [82A-B] (3)From the fact that the High Court had permitted cross- examination of only some deponents it did not follow that the High Court was precluded from taking into consideration the affidavits of other deponents. Order permitting cross- examination of some of the deponents did not have the effect of obliterating from record the affidavits of other deponents. There is nothing wrong in the approach of the High Court in relying upon the affidavits of deponents who were not cross-examined on a conspectus of the entire circumstances of the case. 182H] (4)The submission must be rejected. It may be a matter of mournful reflection but all the same it is the acknowledgment of a stark reality that there has been in recent years in the case of some elected representatives so much erosion of moral values that they feel no compunction in repeatedly changing their loyalty and shifting their allegiance from one party leader to the other. Such representatives have a pliable conscience plainly because they succumb to III kinds of pressures and yield to all kinds of temptations. They bring a touch of melodrama and the kaleidoscopic nature of the local political scene is quite often a reflection of the sombre activities of these representatives. Against the backdrop of such activities there is nothing surprising or unusual in the conduct of the Councillor, [83H] (5)There is no imperative requirement in the case of a motion of no confidence that it should be passed on some particular ground. There is nothing in the language of s.
 36 of the Gujarat Municipalities Act which makes it necessary to specify a ground when passing a motion of no confidence against the President. Though according to the form prescribed the ground has to be mentioned, it does not follow that the ground must also be specified when a motion of no confidence is actually passed against a President.
 [86A-B] There is a difference between a motion of no confidence and a, censure motion. While it, is necessary in the case of censure motion to set out the ground or charge on which it is based, a motion of no confidence need not set out a ground or charge. A vote of censure presupposes that the persons censured have been guilty of some impropriety or lapse by act or omission. It may, therefore, become necessary to specify the impropriety or lapse while moving a vote of censure. No such consideration arises when a motion of no confidence is moved.

 Krishma lyer, J It acts enormously to inconvenience, expense and delay to insist on oral evidence for proof of every little relevant fact in judicial proceedings by suit or writ. Faith in viva voice examination tested by severe cross-examination has sometimes 73 been reduced to a legal superstitious. While screening the veracity of glib versions on vital matters of controversy by telling cross-examination in court is necessary, many facts.
 either formal, non-controversal or well-established other- wise, may well be proved by affidavit evidence. In a civil case reliance upon statements made before the police is not merely irrelevant but throws up suspicion because the police had no business to record any statement, as the High Court has it self pointed out.
