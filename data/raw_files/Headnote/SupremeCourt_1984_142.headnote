 The appellant, a limited company governed by the Companies Act, 1956 (for short, the Act) challenged before a Division Bench of the High Court the order of the Company Judge, winding up the appellant-company and appointing Official Liquidator, on three petitions moved by the creditors under s. 439 of the Act on the ground that the appellant-company was unable to pay its debts. The appellate Bench of the High Court disposed of the appeals after approving the scheme of compromise and arrangement under s.
 391 of the Act and directed that (i) the winding up order passed by the Company Judge shall be held in abeyance on certain undertakings being filed by the appellant company within the prescribed time before the High Court to abide by the conditions imposed in the judgment; (ii) the Official Liquidator will be considered as appointed to function as the provisional Liquidator on the first payment of Rs. 25 lacs being made within four weeks of the judgment; and (iii) in case of any default the winding up order will stand confirmed. Since then the scheme of compromise and arrangement was being implemented meticulously. In the course of implementation of the scheme the appellant company moved an application before the Appellate Bench praying that the provisional Liquidator be directed to file claim petitions under s. 446 (2) of the Act for realising the claims of the company which would further assist and facilitate the implementation of the scheme of compromise and arrangement as supervised by the Court. Respondent No. 1 opposed this application. The High Court while rejecting the application, held that as the winding up proceeding in respect of the appellant-company is no more pending and there is no court which could be said to be the court winding up the company, the claim petition on behalf of the company which is not being wound up could not be instituted as contemplated by s. 446 (2). Hence this appeal by special leave.
 Allowing the appeal, 512 ^ 
 HELD : (1) It would be advantageous to notice the historical evolution of the provision as well as its present setting before considering the true scope and ambit of the jurisdiction conferred on the court winding up a company by sec. 446(2) (b) of the Act. Section 171 of the Indian Companies Act 1913, which did not contain any provision similar or identical to that of sec. 446(2), is re-enacted with little modification as Sec. 446(1) of the Companies Act 1956 Since there was no specific provision in the repealed Companies Act 1913 conferring jurisdiction on the court winding up the company analogous to the one conferred by sec. 446(2), the official Liquidator in order to realise and recover the claims and subsisting debts owed to the company had the unenviable fate of filing suits. To save the company which is ordered to be wound up from this prolix and expensive litigation and to keep all incidental proceedings in winding up before the court which is winding up the company, its jurisdiction was enlarged by sec. 446(2) to entertain petition amongst others for recovering the claims of the company. This was the object behind enacting s.
 446(2) and therefore it must receive such construction at the hands of the court as would advance the object and at any rate not thwart it. [516H, 517A, B, 518A, B] 
 2. Section 446(1) provides that when a winding up order has been made or the official Liquidator has been appointed as provisional Liquidator, no suit or other legal proceeding shall be commenced, or if pending at the date of the winding up order, shall be proceeded with, against the company, except by leave of the Court and subject to such terms as the Court may impose. It envisages two situations in which the court will have jurisdiction to make the order thereunder contemplated. These two situations are: where a winding up order has been made or where the official Liquidator has been appointed as provisional Liquidator. The first of the two situations envisages an order for winding up of the company having been made and which is subsisting.
 The second situation is where without making a winding up order, the Court has appointed official liquidator to be the provisional Liquidator as contemplated by Sec. 450(1).
 [518D, 519E, F] Sub-Sec. (2) of Sec. 446 confers jurisdiction on the Court which is winding up the company to entertain and dispose of proceedings set out in clauses (a) to (d). The expression 'court which is winding up the company' will comprehend the Court before which a winding up petition is pending or which has made an order for winding up of the company and further winding up proceedings are continued under its directions. Undoubtedly, looking to the language of Sec. 446(1) and (2) and its setting in Part VII which deals with winding up proceedings would clearly show that the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain and dispose of proceedings set out 513 in sub-cls. (a) to (d) of sub-sec. (2) can be invoked in the court which is winding up the company. [520B-C] (3) Where a winding up petition is pending meaning thereby that an official Liquidator is appointed as provisional Liquidator which is a stage in the process of winding up, the court before which such proceeding is pending can be styled as a court winding up of the company and ipso facto it would have jurisdiction to entertain the proceeding enumerated in clauses (a) to (d) of sub-sec. (2) of sec. 446. If the winding up petition fails the proceedings pending in the court may have to be transferred to the court which can entertain the proceeding. But if the petition praying for winding up the company ends in a winding up order the proceedings intimated under sub-sec.
 (2) will have to be proceeded with till they are finally disposed of because winding up order will relate back to the date of the presentation of the winding up petition. In this view of the matter no anomalous situation can ever arise.
 Therefore, the apprehension of the High Court that if such jurisdiction is conferred on the court at a stage anterior to the winding up order being made but subsequent to the appointment of official Liquidator as provisional Liquidator an anomalous situation would arise is not well founded.
 [513B, C] (4) It is now well settled that a winding up order once made can be revoked or recalled but till it is revoked or recalled it continues to subsist. Now, it the winding up order is subsisting the court which made that order or the court which kept it in abeyance will have jurisdiction to give necessary directions to the provisional Liquidator to take recourse to s. 446(2). [522B-C] (5) In the instant case. The winding up order made by the learned Company Judge in respect of the appellant- company has neither been quashed set, aside, cancelled revoked nor recalled. Therefore, the winding up order was effectively subsisting but inoperative for the time being, having all the potentiality of being rejuvenated or being brought back to life. The High Court was in error in rejecting the application, since its approach in giving a restricted meaning to the expression 'court which is winding up the company' under sub sec. (2) by restricting it to the first situation under section 446(1) overlooks the objects and purpose sought to be achieved by introducing sub-section (2) in section 446.
