 Respondent No. 1 was granted certain land in Patiala State in 1946 for the purpose of promoting a company for the manufacture of Banaspatighee. After he had paid the costs of the land. possession of the said land was given to respondent No. 1 on November 17, 1946. On February 12, 1947 a promoting company was formed. There was an Agreement between the Patiala State and the promoting company. The third proviso to cl. 6(a) of the Agreement laid down inter alia that if the proposed company was wound.up the land granted to it would revert to Patiala State. On such reversion compensation would be paid by the State. The fourth proviso to cl. 6(a) further laid down that in the above case the land would be delivered to Patiala State by the proposed company within a reasonable time and the company would be under an obligation to remove its machinery etc. from such land within 24 months after a notice had been given in this regard by the State. If it was not removed within the notice period or a further period of 6 months which the State could allow the machinery etc. would become the property of the State. The proposed company (respondent No. 2 herein) was incorporated on May 27, 1948 but it never went into production. In 1951 respondent no. I filed a petition for the winding up of the company, in the name of the company. Two provisional liquidators were appointed, but the petition was dismissed as incompetent. Thereafter in, 1955 on a petition by certain shareholders an order for winding up of the company was passed by the High Court. The voluntary liquidators resigned and the Bank of Patiala as Official Liquidator entered into possession of the company's property and auctioned the same in 1959. Considering a claim by respondent No. 1 to the land a Single Judge of the High Court held that the land had vested in the company and respondent no. I was not entitled to it. The Division Bench held that the land belonged to the State but -the company would continue in possession till a valid notice was given in terms of the 4th proviso to cl. 6(a) of the Agreement. In appeal before this Court the State urged that the notice given by the Director of Industries to the provisional liquidators on August 14, 1952 was legally sufficient.
 
HELD : The title to the land had already vested in the State Government under the third proviso to cl. 6(a) of the Agreement because of the order of winding up of the company made by the High Court. There was nothing in the Agreement to 'show that the company was entitled to be in of the property even after the title had vested in the State Government. The 4th proviso only said that if the company did not deliver possession within reasonable time and if any machinery plant, buildings or structures remained on the land the title to these also would vest in the State Government if the company did -not remove the struc- 14 tures or the machinery within 24 months from the date of the notice. In the circumstances of the case it must be held that the notice given by the Director of Industries dated August 14, 1952 satisfied the requirements 'of the fourth proviso to cl. 6(a) of the Agreement. The notice period having expired, the State was entitled to possession of the land. [17 B-E]
