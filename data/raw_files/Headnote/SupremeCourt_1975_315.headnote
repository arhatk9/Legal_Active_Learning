 "R" an employee of the Government of C.P. & Berar on the formation of the State of Madhya Pradesh, carved out by merging the erstwhile States of Maha Koshal, Madhya Bharat, Vindhya Pradesh & Bhopal in 1956 was allotted to the new State of Madhya Pradesh. A provisional common gradation list of those officers of various departments allocated from the merging states was prepared, in accordance with the principles laid down and as per the States Reorganisation Act, 1956 on 3-10-1961 and published in the M.P. Government gazette on 28-10-1961. Objections if any, were also called for within a month therefrom from the affected employees. A final gradation list was prepared on November 7, 1964 and published in the official gazette on November 11, 1964. On October 1, 1964 the respondent, aggrieved by the position given to him in the gradation list represented that he should have been shown senior to five officers hailing from Maha Koshal Region because he was appointed as Assistant Sales Tax Officer in that region before them. The assigning of higher seniority to the said officers was after taking into consideration the fact of their holding posts carrying almost equivalent grade of the post held by the respondent.
 The respondent made another representation on February 2, 1965 and filed a writ on October 16, 1966. The rule nisi was made absolute on September 20, 1969, by the Madhya Pradesh High Court following an earlier decision of that Court in Kanhayalal Pandit's case decided on November 17, 1964 wherein it was held that the affected employees could make their representation only after the final gradation list is published. On appeal by special leave, the Court ^ 
 HELD : (i) The object of preparing a tentative or provisional gradation list was to give an opportunity to the officers whose seniority was determined in the list to make their representation in order to satisfy the Government regarding any mistake or error that had crept in the gradation list. If the employee concerned did not file his representation within a month from the date of the publication of the provisional gradation list, then his representation should have been rejected out right. [959 F- G] (ii) In fact the purport of S. 116 (5) (b) of the State Reorganisation Act, 1956 was that there should be a fair and equitable treatment of all persons affected by the provisions of that section. This could only be done if before a final gradation list was prepared the officers were given an opportunity to acquaint the Government with their respective points of view. It was indeed a strange view to take that the provisional gradation list was absolutely of no consequence and after the said list was finalised and the time for finalising representation expired, then alone the employees concerned should have been asked to file their representations. This is really putting the cart before the horse. Once the list was finalised, it would be difficult for the Government to review its orders which would lead to serious complications and dislocation of the service structure of the State. [960 B-D] (iii) It appears, from a perusal of the various clauses of S. 115 of the State Reorganisation Act that the Statute contemplated three stages for determining the seniority of the officers.
 (a) The formation of Advisory Committees and determination of principles on the basis of which the seniority was to be determined;
 956 (b) the preparation of a provisional gradation list so as to give an opportunity to the employees concerned to file their objections; and (c) the publication of the final gradation list after consideration of the objections file by the employees concerned and taking an overall view of the matter. [960 D- E] Kanahyalal Pandit v. State of Madhya Pradesh (Misc.
 Petition No. 188 of 1974 dt. 17-11-64 M.P. High Court) overruled.
 (iv) In the instant case, the equation of the posts based on a chalked out objective formula so that the least prejudice is caused to the employees concerned was in conformity with the principles laid down in S. 115 of the States Reorganisation Act. [961 E-F] (v) The Government had prepared the final gradation list after an objective and thorough consideration of the various aspects of the career of the employees and the principles which governed the list were wholly in consonance with the provisions of S. 115 of the States Reorganisation Act; 1966.
