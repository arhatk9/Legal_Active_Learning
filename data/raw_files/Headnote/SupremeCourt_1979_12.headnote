 The appellant was the husband of respondent No. 1.
 Relations between the husband and wife having been strained for some years they lived separately. On the husband's complaint that his wife had married another person during the subsistence of their marriage, she and accused no. 4 were convicted under s. 494 IPC.
 Allowing the wife's revision petition the High Court held the marriage to be void on the ground that there was no evidence to prove that the essential ceremonies required to be performed in a Hindu marriage, namely Dutta Homa and Saptapadi had been performed.
 In appeal to this Court the husband contended that under the custom followed by the community to which the parties belonged Saptapadi was not an essential requirement to constitute a valid marriage but that tying a yarn thread round the bride's neck at the time of marriage was sufficient to make a valid marriage and this having been done, the second marriage was valid and the wife was guilty of the offence under s. 494 IPC.
 Dismissing the appeal.
 ^ 
 HELD: The prosecution failed to prove that the second marriage was a valid marriage and, therefore, the High Court was justified in acquitting the respondents. [1022 F] Before a conviction can be recorded under s. 494 IPC the following ingredients must be sartisfied :- (1) that the complainant had been married to the accused;
 (2) that the accused contracted a second marriage while the first marriage was still subsisting; and (3) that both the marriages were valid and strictly according to law governing the parties. [1022 B] In the instant case there was no evidence to show that there was any custom among the parties out weighing the written text of law. Secondly, the husband had not clearly mentioned that the parties were governed by custom in derogation of Hindu Law. The priest who performed the marriage had shown complete ignorance as to whether or not the parties were governed by custom. The witness was, therefore, incompetent,to depose about the existence of any custom in the family of the parties. When the priest said that there was no custom of sacred fire and Saptapadi what he meant was that in the second marriage these two ceremonies had not been performed. [1022 C-D & 1021 G-H] 1020 In re: Dolgonti Raghava Reddy & Anr., AIR 1968 (AP) 117 held inapplicable.
