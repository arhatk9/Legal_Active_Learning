 The petitioners and appellants carried on the business of Pawn broking and money lending inter alia on the security of gold articles and ornaments. They challenged the validity of different provisions of the Gold Control Act, 1969. The contentions that fell for consideration were: (i) whether there was anything in the Act or the rules which constituted an unreasonable restriction on the part of a pawn broker to hold, acquire or dispose of property or carry on his business of money lending within the meaning of Art. 19(1) (f) and (g) of the Constitution not saved by sub-cls.(5) and (6) thereof; (ii) whether in the absence of a provision for notice to be given to him in case of any proceeding for confiscation the pawnee may be prejudicially affected without a hearing being given to him; (iii) whether s. 71 of the Act was ultra vires; (iv) whether the failure to make a distinction between 'article' and 'ornament' in the definition section was prejudicial to a dealer; (v) whether compliance with all the conditions laid down in form GS III under r. 4 of the Act may be impossible in a number of cases; (vi) whether it was difficult to comply with s. 16 of the Act as regards acquisition or transfer of gold as and when made, (vii) whether a pawn-broker or money lender was entitled to hold primary gold; (viii) whether certain government circulars had the effect of extending time for filing of declaration under s. 16(1) beyond 28th February 1969 ; (ix) whether s. 58(1) of the Act was violative of the Constitution and liable to be struck down; (x) whether s. 16 (1) of the Act being a general provision could not apply to pawn-brokers and money lenders who were governed by ss. 6, 10, 28; (xi) whether s. 16(1) was unreasonable as regards pawn brokers; (xii) whether the impugned Act encroached upon the field exclusively occupied by Andhra Pradesh Act XXIII of 1943 and Andhra Pradesh Act V of 1349F.
 
HELD: (i) If smuggling of gold into the country is to be checked by the prevention of the conversion of smuggled gold into gold articles or ornaments, there is no unreasonableness in the State calling upon all pawn brokers and persons who take pledges or hypothecation of ornaments to furnish declarations so that the Administrator and the Gold Control Officer may keep an eye on the activities of such persons and if necessary at any point of time, ask for a return in terms of s. 6 and satisfy himself about the legality of his acts by inspecting his accounts. It would not be difficult for anybody carrying on or wanting to carry on business lawfully to insist on the pawnor producing the copy of the declaration in his possession given to him after authentication by the Gold Control Officer in terms of 255 sub-s. (8) of s. 16 in order to satisfy himself that there was no contravention of the Act. The requirement of making a -declaration as often as a pwan broker acquires ownership possession, custody or control- of gold under sub-s. (4) is to be read with sub-s. (10) and it is enough for a pawn broker 'to approach the Gold Control Officer' with the full and detailed statements of his holding once, a month. [269D- E, G] As such it cannot be said that there is any unreasonable restriction in .the said provisions on holding property or pursuing one's business in terms of Art. 19(1) (f) or (g) of the Constitution. [269H] (ii) The contention that there being no provision for notice to be given to him in case of any proceeding for confiscation the pawnee may be prejudicially affected without a hearing being given to him had no substance inasmuch as he will be the person presumed to be the owner in terms of s. 99 and the gold can only be seized from his possession or custody. He can appear before the authorities and make his submissions so that no penal action should be taken against him. [270A-B] (iii) There is no justification for an order of confiscation of gold under s. 71 of the Act merely because of a failure to comply with s. 16 relating to declaration.
 It is no doubt true that the owner is to be given a hearing in terms of s. 79 and he has a right of appeal under s. 80 but the provision of s. 73 which allows the levy of a fine in lieu of confiscation not exceeding twice the value of the thing in respect of which confiscation is authorised appears to be unduly harsh and unconscionable. Under the Wealth tax Act the penalty for failure to file a return is much lighter. Section 71 therefore appears to place an unreasonable restriction on the right of a person to acquire hold and dispose of gold, articles or gold ornaments. It may be applied indiscriminately and cannot therefore be upheld as saved by cls. (5) and (6) of Art. 19 of Constitution. [270C-F] (iv) It cannot be said that the definition section does not make a clear distinction between an 'article' and an 'ornament'. The explanation to S. 2(p) shows that nothing made of gold which resembles an ornament will be deemed to be an ornament unless the thing (having regard to its purity, size, weight, description or workmanship) is such as is commonly used as ornament in any State. Clearly it is a question of proof as to whether the thing passes as an article or an ornament in a particular state. [270G] (v) It cannot be said that compliance with all the conditions laid down in form G. S. III under r. 4 of the Act is impossible. No doubt there may be difficulty in some cases where an article contains metals other than gold or precious stones, but a pawn broker who is asked to advance money on the security of such an article can make a fairly accurate estimate of the weight and value of the gold therein so as to be able to judge for himself how much he can safely advance on the security of that article. He is not called upon to give the exact purity of the gold content of the article. He can only give an estimate of its purity.
 [271A-C] (vi) There was no difficulty in regard to the primary gold found in possession of the petitioner in writ petition No.
 
24. Under s. 2(1) no person can own or have in his possession, custody or control, acquire or agree to acquire ownership, buy, accept or otherwise receive any primary gold except as provided in the Act and the pawn broker or money lender is not such a person. [271F] 256 (vii) The printed circulars to which attention was drawn did not show that there was any extension of time with regard to declarations under s. 16(1) beyond 28th February 1969. Reference to certain circulars addressed only to Gold Control officers to the effect that no steps were to be taken until after 30th April 1969 could not be availed of by the petitioner who was not in a position to assert that the circular had been publicly advertised or that he himself had received any copy of such circular. [272B].
 (viii) Section 58(1) of the Act which allows any Gold Control Officer authorised by the Administrator to enter and search any business premises if he has reason to suspect that any provision of the Act was being or was about to be contravened could not be struck down on the ground that the power to search was given without the same safeguards as in the Sea Customs Act, 1882 the Customs Act, 1962 or the Code of Criminal Procedure. There may be cases where it is necessary for the Gold Control Officer to act with expedition in the matter of search so that the information that he is going to search a premises may not leak out and the only safety in this regard is that the Gold Control Officer must be authorised by the Administrator in this behalf and he in his turn if he is empowered by the Central Government may authorise other Government Officers to enter and search the premises. In the present case the counter- affidavit showed that the officer searching had information regarding the contravention of the provisions of the Act and the result of the search showed that huge quantity of gold was lying with the petitioner in respect of which no declaration had been made. The Gold Control Act is not the only Provisions of law where power to search on suspicion has been conferred on an officer. In this connection reference may be made to s. 41 of the Madras General Sales Tax Act 1 of 1959 which came up for consideration before this Court in the Commissioner Commercial Taxes, Board of Revenue, Madras v. Ramkishan Srikishan Iyer etc., C.A. Nos.
 150/68 dt. 9-8-1967. [272D-H] (xi) Section 16 is not excluded in the case of money lenders or pawn brokers. Any person who comes under the purview of s. 16(1) has to make a declaration unless there is any provision to the contrary in that Chapter. The only provision to the contrary is contained in sub-s. (5) which permits of exemptions in respect of persons holding gold articles or ornaments up to a specified limit. The provision in s. 6(1) empowering the Administrator to call upon any pawn broker to furnish a return does not do away with his obligation to file a declaration under s. 16(1).
 There is no question of duplication of declarations here.
 Every pawn broker will have to file his declaration under s.
 16(1) and he would be obliged to make a return only when he is called upon to do so in terms of s. 6. If a number of pawn brokers carry on business in partnership the declaration can be made by any partner of the firm in terms of cl. (f) and if a company carries on business of pawn broking any person in charge of the management of the affairs of the company can make the declaration. [274A-F] (x) There was no substance in the argument that a pawn broker only kept things in his safe custody and it would be very oppresive on him if he had the obligation to make a declaration as often as he got in a gold article under a pledge or parted with it on redemption. A money lender.
 specially a pawn broker who enters into a number of transactions of pledge every day has to maintain his account books and he has to record faithfully therein the articles he receives by way of pledge including their weight and general description when he takes them in and making a declaration for the purpose of the Act cannot entail any hardship on such a person.

 (xi) By the Gold Control Act Parliament only sought to control and regulate the production, manufacture etc. use and possession of and the business in gold, gold ornaments etc. It did not seek to disturb or annul the provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Acts dealing with pawn brokers and money lenders. The provisions of the State Acts are to have full play and effect so long as the Gold Control Act is not violated. [275E] Accordingly, save that s. 71 of the Act is unconstitutional, the writ petition and appeals must be dismissed. [275G]:,
