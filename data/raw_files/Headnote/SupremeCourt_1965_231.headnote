 The appellant gave certain mines on lease to a Syndicate in lieu of rents and royalty. By cl. 1 Part VII of the indenture of lease the Syndicate was also required to discharge all public demands in respect of the mines made by the State Government, or the local authority, except land revenue. In compliance with the said clause the Syndicate paid certain sums for the periods ending July 31, 1951 and July 31, 1952 to the appellant as 'Local Fund Cess'. This Cess was calculated by the Syndicate as a percentage of the rent and royalties paid for the mines whereas under the relevant law the cess had to be a percentage of the land revenue, and therefore the sums paid were much larger than due. For the assessment years 1952-53 and 1953-54 the Income-tax Officer having jurisdiction over the area treated the amounts so paid 10 the appellant as part of his income.
 The appellant filed an appeal before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and contended that the two sums were not tax- able because they represented Local Fund Cess collected by him on behalf of the State Government or Local Board, and also because they were receipts "of a casual and non- recurring nature." These contentions were accepted by the;
 Appellate Assistant Commissioner but the Tribunal and the High Court in a reference under s. 66 of the Income-Tax Act upheld the view of the Income Tax Officer. The appellant came to this Court with certificate.
 
HELD : (i) The Syndicate was not an inferior holder under the appellant. It was the appellant who was the holder, and the liability to pay the local fund cess under the Bombay Land Revenue Code was his. Under the terms of Part VII cl.
 1 of the indenture of lease the Syndicate had agreed to pay to the appellant the amount of local fund cess which the latter had to pay to the Government. But by collecting the amount from the Syndicate under the terms of his contract, the appellant was not constituted an agent of the Government for recovering the cess. [446 A-C] (ii) The Syndicate merely sought to discharge what it believed was its contractual obligation under the lease and in doing so it made payments which exceeded the local fund cess payable by the appellant. The amounts so paid had a quality, if not identical, closely similar to rents and royalty. It was immaterial that if the true position had.
 been appreciated the, Syndicate might not have paid the amounts. They were in fact paid by the Syndicate and were received and appropriated by the appellant as if he was entitled to receive them. The difference between the amounts which the appellant received and the amounts for which he could under the terms of the lease claim reimbursement must therefore 441 be regarded as income within the meaning of the Indian Income-tax Act, and unless specially exempted, liable to tax. [445 E-G, H] (iii) There is nothing in the Income-tax Act which prevents the Revenue authorities from determining the quantum of the amount which is payable by the appellant as local fund cess, when that question properly arises before them in the course of proceedings for assessment. [446 D] (iv) the fact that the Syndicate had filed suits to recover the excess amounts paid to the appellant as local fund cess did not affect the issue. The appellant had received certain amount under a contract with the Syndicate and if that amount was income the fact that the person who paid it might claim refund would not deprive it of its character of income in the year in which it was received. [447 G-H] (v) Assuming that the amounts sought to be included as income were paid as a result of some mistake on the part of the Syndicate, they had not the characteristic of casualness and it was not suggested that they were non- recurring.
