 The Tamil Nadu Entertainment Tax Act, 1939 provides for levy of entertainment tax on admission to cinema theatres in the State of Tamil Nadu. Until 1978 the entertainment tax was levied on the basis of 'admission system' i.e. on the actual number of tickets sold. In 1978 the Act was amended and section 5(A) and 5(B) were introduced. These sections introduced the 'composition system' of collection of entertainment tax 165 under which tax was levied based upon the gross collection capacity of cinema theatres irrespective of the actual number of tickets sold. However, the newly introduced 'composition system' was not made applicable to the entire State. While the theatres situated within the Municipal Corporations of Madras, Madurai, Coimbatore and the Special grade municipalities continued to be governed by the original system of taxation i.e. 'admission system' the theatres situated in all other local areas of the State were governed by the composition system.
 In 1989 the Act was further amended and Sub-section (1) of Section 5(A) of the Act was substituted. By this amendment, the percentage of entertainment tax via-a-vis the rates of admission in force in corporation and special grade municipality areas was reduced from 53% to 40%. At the same time all the theatres situated within the radius of five kilometers from the peripheral limits of such areas (belt) which were hitherto governed by the composition system were brought over to the admission system. However, the temporary and open air theatres even though located in the belt of five kilometers were excluded from this switch-over.
 The appellants challenged the validity of section 5(A)(1) by filing various writ petitions which were dismissed by a Division Bench of the Madras High Court.
 In appeals to this Court, it was contended on behalf of the appellants (1) that the Amendment Act is arbitrary and violative of Article 14 inasmuch as (a) it classifies theatres situated in a local area into two categories subjecting one such category to a hostile treatment; (b) it equates the theatres situated in village panchayats and village townships and other lesser grade municipalities with the theatres in corporation areas and special grade municipalities area and that such a classification has no relation to the object of the enactment; (2) exemption of temporary and open theatres from the 'admission system' of taxation is discriminatory; (3) the impugned provisions are confiscatory in nature and they constitute an unreasonable restriction upon the petitioners' fundamental right to trade guaranteed by Article 19(1)(g); (4) The petitioners had come to entertain a legitimate expectation, based on legislative practice, that they would not be brought over to 'admission system' of taxation.
 Dismissing the appeals, this Court, 166 
 HELD: 1. The Tamil Nadu Legislature is competent to declare that the theatres situated within the five kilometer radius (belt) of the municipal corporation areas and the areas of special grade municipalities shall be subjected to the same method of taxation as the theatres situated within the said areas. The Act no doubt adopt the local areas declared under the Tamil Nadu Municipal Corporation Act, Tamil Nadu Municipalities Act and Tamil Nadu Gram Panchayats Act as the basis for prescribing the rate of taxation. But it must be remembered that it was not obligatory upon the legislature to do so. It could have adopted any other basis. It is only for the sake of convenience that the existing local areas - convenient existing units of references - were adopted, it is not a question of power but one of convenience. [177C-D] 
 1.1 The theatres situated within the belt are proximate to the corporation and special grade municipality areas and thus enjoy a certain advantage which the theatres beyond the belt do not. They draw custom from within the corporation areas by virtue of their proximity. The corporation areas have a larger percentage of affluent persons than other areas, who have more money at their disposal. They spend more on entertainment. The municipal boundary has no significance for them. If there is a good picture in a theatre situated beyond the municipal corporation limits they would go and see it. [177H, 178A-B] 
 1.2 The classification or the distinction made between theatres situated within the belt and the theatres outside the belt is not an unreasonable one. The material placed before the Court shows that theatres situated within the belt are substantially in the same position as those within the corporation or special grade municipality areas, if not better. The theatres within the belt are akin to and comparable to the theatres situated within the areas of corporations and Special Grade Municipalities. Further it is not disputed that the admission system fetches more revenue to the State. It is precisely for this reason that the said system is continued in the major cities. It cannot be said that the classification has no nexus to the object.
 [178H, 179A-C] 
 2. The argument that if the theatres situated within a gram panchayat or a lesser grade municipality are to be equated with the theatres within the corporation and other areas they should also be allowed to charge the rates of admission prevalent in corporation areas 167 cannot be accepted. Firstly, rates of admission do not merely depend upon the category of local areas but also upon the amenities provided in the theatres. Secondly, the very system of levy in both areas is different. Under section 4 i.e., admission system the rate of tax was 53% of the admission charge, which is now brought down to 40% by the impugned Amendment Act on the actual number of tickets sold whereas in respect of theatres governed by composition system, the rate of levy is upon the gross collection capacity irrespective of the actual number of tickets sold for a show or over a week. Thirdly, the rates of admission are prescribed under a different enactment. [179F-H, 180A] Moreover, the petitioners are not suffering any real prejudice. Whichever the system of taxation, the amount collected by way of entertainment tax is to be made over to the State. Even under the composition system, the formula evolved is supposed to represent the amount really collected by way of entertainment tax. It may be that in a given case or probably in many cases - the exhibitors may be saving a part of the amount collected by way of entertainment tax by paying only the compounded amount. But it may not necessarily be so. There may be theatres where the formula may work to their prejudice because of their low occupancy rate. In any event, the mere fact that an exhibitor is able to save a part of the tax by paying the compounded amount cannot be treated as a benefit in law which he is deprived by following the admission system. [180B-D] 3.Open-air theatres and temporary theatres stand on a different footing from permanent theatres. They suffer from several disadvantages which the others do not. They are a class apart. If the impugned provision has treated them as a separate class, no objection can be taken thereto. [181B] 
 4. The theory of legitimate expectation based upon legislative practice cannot be brought in to defeat or invalidate a legislation. It may at the most be used against an administrative action, and even there it may not be an indefeasible right. No case has been brought to the notice of the Court where a legislation has been invalidated on the basis that it offends the legitimate expectation of the persons affected thereby.

 5. The impugned change-over to the 'admission system' does not 168 amount to unreasonable restriction upon the petitioners' fundamental right to trade. [182A] 
 6. Article 14 of the Constitution enjoins upon the State not to deny any persons 'Equality before law' or 'the equal protection of law' within the territory of India. The two expressions do not mean the same thing even if there may be much in common. Their meaning and content has to be found and determined having regard to the context and scheme of our Constitution. The word "law" in the former expression is used in a generic sense - a philosophical sense - whereas the word "laws" in the latter expression denotes specific laws in force. [173C-E] 
 7. Equality before law is a dynamic concept having many facets. One facet - the most commonly acknowledge - is that there shall be no privileged person or class and that none shall be above law. A facet which is of immediate relevance herein is the obligation upon the State to bring about, through the machinery of law, a more equal society envisaged by the preamble and part IV of our Constitution.
 For equality before law can be predicate meaningfully only in an equal society i.e., in a society contemplated by Article 38 of the Constitution. [173F-G] 
 8. The instrument of taxation is not merely a means to raise revenue in in India; it is, and ought to be, a means to reduce inequalities. It is for this reason that while applying the doctrine of classifications - developed mainly with reference to and under the concept of "equal protection of law" - Parliament is allowed more freedom of choice in the matter of taxation vis-a-vis other laws. If this be the situation in the case of direct taxes, it should be more so in the case of indirect taxes, since in the case of such taxes the real incidence is upon some other than upon the person who actually makes it over to the State, though, it is true, he cannot avoid the liability on the ground that he has not passed it on. In the matter of taxation it is, thus, not a question of power but one of constraints of policy- the interest of economy, of trade, profession and industry, the justness of the burden, its 'acceptability' and other similar consideration. But this does not mean that taxation laws are immune from attack based upon Article 14.It is only that parliament and legislatures are accorded a greater freedom and latitude in choosing the persons upon whom and the situations and stage at which it can levy tax. Under the Constitution, there is an added obligation upon he State to employ the power of taxation-nay, all its powers - to achieve the goal 169 adumbrated in Article 38.
