 The grantee of a monopoly from the Government to manufacture sugar, transferred his rights, with the permission of the Government, to the appellant-company (assessee), under an agreement., Under the terms of the grant and the agreement, the assessee was liable to pay royalty at Z% on the price of sugar manufactured by the assessee and this rate was revisable, if after five years, it was found to be excessive; but no other tax was to be charged on the sugar manufactured. The assessee had to pay to the transferor and to his nominee, every year 1 1/4% of the net profits of its business, in lieu of the monopoly rights and licence.
 For the assessment years 1950-53, the assessee claimed that, (a) The ,amount paid to the transferor in respect of the monopoly and licence, and (b) the royalty paid to the Government in respect of the sugar manufactured were deductible expenses but the Department, Tribunal and the High Court, on reference, held against the assessee.
 Partly allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The payments in respect of the monopoly rights are of a capital nature, but the royalties paid are of a revenue nature deductible under s., 10(2) (xv) of the Income-tax Act, 1922. [436B-C] None of the tests laid down in the various decisions for determining whether an expenditure incurred in bringing into existence an asset is of a capital or revenue nature' is either exhaustive or universal, because, it is not always easy to determine whether a particular asset belongs to one :category or the other; nor does it depend in any way on what may be the ,nature of the asset in fact or in law. The determining factor depends largely on the nature of the trade in which the asset is employed and the quality of the payment therefore. [434C-D, F] In the present case, (1) no arguments were addressed regarding payments in respect of monopoly rights and licence. [433 B] (2) As regards the royalty on the sugar manufactured (a) the words no other tax will be charged' suggest that what was being charged, was intended to be a tax in some form and (b) the payment of the royalty is directly related to the sugar manufactured by the appellant and is not for securing an enduring advantage. Therefore, the expenditure is a revenue expenditure. [433E; 434F-G; 435E] Gotan Lime Syndicate Y. Commissioner of I.T. 59 I.T.R. 718 and Associated Stone Industries (Kotah) Ltd. v.
