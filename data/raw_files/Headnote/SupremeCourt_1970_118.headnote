 The respondent was a manufacturer of medicinal or toilet preparations which fell within the definition of "excisable articles" on which excise duty was payable under s. 3 (6) (c) of the Punjab Excise Act, 1914. Under s. 6 read with Entry 37 in Schedule B of the East Punjab General Sales Tax Act, 1948, all goods on which duty was leviable under the Punjab Excise Act, 1914, were exempt from the levy of sales tax. After the commencement of the constitution, alcoholic preparations which, under the Government of India Act, 1935, were a provincial subject, fell within the Union List and in 1955 the Union Parliament enacted the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations (Excise Duties) Act. This Central Act repealed any State laws corresponding to the Act and brought about uniformity in all States in the imposition of excise duty on alcoholic preparations.
 The respondent was assessed to sales tax on alcoholic preparations for the years 1959-60 to 1961-62 as the Sales Tax authorities considered that the respondent could no longer claim the benefit of the exemption contained in Entry 37 of Schedule B of the Act. The respondent challenged the levy of sales tax by a writ petition which was allowed by the High Court on the view that by virtue of s. 8 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, the reference in Entry 37 to the Punjab Excise Act must be taken to be a reference to the relevant provisions of the Central Act.
 On appeal to this Court, 
HELD:Dismissing the appeal, The High Court was right in saying that there was nothing in s.. 8 of the General Clauses Act to indicate that the words "former enactment" in that provision meant only a Central enactment and not a State enactment. According to s. 3(19) "enactment" shall include any provision contained in any Act. [444 G-H] Furthermore it could never be intended that when an Act passed by the Union Parliament repeals a State Act the principle underlying s. 8 should never become applicable.
