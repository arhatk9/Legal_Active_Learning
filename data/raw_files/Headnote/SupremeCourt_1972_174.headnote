 The petitioner was detained under ss. 3(2) and 5 of the Jammu & Kashmir Preventive Detention Act 1964 by an order of the District Magistrate. According to the grounds of detention supplied to the petitioner be was in the service of Pakistan Intelligence and had also recruited other persons to supply military information to Pakistan Intelligence. After the Advisory Board had given its opinion holding that the detention was justified, the State Government confirmed the order of detention. The petitioner filed a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution.
 The Court rejected the contention of the petitioner that he was already In custody when the order of detention was passed. The Court also found that the activities of the petitioner were prejudicial to the security of the Slate within the meaning of s. 3(i) of the Act. On the question whether the failure of the State Government to specify the period of detention introduced an infirmity in the detention of the petitioner, 
HELD : It is difficult to infer from the language of section 12 of the Act that the State Government while confirming the detention order should also specify the period of detention.
 AR that the section requires is that, if the Advisory Board has reported that there is, in its opinion, sufficient cause for the detention of the person, the Government may confirm the detention order. There is nothing in the section which enjoins upon the Government to specify the period of detention also while confirming the detention order. [873E- F] Further it is not always practicable and feasible 'for the State Government at the time of confirming the detention order to specify the period of detention. The continued detention of the detenu, subject to the maximum period prescribed by the Act, depends upon a variety of factors and the State Government would have to take into account all the circumstances including fresh developments and subsequent events in deciding whether to keep the detenu in detention for the maximum period or to release him earlier. It has accordingly been provided in sub-section (2) of section 13 of the Act that the State Government would have the power to revoke or modify the detention order at any time earlier than the expiry of two years from the date of detention.
