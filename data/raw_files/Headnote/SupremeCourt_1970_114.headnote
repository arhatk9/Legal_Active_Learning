 The appellant was a Jagirdar of the erstwhile Gwalior State which marged in the State of Madhya Bharat (now Madhya Pradesh).The Madhya Bharat Abolition of Jagir Act 1951 abolished Jagirs with effect from December 4, 1952. Under s. 8 of the Act compensation was payable in accordance with the principles laid down in Schedule 1 of the Act, Under sub-section (2) of that section the compensation payable became due as from the date of the resumption of the Jagir.
 Simple interest was payable at 2 1/2 per cent per annum from that date up to the date of payment of the amount of compensation which was payable within a period of 10 years in annual instalments. The appellant claimed before the income-tax Officer that the amount of interest formed part of the compensation and constituted a capital receipt. Tile claim was disallowed by the Income-tax Officer as well as by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. The Tribunal, however, held that the amount of interest was a capital receipt which could not be included in the assessee's income. In reference, the High Court held against the appellant. In appeal to this Court by special leave.
 
HELD : Under S. 8 of the Jagir Act the compensation amount is determined in accordance with the principles laid down in Schedule I became due to the Jagirdar from the date of resumption. Since the entire amount was not to be paid on the date of the resumption but was to be paid by instalments extending over 10 years, a provision had to be made for the payment of interest in sub-s. (2). The amount of interest was thus given to the Jagirdar for being kept out of the compensation amount for the aforesaid period. The legislature being well aware of the distinction between compensation and interest, employed clear language which leaves no room for doubt that, under sub-s. (2) interest was payable in a well understood sense and it could never form part of the compensation. [425 E-H] The fact that the marginal heading of s. 8 was 'Duty to pay compensation' could not lead to a different conclusion. The marginal heading cannot control the words of a section, particularly, when the language is clear and unambiguous.
