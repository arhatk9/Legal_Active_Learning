 The Government acquired appellant's land for a company for setting up a textile machinery parts factory. The entire compensation for the acquisition was to be paid by the company. The Government was satisfied that the product of the company would be useful to the public and the agreement between the company and the Government provided that those who had business with the company shall have access to the land and works.
 The notifications under ss. 4 and 6 of the Land acquisition Act, 1894, were issued showing that the land was acquired for the company. The appellant contended that the notification under s.
 6 was invalid as the acquisition was not for the construction of any work which was likely to prove useful to the public as contemplated by s. 40 (1)(b) read with cl. (5) of s. 41.
 ^ Held, (per Gajendragadkar, Wanchoo, Das Gupta and Ayyangar, JJ., Sarkar, J. contra), that the notification under s. 6 of the Act was invalid and the proceedings should be quashed. Section 40 (1)(b), which alone could apply to the case, provided that in case of acquisition for a company the Government could give its consent if the acquisition was needed for the construction of some work which was likely to prove useful to the public. For such cases cl. (5) of s. 41 provided that the agreement between the company and the Government shall state the terms on which the public shall be entitled to use the works. These provisions had to be read together and required that the work should be directly useful to the public and that the agreement should contain a term as to how the public shall have the right to use the work directly themselves. The provision of access to the land or works to those having business with the company or the fact that the product of the company would be useful to the public were not sufficient to bring the acquisition for a company within the meaning of the relevant words in ss. 40 and 41. The satisfaction of the Government that the work was likely 150 to prove useful to the public upon a wrong construction of s. 40 and s. 41 was not binding.
 The conclusiveness attached by s. 6(3) to the notification under s. 6(1) was only to this extent that the land was needed for the purposes of a company and this was not in dispute.

 Per Sarkar, J.-The acquisition for the company to set up a textile machinery parts factory was for some work which was likely to prove useful to the public and was valid. The work contemplated in s. 40(1)(b) was work from which the public could in any way derive benefit, whether by direct use of the work or by enjoyment of the fruits of the activities carried on there or otherwise; it could not be confined to a construction for philanthropic purpose or to such work as could be itself used by the public. The meaning could not be restricted by cl. (5) of s.
 41 as that would defeat the intention of the statute. The provisions in the agreement about the terms on which the public would be entitled to use the work were inapplicable to cases where the work was such that the public could not use it.
