 The respondents were dealers in fruits in Tamil Nadu.
 Originally under the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939 the sale of fruits was liable to tax. By means of a notification dated March 25, 1954 the sale of fruits among other commodities was exempted from payment of tax under s.
 6 of the Act. The 1939 Act was repeated and re-enacted by the Madras (now Tamil Nadu) General Sales Tax Act. 1959 which was published in the official gazette on March 18, 1959. The State Government passed G.O. No. 976 on March 28, 1959 by which the new Act was to come into force from April 1, 1959. To the G.O. was annexed a notification under s. 17 of the Act which was directed to be published on April 1, 1959 and was to come into force on that date. According to the notification fresh fruits ceased to be exempt from tax under the Act. Subsequently fresh fruits were again exempted with effect from April 1, 1960. Thus it was only during the assessment year 1959-60 that, the respondents were liable to pay tax on the sale of fresh fruits under the provisions of the Act. By the judgment under appeal the High Court struck down notification No. 976 dated March 28, 1959 which was to take effect from April 1, 1959 on the ground that it had been issued before the Act came into force. The respondents were held to be entitled by reason of the saving provision of s. 61 of the Act to invoke the exemption that had been granted under the earlier Act of 1939. By special leave appeals were filed by the State of Madras in this Court.
 
 HELD : The mere fact that the impugned notification bore an earlier date was of no consequence. Section 53(4) of the Act expressly provides that all notifications under the Act shall, unless they are expressed to come into force on a particular date come 'into force on the day an which they are published. The notification in question was stated to come into 'force on April 1, 1959. Besides it was published on that very day. Therefore in terms of cl. (b) of s. 53(4) of the Act the notification bad come into force only on April 1, 1959 and not earlier. No one had challenged nor indeed could it be disputed that on April 1, 1959 a valid notification could be issued under s. 17 of the Act. For this reason alone the validity of the notification must be upheld. [460 B-E] The appeals must accordingly be allowed.
 Bopanna Venkateswaraloo & Ors. v. Supt. Central Jail, Hyderabad, State, [1952] INSC 59; [1953] S.C.R. 905, held inapplicable.
