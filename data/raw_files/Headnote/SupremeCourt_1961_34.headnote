 Item 8 of the schedule to s. 167, Sea Customs Act, 1878, provides that any person concerned in the importation or exportation of prohibited goods shall be liable to a penalty "not exceeding three times the value of the goods, or not exceeding one thousand rupees." The petitioner was found to have imported gold of the value of Rs' 25,000/- and the Customs authorities imposed a penalty of Rs. 5,000/-. The petitioner challenged the validity of the order imposing the penalty on the ground that the. maximum penalty that could be imposed under item 8 of s. 167 was Rs. 1,000/-.
 Held, that the orders imposing the penalty was valid. It is open to the Customs authorities to impose any of the alternative penalties provided though the amount of it exceeds the amount of the maximum in the other alternative.
 None of the previous decisions of the Supreme Court were authority for the proposition that the maximum penalty which can be imposed under item 8 of s. 167 is Rs. 1,000/- as this question did not arise in those cases. On the plain language of the provision which was in the affirmative form it gave ail option to the Customs authorities to impose any one of the two penalties provided. The relevant words could not be read as "shall not be liable to a penalty exceeding three times the value of the goods, or exceeding one thousand rupees. " Maqbool Hussain v.
