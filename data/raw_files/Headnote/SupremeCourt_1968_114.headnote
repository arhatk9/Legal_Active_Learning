 S who held a Talukdari Estate governed by the provisions of the Oudh Estates Act 1 of 1869 died without legitimate children. Eight days before his death on June 21, 1900 he executed a will under which (a) his widow J was directed to adopt a son as soon as possible, (b) the Court of Wards was to manage the estate tiff a male successor could take over the management, (c) J was during her life-time to be paid a monthly allowance of one thousand rupees. In 1901 J, as directed by the aforesaid will, adopted a son B. Till 1920 when B attained majority the Court of Wards managed the estate and thereafter it was managed by B. In 1932, one year before J's death, B executed a deed of Trust in respect of the estate properties principally for the benefit of his creditors with the residue in favour of his son 'the Senior Rajkumar in 1936 B revoked this deed. In 1946 he made a will bequeathing the estate in favour of his second son 'the Junior Rajkumar After his death in the same year there was litigation between 'the Senior Rajkumar' and the 'Junior Rajkumar' the former claiming the estate under the Trust Deed of 1932 and the latter under (the Will of 1946. The trial court held that the Trust Deed was validly executed and that the will was operative in respect of she properties not covered by the Trust. The High Court in appeal also held the Trust Deed to be valid. The Junior Rajkumar appealed to this Court. On the contentions of the parties the following questions arose for consideration : (i) Whether on a true interProtation of the will of S. interest in the estate was intended to be conferred on B; (ii) Whether the will of S, having been made less than three months before his death it could operate in favour of B in view of the provision in s. 13(1) of the Oudh Estates Act;
 (iii) Whether in view of s. 22(7) of the Act B had a vested interest in the estate during the life-time of J; (iv) whether B's adoption related back to the date of the death of S.; (v) whether before the trust deed 'was executed by B in 1932 he had acquired title to the estate by adverse possession against J; (vi) whether S. 43 of the Transfer of Property Act precluded the appellants from challenging the Trust Deed.
 
HELD : (i) In the will of S. it was laid down that after his death his wife should adopt a son and the Court of Wards should manage the estate on behalf of the son so adopted.
 This indicates by necessary 2 implication that the adopted son was on adoption intended to be the beneficiary of the estate [7F] (ii) The son adopted by the widow in pursuance of the authority from the talukdar would under the provisions of the Act, be deemed to he a person who would have succeeded to the estate or interest therein within the meaning of s.
 13(1) of the Act. Therefore the fact that S died within there months of the date, when his will was executed and attested did not operate under s. 13 of the Act as a bar to the acquisition of an interest by B under the will of S.

 (iii) But under the will of S. the devise of the residue in favour of B could become effective, only on his adoption by J. Between the date of the death of S. and the adoption of a son there was intestacy in respect of the talukdari estate. As under Hindu law, so under the Oudh Estates Act 1869 the estate did not remain in abeyance. On the death of the testator therefore the widow took the estate by virtue of s. 22(7) of the Act. [4D-E] (iv) Under sub-Cl.(7) of s. 22, in default of heirs mentioned in cls.(1) to (6) of that section the widow takes the estate for her life-time whatever be the personal law governing her husband dying intestate. Her interest in the estate was not liable to be defeated once it was vested in her. She held the estate for the natural life-time : the son adopted by her in pursuance of the authority of her husband did not divest her of the estate. The adopted son inherited the estate on her death under cl. (8) of s. 22 and not before. The adopted son was undoubtedly an heir but he has during the lifetime of the widow no interest in the estate. [15F-16B] Accordingly B was not competent in 1932 when J. was still alive, to settle the estate for the benefit of his creditors and the Trust Deed relied on by the respondents was inoperative in regard to the talukdari estate.

 (v) The doctrine of Hindu law by which the adoption of -a son by the widow by the authority of her husband relates back to the death of the husband could have no application to taluqdari estates as such a rule would be contrary to the express provision in s. 22(7) which is applicable to all communities. [17G-18A] (vi) By the mere fact that she did not have management of the estate but was only given a pension J. did not lose her title to the property which devolved on her under s. 22(7).
 B was living with her and it did not appear that she was excluded from the estate or -any part thereof. Mere erroneous admission of title of another person without effective deprivation of possession did not result in extinction of her title by adverse possession. [20A-B] (vii) Section 43 of the Transfer of Property Act applies only to cases where the transfer is for consideration and not otherwise. The Trust Deed of 1932 was not executed for consideration. The doctrine of feeding the estoppel embodied in s. 43 relied on by the respondents had therefore, no application to the case. [20F-21C] 3
