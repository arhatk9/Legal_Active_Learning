 The Assistant Collector of Central Excise issued an authorization 'under s. 126(L)(2) of the Defence of India (Amendment) Rules, 1963 (Gold Control Rules) for searching the premises of the appellant. As a result of the search undeclared gold and certain other articles as well as documents were seized. The appellant's writ petition under Art. 226 challenging the search on various grounds was dismissed. In appeal by certificate, 
HELD : (i) Mala fides had not been proved against the officer authorized to make the search [342 C] (ii) The authorization order could. not be said to be defective merely because it did not expressly employ the phrase 'reason to believe' occurring in s. 105 of the- Customs Act. The phraseology used in the order meant, in effect and substance, the same thing. [342 E-F] (iii) While it may be advisable and indeed proper for the Assistant Collector to give in the authorization order the reasons for his belief that a search is necessary, the non-mention of reasons would not by itself vitiate the order. Nor can all the particulars of the nature of the goods and of the documents be mentioned in the order as they will be known only after the search is made The specifications given in the present case,were sufficient to enable the officer authorized to make the search [343 C-D] (iv) The word by in s.2(34) refers both to the Board and the Collecter and therefore both the Board- and the Collector of Customs can assign functions to an officer of Customs. [343 H] (v) It cannot be said that the Assistant Collector of Customs must in authorizing search also record his reasons for doing so on the ground that s. 165(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure which makes such a provision is made applicable to searches under s. 105 of the Customs Act.
 While under S.--105 of the Act the Assistant Collector of Customs either makes the search personally or authorizes any officer of Customs to do so, if he has reasons to believe the facts mentioned therein, under s. 165(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure the recording of the reasons for believing the facts is only to enable him to make a search urgently in a case where search warrants in the ordinary course cannot be obtained. It is, therefore, not possible to invoke the condition and apply it to a situation arising under s. 105 of the Act [345 B-D] 341 (VI) Section 105 of the Customs Act does not confer an unguided and arbitrary power on the Assistant Collector of Customs to make a search. A deeper scrutiny of the provisions indicates not only a policy but also effective checks on the exercise of the power of search by the Assistant Collector. The section does not therefore offend Art. 14 of the Constitution. [346 D] (vii) The High Court on the materials placed before it, held that the Assistant Collector had acted with reasonable belief in the facts mentioned in s. 105. There, was no justification for interfering with the findings of the High Court. [346 E-F] 'Durga Prasad v. H. R.
