 The petitioner owned certain land. There was an earlier attempt to acquire the land of the petitioner by sanctioning a housing accommodation scheme by- the Indore Improvement Trust under the Madhya Pradesh Town Improvement Trust Act, 1960. The said scheme was, however, cancelled. The petitioner wanted to develop his. land for industrial purposes and, therefore, obtained No Objection Certificates from various Government Departments as well as from the Trust. The petitioner got his land converted from agricultural purpose to industrial purpose subject to the limitation that the construction work had to be approved by the Trust. The Trust, however, refused the No Objection Certificate for development of the land on individual basis on the ground that a scheme was being approved for the land in question and other neighbouring lands. The Trust framed a scheme which included the land of the petitioner also.
 The Trust served a notice to acquire the petitioner's land for the purpose of the scheme. The petitioner submitted his objection stating that the land was being developed into industrial area and several small scale industries were functioning there and, as such, development was alreadyin progress. Thereafter, the Trust published a notice acquiring the said land. Before the Trust could take possession of the petitioner's land the petitionerfiled a Writ Petition in this Court.
 It was contended on behalf of the petitioners :
 (1) The Housing Accommodation Scheme is invalid because it does not specify the class of inhabitants for whom the same has been made.
 (2) The scheme being a Housing Accommodation Scheme it is for residential occupation only and it is not competent to include plans for industrial purposes.
 (3) Section 31 of the Act does not empower the Trust to frame a scheme for industrial purposes at all.
 (4) There is no application of the mind in terms of section 45 in making the Scheme.
 (5) The acquisition of the land for the purpose of the Scheme is malafide.
 (6) Since the Act makes no provision for payment of interest from the date of delivery of possession of the land to the Trust till the determination of compensation by the Tribunal, acquisition of the land is violative of article 31(2) of the Constitution.
 Petitioner has not challenged vires of any provisions of the Act.
 
HELD : (1) Section 31 of the Act permits combining two or more schemes or supplementing some special features of a particular scheme in another scheme. There is no bar in framing a housing accommodation scheme with some of the features of industrial scheme. A housing accommodation scheme need not necessarily be residential scheme only. It can admit of providing housing accommodation for any other purpose or object. There is nothing in section 31 or any other provision of the Act disabling the Trust from framing scheme for industrial purpose. [690E-G] 687 (2)Section 45 requires that while framing the scheme the inherent utility, efficiency and adequacy of the scheme and the objections and representations of the persons have to be taken into consideration.' The scheme in question was open for inspection. There was no ambiguity or vagueness of the scheme or its purpose. Where factual satisfaction is evident formal recitals being omitted may not matter. At any rate, section 52 (2) Puts a final seat of imprimatur on the scheme after publication of the sanction of the Government. [691C-D) (3) Acquisition is not malafide.. No oblique motive can be inputed to the Trust in making the impugned scheme. There is no allegation of mala fide against the State Government whose sanction was a, pre-requisite for the acquisition.
 The order of acquisition cannot, therefore. be characterised as I malafide. [691G-H] (4) It is true that there is no provision for awarding interest unlike under the Land Acquisition Act. It is submitted by the respondents that there is no bar under the Act against awarding interest by the Tribunal. It is not possible to hold that the compensation Tribunal which is at par with an arbitrator will be entitled to award interest without any express provision in the Act. The petitioner is, therefore. right in their contention- that this Act does not provide for awarding interest from the date of taking possession of the property to the date of determination of compensation. However, it is not possible to quash the acquisition in the absence of a challenge to the vires of the provisions of the Act. The law being valid the attack will revaperate upon the quantum of compensation pure and simple. It is sufficient to point out that the quantum of compensation cannot be challenged under Article 31(2) of the Constitution. [692D; 694C-G]
