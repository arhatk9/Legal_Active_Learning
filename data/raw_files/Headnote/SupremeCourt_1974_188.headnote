 The State Government acquired a large area with some buildings thereon in the city of Hyderabad, belonging to the appellant and the Collector awarded compensation under the Hyderabad Land Acquisition Act. The compensation was made up of sums awarded for buildings, for standing trees, for a belt of land 50 ft. deep adjoining the road at a particular rate, and for the remaining area at a lesser rate. On reference, the City Civil Court increased the value of the buildings on the basis of by a multiple of 25 times the rent fetched. On appeal, the High Court further enhanced the value of the buildings by using a multiple of 27 instead of 25, in fixing the compensation for the buildings.
 In appeal to this Court, it was contended (1) that there was a potential value of the land which was not taken into account by the High Court; (2) that the land and buildings should have been taken together; and that the land should not have been sub-divided on the principle of belting; and (3) that the multiple for capitalisation of the value of buildings should have been 33-1/3 and not 27.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : There is no substantial question of law of general importance meriting consideration by this Court. [185H] (1)The potential value of the land was taken into account by the High Court. On a consideration of the totality of factors, the physical feature of the terrain, and the evidence placed on record, the High Court was justified in holding that the appellant had not substantiated the big potential value claimed by him on the basis of any unique features of the land. [186 D-F] (2)The higher value for a strip of 50 feet adjoining the land was given by the courts below on the principles of belting. This Principle was adopted at the instance of the appellant himself and such an approach had operated to his benefit and not detriment. The Court had also taken note of the fact that the value of a tiny plot is not a proper measure when a large area is acquired. [187 A-C] Mohini; Mohan v. Province of Bengal A.I.R. 1951 Cal. 246;

 (3)The rate of interest allowed on government securities at the relevant time (1957) ranged between 3-3/4% and 4% and the High Court, when accepting the multiple of 27, accepted 3-3/4%. There is no warrant for the appellant's contention that the interest on government bonds at the relevant time was only 3%. [187 D-E]
