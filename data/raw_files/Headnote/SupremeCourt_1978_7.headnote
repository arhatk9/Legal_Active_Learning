 The statement of objects and reasons to the Kerala Agriculturists' Debt Relief Act, 1970 states that the benefits conferred by Kerala Act 31 of 1958 were available only in respect of debts incurred by the agriculturists before the date of commencement of the Act, namely July 14, 1958. And since even after this date agricultural indebtedness among the poorer sections continued to be on the increase the legislature considered it necessary to give relief to the agriculturists against whom suits had been filed for recovery of debts accrued after the commencement of the 1958 Act.
 Section 20(1) of the Act provides that where any immovable property in which the agriculturist had an interest has been sold in execution of any decree for recovery of a debt but possession has not actually passed from the judgment debtor to the purchaser and the decree-holder is the purchaser then such judgment-debtor may deposit one half of the purchase money and, apply to the Court to set aside the sale of the property and the Court shall order the sale to be set aside and further order payment of the balance of the purchase money in ten equal instalments in accordance with the procedure set out therein. Subsection (2) provides that where any immovable property in which the agriculturist had an interest has been sold in execution of any decree for arrears of rent and the possession of the property has actually passed from the judgment debtorto the purchaser during the periods mentioned therein then such judgment debtormay deposit one half of the purchase money and apply to the Court to setaside the sale of the property and the court shall order the setting aside of the sale and for the payment of the balance of the purchase money according to the procedure set out in the section. Sub-section (3) provides that where property sold in the execution of any decree for the recovery of a debt and the decree holder is not the purchaser such judgment-debtor may deposit the purchase money and apply to the court to set aside the sale of the property and the Court shall order the sale to be set aside. Sub-section (5) provides that where improvements have been effected on the property sold after the date of sale the value of such improvement as determined by the Court shall be deposited by the applicant for payment to the auction purchaser. Sub-section (6) provides that an order under sub-sections (1) or (2) or (3) shall not be deemed to affect the rights of bona fide alienees of the auction purchaser deriving right before the date of publication of the Bill.
 In the instant cases a creditor had obtained a mortgage decree against the judgment debtor, who was an agriculturist. Since the debtor was not able to pay the decretal amount in instalments, a decree for sale of the property was passed by the Court. The debtor's property was auctioned and purchased by the appellant who was not the decree-holder. In some cases decrees were obtained by the creditors against the debtors and, on their failure to pay the 538 instalments property was purchased at the auction by the decree-holders the-selves. After the purchase, improvements were made by them in the propertieswhen the debtors launched proceedings under the Act for restoration of possession of the property on payment of the decretal amount, the appellants challenged the constitutional validity of the Act. The High Court upheld the validity of s. 20 and dismissed the writ petitions.
 In appeal to this Court, it was contended on behalf of the appellants that (1) the appellants having acquired valid title to the property after purchase at auction sale in execution of a decree, s. 20 which deprives them of their right to hold property was violative of Art. 19(1)(f), (2) though the obvious object of the Act was to give relief to debtors who filed suits for recovery of debts after the commencement of the 1958-Act it travels beyond the statement of objects and reasons, giving a blanket power to the Court to set aside the sale completed even before the passing of the Act and (3) s. 20(3) and (6) are violative of Art. 14 because the stranger decree-holder was selected for hostile discrimination whereas a bona fide alienee was exempted from the operation of the Act.
 Dismissing the appeals, (per Beg, C. J., Krishna Iyer, S. Murtaza Fazal Ali and Jaswant Singh, J.) 
HELD : There is no constitutional infirmity on the ground that the Act is violative of Art. 19(1)(f). The restrictions imposed are clearly reasonable within the meaning of cl. (6) of that Article. [559 A-B] 1(a) In interpreting the constitutional provisions for judging the impact of an enactment on the fundamental rights of the citizens the approach of the Courts is to interpret the constitutional provisions against the social setting of the country so as to show a complete consciousness and deep awareness of the growing requirements of the society, the increasing needs of the nation, the burning problems of the day and the complex issues facing the people which the legislature in its wisdom, through beneficial legislation, seeks to solve. The judicial approach should be dynamic rather than static, pragmatic rather than pedantic and elastic rather than rigid. It must take into consideration the changing trends of economic thought, the temper of the times and the living aspirations and feelings of the people.
 This Court must strike a just balance betweenthe fundamental rights and the larger and broader interests of society.[534 A-C] (b) The legislature is in a better position to understand and appreciate the needs of the people and to bring about social reforms for the uptiftment of the backward and the weaker sections and for the improvement of the lot of the poor. The Court will interfere only when the statute is clearly violative of the fundamental right or when the Act is beyond the legislative competence. Courts have recognised that there is always a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of a statute and the onus to prove its invalidity lies on the party assailing the Act.

 The State of Bihar [1958] INSC 46; (1959) SCR 629 referred to.
 (e) The object of the Act being removal of agricultural indebtedness and reduction of one of the important causes of poverty, is undoubtedly in public interest and the restriction must be presumed to be reasonable. [545 B-C] (b) By a long line of decisions this Court has laid down seteral tests and guidelines for judging the reasonableness of restrictions. They are :
 (i) Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles constitute the "conscience" of the Constitution. The purpose of the latter is to fix certain social and economic goals for immediate attainment by bringing about a non-violent social revolution. The Constitution aims at bringing about a synthesis between funda.mental rights and directive principles by giving to the former a place of pride and to the latter a place of permanence.

 In the instant case the object of the Act being to eradicate rural indebtedness and thereby secure the common good, of the people living in object poverty, clearly fulfils the directives in Arts. 38 and 39(b) of the Constitution. There is no conflict between the directives and the restrictions sought to be placed by the Act. [545 E-F, 547 A] (ii)The restrictions must not be arbitrary or excessive in nature so as to go beyond the requirement of the interest of the general public. What is required is that the legislature should take intelligent care in choosing I course which is dictated by reason and good conscience so as to strike a just balance between the freedom contained in Art. 19(1)(f) and the social control permitted by cll. (5) and (6) of that Article. [547 B-E] Chintamman Rao v. The State of Madhya Pradesh [1950] INSC 29; (1950) SCR 759 at 763 and Messrs. Dwarka Prasad Laxmi Narain v. The State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors. [1954] INSC 1; (1954) SCR 803 at 811-12 referred to.
 (iii)No abstract or general pattern or a fixed principle can be laid down which can be of universal application and the same will have to vary from case to case and with regard to changing conditions, the values of human life, social philosophy of the Constitution, prevailing conditions and the surrounding circumstances, all of which must enter into the judicial verdict.

 (iv)The Court has to examine the nature and extent, the purport and content of the right, nature of the evil sought to be remedied by the statute, the harm caused to the citizen and the benefit to be conferred on the person or the community for whose benefit the legislation is passed, urgency of the evil and the necessity to rectify the same.
 In so doing the Court has to strike a just balance between the restriction imposed and the social control envisaged by Art. 19(6). [549 A-B] Narendra Kumar & Ors. v. The Union of India & Ors. [1959] INSC 147; (1960) 2 SCR 375 and Bachan Singh & Ors. v. State of Punjab & Ors.
 (1971) 1 SCC 713 at 718 referredto.
 (v)There must be direct and proximate nexus or a reasonable connection betweenthe restriction imposed and the object sought to be achieved. In other words, the Court has to see whether by virtue of the restriction imposed on the right of the citizen the object of the statute is really fulfilled or frustrated. If there is a direct nexus between the restriction and the object of the Act then a strong presumption in favour of the constitutionality of the Act will arise.

 (vi)Courts must see whether the social control envisaged in Art. 19(6) is being effectuated by the restriction imposed on the fundamental right. If they look at the restrictions only from the point of view of the citizen who is affected, it will not be a correct or safe approach inasmuch as the restriction is bound to be irksome and painful to the citizen even though it may be for the public good. However important the right of a citizen or an individual may be, it has to yield to the larger interests of the country or the community. [550 G-H, 551 A] Jyoti Prashad v. The Administrator for the Union Territory of Delhi [1961] INSC 175; (1962), 2 SCR 125 at 148 referred to.
 540 (vii)The Court is fully entitled to take into consideration matters of common report, history of the times and matters of common knowledge and the circumstances existing at the time of legislation. [551 D] Mohd. Hanif Quareshi & Ors. v. The State of Bihar [1958] INSC 46; (1959) SCR 629 referred to.
 In the instant case the object of the Act being to protect the agriculturistdebtors from the clutches of the greedy creditors, is undoubtedly a laudable object. The Act does not take away the property of the purchaser without compensation and, therefore, his right to hold property has not been destroyed. No exception can be taken to s. 20(2) (b) which provides for payment of the purchase money by instalments because the debtor, on account of his poverty, cannot pay the debt in a lump-sum. Secondly having regard to the economic condition of the peasantry in the State, the object sought to be achieved being to remove agricultural indebtedness and amelioration of the lot of the agricui- turists, it cannot be said that the restrictions are in any way arbitrary or excessive or beyond the requirements of the situation. [558 B, D, F, H, 559 A] 
2. The object of the Act mentioned in the first part of the statement of objects and reasons clearly shows that it is comprehensive in nature and is not confined to any particular situation. In view of the clear and unambiguous provisions of the Act, it is not necessary to delve into statement of objects and reasons. [559 G-H] Section 20 is not violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution.
 [562 B] 3(a) What Article 14 forbids is hostile discrimination and not reasonable classification. Equality before law does not mean that the same set of laws should apply to all persons under every circumstance ignoring differences and disparities between men and things. It is for the State to make reasonable classification which must fulfil two conditions : (1) the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the group; and (2) the differentia must have a reasonable nexus to the object sought to be achieved by tile statute. [560 C- E] Shri Ram Krishna Dalnua v. Shri Justice S. R. Tendolkar & Ors. [1958] INSC 30; (1959) SCR 279 it 296-97 and State, of Kerala & Anr. v.
 N. M. Thomas & Ors. (1976)2 SCC 310 referred to.
 (b)Having regard to the allowed object of the Act, if by reason of their povertyand economic backwardness the agriculturist-debtors are treated as a separatecategory or class for preferential treatment in public interest, the classi-fication is not unreasonable. In making the classification, the legislature cannot be expected to provide an abstract symmetry. All that is necessary is that the classes have to be set apart accordions to the necessities and exige ies a, as dictated by experience and surrounding circumstances and the cl ton should not be arbitrary, artificial or illusory. [561 6-H, 562 A] State of West Bengal v. Anway Ali Sarkar [1952] INSC 1; (1952) SCR 284 at 321 referred to.
 (c) It is well settled that before a person can claim to be discriminated against another he must show that all the other persons are similarly situate or equally circumstanced. Unless the appellant is able to establish that he is equated with a bona fide alienee in every respect, Art. 14 will have no application. In other words, discrimination violative of Art. 14 can only take effect if there is discrimination between equals and not where unequals are being differently treated. [562 C-D] State of J & K v. T. N. Khosa & Anr. [1973] INSC 180; (1974) 1 SCR 771 at 783, Chiranjit Lal Chowadhuri v. The Union o India & Ors.
 (1950) SCR 860 It 911 and Southern Railways Co. v. Greene [1910] USSC 60; 216 U.S. 400, 412 referred to.
 541 (d) A stranger auction purchaser and a bona fide alienee cannot be said to be similarly situate. [563 D] In the instant case the stranger auction purchaser who participates in the proceedings in execution of the decree against the debtor has a clear notice of the circumstances under which the decree was passed and of the fact that the property sold was the property of the debtor. If the legislature at a later stage passes a law to restore the property to the agriculturist-debtor the auction-purchaser cannot complain. Secondly, the stranger auction-purchaser knows that he had purchased the property at a distress sale.
 Thirdly even if the property was restored to the stranger auction-purchaser, he is entitled to get the entire purchase money in lump-sum including the cost before parting with possession of the property. This distinguishes the case from that of a decreeholder-purchaser. A bona fide alienee on the other hand purchases, the property under negotiation;
 he has no notice of the debt of the debtor or the cir- cumstances under which the decree was passed. [563 E, H, 564 A] Per Bhagwati, Shinghal and Tulzapurkar, JJ concurring.
 The subject-matter of the Act is clearly within the purview of Entry 30 (money lending and money lenders; relief of agricultural indebtedness) and the Act which provides for the " relief of indebted agriculturists in the State of Kerala" is within the competence of the State Legislature.
 [568 G, 569 A] 1(a) There is no justification for the contention that Entry 30 is confined only to subsisting- indebtedness and Would not cover the necessity of providing relief of those agriculturists who had lost their immovable property by Court sales in execution of the decree against them and had been rendered destitute. Section 20 deals with a liability which had ceased and did not subsist on the date the Act came into force. But there is nothing in Entry 30 of List 11 to show that it will not be attracted and would not enable the State Legislature to make a law simply because the debt of the agriculturist had been paid off under a distress sale-. [569 C-E] (b) An agriculturist does not cease to be an agriculturist merely because he has lost his immovable property. It cannot be said that the State is not interested in providing him necessary relief merely because he has lost his immovable property. On the other 'hand his helpless condition calls for early solution and it is only natural that the State Legislature should think of rehabilitating him by providing the necessary relief under an Act of the nature under consideration. There is nothing in the working of Entry 30 to show that the relief contemplated by it must necessarily relate to any subsisting indebtedness and would not cover the question of relief to those who have lost the means of their livelihood because of the delay in providing them legislative relief.
 [569- F-G] (c) It cannot be gainsaid that agriculturists. and even, indebted agriculturists, form the bulk or, at any rate a considerable part of the rural population in an essentially rural economy. and so if a restriction is reasonable in their interest. it world squarely fall within the purview of cl. (5) of Art. 19.

 (d) Thousands of suits were pending against indebted agriculturists in various Courts and immovable properties of a large number of agriculturists had been sold rendering them completely helpless. So if the State Legislature passed the Act in the interest of the general public to provide relief of the nature mentioned in s. 20 the restriction provided therein is clearly "reasonable". Even so, the section makes provision for repayment of the purchase money, the costs of execution and the improvements made by the purchaser Their restriction is, therefore, reasonable in every sense and the High Court rightly rejected the argument to the contrary. [571 A-C], Section 20 is not violative of Art. 14. [573 D] 54 2 2(a) A comparison of sub-s-(1) with sub-s. (3) would show that the treatment to a decree-holder-purchaser is different and is less advantageous than the treatment to a purchaser who is not a decree-holder. The former is treated as a different class. Decree-holders very often exploit their debtors in many ways and sales to them are generally viewed with suspicion and disfavour. Under O.XXI, r.72 CPC, it is not permissible for a decree-holder to bid for or purchase the property without the express permission of the Court.
 The decree holder purchaser has rightly been treated as a class by himself and that classification obviously has the object of benefiting the agriculturist debtor by permitting him to deposit only half the purchase money and paying the balance in instalments.[572 A-B] (b) There is also justification for treating an auction purchaser at a Court sale differently from a bona-fide alienee of the auction purchaser who derived his rights before the date of publication of the 1968 Bill. Such an alienee of the auction-purchaser could not possibly have been aware of the hazards of Purchasing the property of an indebted agriculturist at the time of purchase.
 [572 C-D] (c) It is futile to contend that if the legislature has protected the interests of an alienee by enacting sub-s.
 (6) it has made a hostile discrimination against the auction purchaser as a class. [573 D]
