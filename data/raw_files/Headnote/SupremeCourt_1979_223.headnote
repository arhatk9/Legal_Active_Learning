 The appellant was charged for an offence under section 16(a) (1) of the Preventive of Food Adulteration Act, 1954, for selling adulterated turmeric powder to Respondent No. 2, the Food Inspector in the employ of the State. Even though the appellant pleaded not guilty to the offence charged against him and chose to be tried, after his examination under section 313 of the Criminal Procedure Code, as a result of "Plea Bargaining" he submitted an application admitting his guilt and praying for leniency towards him due to the fact that he was a poor man and his offence a first one. The Magistrate, thereupon made an order convicting the appellant of the offence under section 16(a)(1) POFA, 1954, and sentencing him to suffer simple imprisonment till the rising of the Court and to pay a fine of Rs. 300/- or in default to suffer further rigorous imprisonment for one month.
 The High Court, coming to know through an anonymous application that the appellant was let off lightly with one day's simple imprisonment in breach of the mandatory requirement of the Act, in suo motu exercise of its revisional jurisdiction issued show cause notice to the appellant for enhancing the sentence and after hearing the appellant affirmed the conviction, but enhanced the sentence to three months' simple imprisonment and also increased the fine to Rs. 500/-.
 Allowing the appeal by special leave, the Court ^ 
 HELD : When there is an admission of guilt made by the accused as a result of "plea bargaining" or otherwise, the evaluation of the evidence by the Court is likely to become a little superficial and perfunctory and the Court may be disposed to refer to the evidence not critically with a view to assessing its credibility, but mechanically as a matter of formality in support of the admission of guilt. The entire approach of the Court to the assessment of the evidence would be likely to be different when there is an admission of guilt by the accused. [1117 B-D] In the instant case, it is true that the learned magistrate did not base his order of conviction solely on the admission of guilt made by the appellant, but it is clear from his judgment that his conclusion was not unaffected by the 1115 admission of guilt on the part of the appellant and in the circumstances, it would not be right to sustain the conviction of the appellant. [1117 B-C] [The Court, therefore, remanded the case to the Trial Court for further steps from the stage of examination under S. 313 of the Crl.P.C. The Court also deprecated the manner in which the cases under POFA are booked and investigated (for statistical purposes) by the authorities and indicated certain guide lines so that the true purpose of the prevention of Food Adultration Law be fulfilled and the great gap between expectation and fulfillment in respect of welfare laws be bridged.]
