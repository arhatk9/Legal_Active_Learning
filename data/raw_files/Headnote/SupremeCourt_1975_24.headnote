 The appellants, non-resident companies with registered office s in Japan, had been assessed to Income-tax for the assessment years 1956-1961 under the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 in respect of their Indian earnings. In the assessment proceedings they claimed as deductible allowance, under s.
 10(2)(xv), the tax paid by them on their business assets under the local tax law in force in Japan. But the Income- tax Officer rejected the claim. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner, however, allowed the claim and his order was confirmed by the Tribunal. On reference,.' the High Court, on a consideration of the various provisions of the Japanese statute, held that under the Japanese law it was the ownership of the assets that was material and not their actual user in business, and relying on the decision of this Court in Travancore Titanium Product Ltd. v. C.I.T. Kerala (60 I.T.R. 277), decided in favour of the Revenue.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD:(1) In Indian Aluminum Co. Ltd. v. C.I.T. West Bengal (84 I.T.R. 735) this Court held that the test adopted in the Travancore Tuanium case, that to be a permissible deduction there must be a direct and intimate connection between the expenditure and the business, that is, between expenditure and the character of the assessee as a trader, and not as owner of the assets, even if they are assets of the business, "'needs to be qualified by stating that if the expenditure is laid out by the assessee as owner-cum-trader, and the expenditure is really incidental to the carrying on of his business, it must be treated to have been laid out by him as a trader and as incidental to his business. [470H-471C] (2)The Income-tax Act, 1961, was amended by the Income-tax Amendment Act, 1972. The amendments were introduced to restore the position established in Travancore Titanium case namely, that Wealth Tax paid by an assessee in respect of his business assets was not deductible as a business expense in computing the assessee's income from his business, which was virtually overruled by the later decision in the Indian Aluminium Company case. But the amendments do not appear to touch the principle laid down in the later case, that where a person has a dual capacity of a trader-cum-owner, and he pays tax in respect of property which is used for the purpose of the trade, the payment must be taken to be in the capacity of a trader. The Amendment Act only adds the sum paid on account of wealth tax to the list of amounts not deductible in computing the assessee's income from business.
 Therefore, any amount paid by the assessee on account of a tax other than the wealth-tax on his business assets would be outside the scope of the Amending Act and would continue to be governed by the law laid down in the Indian Aluminium case. The explanation in s. 40 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, which s. 4 of the Amendment Act adopts for the purpose of that section defines wealth tax to include, inter alia, besides wealth tax chargeable under the Indian Wealth Tax Act, 1957, "any tax of a similar character chargeable under any law in force in any country outside India,. [47ID-E;
 472D-G] (3)But, unlike the Wealth-tax in India the municipal property tax in Japan is a local tax imposed on certain specified properties by the city, town or village in which the property is located. The Indian Wealth Tax is a national tax chargeable on the net wealth of the person with certain specified exemptions. The difference in the manner of determination of the taxable basis of the proper- 468 ties and the rates of taxation emphasize the basic difference between the two taxes notwithstanding certain points of similarity. [473H-474B] (4)The facts also disclosed that the assets belonging to the appellants were used by them in their business during the relevant previous years and also that the payment of tax under the Japanese law was incidental to the carrying on of the business of the assessee.
