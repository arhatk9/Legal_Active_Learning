 A case relating to abduction of four diamond merchants and one K was registered at Police Station on 16.9.91. The investigation was entrusted to C.B.I. During investigation it was disclosed that between 14th and 15th September 1991, the four diamond merchants, K and one driver were kidnapped from two hotels, and that K was one of the associates of the accused, responsible for the kidnapping.
 On 4.10.91 K was arrested and was produced before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, on 5.10.91 and he was remanded to judicial custody till 11.10.91.
 On 10.10.91 a test identification parade was arranged but K refused to cooperate and his refusal was recorded by the concerned Magistrate.
 On 11.10.91 the investigating officer moved an application, seeking police custody of K, which was allowed.
 When he was being taken on the way K pretended to be indisposed and he was taken to a Hospital, where he remained confined on the ground of illness upto 21.10.91 and then he was referred to Cardiac Out-patient Department of the Hospital. K was again remanded to judicial custody by the Magistrate upto 29.10.91 and thereafter he was sent to Jail.
 As the Police could not take him into police custody all these days the investigating officer again applied to the court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate for police custody of K.
 The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate relying on a judgment in State 159 (Delhi Admn.) v. Dharam Pal and others, 1982 Crl. L.J.1103 refused police remand.
 A revision was filed before the High Court against the order of the Magistrate.
 The High Court, without deciding the question, whether or not after the expiry of the initial period of 15 days a person could still be remanded to police custody by the Magistrate before whom he was produced, granted K bail.
 In these appeals, the C.B.I. challenged the order of the High Court, contending that the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate erred in not granting police custody and that Dharam Pal's case on which he placed reliance was wrongly decided; that the High Court erred in granting bail to K without deciding the question whether he can be remanded to police custody; that a combined reading of Section 167(2) and the proviso therein would make it clear that if for any reason the police custody could not be obtained during the period of first fifteen days yet a remand to the police custody even later was not precluded.
 The respondent-accused submitted that the police custody if at all be granted by the Magistrate u/s. 167 Cr.
 P.C. should be only during the period of first 15 days from the date of production of the accused before the Magistrate and not later and that subsequent custody if any should only be judicial custody and the question of granting police custody after the expiry of first 15 days remand did not arise.
 On the question, whether a person arrested and produced before the nearest Magistrate as required under Section 167(1) Code of Criminal Procedure could still be remanded to police custody after the expiry of the initial period of 15 days, this Court dismissing the appeals of the C.B.I., 
 HELD : 1.01. Article 22(2) of the Constitution of India and Section 57 of Cr. P.C. give a mandate that every person who is arrested and detained in police custody shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of 24 hours of such arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of the arrest to the court of the magistrate and no such person shall be detained in the custody beyond the said period without the authority of a magistrate. These two provisions clearly 160 manifest the intention of the law in this regard and therefore it is the magistrate who has to judicially scrutinise circumstances and if satisfied can order the detention of the accused in police custody. [175 C] 1.02. The detention in police custody is generally disfavoured by law. The provisions of law lay down that such detention can be allowed only in special circumstances and that can be only by a remand granted by a magistrate for reasons judicially scrutinised and for such limited purposes as the necessities of the case may require. The scheme of Section 167 is obvious and is intended to protect the accused from the methods which may be adopted by some overzealous and unscrupulous police officers.
 [175 B] 1.03. Whenever any person is arrested under Section 54 Cr.P.C. he should be produced before the nearest Magistrate within 24 hours as mentioned therein. Such Magistrate may or may not have jurisdiction to try the case. If Judicial Magistrate is not available, the police officer may transmit the arrested accused to the nearest Executive Magistrate on whom the judicial powers have been conferred. [178 D] 1.04. The Judicial Magistrate can in the first instance authorise the detention of the accused in such custody i.e.
 either police or judicial from time to time but the total period of detention cannot exceed fifteen days in the whole.
 Within this period of fifteen days there can be more than one order changing the nature of such custody either from police to judicial or vice-versa. [178 E] 1.05. If the arrested accused is produced before the Executive Magistrate he is empowered to authorise the detention in such custody either police or judicial only for a week, in the same manner namely by one or more orders but after one week he should transmit him to the nearest Judicial Magistrate along with the records. [178 F] 1.06. When the arrested accused is so transmitted the Judicial Magistrate, for the remaining period, that is to say excluding one week or the number of days of detention ordered by the Executive Magistrate, may authorise further detention within that period of first fifteen days to such custody either police or judicial. After the expiry of the first period of fifteen days the further remand during the period of investigation can only be in judicial custody.
 [178 G] 161 1.07. There cannot be any detention in the police custody after the expiry of first fifteen days even in a case where some more offences either serious or otherwise committed by him in the same transaction come to light at a later stage.[178.H] 1.08. But this bar does not apply if the same arrested accused is involved in a different case arising out of a different transaction. Even if he is in judicial custody in connection with the investigation of the earlier case he can formally be arrested regarding his involvement in the different case and associate him with the investigation of that other case and the Magistrate can act as provided under Section 167(2) and the proviso and can remand him to such custody as mentioned therein during the first period of fifteen days thereafter in accordance with the proviso.
 [179 A] 1.09.If the investigation is not completed within the period of ninety days or sixty days then the accused has to be released on bail as provided under the proviso to Section 167(2). The period of ninety days or sixty days has to be computed from the date of detention as per the orders of the Magistrate and not from the date of arrest by the police.
 [179 C] 1.10. The first period of fifteen days mentioned in Section 167(2) has to be computed from the date of such detention and after the expiry of the period of first fifteen days it should be only judicial custody.
