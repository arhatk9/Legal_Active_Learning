 The respondent filed a complaint against the appellants under s. 500 I.P.C. alleging that they made certain defamatory allegations against him. According to him the appellants passed a resolution suspending him from municipal service, that in the course of the discussion relating to the passing of the resolution, all the appellants made wild and baseless allegations involving moral turpitude against the respondent, and after passing the resolution the appellants with the ulterior motive of maligning the respon- dent, gave publicity to the resolution in the local newspapers with large circulation. A report containing the allegations which was sent by the Secretary of the Corporation to the Commissioner was given in evidence.' The Magistrate dismissed the complaint under s. 203, Cr.
 P.C. on two grounds, namely, (1) there was no evidence on record as to which of the appellants made which allegations against the respondents and in the absence of such an important ingredient no prima facie case against any of the appellants could be said to have been made out, and (2) the resolution passed by the Standing Committee and the discussion preceding it were covered by the exceptions to s.
 499, I.P.C. The sessions Judge dismissed the revision of the complainant summarily.
 The High Court set aside the order of the Magistrate and directed further inquiry on the grounds that: (1) it could not be said that there was no evidence as to which member of the Standing Committee made allegations against the respondent, as the evidence implicated all the members of the Standing Committee including the appellants in the charge of making the defamatory allegations contained in the report and (2) the appellants were not protected by the Exceptions to s. 499.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD: (1) While it is desirable that the actual words stated to have 'been used by the accused which are alleged to be defamatory should be reproduced by the complainant, in cases where the words spoken are too many or the statements are too long, it will be the height of technicality to insist that the actual words and the entire statements should-be reproduced verbatim. The object of having the actual words before the court is to enable it to consider whether the words are defamatory. That purpose will be served if the complainant is able to reproduce in his complaint or evidence, in a substantial measure, the words of imputation alleged to have been uttered. From the point of view of the accused also it is 448 necessary that the matters alleged to be defamatory in the complaint must be so stated as to enable them to know the nature of the allegations they have to meet. But a complaint cannot be thrown out on the mere ground that the actual words spoken had not been stated in the complaint.
 It is only if the case of a complainant is that each of the accused made different statements that it would be necessary for the complainant to specify them actual words spoken by each of the accused. (457B-F] In the present case, on the averments made in the complaint which refers to various matters referred to in the report, the complainant had furnished in a substantial measure the words of imputation, which, according to him were defamatory. When the case of the complainant was that all the appellants made the statements referred to in the report, an& he was prepared to go to trial on that footing, the question of the complainant stating the words alleged to have been used by the individual accused did not arise.

 (2) Under ss. 202 and 203 Cr. P.C. the Magistrate has to see whether a prima facie case is made out against the accused on the materials and' evidence placed before him by the complainant and not whether the evidence is sufficient to warrant a conviction. [452G-H; 453A-B] In the present case, the approach of the Magistrate was fallacious in the face of the allegations by the respondent that all the appellants made the statements referred to in the report.

 (3) It was also unnecessary for the High Court to consider the applicability of the Exceptions to s. 499 I.P.C., at this stage. All the defence that may be available to the appellants will have to be gone into during, the trial of the complaint. [459B-C]
