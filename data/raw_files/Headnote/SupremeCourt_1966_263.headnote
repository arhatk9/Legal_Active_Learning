 The said landlords obtained a decree for ejectment of the tenant from the accommodation, Exercising the Collector's powers under s. 7(2) of the U.P. (Temporary) Control of Rent 
 Officer passed an order directing the landlords to let the accommodation to respondent No. 1. However, subsequent to this order, the landlords allowed the appellant to continue as tenant on enhanced rent. The Assistant Rent Control & Eviction Officer thereupon started proceedings under s.
 7A(1) of the Act. He passed an order under s. 7A(2) directing the appellant to vacate the accommodation. The appellant filed a writ petition but failing to get relief from the High Court, he filed a suit asking for a declaration that the orders passed by the Assistant Rent Control & Eviction Officer were without jurisdiction. The trial court dismissed the suit, the appellate court decreed it., but on second appeal the High Court restored the decree of the trial court dismissing the suit. The appellant was granted special leave to appeal to this Court.
 It was urged on behalf of the appellant (i) that the District Magistrate had no powers to pass the order of allotment under s. 7(2) till the accommodation had fallen vacant, (ii) that even if he had the power the order would take effect only when the accommodation fell vacant and (ii) that the proceedings under s. 7A were without jurisdiction as there was no contravention of the order under s. 7(2).
 
HELD : (i) The District Magistrate can pass an order under s. 7(2) not only when the accommodation is or has fallen vacant but also when it is about to fall vacant. In the present case both the landlord and the tenant had made statements that the accommodation was about to fall vacant.
 On the materials on the record there could be no doubt that the accommodation was about to fall vacant when the District Magistrate passed the order under s. 7(2). [243 D-E] (ii) The order under s. 7(2) directed the landlords to let the accommodation to the allottee. The order took effect immediately. It could not be said that the order would take effect only when the accommodation actually fell vacant.
 [244 A-B] (iii) After the allotment was passed, the landlords agreed to accept the appellant as a tenant at enhanced rent.
