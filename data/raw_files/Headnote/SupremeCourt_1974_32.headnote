 The appellant and the respondent contested election to a ward in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi in which the appellant was declared elected. Respondent no. 1 filed an election petition challenging the appellant's election on the ground of corrupt practice and prayed that he be declared duly elected under s. 19(1)(c) of the Corporation Act. The appellant on the other hand contended that since the respondent was guilty of corrupt practices he, had become disentitled to be declared elected. The Election Tribunal held that the appellant was not entitled to raise such a plea. On appeal the High Court held that in the absence of a specific provision in the Corporation Act corresponding to s. 97 of the Representation of People Act, 1951 the returned candidate was not entitled to recriminate on the grounds contained in s. 17 of the Corporation Act.
 Section 9(1)(d) of the Corporation Act enacts that a person shall be disqualified for being chosen as, and for being, a councillor, or alderman if he has, in proceedings for questioning the validity or regularity of an election, been found to have been guilty of any corrupt practice. . .
 Section 17 enacts the grounds on which the election could be declared void. One of such grounds in s. 17 (1) (a) is that "on the date of his election a returned candidate was not qualified or was disqualified to be chosen as a councillor." On the question whether in an election petition under the Act for getting an election declared void and for a further declaration that the petitioner himself had been duly elected, the returned candidate is entitled to plead and prove that the petitioner was guilty of corrupt practice in the election in question, and was therefore not entitled to be declared as duly elected.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) There is no provision in the Corporation Act corresponding to s. 97 of the Representation of People, Act expressly giving a right of recrimination to the returned candidate. The effect of the word "being" in the opening sentence of s.9(1) appears to have been largely off-set by the use of the words "to have been guilty" in cl.(d). The meaning of the phrase "have been" is "immediately prior to a specific time". If the phrase "found to have been guilty" in s.9(1)(d) is construed in the context of cl.(a) of s.17(1), then it will mean "found to have been guilty at the time of election, and immediately preceding the election." The right to recriminate cannot be legitimately spelled out of s.9(1)(d) without doing violence to its language or unduly stretching it. [364 F] (2) The inquiry of the District Judge, who is the election tribunal, at the trial of an election petition is limited to the investigation of those matters only which will enable him to make the orders specified in s.19(1). But where in a composite petition relief is claimed that the petitioner be declared elected in place of the returned candidate, the District Judge is to investigate if either of the two conditions for the grant of a further declaration specified in s.19(2) is made out namely : (a) whether in fact the petitioner received a majority of the valid votes, or (b) whether the petitioner would have but for the votes obtained by the returned candidate, obtained a majority of the valid votes. In such a composite position apart from rebutting the allegations made against him in the petition all that the returned candidate can further show is that the 359 petitioner did not in fact receive the majority of valid votes and is therefore, not entitled to the further declaration of his due election. In the absence of a provision specifically conferring such a right, the returned candidate cannot allege and prove further that even if the petitioner had obtained a majority of valid votes,-he could not be granted the declaration of his due election because he had committed corrupt practices. Such plea and proof will, in reality, be in the nature of a counterattack, not necessary for legitimate defence. [365 C] (3) In the light of the well-established principles the court cannot bridge the gap or supply this apparent omission in the Corporation Act with regard to a returned candidate's claim to recriminate, by importing principles of common law or equity, the maxim casus omissus et oblivioni datus disposition communis juris relinqitur being in-applicable to the construction of election statutes. A right to file an election petition or a recriminatory petition being a mere creature of statute, unknown to common law, the appellant' in the absence of a clear statutory provision, is not entitled to recriminate on any of the grounds mentioned in s. 17. [366 D] (b) If the failure to comply strictly with the requirements of a statutory provision as to recrimination precludes the returned candidate from recriminating, a fortiori, in the absence of such a statutory provision in an election law, the returned candidate has no right to recriminate.
