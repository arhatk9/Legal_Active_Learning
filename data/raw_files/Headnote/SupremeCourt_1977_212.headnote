 The respondent assessee is a Company carrying on its business of, copper engraving and manufacturing labels. For the assessment year 1963-64, the assesee did not ask for any exemption in respect of a portion of its profits under section 84 of the Income-tax Act, though in the subsequent years the assessee did ask and the Income-tax Officer accepted it. Dismissing the appeal against the orders of the assessments for the year 1963-64, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, therefore, held that the question of error on the part of the Income-tax Officer did not arise as no claim for exemption under section 84, which was made for the first time before him, had been made before the Income-tax Officer. The Tribunal, on further appeal, took a different view and held that "since the entire assessment was open before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner" there was no "reason for not entertaining the claim of the assessee." The Tribunal directed the Income-tax Officer to allow appropriate relief under section 84 of the Act. On a reference made at the instance of Commissioner of Income- tax, the Gujarat High Court answered it against the revenue and in favour of the assessee.
 Allowing the appeal the Court, 
HELD : (1) 'Consideration' does not mean incidental or collateral examination of any matter by the Income-tax Officer in the process of assessment. There must be something mind in the assessment order to show that the Income tax Officer applied his mind to the particular subject matter or the particular source of income with a view to its taxability or its non-taxability. If an item of income noticed by the Income-tax Officer, but not examined by him from the point of view of its taxability or non- taxability cannot be said to have been considered by him, the Income-tax Officer examining a portion of the profits from the point of view of its taxability should not be deemed to have also considered the question of its non- taxability.

 (2)In the instant case,; (a) on the facts of the case, the question referred to the High Court should have been answered in the negative; (b) Neither any claim was made by the assessee before the Income-tax Officer nor was there any material on record supporting such a claim; (c) in the statement of the case, drawn up by the Tribunal there is no basis for an assumption by the High Court that a portion of the profit in the relevant assessment year was exempt from tax under section 84 and that the assessee failed to claim an exemption to which he was admittedly entitled. From that admission that in the years subsequent to the assessment year in question, a relief under section 84 had been allowed to the assessee, it cannot be presumed that the prescribed conditions justifying a claim for exemption under the section were also fulfilled in an earlier year.
