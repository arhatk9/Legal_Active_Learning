 The assessee was a dealer in motor vehicles and spare parts and cartain other goods. During the assessment proceedings under the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1959 it was found inter alia that the assessee had not included in the monthly return in Form A-2, three items of turnover, namely, delivery charges relating to motor vehicles purchased by the assessee from Calcutta dealers, sales of motor parts, and sales of firewood. Assessment was made overlooking the assessee's objections in respect of the inclusion of these items in the turnover. The Commercial Tax Officer also imposed penalty on the assessee. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner reduced the penalty to a nominal figure. The Board of Revenue set aside the appellate order holding that assessee did not deserve lenient treatment. The High Court in reference held that penalty was leviable only in respect of the second item in respect of which a best judgment assessment had been made but not in respect of the first and third items in respect of Which the figures in the books had been accepted. In appeal by the Revenue, 
HELD : The High Court came to the correct conclusion because sub-ss. (2). and (3) of s. 12 have to be read together.
 Sub-section (2) empowers the assessing authority to assess the dealer to the best of its judgment in the events : (i) if no return has been submitted by the dealer under sub-s.
 (1) within the prescribed period and (ii) if the return submitted by him appears to be incomplete and incorrect.
 Subsection (3) empowers the assessing authority to levy the penalty only when it makes an assessment under sub-s. (2).
 In other words when the assessing authority has made the assessment to the best of its judgment it can le a penalty.
 When account books are accepted along with other recordr there can be no ground for making a best judgment assessment. [753 C-G] State of Kerala v. C. Velukutty, 17 S.T.C. 465, referred to.
 In the present case the High Court rightly found that the turnovers involved in the first and third items were not determined on the basis of any estimate of best judgment since the quantum of turnovers in respect of both these items were based on the assessee's books. The penalty thus could not be levied in respect of these two items. [753 H- 754 B] The appeal must accordingly fail.
