 The appellant executed a deed of trust on December 20, 1961, in respect of certain properties on a stamp paper of Rs.
 30/- on the footing that the deed was a declaration of trust. The SubRegistrar to whom it was presented for registration, impounded the deed and forwarded it to the Collector for action under see. 38 (2) of the Indian Stamp Act, 2 of 1899. The Collector thereafter directed the appellant to deposit additional stamp duty and penalty amounting to Rs. 36,685/- but the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority, Delhi, reduced the amount in revision to Rs.
 3,780/-. The appellant then applied to that Authority to state a case to the High Court under section 57(1) but this application was rejected and a writ petition filed by the appellant challenging this rejection was dismissed by the High Court.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that the Authority was, under section 57(1), bound to refer the case to the High Court even though there was no pending case before it and by its refusal to do so the Authority failed to discharge its statutory duty; that the High Court was in the circumstances competent to direct the reference and the summary dismissal of the writ petition by if was wrong. On the other hand the respondent's contention was that section 57(1) postulates the existence of a pending case; that the word "case" in the sub-section means a case which has not been finally decided by the revenue authorities and which is capable of being disposed of, where a reference is made to the High Court, in accordance with the opinion of the Court as provided by sec. 59(2), Held: When a reference has been made to the Authority or the case has otherwise come to his notice, if an application is made under s. 57(1) and it involves a substantial question of law, whether the case is pending or not, the Authority is bound to state the case in compliance with its obligation. [695 A-B] Section 57 affords a remedy to the citizen to have his case referred to the High Court against an order of a revenue authority imposing stamp duty and/or penalty provided the application involves a substantial question of law and imposes a corresponding obligation on the Authority to refer it to the High Court for its opinion. Such a right and obligation cannot be construed to depend upon any subsidiary circumstance such as the pendency of the case before the Authority. [694 F-G] The Authority therefore was in error in refusing to state the case and the High Court was equally in error in summarily dismissing the writ petition as the question whether the document was a declaration of trust or was a deed of settlement was a substantial question of law.
