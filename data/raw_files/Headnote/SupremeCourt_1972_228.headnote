 The appellant was driving a bus, which mounted the footpath, dashed against an electric pole, aid a person, who was near the electric pole, was knocked down dead as a result of the pole falling on him. Four other persons were injured by the bus hitting them. Three of these persons were examined as prosecution witnesses, but the evidence on behalf of the prosecution did not throw any right on the precise circumstances in which the bus happened to mount the footpath. According to the appellant, he was driving the bus at a moderate speed when suddenly the fourth of the injured persons, who was not examined as a witness, came running in his attempt to cross the road. The appellant took a turn to avoid him and also applied his brakes, but the accident happened because of circumstances beyond his control. He also examined one witness on his behalf who generally supported his version. The trial court passed strictures on the defence witness and convicted the appellant under s. 304A I.P.C. On appeal, the High Court, while emphasising on the perfunctory character of the investigation, also passed strong strictures against the defence witness and confirmed the conviction of the appellant, on the grounds, that the electric pole would not have fallen unless the bus was going at a high speed when it hit the pole, that assuming the pedestrian came running across the road the appellant was in a position to see him and could have come to a complete stop if he was reasonably careful, and that the appellant must have continued to run the bus at full speed expecting the pedestrian to stop. The High Court wanted to examine the injured pedestrian as a Court witness, but did not do as the defence objected.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court under Art. 136 of the Constitution, 
HELD : (1) The High Court should have examined the court witness. The failure to do so on the ground that the defence objected to such examination was not a proper approach, because, parties cannot control the Court's discretion to have any additional evidence considered by it to be necessary in the interests of justice. Justice would fail not only by unjust conviction of the innocent but also by acquittal of the guilty for unjustified failure to produce available evidence. [387G-H] (2)The fact that this was not the first time when investigation in a caselike this had been utterly perfunctory was no ground for convicting the accused. [386G- H] (3)Assuming that the High Court was right that the road at the time was more than normally crowded it was still a question for consideration as to from how much distance the appellant would have been able to see a pedestrian who was running to the road, an aspect which was not adverted to by the High Court. [386E-F] 378 (4)The judgment of the trial Court and of the High Court proceed principally on assumptions not fully supportable on the material on the record. Merely because the nature of the accident, prima facie requires an explanation from the driver would not be sufficient to sustain his conviction, if the truth of his explanation which was not liable to rejectionoutright could have been appropriately judged if the evidence left out by the prosecution had been produced.
 [387A-E] (5) Evidence which was material,. such as the evidence of the pedestrian and the passengers in the bus had not been collected by the investigating agency, and the reasons given for not examining the injured pedestrian are wholly unconvincing. The evidence actually produced', has not established the appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt., [387C-F] (6)The Investigating Officer has acted without the requisite sense of responsibility essential for fair and just investigation into serious accidents like the present.
 He had not taken photographs of the position of the vehicle, the electric pole, and the position of the victim, but bad produced, instead, a most unsatisfactory rough sketch.
 There was no evidence of relevant factors such as the height of the kerb, the state of traffic on the road, the condition of the brakes, and of the probable speed of the bus which could have been ascertained by measuring the tyre marks on the road. [383G-H; 386A-C] (7)Assuming the testimony of the defence witness did not impress the courts below they should have expressed their opinion in temperate language with judicial restraint.
