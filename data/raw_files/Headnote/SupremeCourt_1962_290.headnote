 The settlement of a country liquor shop was made by a lot drawn in favour of one jadu Manjhi after cancellation of the license of the previous licensee...' The previous licensee preferred an appeal before, the Commissioner of Excise which was dismissed and then he preferred a revision to the Board of Revenue, Bihar and obtained stay of the settlement of the OM. later on, the Board of Revenue dismissed his petition and jadu Manjhi also died.
 Thereafter a fresh lot was drawn in favour of the appellant against which the previous licensee obtained stay from the revenue court, but his petition was dismissed and after the furnishing of security on September 11, 196 1, the shop was settled with the appellant and license was issued to him.
 On June 19, 1961, one-Phudan Manjhi son of jadu Manjhi filed a petition before the Deputy Commissioner for the substitution of his name in the place of his father which was rejected. Against that order he preferred an appeal before the Commissioner of Excise who remanded the case to the Deputy Commissioner to consider the fitness of Phudan Manjhi. One Bhagwn Rajak who was not an applicant before the Deputy Commissioner filed an application before the Commissioner demanding fresh advertisement for the settlement of the shop which was allowed and the Deputy Commissioner was directed for taking steps for a fresh settlement in accordance with the rules of the Excise Manual. Against that order the appellant filed a petition before the Board of Revenue which was, dismissed and the Deputy commissioner was directed that unless he came to a definite conclusion that Phudan Manjhi was unfit to hold the license, he should be selected as a licensee in accordance with the rules. The result was that the appellant's license was cancelled and the Deputy Commissioner was directed to hold a fresh settlement giving a preferential treatment to Phudan Manjhi. The appellant filed a petition under Art.
 226 of the constitution in the High Court to quash the said orders, in which neither Phudan Manjhi nor Bhagwan Rajak in whose 677 favour the Board of Revenue decided the petition were made parties. The High Court dismissed the petition in limine.
 In this Court a preliminary objection was raised by the respondents that since Phudan Manjhi and Bhagwan Rajak were not made parties, who were necessary parties to the writ petition, the High Court was justified in dismissing the petition. It was urged by the appellant that in such a writ the said tribunal or authority is the only necessary party and the Parties An Whose favour the said tribunal or authority made an order Or created parties and even at this very late stage it is open to this court to direct the impleading of the said parties.
 Held, that a necessary party is one without whom no order can be made effectively; a proper party is one in whose absence an effective order can be made but whose Presence is necessary for a complete and final decision on the question involved in the proceeding.
 A writ of certiorari lies only in respect of a judicial or quasi-judicial. act and a tribunal performing a judicial or quasi-judicial act cannot decide against the rights of a party without giving him a hearing or an opportunity to represent his case. If the provisions of a particular statute or rules made thereunder do not provide for it.
 principles of natural justice demand it. Any such order made without hearing the affected parties would be void. As a writ of certiorari will be granted to remove the, record of proceedings of an inferior tribunal or authority performing judicial or quasi-judicial acts, ex hypothesi it follows that the High Court in exercising its jurisdiction shall also act judicially in disposing of the proceedings before it.
 In a writ of certiorari not only the tribunal or authority whose order is sought to be quashed but also parties in whose favour the said order is issued are necessary parties.
 But it is in the discretion of the Court,to add or implead proper parties, for completely settling all the questions that may be involved in the controversy either suo-motu or on the application of a party to the writ or an application filed at the instance of such proper party.
