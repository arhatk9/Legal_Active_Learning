 The question arising for determination was whether the Chairman of the Managing Committee of a Municipality who could order payment of bills for fixed recurring charges was a "public servant" within the meaning of s. 21 of the Indian Penal Code.
 Held, that the power to make payment of fixed recurring charges, such as pay bills, imposed a "duty" on the Chairman to do so when necessary as the power was vested in the Chairman for the benefit of the persons entitled to receive those recurring charges.
 Julius v. Lord Bishop of Oxford, (1880) 5 App. CaS. 214, referred to.
 Section 21, Cl. 1O of the Indian Penal Code merely requires that the person should have the "duty" to expend property for certain purposes and is not restricted to such cases only where there is no limitation on the exercise of that power of expending property. The Chairman had the duty to order payment and spend money of the Municipality in certain circumstances and as such was a "public servant".
