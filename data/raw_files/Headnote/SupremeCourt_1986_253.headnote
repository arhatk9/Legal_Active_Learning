 Chander Mohan made a gift of the house in dispute in favour of Gyan Chand, but later on he filed a suit for cancellation of the gift. The suit was referred to the arbitrator who made his award, which was accepted by the Court and a decree followed. Under the decree Chander Mohan got a right of enjoyment during his life time. Gyan Chand and the sons ofMohinder Mohan, another brother of Chander Mohan, together got one-third share each. The remaining one-third share went to the daughter of Chander Mohan with life interest and after her, absolutely to her son.
 Later the three sons of Mahinder Mohan filed a suit asking for exclusive possession of their one-third share in the disputed house. Finally, the High Court held that they were not entitled to a share in the property.
 The widow and son of Chander Mohan filed a suit claiming two-third shares in the property and for partitioning there- of. The trial Court dismissed the suit holding that the award was void and the gift operated and since under it, no share was given to them, they had no right to sue for parti- tion. However, in appeal, the High Court found that they had one-third share and decreed their claim to that extent.
 Allowing the appeal of Gyan Chand Kapoor (Defendant no. 1), 
 HELD: 1. The High Court was wrong in holding that the plaintiffs had a share in the property. In the very first litigation itself the decree was in the nature of a family settlement on the basis of an award grounded upon compro- mise. There was no justification to hold that the gift which constituted the title in respect of the subject matter of the house, were separate from one another; equally falla- cious was the view of the trial Court that notwithstanding the compromise, the award and the decree, the gift still remained valid as it has not been set aside. [400E -- F] 399 
 2. Admittedly, under the gift or in the compromise and the award no share had been given to the present plaintiffs.
 In such circumstances, the plaintiffs could not claim any share in the property. [400G] 
 3. Rama Devi, widow of Chander Mohan, is allowed to live during her life time in the house in dispute without title to the property. [40lB -- C]
