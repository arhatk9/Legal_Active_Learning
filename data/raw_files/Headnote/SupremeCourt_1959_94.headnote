 The respondents were manufacturers of perfumery and hair oils at Ratlam in Madhya Bharat which at the relevant time was a Part B State. They sent out agents who canvassed orders. The goods ordered were sent to the customers from Ratlam either through the post office by Value Payable Post or they were sent from there by rail and the railway receipts in favour of self were sent through a bank with the direction that they (railway receipts) were to be handed over against payment of the enclosed demand draft.' The price when received by the bank was sent by means of a demand draft to the respondents at Ratlam who bad it cashed and credited to their account at Bombay. The respondents were assessed to income-tax, in respect of profits from such sales of goods to customers in Part A and C States, for the assessment year 1950-51, at the rate or rates applicable to income, profits or gains arising or accruing in Part A States on the footing that the sales were effected in Part A and C States and the payments were also received there. The respondents claimed that the prices realised constituted receipts in Ratlam 51 402 and that therefore they. were liable to be assessed only at the concessional rates applicable to Part B States. The Appellate Tribunal held that the price of goods sent by Value Payable Post was received at Ratlam and that in respect of the price received by bank drafts which had been realised through the bank at Bombay, the amount must be treated as having been received in a Part A State. At the instance of the Commissioner of Income-tax and the respondents, the Tribunal referred two questions to the High Court: (1) Whether the bank drafts payable in Part A or C States but received at Ratlam and encashed through the assessee's bankers at Bombay constituted receipts in Part A State? (2) Whether the receipt of sale proceeds at Ratlam (which included the assessee's profits) in respect of goods sent by the assessee to customers in Part A or C States by V.P.P. amounted to receipts of income, profits or gains at Ratlam in a Part B State? The High Court having answered both the questions in favour of the respondents, the Com- missioner of Income-tax preferred an appeal to the Supreme Court :- Held: (1) When a question referred to the Court is not properly framed, it is open to the Court to reframe the question which arises on a proper appreciation of the facts of the Case.
 Narain Swadeshi Weaving Mills v. The Commissioner of Excess Profits Tax, [1955] 1 S.C.R. 925, followed.
 The proper question that arose on the facts of the present case was held to be: " Whether on the facts and circumstances of this case the payment received from a buyer by a banker in Part A or C States against delivery of railway receipts for goods sent by the seller is payment in these States or in Ratlam which was a Part B State." (2) Where goods are sent by rail and the railway receipts in, favour of self are sent to a banker to be delivered to the buyer against payment of the price, the appropriation to the contract is only conditional and the performance is completed only when the monies are paid and the railway receipts delivered.
 Accordingly, where, as in the present case, the payment.
 was received by a banker from a buyer in a Part A or C State against delivery of a railway receipt in favour of self for goods sent by the respondents, the contract must be taken to have been per-. formed in Part A or C States and the income arising out of these transactions must be held to have been received there.
 (3) The principles governing the despatch of articles by Value Payable Post system are:- (i) that the post office is an agent of the seller for the recovery of price against delivery of goods;
 Mothi Rungaya Chetty V. The Secretary of State for India, (1904) I.L.R. 28 Mad. 213, approved.
 (ii) that the seller retains control over the goods right up to the time goods are delivered to the buyer against payment and 403 the contract falls under s. 25(1) of the Indian Sale of Goods Act, 1930;
 Mirabita v. Imperial Ottomon Bank, (1878) 3 Ex. D. 164 and The Parchim, [1918] A.C. 57, referred to.
 (iii) that even if the post office were considered to be a bailee of goods for transmission to the buyer, the contract would fall under s. 25 of the Indian Sale of Goods Act and the appropriation is conditional and until the condition is fulfilled the property in the goods does not pass; and, (iv) that it is the duty of the bailee to dispose of the goods in accordance with the directions of the bailor which in this case was to deliver the goods against payment.
 Hence the bailee received the price at the place of delivery of goods and did so on behalf of the bailor.
 Consequently, in the present case, in respect of goods sent by Value Payable Post to a Part A or C State the price was received there and not at Ratlam.
