 The workmen of the appellant consisted of three categories: regular staff, work-charged staff and casual labour (muster-roll employees). By a settlement between the parties, it was agreed that certain questions like revision of pay, etc., should be referred to arbitration. Before the settlement, however, wages of muster roll workmen were raised to a minimum of Rs. 3/- and in respect of the same category of persons who were drawing Rs. 3/- or more per day, the rise was 50 paise per person. In the case of this category of workmen there had also been an earlier settlement in 1966. The Industrial Tribunal, in its award, allowed an increase of 25 per cent in the wages of all workmen including the muster roll workmen. The appellant sought to quash the award of the Tribunal but the High Court dismissed the writ petition.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, ^ 
 HELD : The wages of muster roll workmen was not one of the points agreed to be referred to the arbitrator for adjudication. The Industrial Tribunal was acting beyond its jurisdiction in allowing 25 per cent increase in the wages of the muster roll workmen. The only reason the Industrial Tribunal has given is that the point under reference by itself did not exclude muster roll workmen and that it clearly mentioned that the parties had agreed that the demands regarding the revision of pay scales of the workmen should be referred to arbitration and no exception had been made against the muster roll workmen. That clause in the settlement should be read along with the rest of the settlement and the charter of demands. Had that been done, there would have been no room for the misunderstanding. The revision of pay scales of the muster roll workmen was already covered by the settlement. [192B; 191F-G]
