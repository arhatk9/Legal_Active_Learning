 The appellant paid to the first respondent a large sum of money in respect of mining lease granted to it. the appellant (plaintiff) instituted a suit for recovery, of possession of the leased property or in the alternative for refund of the sum paid to the first respondent. After institution of the suit the Bihar Land Reforms Act came into force as a result of which the appellant's claim in respect of possession of the mines became unenforceable. The appellant, therefore, confined its claim for the recovery of the sum paid.
 Dismissing the appeal, the trial court held that the appellant was not entitled to claim any relief under s. 65 of the Contract Act because there was no occasion for it to have been under any kind of ignorance of law and as the Mineral Concession Rules of 1949 rendered any stipulation for payment of salami illegal, the lease on that basis was also illegal. The High Court unheld the view of the trial Court.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : This is not a case to which sections 65, 70 and 72 of the Contract Act apply. The payment of the money was not made lawfully nor was it done under mistake or coercion.
 [709A] (1) Where an agreement is void ah initio or a contract becomes void due to subsequent happenings any person receiving an advantage under such agreement at contract is bound to restore such advantage or to make compensation for it to the per-son from whom he received it. But where even at the time when the agreement was entered into both the parties knew that it was not lawful and, therefore, void,.
 there was no contract but only an agreement. [705F] Harnath Kaur v. Inder Bahadur Singh, 1923, 50 I.A. 69, 75-76 and Shri Ramagya Prasad Gupta & Ors. v. Sri Murli Prasad & Ors. C.A. Nos. 17 10 of 1967 & 1986 of1966 decided on 11-4- 1974, referred to.
 Budhulal v. Deccan Banking Company A.I.R. 1955 Hyd. 69 and Sivaaramakrishnaiah v. Narahari Rao, A.I.R. 1960 A.P. 186, approved.
 (2) Section 4 of the Mines and Mineral (Regulation and Development) Act, 1948 provides that no mining lease shall be granted otherwise than in accordance, with the Rules made under the Act. Rule 45 of the Mineral Concession Rules,, 1949 provides that a mining lease shall be granted only to a person holding a certificate of approval from the State Government. Rule 49 provides that no grantor of mining lease shall charge any premium in addition to or in lieu of the rent specified in such a lease. In the present case the appellant had no certificate as required under r. 45 and contrary to r. 49 there was a stipulation for payment of a premium, under the lease deed. The lease in favour of the appellant was, therefore, contrary, to the provisions of the Act and the rules and as such void. [708F] (3) There was no occasion for the plaintiff to have been under any kind of ignorance of law under the Contract Act and the Mineral Concession Rules, 1949. The appellant was in the business of mining and had the advantage of consulting-. its lawyers and solicitors. [708H]
