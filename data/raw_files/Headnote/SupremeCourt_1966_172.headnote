 The assessee was a Hindu undivided family carrying on a joint family business and was also deriving some income from partnerships, in which its karta representing the family, was a partner. The family consisted of two brothers and their minor sons. One of the brothers, who was the karta.
 asked the other for a salary of Rs. 1,000 per month, since he was managing the business. The other brother agreed to it, and the payments were made. The see claimed that the sum of Rs. 12,000 per year, paid as remuneration to the karta should be deducted as an item of expenditure under s.
 10(2)(xv) of the Income-tax Act, 1922. The claim was rejected by the Department, the Tribunal and the High Court.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : As the remuneration was paid under a valid agreement which was bona fide and in the interest of, and expedient for, the business of the family, and the payment was genuine and not excessive and was not a device to, escape income- tax, the remuneration must be held to be an expenditure laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the business of the family and must be, allowed as an expenditure under the section. [421 B-C,D] The karta of a family can be paid remuneration for carrying on family business, provided it is under some valid agreement. The test of the validity of such an agreement, when entered into on behalf of a minor, is that it should be for the benefit of the minor. The agreement in the, instant case was entered into between the two adult members. Their minor sons were represented by them or by the karta and the agreement was not prejudicial to the minors' interests. In fact, it was acquiesced in by those minors who had later become majors. If the agreement was in the interests of the family it would not be invalid, when executed on behalf of the minors by the person authorised to act on their behalf, simply hecause the minors were represented by a person who received some benefit under the agreement. Further, the remuneration was not intended to cover any service rendered by the karta to the partnership firms, but Was for looking after the interests of the family in-those businesses and for managing the affairs of the family.
