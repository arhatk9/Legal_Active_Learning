 One G. Chettiar died leaving a daughter (defendant-1) and grand sons of sister (Appellant). In 1953 the 1st defendant adopted a son who is the second defendant. The appellant, filed the present suit challenging the adoption by the 1st defendant of the 2nd defendant and alienations of properties by 1st and 2nd defendants, in favour of the 3rd and 4th defendants. The validity of adoption was questioned by the appellants on various grounds. The main ground pressed in this Court is that there was want of consent of sapindas of the husband of the 1st defendant and that the adoption was made for the purpose of depriving the sapindas of their right to pronerty and not on any consideration of spiritual benefit to her husband. The trial court found that the refusal of the appellants to given their consent to adoption was improper and that they had more or less abused their fiduciary position. The High Court found that the adoption was true but not valid, since other agnates of husband of the 1st defendant were not consulted and their consent obtained. The court left open the construction of Will of G. Chettiar and the question as to whether the 2nd defendant was entitled to claim under the Will of G. Chettiar. The Court found that the alienation made in favour of defendants 3 and 4 were valid. On an appeal filed by defendants 1 and 2 to the High Court, the High Court held that the adoption of the 2nd defendant by the 1st defendant was true and valid but agreed that the contention of the appellants that the 2nd defendant as the adopted son of the 1st defendant could not take any bequest under the Will, but as Sethu Chettiar the adoptive father of the second defendant took the vested interest under the Will, the defendant 2 will be entitled to that interest as the adopted son. The challenge to the alienation in favour of defendants 3 and 4 Dismissing the appeal 
HELD : 1. The power of a Hindu widow to adopt a son to his husband is well recognised in Hindu law. When the adoption is authorised by the husband of the widow, the widow's power is co-extensive with that of her husband. Equally when the consent of the husband's kinsmen is obtained the widow's power is co-extensive with that of her husband, [522 F-G] Balusu Gurulingaswami v. Balusu Ramalak hmamma, I.L.R. 22 Mad. 398 approved.
 
2. The necessity for obtaining the assent of the sapindas has been laid down in Ramnad case, (1868) 12 MIA 397, 442 referred. The reason for requiring the assent of the sapindas is to see that the adopt on was a bonafide performance of the religious duty and not due to any capricious action by the widow. In the case of a joint family it is necessary that he widow should consult the elders in the husband's family particularly the father of the husband. But when the family is divided the duty of the widow is to consult the agnates of the husband at the first instance. If the consent of the nearer agnates is withheld for capricious reasons she can proceed to consult and obtain the consent of remoter agnates. The appellants were consulted by defendant No. 1 but they refused their consent.
 The first appellant who examined himself as P.W. 1 stated that he withheld his consent because lie was afraid that he would lose his reversionary right to the estate. it is also clear that the appellant was negotiating a price through several persons for giving his consent. The Trial 521 Court as well as the High Court rightly came to the conclusion that the appellants improperly withheld their consent to the adoption. The contention that the widow was induced by improper motive in adopting negatived with reference to the statement of the 1st defendant stating that she had adopted 2nd defendant for the spiritual benefit of her husband. The statement by her under the stress of the cross-examination that she resorted to adoption for putting an end to the troubles by the sapindas which she had in plenty would only disclose how bitter she was against them. [523 A-B, D-E, G, 524 E, F, G-H, 525E] Kanakaratnanz v. Narasimha Rao, ILR (1942) Mad. 173 approved.
 Sri Raja Ravu Sri Krishnayya Rao & Anr. v. Raja of Pittapur, (1928) ILR. 51 Mad. 893; Basba Rabidat Singh v. Indar Kumar- (1889) IA 16 Cal. 556 (P.C.) referred to.
 The basis for requiring the assent of the sapindas is the presumed incapacity of women for independence. During the 100 years society has advanced and the presumption of incapacity of women for independent can no longer be taken for granted. Apart from the Constitutional guarantee that there will be no discrimination against any citizen on the ground of sex, it is clear that women have established that the presumption of incapacity for independence is no longer valid. It is well known that women have occupied highest positions and proved themselves equal to men in all professions and other avocations. In the changed circumstances therefore the basis for the requirement of the assent of kinsmen by a widow due to incapacity no longer exists and, it may well be asked whether the sapinda's assent is any more necessary. [529 B, E-G] The contention of the appellants that 'Puthra Pouthrathi Santhathies' does not include an adopted son negatived. An adopted son is as good as a Puthra for all purposes. It may be different in case of an illegitimate son. [532 F-H]
