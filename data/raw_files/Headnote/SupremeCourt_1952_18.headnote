 Section 11, sub-s. (1), of the Preventive Detention Act, 1950, provided that "in any case where the Advisory Board has reported that there is in its opinion sufficient cause for the detention of a person, the appropriate government may confirm the detention order and continue the detention for such period as it thinks fit". The case of the peti- tioner who was arrested under the Act was referred to the Advisory Board and on receiving a report from the Board that in its opinion there was sufficient cause for the detention of the petitioner the Government decided to confirm the order of detention and this decision was communicated to the District Magistrate by a confidential letter signed by the Assistant Secretary to the Government for the Secretary to the Government. The material portion of the letter ran thus :-- "The Government is accordingly pleased to confirm the detention order against the detenu. Please inform the detenu accordingly and report compliance." In an applica- tion for a writ in the nature of habeas corpus it was con- tended on behalf of the petitioner that his detention was illegal: (i) because the Government had at the time of confirming the order omitted to specify the period during which the detention should continue; (ii)because the order of confirmation was not expressed to be made in the name of the Governor as required by Art. 166 (1) of the Constitu- tion:
 Held, per PATANJALI SASTRI C.J., MUKHERJEA, DAS and CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR JJ. (MAHAJAN J. dissenting)--that the omission to state the period of further detention while confirming the detention order under s. 11 (1) of the Pre- ventive Detention Act could not render the detention illegal because, per PATANJALI SASTRI. C.J. and DAs J.--on a proper construction ors. 11 (1), a specification of the period of continuation of the detention is not necessary, however desirable it may be;per MUKHERJEA and CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR, JJ.--though s. 11 (1) does contemplate that a period should be mentioned during 613 which the further detention of the detenu is to continue, mere omission to do so would not make the order a nullity and justify release of the detenu.
 Held also, per PATANJALI SASTRI C.J., MUKHERJEA, DAS and CHANDRASE KHARA AIYER, J J, that though the Preventive Detention Act contemplates and requires the taking of an executive decision for confirming a detention order under s.
 11 (1), omission to make and authenticate that executive decision in the form mentioned in Art. 166 will not make the decision itself illegal for the provisions in that article are merely directory and not mandatory. Per MUKHERJEA and CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR, JJ.--Section 11(1)of the Preventive Detention Act does contemplate a formal order of confirma- tion and Art. 166(1) of the Constitution would apply to the case; clauses (1) and (2) of the said article must however be read together. While cl. (1) relates to the mode of expression of an executive order or instrument, cl. (2) lays down the way in which such order is to be authenticated, and when both these forms are complied with, an order or instru- ment would be immune from challenge in a court of law on the ground that it has not been made or executed by the Governor of the State. Even if cl. (1) is taken to be an independent provision unconnected with cl. (2) and having no relation to the purpose indicated therein, cl. (1) is directory and not imperative in its character.
 MAHAJAN J.--Section 11 (I)of the Preventive Detention Act contemplates that when the report of the Advisory Board reaches the Government it has to come to a decision and pass an order in accordance with that decision against the detenu to the effect that in view of the report of the Advisory Board the detention order is continued for a certain period and failure to fix the period of further detention would make the detention illegal.
