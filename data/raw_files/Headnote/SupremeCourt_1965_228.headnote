 At a time when the State of Kerala was being governed by virtue of a Proclamation under Art. 356 by the President acting through the Governor, the petitioners, who were members of the Left 'Communist Party along with others numbering 140 in all, were ordered to be detained under r.
 30(1) (b) of the Defence of India Rules by orders of the Governor of Kerala passed on December 29, 1964. On March 4, 1965, the Governor's orders were cancelled and on the same date fresh orders of detention were made by the Central Government.
 In petitions under Art. 132, for writs of Habeas Corpus, the petitioners contended, inter alia, that the orders of detention of the 29th December were mala fide in that they were calculated to damage the prospect of the petitioners' party at the impending elections in the State, and that the orders of the 4th March were also mala fide as they were made to circumvent the possibility of the petitioners' release in case their party came into power after the elections. It was further contended that there was no application of the mind by the Government when the detention orders were passed, for as many as 140 orders were passed on the same day; that there Was no material before the Central Government when it passed the orders of March 4, 1965, and that if the orders of detention of December 29, 1964 were good, the only way in which they could be cancelled was by release of the petitioners and they could not be replaced by other orders of detention.
 
HELD : The petitioners' detention under the orders passed on March 4, 1965 was legal.
 It is well settled that in dealing with a petition for habeas cot-pus the courts has to see whether the detention on the date on which the application is made is legal if nothing more has intervened between the date of the application and the date of hearing. Accordingly, the court would only consider the legality of the orders passed on March 4, 1965. [430 C-D, E] It could not be said that the detention orders were passed mala fide if the Central Government was satisfied that with a view to preventing the petitioners from acting in a manner prejudicial to the defence of India, etc., it was necessary to detain them. [430 F-G] There was no reason to disbelieve the affidavit filed on behalf of the Government of India that it was satisfied with respect to each individual person detained that his detention wag necessary; and that there was meterial before it on which it came to its conclusion. [431 E, H] 4 2 8 There was nothing illegal in the President functioning under the Proclamation withdrawing the' orders of detention of December 29, 1964 and thereafter the Central Government passing the orders of detention of its own on the same day.
 it was not necessary to carry out the empty formality of release from jail under the orders of cancellation and then to arrest the person released immediately they came out of jail and to serve on them the, new orders of detention dated March 4, 1965.
