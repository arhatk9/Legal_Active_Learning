 In the Criminal application filed by the appellants under section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Trial Court on an appreciation of the evidence accepted the defence of the respondent that the first appellant was not his wife but held that the second appellant was his illegitimate child and directed the payment of Rs. 25 per month towards maintenance of the child. Two revision petitions preferred by both the parties before the Kerala High Court were heard together. Allowing the respondents' petition and dismissing the appellants' petition, the Court held that the second appellant was not the child of the respondent. Hence the appeals by special leave.
 Allowing Criminal Appeal No. 462A/81 and dismissing Crl. Appeal No. 463/81, the Court, ^ 
 HELD : 1. The High Court in its criminal jurisdiction under section 401 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was not justified in making a re-assessment of the evidence and in substituting its own view for that of the trial Judge on a question of fact. The questions whether the appellant No. 1 was the married wife of the respondent and whether the appellant No. 2 was the legitimate or illegitimate child of the respondent are pre-eminently questions of fact.
