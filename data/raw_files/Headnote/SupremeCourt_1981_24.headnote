 The parties are agreed that the provisions of Rule 49 are not attracted and no fees are payable under it at the stage of entry into a market area if the agricultural produce in question is covered by sub-rule(2) of Rule 48, i.e., when such produce fulfils either of the following conditions:- (i) It is brought from outside the market area thereinto for use therein by the industrial concerns situated therein or for export and in respect thereof a declaration has been made and a certificate has been obtained in Form V.
 (ii) The sale or purchase of such produce comes within the purview of sub-section (3) of section 6 of the Gujarat Agricultural Produce Markets Act.
 This interpretation of Rules 48 and 49 which flows directly from the language employed therein is correct. Rule 49 will have no application to any case which falls within the ambit of sub-rule (2) of Rule 48. [763 D-E]
