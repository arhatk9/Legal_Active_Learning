 The appellant was a citizen of Pakistan and had come to India on June 6, 1950 on a temporary permit. During his absence the Pakistan Government declared him to be an evacuee. In December 1950 he was granted a Domicile Certificate and since then he continued to reside in Bombay.
 On May 4, 1945 the appellant had opened an account with the Bank of India (Hyderabad, Sind Branch) called the Cash Credit Account. The amount was secured by an assignment of life insurance policies on the appellant's life and mortgage of certain immovable properties. In July 1949 the appellant took another loan of Rs. 1,25,000 from the Hyderabad Bank on the security of certain properties and the personal security of himself and his wife. On July 22, 1952 the appellant mads an application under s. 5 of the Displaced Persons (Debt Adjustment) Act, 1951 for adjustment of his debts against several creditors, but pressed it only against the Bank. Against the trial court's judgment both parties appealed to the High Court. The High Court's judgment was challenged by the appellant in this Court. It was contended on behalf of the appellant, inter alia : (i) That no interest should have been allowed to the Bank from August 15, 1947 in view of the provisions of s. 29 of the Act; (ii) That the liability on the Cash Credit Account and on the Loan Account was not the sole responsibility of the appellant but was a joint liability and the High Court should have apportioned the joint debt under s. 22, without construing that section with the aid of s. 43 of the Indian Contract Act; (iii) That the insurance policies did not fall under s. 17 of the Act and the appellant was entitled to a refund of the amount recovered from them; and (iv) That the High Court erred in interpreting the word 'renewal' occurring in the definition of s. 2(6).
 
HELD : (i) Proviso (b) to s. 29(1) of the Act confers a discretion on the Tribunal to allow interest not exceeding 4 per cent per annum for the period from August 15, 1947 up to December 10, 1951, the date on which the Act came into force in Bombay after taking into account the paying capacity of the debtor as defined in s. 32. In the present case the Hi Court had on the statement of the appellant himself found his paying capacity to be far in excess of the debts due 'from him, and it was therefore a fit case in which interest at 4 per cent should be allowed to' the Bank from August 15, 1947 to December 10, 1951. [876 A-D] (ii)Even assuming that s. 43 of the contract is not relevant for the construction of s. 22 of the Act the plea of the appellant for apportionment of the debt must be rejected because from his own pleadings it was apparent that the liability both on the Loan Account and on the Cash Credit Account was undertaken solely by the appellant.
 There was no justification for interfering with the finding of the High Court in this respect. [876 E-H] 869 (iii) The insurance policies were 'movable property'as defined in s. 3 of the General Clauses Act. In the present case there was an absolute assignment of the policies in favour of the Bank and the policies were also in its possession. Section 17 of the Act therefore applied and unless realisation under the policies was in excess of the debt due the appellant was not entitled to refund. [877 F-G] (iv) The confirmation or acknowledgement of indebtedness cludes both loan and interest and further advance if any within the ambit of the expression renewal in the proviso the Act. The liability referred to in the proviso is the liability solely by way of renewal and the proviso to the section states that the original loan and not the one for which the renewal is made is the debt within the meaning of the section. But the proviso does not apply if the confirmation or acknowledgement is not solely by way of renewal on accoust of loan or interest but includes further advance. The High Court was justified in determining the appellant's debts on this view. [877 H; 878 A-B]
