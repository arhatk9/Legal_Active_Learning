 On November 18, 1968, fourteen charges under s. 46(1) of the Andhra Pradesh Charitable and Hindu Religious institutions and Endowments Act, 1966, were preferred against the petitioner who was the Mathadhipathi of Sri Swami Hathiramji Math, Tirupathi-Thirumalla. Under s. 46(3) he was suspended from his office pending enquiry under s. 46(2), and under s.
 47, the Assistant Commissioner, Endowments Department, was directed to attend to the day-to-day administration of the Math and its endowments temporarily until the disposal of the inquiry. The petitioner challenged the constitutional validity of ss. 46 and 47 as violative of his fundamental rights under Arts. 14, 19(1)(f), 25(1) and 26(b) and (d), in a petition under Art. 32.
 
HELD : (1) A mathadhipathi is the head and superior of a spiritual fraternity and the purpose of a math is to encourage and foster spiritual training by the maintenance of a competent line of teachers who could impart religious instruction to the disciples and followers of the math and to strengthen the doctrines of the particular school or order of which they profess to be adherents. By virtue of his office he is under an obligation to discharge his duties as a trustee and is answerable as such. He enjoys large powers for the benefit of the institution of which he is the bead. He is to incur expenditure for the math, that is, for carrying on religious worship, for the disciples, and for maintaining the dignity of his office. If he cannot perform his duties either as a spiritual or a temporal head or cannot properly administer or manage the trust property or has been guilty of breach of trust or wilful default or leads an immoral life, action can be taken against him under s. 46(1). The power is given to the Commissioner to make an inquiry into or try the allegations or charges against him and to order his removal if the charges are established.
 Under s. 104 of the Act, the proceedings before the Commissioner are quasijudicial, and if he makes an order of removal, it can be challenged in a suit in a court of law with a right of appeal to the High Court. As regards the power to suspend under s. 46(3), the power of suspension, pending inquiry, is a necessary and reasonable part of the procedure. If the mathadhipathi is allowed to function during the pendency of an enquiry he may tamper with the evidence against him and the purpose of the enquiry may be defeated. Therefore, the restrictions imposed by the impugned provisions are reasonable and in the interest of general public and do not violate Arts. 14 and 19(1)(f).

 104 (2)Under Art. 25(1), the petitioner has a fundamental right to practise and propagate his religion freely, but, by the Commissioner exercising his powers under s. 47 of the Act, the petitioner had not been prohibited or debarred 'from professing, practising and propagating his religion.
 He could enter the Math and exercise the fundamental right.
 [113 E] (3)There is nothing in ss. 46 and 47 which empower the Commissioner to interfere with the autonomy of the religious denomination in the matter of deciding as to what rites and ceremonies are, essential according to the tenets of the religion the denomination professes or practises. Neither the Commissioner nor the Assistant Commissioner who has been put in charge of the day-to-day affairs have interfered in such matters. Therefore, there is no contravention of Art.
 26(b). Under Art. 26(d), a religious denomination or its representative has the fundamental right to .administer property according to law. The provisions of s. 47 do not take away the -right of administration from the hands of a religious denomination altogether and vest it for all time in a person or authority who is not entitled to exercise that right under the custom prevailing in the math; nor could such power be exercised without any justifying necessity. The section deals only with a situation where there is a temporary vacancy far any of the reasons stated therein as also because the mathadhipathi has been suspended pending an enquiry under s. 46, that is, the Commissioner can appoint some one to carry on the administration of the math and its endowments only when the conditions of s. 47 are satisfied. [113 F-H; 114 A-D] In the present case, the Assistant Commissioner was appointed because of the enquiry which was pending against the petitioner, in which, serious charges of misappropriation and defalcation of trust funds and leading an immoral life were being investigated.
