 The respondent was an employee of the appellant. Certain disciplinary proceedings were taken against the respondent.
 These charges were enquired into by the Disciplinary Officer of the appellant. That Officer found that the charges were proved against the respondent and submitted his report to the competent authority. On May 18, 1967, the competent authority, after considering the report of the Enquiry Officer recorded a note on the file expressing agreement with the report of the Enquiry Officer that the respondent be removed from service after giving him one month's wages and directing that simultaneous application be filed before the Tribunal (where several disputes between the appellant and its workmen, were pending), seeking approval of the action taken against the respondent, as required u/s. 32(2) of the Act. A note dated June 22, 1967 was sent to the respondent in which he was informed that he was being removed from service with effect from July 1, 1967. This note reached him on June 26. 1967. One month's wages were remitted to him on June 28, 1967 by money order which he received on July 1, 1967. An application u/s. 32(2)(b) of the Act was made on July 3, 1967. The Labour Court while finding that the enquiry report and the punishment awarded on the basis of the enquiry was justified, held that the filing of the application u /s. 32 (2) (b) of the Act on July 3, 1967 did not satisfy the requirement of the proviso thereto.
 On appeal by special leave, Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) The proviso to S. 32(2)(b) contemplates three things dismissal or discharge; (2) payment of wages; and (3) making of an application for approval to be simultaneous and to be part of the same transaction. The object is that when the employer takes action under s. 32(2)(b) by dismissing- or discharging an employee he should immediately make payment to him or offer payment of wages for one month and also make an application to the Tribunal or to the Labour Court, as the case may be, for approval. The employer's conduct should show that the three things contemplated under the proviso are parts of the same transaction.
 Simultaneous action has to be taken in these matters but that does not mean that all the three things mentioned before should be done on the same day. [115 B] Strawboard Manufacturing Co. v. Govind, [1962] Suppl. 3 S.C.R. 618 and P. H. Kalvani v. M/s. Air France, Calcutta [1963] INSC 40; [1964] 2 S.C.R. 104, relied on.
 (ii) No hard and fast rule can be laid down in these matters. Each case must be decided on its own facts. In the present case all the three. things which were don(- were a part of the same transaction.
