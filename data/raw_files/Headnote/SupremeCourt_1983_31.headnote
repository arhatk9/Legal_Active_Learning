 Under s. 39 of the Uttar Pradesh State Universities Act, 1973 a person is disqualified from being chosen as a member of the Management of an affiliated college if he or his relative accepts any remuneration for any work in such college. However, the proviso to that section states that nothing in the section shall apply to the acceptance of any remuneration by a teacher as such. The expression 'relative' as defined in the explanation to the section includes within its meaning a 'brother'.
 The election of appellant-3 as Honorary Secretary of the Executive Committee of an affiliated college was set aside by respondent-1 on the ground that he was disqualified from being chosen as such, as his brother was a lecturer in that college. The writ petition filed against the order of respondent-1 was dismissed by the High Court.
 Counsel for appellants contended that cases in which remuneration is accepted by a relative in his capacity as a teacher are exempted from the operation of s. 39 by virtue of the proviso thereto and since appellant-3's brother was accepting remuneration as a teacher in the college, appellant-3 was not disqualified from being chosen as a member of the management of the college. It was further contended that s. 39 is prospective in operation in the sense that if a person was a teacher prior to the date when the Act came into force, his relative would not be disqualified even if he is elected after the coming into force of the Act.
 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: By reason of the proviso, the disqualification provided for by s. 39 will not apply "to the acceptance of any remuneration by a teacher as such". What the proviso means is that a teacher shall not be disqualified for being chosen as a member of the Management of the college for the reason 623 that he accepts remuneration from the college in his capacity as a teacher. The object of the proviso is to enable the teachers of a college to become members of the management of the college. The exception carved out by the proviso cannot apply to cases in which the person elected to the Executive Committee of the college is not himself a teacher but whose relative is a teacher. The proviso, thus interpreted, will give meaning to the provision contained in cl. (b) of Statute 13.05 of the Meerut University First Statutes, 1977 which provides that 25 per cent of the Members of the Management of a college shall be teachers.
 Granting protection to relatives of teachers is foreign to the very object of the proviso, the reason being that such relatives should not become a handy medium for distributing favours and patronage to the teachers. [626 B-H; 627 A-C] Judgment dated August 26, 1981 of the Allahabad High Court in Civil Misc. Writ No. 11147 of 1980, approved.
 In the instant case, appellent-3 is not protected by the proviso; the disqualification is incurred by him because his brother, who is a teacher, accepts remuneration for the work done by him for the college. [626 E] (b) The mere circumstance that s. 39 uses a verb in the present tense, namely, "accepts", will not justify the conclusion that the section will apply to those cases only wherein the remuneration is accepted by the teacher for the first time after the Act came into force. The section, on its terms, must apply even to those cases in which a teacher has been accepting remuneration prior to the date on which the Act came into force with the result that the relative of such a teacher cannot be chosen as a member of the Management of the college. While interpreting a statute one must have regard to the substance of the matter and hypertechnical considerations should be ruled out. The interpretation should, as far possible, further the object of the statute. [627 D-F] Judgment dated August 12, 1981 of the Allahabad High Court in Civil Misc. Writ No. 8647 of 1980, overruled.
