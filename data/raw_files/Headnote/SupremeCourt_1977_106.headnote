 An excise duty of Rs. 55055.87 was levied and collected from the respondent-firm by the Excise authorities treating the non-woven felts manufactured by them as "woollen fab- rics" covered by entry 21 in Schedule I to the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944. The Gujarat High, Court allowed the writ petition filed by the respondent and held that the respondent's products were not "woollen fabrics" and direct- ed the refund of the entire sum collected as excise duty.
 Dismissing the appeal by certificate to this Court, 
 HELD: (1) The well-known rule in interpreting items in statutes is that resort should be had not to the scientif- ic or the technical meaning of such terms but to their popular meaning or the meaning attached to them by those dealing in them, that is to say, their commercial sense.

 (2) Fabric means woven material. Entries 19 to 22 in the Schedule deal with fabrics. Entry 21 describes woollen fabrics as meaning all varieties of fabrics manufactured out of wool, barring the exceptions mentioned, including blan- kets, lohis, rugs, shawls and embroidery in the piece in strips or in motifs. The word "fabric" in entry 21 has been used to mean woven material in which sense it is popularly understood. The term "woollen fabrics" in that sense was not wide enough to cover non-woven material which is wool- based. Blankets. rugs and shawls etc. have been specifical- ly included in the entry out of abundant caution to indicate that "woollen fabrics" in entry 21 means not only woollen garments but also woollen material used as covering or for similar other purposes. [473 H, 474 F-G] (3) It is plain from entry 21 in Schedule 1 to the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944 that the respondent's products did not fall within it as they are nonwoven felts from woollen fibres.
