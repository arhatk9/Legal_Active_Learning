 An industrial award known as Puranik Award dated 26-10-1956 which fixed Rs. 35/- as the minimum wage in the Litho Industry in the Vidarbha region stood terminated with effect from July 22, 1958 as per a notice dated January 22, 1958 from the employees of Litho Industry. Pending the decision in the reference made under s. 31A of the C.P. and Berar Industrial Disputes Settlement Act, 1947 arising out of the demands of the employees of the Litho Industry, an agreement was entered into on February 21, 1966 between the employers and the employees of various concerns requesting the St-ate Government to exercise its power u/s 39 of the Act and to refer to the arbitration of the State Industrial Court the disputes mentioned in the agreement. By the notification dated 7-1-1965 the Government referred the disputes in respect of the demands of the employees set out in Schedule 11 to the Notification made against the 10 employers specifically mentioned in Schedule I to the notification, being the employers in the Litho Press Industry in the Vidarbha region. The demands in particular were to the disputes as to the living wage, for fitment of the employees already in service at the date of the demand for revised scales of wages with retrospective effect from 1956, and for the dearness allowance with retrospective effect from 1959 to be linked with the index number at the rate of 8 paise per point with 1956 as 100. The State Government by its notification dated December 31, 1964 fixed Rs, 70/- per month as the minimum wage under the Minimum Wages Act. The notification divided the employees into several classes. It did not attach any scale of pay to the minimum wages fixed but provided that at interval of every six months the State Government may issue a notification fixing certain amounts payable in addition to the minimum wages as special allowances.
 The Industrial Court made its award on May 10. 1968. The Award divided the employers into two classes being Class A and Class B on the basis of the financial capacity of the employers to pay. The award fixed rates and scales of wages for the employees of the three employers in Class A being Shivraj Shakti and Vasant Litho Works. The award did not fix any rates and scales of wages in respect of other units of the industry the reason being that they did not have adequate financial capacity. In the case of Class A the award also fixed the employees of various duration of service by way of fitment into the scales of wages awarded in the award. It also fixed the date from which the new rates and scales of wages were to be deemed to have commenced.
 Against the, award six writ petition& were filed before the High Court, three by the appellants in this Court and other three by the employees. The High Court agreed with the view of the Industrial Court and held that the award classifying the employers into two classes A & B on the basis of their paying capacity, determining the rates and scales of wages and the dearness allowance regarding Class A employees is valid.
 The appellants in these appeals by special leave contend that there is no warrant for the direction by the High Court to the Industrial Court to fix an industrial minimum wage regardless of the paying capacity of the industry or the employer.
 412 Allowing the appeals in part and modifying the order of remand the Court 
HELD : 1. (a) It is permissible to divide the industry into appropriate classes and then deal with the capacity of the industry to pay class-wise. [418 H, 419 Al Express Newspapers (P) Ltd. & Anr. v. Union of India and Ors. [1959] S.C.R. 12, followed.
 (b) The extent of the business carried on by the concerns, the capital invested, the profits made, the nature of the business, their standing, the strength of labour force, the dividends declared and the prospects about the future of business and other relevant factors have to be borne in mind for the purpose of comparison. The principle is that in applying the industry-cumregion formula for fixing wage scales. the Tribunal should lay stress on the industry part of the formula if there were a large number of concerns in the same region carrying on the same industry, but where the number of industries of the same kind in a particular region were small, it was the region part of the formula which assumed importance. In the former case in order that pro- duction cost may not be unequal and there may be equal competition, wages should generally be fixed on the basis of the comparable industries, namely, industries of the same kind.

2. The dispute, in the instant case on the stand taken by the employees related to fixation of a fair wage and not a minimum wage. In fact, the employees requested the Government to fix a minimum wage which was accordingly fixed. Fair wage is a mean between the living wage and minimum wage. The minimum wage contemplated above is something more than the bare minimum of the subsistence, wage sufficient to cover the bare physical needs of the worker and his family, providing also for the preservation- of the efficiency of the worker and for some measure of education, medical requirements and amenities. So far as the minimum wage is concerned it is to be fixed without any reference to the paying capacity of the industry. [420 F-G, 421 A-D] Express News Papers (P) Ltd. v. Union of India, [1959] S.C.R. 12 and U. Unichoyi & Ors. v. The State of Kerala [1961] INSC 158; [1962] 1 S.C.R. 946 referred to.
 3(a) When a dispute is pending before any tribunal regarding the minimum wage, the award will bind and to that extent the provisions of the Act will not be applicable but in other eases the Government is entitled under the Minimum Wages Act to fix a minimum wage. Section 5 prescribes the procedure under which the minimum wage is to be fixed and revised.
 Provision is made for appointment of committees and consultation of the persons concerned before the minimum wage is fixed. The procedure is that in the absence of a dispute pending before the Tribunal regarding the fixation of minimum wages, the minimum wages fixed by the Government will bind the parties. [421 G-H, 422 A] (b) In an industrial dispute a basic minimum wage can be fixed when the statute has not fixed the minimum wage.
 Section 3(2A) of the Minimum Wages Act does contemplate fixation of minimum wages by the Tribunal. In fixing such a minimum wage the Tribunal may take into account all the facts and fix a minimum wage which may be higher than the minimum wage contemplated under Minimum Wages Act. The Industrial Tribunal was not called upon to fix a minimum wage for both the employers as well as the employees proceeded on the basis that the tribunal was fixing a fair wage. In fact, the employees, requested the Government to fix a minimum wage which was accordingly done. In this view no further reference need be made 413 to Section 3(2A) of the Minimum Wages Act. The tribunal proceeded on the basis that it was called upon to fix a fair wage. In the circumstances, the view taken by the High Court that it was incumbent on the tribunal to fix an industrial wage apart from the minimum wage without taking into account the paying capacity of the Industry is erroneous. [422 B-E] (c) In view of the finding that what the Tribunal was called upon to fix was a fair wage and not a minimum wage, the financial capacity of the concerns classified under B is relevant and the finding of the Tribunal that their finances would not justify any provision for fair wages has to be accepted. Further, it will be seen that the employees of the concerns classified under B have not preferred any appeal and the question cannot be gone into the appeals.
 [422 H, 423 A] 
4. The fixation of rate of wages which includes within its compass the fixation of scales of wages and fitment of workmen into wages scales will also depend upon the paying capacity of the industry. The tribunal dealing with Demand No. 5 in its award accepted the suggestion that the Court may grant some increments in proportion to the years of service put in by an employee. It provided two increments for persons who have put in 2 to 5 years of service, three increments for persons who put in service of 5 to 10 years, four increments for persons who have put in service of 10 to 15 years and five increments who have put in service over 15 years. The Tribunal also directed that there shall be a fitment and the employee should be fitted into the scale of pay by placing him at the stage in the scale equal to next above, his basic pay. The award regarding the fitment and increment was accepted by the High court but in the order of remand the High Court directed a general revision as it was not satisfied with the manner in which the financial capacity of the concerns was determined. [423 A-C] 
5. (a) After fixing of the financial capacity, the fair wage which would include fitment, wage scales and dearness allowances payable has to be determined. The question as to the period during which retrospective effect has to be given for payment of fair wages has also to be considered.
 A fair wage is related to the earning capacity and workload.
 While the lower limit of wage structure is the minimum wage any increase over that will depend upon the capacity of the industry to pay. The factors which determine the capacity to pay will be the productivity of the labour, the prevailing rates of wages in the same or similiar industries in the same or neighbouring localities, the present economic position of the industry, its prospect as in the, near future etc. The fair wage will grow with the growth and development of the national economyand the progress made by the industry and must approximate to the capacity of the industry to pay. The claim of the employees for a fair and higher wage depends not only on the financial capacity of the employer but also on to interests of the consumer and the State, the employers' desire for a reasonable profit the rise in price which may effect the consumer and the national economy which may have an adverse effect on the labour itself. [423 D-H] (b) in order to determine the fair wage including the scale of pay, the Price rise, the dearness allowance etc., the financial capacity of the concern has The profit and loss account, the prospects of the company improving itself in future and all other relevant matters will have to be taken into account. The expenses properly incurred for working the industry such as buying of raw materials, expenses incurred in running the factory, office and other transport expenses, the expenses incurred in marketing and other such allowable expenditure has to be deducted. Neither the contention of the respondents that the gross profits alone has to be taken into account nor the pleas on behalf of the appellants that the net profit alone should be the basis of determining the financial capacity can be accepted. The determination of gross profit and net profit vary according to the basis of accounting adopted. The provisionfor Income tax and forreserves must take second place as compared to provision for wagestructure and gratuity, Which stands on the same footing is Provident Fund which is also a retiral benefit.The provisions 'for income-tax, 414 reserve and depreciation are not permitted. The High Court, was therefore right in its view that no rebate can be allowed towards payment of income-tax. [424 A-H, 425 A] Gramaphone Company Ltd. v. Its Workmen, [1964] 2 L.L.J. 131 and Indian Link Chain Manufacturers Ltd. v. Their Workmen, [1973] 1 S.C.R. 790; applied.
 (c) The High Court is not correct in its view that any amount paid a,, bonus in addition to the minimum bonus cannot be deducted as expenses. The amount which is paid as bonus goes, in substance to augment the wages and as such is liable to be deducted in determining the paying capacity of the employer. It seems that the High Court was influenced by the fact that the additional bonus cannot be deducted at the beginning of the year. This fact will not make any difference for the paying capacity of the concern can be ascertained after deducting the amount in the subsequent year. [425 B-D] 
6. When a dearness allowance is fixed as a part of the fair wage it will have to depend upon the paying capacity of the employer. Though the dearness allowance is given to compensate for the rise of cost of living, cent per cent neutralisation is not given as it may, lead to inflation, and therefore Dearness Allowance is often little less than one-Hundred per cent neutralisation. In fixing of the dearness allowance, the principle that is followed in determining the paying capacity for fixing wage structure, is equally applicable. In determining the dearness allowance increase in the cost of living, the resulting change in the economic conditions and the pattern of dearness allowance' prevailing in other concerns in the same region are factors, to be taken into consideration. The increase in the cost of living since the time when the dearness, allowance was last fixed is also taken into account. Therefore the High Court is not right in its observation that the dearness allowance should effect a cent per cent neutralisation. [425 F-H, 426 A-B] Clerks of Calcutta Tramways v. Calcutta Tramways Co. Ltd., [1956] INSC 57; [1956] S.C.R. 772, Hindustan Times Ltd.' New Delhi v. Their Workmen [1964] 1 S.C.R. 234 and Ahmedabad Mill Owners Association v. The Textile Labour Association. [1965] INSC 149; [1966] 1 S.C.R. 382, followed.
 
7. In granting retrospective effect the Tribunal has a discretion to fix the date taking into account the financial position of the Company. [426 G] 
8. The High Court is not correct in its view that the Industrial Tribunal should fix an industrial minimum wage without taking into account, the paying capacity of the employer. [427 A-B]
