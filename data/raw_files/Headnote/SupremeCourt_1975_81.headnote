 The petitioner and two of his associates were charged with offences under ss. 451, 324 etc. I.P.C. in one case. In another, the, petitioner and three of his associates were charged with offences under ss. 148, 149, 307 etc. I.P.C.
 In respect of both the cases, however, the police applied before the Magistrate requesting that the petitioner be discharged for his detention under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971.
 An order of detention under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act was then passed against the petitioner and his associates on two grounds namely (1) that he and his associates reinforced by 25 others formed a violent mob near a workshop manufacturing defence materials and hurled brickbats creating fear, frightfulness and insecurity among the workers and the authorities, and (2) that he and his associates armed with pistol and high explosive bombs created a great disturbance of public order which resulted in panic and confusion on a public road. The detention orders against the associates were revoked because the Advisory Board reported that there was no sufficient cause for their detention. The petitioner, however, did not appear before the Board and his representation was considered by the State and forwarded to the Advisory Board.
 His second representation was not forwarded to the Advisory Board.
 In a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution the petitioner contended (1) that the provisions of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act bad been used as a convenient substitute for the provisions of ordinary law for detaining the petitioner because his discharge was asked for on the ground that he was going to be detained under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act., (2) that he grounds furnished relate to maintenance of law and order and therefore it Could not be made the basis of the order of detention; (3) that the detaining authority had not applied his mind to the petitioner's case as shown by the fact that the grounds of detention show that the petitioner had to be discharged from the criminal cases due to want of sufficient evidence for the successful prosecution whereas the order of discharge showed that he was discharged because he was going to be detained under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971; (4) that the grounds of detention were vague; (5) that the Government had failed to periodically review the case of the petitioner and that had rendered his continued detention illegal and that this was a case where s. 15 of the Act should have been applied and the petitioner released.
 Dismissing the petition, 
HELD:(1) (a) It is not always possible for a Court dealing with an habeas corpus petition in the case of a pet-son detained under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act to say whether in a case where a criminal case had been registered against a person and then withdrawn, and he was detained under the provisions of the Act, that was proper or not. The Court is not in possession of all the evidence to be able to decide for itself whether the prosecution would have been successful or not and without those materials being available it is not possible for the Court to say that the punitive action should have been taken and not detention. It is the authority conducting the prosecution that would be in a position to decide whether evidence was available which could establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt before the criminal court. Where the authority was not sure that such material was available it may not like to face the prospect of the prosecution 19 failing and being charged with vindictiveness or mala fides if thereafter the accused was detained preventively. The Court should be slow towards the conclusion that the detenu could have been successfully prosecuted in the absence of all the material before it and then going on to criticise the detaining authority for not continuing the prosecution but detaining him. [25D-F] In the instant case the fact that an application for discharge was made by the police would not in any way vitiate the grounds of detention or show that the Police Commissioner had no sufficient material before him to be satisfied that the petitioner ought to be detained in order to prevent him from acting in a manner prejudicial to public order Want of evidence for successful prosecution is a matter which can belegitimately taken into account by an authority competent to pass an orderof detention under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act for deciding whether he should pass an order of detention against a particular person. [25H] Haraclhan Saha v. State of West Bengal, A.I.R. 1974 S.C.
 2154; Srilal Shaw v. State of W.B., [1974] INSC 262; [1975] 1 S.C.C. 336; and Sadhul Roy v. The State of Bengal, [1975] INSC 13; [1975] 3 S.C.R. 291 referred to.
 (b)The fact that sufficient evidence to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt was not available to the police and for that reason they had asked for the discharge of the petitioner did not mean that the detaining authority had not before him evidence on which he could be satisfied. The detaining authority, when he came to know that the petitioner was going to be discharged from the criminal cases for want of sufficient evidence could very well take the view that it was necessary for the purpose of preventing the petitioner from acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order that he should be detained and if he was satisfied on the evidence available. his subjective satisfaction could not be questioned by this Court. Merely because the two companions of the petitioner were 'released because there was not sufficient cause for their continued detention, it could not be assumed that there was no sufficient cause for the detention of the petitioner. [26 B-D] (2)The petitioner, along with his associates and 25 others formed a violent mob outside the workshop and pelted brickbats for over two hours causing fear and alarm not only to persons working in-the factory but to people passing along the road. Again in the second incident the petitioner and his associates armed with pistols and bombs terrorised the local people and the workers causing widespread panic and confusion in the area. Both the incidents clearly relate to public order. [26 G-H] (3)(a) Whereas criminal prosecution is punitive preventive detention is resorted to in order to prevent a person from acting in a manner prejudicial to public order in future.
 If the detaining authority was satisfied that on the grounds mentioned it was necessary to detain the petitioner in order to prevent him from acting in a manner prejudicial to the public order that satisfaction cannot be questioned by the Court. [27G] (b)In the instant case it cannot be said that when the Commissioner of Police stated that the petitioner had to be discharged from the criminal cases due to want of sufficient evidence for a successful prosecution that was one of the grounds for the petitioner's detention. The grounds for detention are the incidents mentioned in the order of detention. [27E] (4)Merely because the name of the petitioner did not figure in the first information report and he was detained for nearly a year after he was arrested on criminal charges, it cannot be said that the grounds were vague. During the course of investigation the detaining authority came to know that the petitioner was one of the persons who took part in the incidents and the petitioner's detention for a year after he was arrested on criminal charges, had nothing to do with the grounds being vague. [27H] (5)(a) Periodical review of a petitioner's detention was not considered by this Court as a legal obligation on the part of the Government nor the failure to do so as making the detention illegal. [28A] 20 Sailesh Dutta v. State of W.B., A.I.R. 1974 S.C. 1816 referred to.
 (b)Section 15 merely confers a power on the Government. The power and duty of this Court is to decide cases coming before it according to law. In so doing it may take various considerations into account. But to advise the Government as to how they should exercise their functions or powers conferred on them by statute is not one of this Court's functions. Where the Court is able to give effect to its views in' the form of a valid and binding order that is a different matter. Furthermore, s. 15 deals with release on parole and there is nothing to show that the petitioner applied for to be released on parole for any specific purpose. Release on parole is made only on the request of the party and for a specific purpose. [29B-C] Babulal Das v. State of W.B. [1975] INSC 6; [1975] 1 S.C.C. 311 held inapplicable.
