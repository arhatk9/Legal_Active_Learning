 The appellant company was the proprietor of certain mills, which was working three shifts in some of its departments.
 The third shift was closed and the appellant issued a month's notice to three clerks terminating their services.
 The subordinate tribunals and the High Court held that it was a case of reduction of posts of clerks without following the procedure prescribed by the Bombay Industrial Relations Act 1946, namely, giving of notice of change as required by s. 42, and thus committed an illegal change in contravention of s. 46, in respect of an industrial matter in item 1 of Schedule 11 of the Act.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) The reply sent, by the management justifying their action, to the Union of workers, indicates, that they had only effected a retrenchment of clerks whom they considered to be surplus. There was no admission that they had effected a reduction in the posts of clerks. Read as a whole, the letter only shows that the termination was necessitated by the closure of the third shift and that the reduction in the clerical strength in consequence of such termination did not result in any increase in the work load of others. [155 B-D] (2) Unless there is a reduction in posts item 1 of Sech. 11 will, have no application. The item refers to reduction intended to be of permanent or semi-permanent character in the number of persons to be employed in a shift, that is, the shift is not abolished but is working and the employer effects a reduction in the number of persons employed in them shift in consequence of which the work load on the remaining persons may be more. Under such a contingency it may be considered that the employer has effected a reduction in the posts occupied by the persons whose services have been terminated. But when the working of the entire shift is stopped there is no question of a reduction in the number of persons employed in a shift. On the other hand, it is a case of termination of employment of all the persons employed in the shift which has been stopped. ] 1 56 A-H] Chaganlal Textile Mills Private Ltd. v. Chatisgoan Girni Kamgar Union, A.I.R. 1959 S.C. 722, followed.
 (3) In the present case, on the closure of the third shift what the employer did was to retrench the employees working in that shift 146 they were found to be surplus in the establishment. It was a case of reduction of persons employed and not one of reduction of the number of persons employed. Hence, it was not a case of reduction of posts.
