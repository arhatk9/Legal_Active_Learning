 The respondent, a head constable, was charged under s. 161, Indian penal Code, and s. 5(1)(b) and (2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, for accepting a bribe for weakening a prosecution case. He was convicted by the trial court, but the High Court allowed the appeal on the ground that under s. 161(1) of the Bombay Police Act 1951, the prosecution was barred having been launched more than six months after the date of the alleged offence.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The High Court was in error, because, the benefit of the six months period of-limitation is available only when the alleged act of the officer was one done under colour of the duty imposed or the authority conferred on him by any provision of law, or in excess of any such duty or authority.Unless there is a reasonable connection between the act complained of and the powers and duties of the office, it cannot be said that the act was done by the accused officer under the colour of his office.[882 E; 883C] The State of Andhra Pradesh v.
