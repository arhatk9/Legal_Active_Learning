 Respondent No.4 obtained a composite lease for mining coal and fire coal and other minerals in respect of certain area comprising Natundihi Pahariabera Colliery from the Government of West Bengal. According to the petitioner, respondent No.4 after obtaining permission from the authorities commenced the extraction of coal from the mine in 1973 and in that connection he employed the petitioner and 700 workmen. Respondent No.4 was prevented from working the coal mine in view of the nationalisation of the coal mines under the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act, 1973.
 After the closure of the coal mine the petitioner and 700 workmen were rendered unemployed and in spite of several representations to the Government of West Bengal, the Coal India and Central Government nothing was done to alleviate their hardship.
 The petitioner invoked the jurisdiction of this Court under Art. 32 of the Constitution purporting to do so on behalf of 700 workmen claiming relief for issue of a writ of mandamus directing the respondent to declare that the said colliery has vested in the Central Government and in the alternative directing the Union of India to take over the colliery under the Nationalisation Act and treat the petitioner and other workmen as workmen of the Central Government and to work the colliery by employing the workmen and to pay them arrears of their wages with effect from April, 1980.
 In support of the petition it was contended: (i) that they have been thrown out of employment although under s. 14 1045 of the Nationalisation Act they continue to be the employees A of the Central Government and are entitled to their wages;
 and (ii) that the said colliery was a coal mine as defined by s.2(b) of the Coal Mines (Taking Over of Management) Act 1973 on the appointed day, namely, 31st January, 1973, but the same was not specified in the Schedule to the Act due to some error and that since the Central Government had acquired knowledge about the existence of the mine it was under a legal duty to issue a notified order making declaration about the existence of such mine and to take over its management.
 On behalf of the respondent No.2 (Coal India - a Government company) it was contended: (i) that respondent No.4 had obtained lease for extracting coal in the said colliery but he never extracted coal and there was no coal mine in existence either on the date of enforcement of the Management Act or on the date when the Nationalisation Act came into force; (ii) that on receipt of information that respondent No.4 was indulging in extracting coal illegally, action was taken against him, and after the enforcement of the Coal Mines Nationalisation (Amendment) Act, 1976 coal mine teases including that of respondent No.4 stood terminated and thereafter he was not entitled to carry on any coal mine, (iii) that since on the appointed day no coal mine existed, there was no question of taking over of the mine either under the Management Act or under the Nationalisation Act; and (iv) that the petitioner and other workmen who may have been employed by respondent No.4 have no right to be the employees of the Central Government or the Government company.
 Dismissing the petition, ^ 
 HELD: 1. Section 14 of the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act, 1973, protects the interest of those workmen who may have been working in a coal mine, specified in the Schedule to the Act. The employees of a private owner even though working in a coal mine are not entitled to be treated employees of the Central Government unless the coal mine is nationalised and specified in the Schedule to that Act.
 Since the colliery in question was not specified in the Schedule to the Nationalisation Act, the workmen which may have been under the employment of the respondent No.4 are not entitled to the benefit of s.14 of the Nationalisation Act. [1054 E-G] 1046 
 2. The Coal Mines (Taking Over of Management) Act, 1973 and the Nationalisation Act both form part of an integral scheme to nationalise coal mines with a view to prevent slaughtering of coal mines and to provide for the co- ordinated development of coal production in a scientific manner and also to conserve the coal deposits. The Management Act was pre-cursor of the Nationalisation Act.
 [1051 F-G] 
 3. There is no provision under the Management Act like s.14 of the Nationalisation Act protecting the interest of the existing employees or conferring right on them to be treated as employees of the Central Government. [1052 D] 
 4. Proviso to s.3(2) of the Management Act, pre- supposes the existence of the coal mine as defined by s.2(b) of the Management Act on the appointed day, namely, January 31, 1973. The legal duty cast on the Central Government to issue a notified order about a coal mine for the purpose of including the same to the Schedule under the Management Act would arise if such coal mine as defined by the Management Act existed on the appointed day. No such legal obligation would be on the Central Government to issue any notified Order making declaration as contemplated by s.3(2) of the Management Act even though the Central Government may have acquired knowledge about the existence of coal mine. The said colliery was not specified either in the Schedule to the Management Act or in the Schedule to the Nationalisation Act, the management of the colliery of respondent No.4 was neither taken over by the Central Government nor was it nationalised under the Nationalisation Act. In the absence of nationalisation of the said colliery, the petitioner and other employees, even if, they had been working in the said colliery could not get benefit of s.14 of the Nationalisation Act. [1055 B-D; 1054 D-E] 
 5. If in reality respondent No.4 had carried on mining operations then there could be conclusive proof in his possession, including the appointment of a Manager to carry on mining operations as required by s.17 of the Mines Act, 1952, periodical inspection reports of the Inspector appointed under the Mines Act, 1952, communication of the actual date of opening of the mine to the Regional Labour Commissioner in the prescribed form as required by Payment of Wages (Mines) Rules 1956 read with s. 2-A(1) of the Mines Act, 1952, assessment of 1047 payment of royalty on coal, annual returns required to be filed with the Labour Enforcement Officer, Register of wages A etc. None of these documents have been produced before the Court. [1056 C-F] 
 6. The burden of establishing that the owner of the colliery had carried on mining operations on the relevant date was on the respondent No. 4 and the workmen claiming relief, but they have failed to discharge that burden. On the contrary material on record shows that no mining operations were carried on by respondent No.4 on or before the appointed day. This conclusion was further supported by the circumstance that respondent No. 4 did not give any intimation to the Central Government as stipulated by 8.
 3(5) of the Management Act. The Management Act and the Nationalisation Act both provide for payment of amounts as compensation to the owners of coal mines whose rights are taken over. In the normal course of human affairs, particularly business affairs, it is difficult to conceive that the owner of a coal mine would not bring to the notice of the Central Government the existence of his coal mine when such coal mine was not included in the Schedule to the Management Act or the Nationalisation Act. Absence of such D intimation indicates that in fact no coal mine existed.[1056 H; 1057 A-D] 
 7. No mining operation is permissible by any person other than those mentioned in 8.3(3) of the Nationalisation Act. Under the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Amendment Act, 1976 all leases of mines including that of Respondent No.4 stood terminated. If respondent No.4 was carrying on mining of coal in 1978, it was wholly unauthorised and illegal, therefore no declaration can be made under the Management Act. [1057 E-G] 
 8. The said colliery was not a coal mine on the appointed day and neither its management nor its ownership ever vested in the Central Government. The petitioner and other workmen are, therefore, not entitled to the protection of 8.14 of the Nationalisation Act and no mandamus as claimed by the Petitioner directing the Central Government to treat the petitioner and other employees as employees of the Central Government can be issued. The Central Government cannot be forced to operate the said colliery as the starting of a coal mine would depend upon a number of factors. me petitioner is, therefore, not entitled to the mandamus directing the Central Government to work the colliery by employing the petitioner and other workmen. The Central Government is not under any legal obligation to pay arrears of wages as claimed by the petitioner. [1057 F-H;
