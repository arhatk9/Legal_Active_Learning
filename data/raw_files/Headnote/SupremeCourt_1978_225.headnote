 The assessee realised certain amounts of money on account of Dharmada (charity) from its customers on sale of yarn and bales of cotton which was its principal business.
 The amounts so realised were shown in a separate column headed "Dharmada" in the bills issued to customers. Without taking them into its trading account, the assessee, credited these amounts to a separate account known as "Dharmada" account. The Board of Directors of the company created a trust and declared that all moneys standing in the "Dharmada Account", and realised on this account in future should be treated as trust fund and utilised by the trustees for such religious and charitable purposes as may be decided by them.
 For the assessment years 1951-52, 1952-53 and 1953-54 the Income Tax officer addled the amounts realised under the head "Dharmada" to the assessable income of the assessee.
 The assessee's appeals to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner were dismissed. On further appeal the Appellate Tribunal held that the trust was void for vagueness and uncertainty and that the realisations partook of the character of trade receipts.
 On reference, the High Court held that the amounts were never the income of the assessee, that the assessee was merely acting as a clearing house for passing the amount to the trust, that the fact that it was a compulsory levy did not make it a trade receipt, that "Dharmada" was a customary levy prevailing in some parts of the country and where it was paid by the customers to a trading concern, the amount was not paid as a price for the commodity sold to the customer.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the Revenue that the realisations being a compulsory levy, they must be regarded as a part of the consideration or price of the goods purchased by the buyers and that gift for "Dharmada" was void for vagueness and uncertainty.
 Dismissing the appeals, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The impugned realisations made by the assessee from ib customers for ''Dharmada'' being entirely earmarked for religious or charitable 242 purposes would not be regarded as the assessee's income chargeable to income tax. [256F] 
 2. A gift to the "Dharmada" or "Dharmadaya" both in common parlance as well as the customary meaning attached thereto among the commercial and trading community cannot be regarded as void or invalid on account of vagueness or uncertainty. When the customers or the brokers paid the impugned amounts to the assessee earmarking them for "Dharmada" these payments were validly earmarked for charitable purposes. In other words right from the inception these amounts were received and held by the assessee under an obligation to spend the same for charitable purposes only, with the result that these receipts could not be regarded as forming income of the assessee.
 [253H-254B] Though there is some justification for holding that a gift to "Dharma" simpliciter would be invalid on grounds of vagueness and uncertainty, a gift to "Dharmada" would be definite, the object being certain viz., for religious or chartiable purposes. In common parlance the expression "Dharmada" or "Dharamadaya" cannot be said to be vague or uncertain and as such a gift to "Dharmada" (Dharmadaya) would not be invalid for vagueness or uncertainty. [251 E-F] 
 3. While the word "Dharma" is indefinite and equivocal, the word 'Dharmadaya" is quite definite. The former means either law or virtue or legal duty or moral duty, the latter means an endowment or gift for religious or charitable purpose. Similarly while the expression "Dharma" is idefinite and equivocal the expression "Dharmarth" has only one meaning viz., anything given for charitable or pious purposes. [251C-D] 
 4. Apart from the fact that the concept of "Dharmada" or "Dharmadaya" in common parlance means anything given in charity or for religious or charitable purposes among the trading or commercial community in various parts of this country, a gift or payment for "Dharmada" is by custom invariably regarded a gift to charitable purposes. [252C] 
 5. Since a gift or payment for "Dharmada" is by commercial or trading custom invariably regarded as a gift for charitable purposes there is no question of there being any vagueness or uncertainty about the object for which such gift or payment has to be utilized. [253] 
 6. Since the realisations are not a part of the price or surcharge on the price but payments for a specific purpose of being spent no charitable purposes, they cannot be regarded as trading receipts of the assessee. [255g] 
 7. The amount of "Dharmada" is a payment which a customer is required to pay in addition to the price of the goods which he purchases from the trader but the purchase of the goods by the customers would be the occasion and not the consideration for the "Dharmada" amount taken from the customer. Al though without payment of "Dharmada" amount the customer may not be able to purchase the goods, but that would not make the payment of "Dharmada" involuntary inasmuch as it is out of his own volition that he purchases the goods from the trader. The "Dharmada" amount is, therefore, not a part of the price but a payment for the specific purpose of being spent on charitable purposes.
 [255C-E] 243 
 8. Even if the assessee had not kept these amounts in a separate bank account, A admittedly a separate "Dharmada Account" was maintained in the books of the assessee in which every receipt was credited and payment made out on charity was debited. The High Court had clearly found that all these amounts were never credited in trading account nor carried over to profit and loss statement. [256E] Commissioner of Income-tax, West Bengal v.
