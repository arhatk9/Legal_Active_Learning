 Rule 97 of the Rajasthan High Court Rules, 1952, states that where a special appeal from the judgment of one judge does not lie unless such judge has declared that the case is a fit one for appeal, an application for such declaration may' be made orally before or at the time when the judgment is delivered and that the Court shall thereupon record an order granting or refusing to grant such declaration.
 In the present case, the only question was whether there was proof that a person was dead, as not having been heard of for more than 7 years, on the date his wife executed a gift deed with respect to property worth about Rs. 200. The appellant did not avail himself of the provision for leave to appeal to a Division Bench. He however obtained special leave from this Court, under Art. 136, but in the petition for special leave, the fact that no application was made to the single Judge of the High Court for leave to appeal to the Division Bench, was not stated.
 
HELD : The special leave must be revoked, because, (a) the appellant had not exhausted all his remedies in the High Court before invoking the jurisdiction of this Court, and (b) the value of the property involved is too small and the question of law involved is of no public importance.
