 The Bihar Civil Service (Judicial Branch) (Recruitment) Rules, 1955 vests the Bihar Public Service Commission by clause (a) of Rule 15 the power to fix the qualifying marks in any or all the subjects at the written examination for the posts of Munsiffs in the Bihar Judicial Service but before doing 80 the Commission has to consult the High Court. Rule 17 of the Rules provides that if a candidate has secured less than the prescribed qualifying marks as required under Rule 15 he would not be eligible for the viva voce test, while under rule 19 the marks obtained at the viva voce test are to be added to the marks obtained at the written examination.
 The appellant appeared at the 19th Competitive Judicial Service Examination and obtained in all 416 marks including the marks obtained at the viva voce test. However, he secured only 38.8 per cent marks at the written examination.
 At the first instance, 83 candidates were appointed as Munsiffs. Later on, the commission submitted another list of 38 candidates to the Government for being appointed as Munsiffs, but it did not iuclude the name of the appellant even though it had included at Serial Nos. 36, 37 and 38 of the names of candidates who had secured lower marks than what the appellant had obtained. Aggrieved by the non- inclusion of his name in the list of successful candidates, he filed a writ petition in the High Court which was dismissed.
 The appellant contended in his appeal before the Supreme Court that the Commission hat in exercise of its discretion fixed 38 per cent marks in the written papers as the qualifying marks 694 under Rule 15(a) after consultation with the High Court and the exclusion of his name from the list of successful candidates prepared under Rule 19 was, therefore, contrary to the Rules. The respondent, however, argued that the name of the appellant was not included in the list of successful candidates prepared under Rule 19 on the ground, that he hat obtained less than 40 per cent marks in the written papers which were the qualifying marks fixed under Rule 15 (a).
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The entire approach adopted by the High Court is wrong. The High Court should have first decided the question whether the Commission had fixed 40 per cent marks as qualifying marks or 38% as it is claimed by the appellant and then it should have proceeded to decide whether the name of the appellant has been properly excluded from the li-t prepared under Rule 19 of the rules or not. It was in error in holding that the Commission hat fixed the qualifying marks at 40 per cent merely because it had not included the names of any candidates who hat secured less than 40 per cent qualifying marks in the list prepared under rule 19. Such non-inclusion by itself and without more does not amount to a decision made by the Commission. The Commission did not actually plead that it hat made any such fresh determination. It appears to be a new case mate out by the High Court to support the action of the Commission which has contrary to its own decision fixing the qualifying arks at 38 per cent. It may be that, in fact, there was no candidate belonging to the unreserved category who bad secured less than 40 per cent marks in the written papers amongst the first batch of 83 candidates but what is relevant is the standard which was applied when the said list was prepared. That list must have been prepared without any doubt in the light of the qualifying marks fixed by the Commission at 38 per cent for the unreserved category on the basis of which the viva voce test of all the candidates belonging to both the batches including the appellant had been held. That standard could not be varied when the next list was prepared. The High Court has failed to appreciate this aspect of tho case. [703 A,E-F, 704 A-C] 
 2. The Commission had fixed 38 per cent as the qualifying marks under Rule 15 (a) of the Rules for the candidates belonging to the unreserved category. Having fixed 38 per cent as the qualifying marks, it was not open to the Commission to exclude the name of a candidate who had secured 38.8 per cent marks in the written examination only because the High Court had earlier 695 recommended that 40 per cent marks should be the qualifying marks when it was consulted by the Commission. As long as fresh determination is made, every candidate who has secured 38 per cent marks and above in the written examination would be entitled to appear at the viva voce test and to be included in the list prepared under Rule 19 of the Rules in the order of merit on the basis of the aggregate marks obtained in the written examination and in the viva voce test. [703 B-E] In the instant case, admittedly the two candidates whose names are shown against Serial Nos. 36 and 37 had secured 415 marks in the aggregate and the candidate shown against Serial No. 38 had secured 413 marks while the appellant had secured 416 marks. The name of the appellant should have, therefore, been included in the list submitted by the Commission to the Government under Rule 19 by placing it above the name of the candidate at Serial No.36. By not doing 80 the Commission had violated the Rules and also Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. Therefore, the decision is directed to submit to the Government a revised list showing the name of the appellant above serial No.36 and the State Government is directed to consider the case of the appellant for appointment as Munsiff under Rule 21 of the rules as if his name had been shown above the candidate whose name is shown against Serial No.36. It is further ordered that on his appointment, the appellant shall be placed above the candidate shown against Serial No.36 in the seniority list and he shall be given all increments etc. as if he had been appointed on the date on which the candidate at Serial No.36 was appointed. 704 D, F-G]
