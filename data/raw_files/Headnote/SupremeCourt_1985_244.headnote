 Under the development plan for Bombay a plot of land was reserved for a bus depot of the Bombay Electricity Supply & Transport Undertaking. The BEST Committee passed a Resolution on 18th January, 1982 approving a proposal under which a part of the plot was to be used for construction of two buildings that will augment the income of the Corporation which could be used for the purpose of construction of staff quarters. Under the proposal the BEST would, on the one hand get a cash amount of Rs.99.0 lacs in the forms of non-refundable premium from the builder in addition to the regular income from the tenants of the two buildings and on the other hand it would not be required to make any capital expenditure for the construction of the project. Thereafter, an advertisement came to be published in newspapers inviting offers from the interested parties to develop the property. In addition to the said advertisement, notices were also forwarded to 22 well-known builders out of whom 12 builders purchased the tender forms. Pursuant to the advertisement and the notices, two tenders were received out of which one was sent by respondent 7, Forward Construction Company and another by Deep Construction. The tender of respondent 7 being higher than that of Deep Construction, was accepted by the BEST Committee on 31st March 1982.
 One Mr. Thakkar filed writ petition before the Bombay High Court challenging the right of the BEST to use the land for a purpose different from the one for which it had been reserved and 767 designated under the development plan as well as the town planning scheme on the ground that it had no right to use it for commercial purpose. The right of the BEST to enter into a contract with the builder was also challenged. A single Judge dismissed the petition holding: (1) that the substantial portion of the acquired plot was being utilised for a purpose for which it was acquired and the commercial use to which the small portion was being put would substantially augment the coffers of the Corporation for the benefit of the public at large; (2) that the value charged by the BEST for allowing use of its property was not grossly inadequate and that sufficient publicity was given before inviting offers; and after having rejected the various pleas taken by the petitioner in the case, he observed that the petitioner was not an independent-minded citizen solely inspired by the laudable motive of protecting public interest and that the allegations in the petition indicated that he had been set up by a disgruntled builder who purchased the tender document but did not give an offer. The matter was taken up in appeal but the Division Bench dismissed the same after hearing all the parties.
 After the dismissal of the aforesaid appeal, respondents Nos. 1 to 6 in civil appeal no. 2311, filed a similar petition under Article 226 of the Constitution. The writ petition was summarily dismissed by a Single Judge.
 However, the appeal filed by the respondents was allowed by a Division Bench which issued a writ of mandamus directing appellants 1 to 4 in civil appeal No. 2311, not to use the plot reserved for BEST bus depot for commercial purpose or for any purpose other than the purpose for which the said plot of land was reserved. The plea of res judicata was rejected for two reasons, namely (1) that in the earlier writ petition the validity of the permission granted under Rule 4(a)(i) of the Development Control Rules was not in issue; and (2) that the earlier writ petition filed by Thakkar was not a bona fide one insomuch as he was put up by some disgruntled builder. The appellant's review petition also failed.
 Allowing the appeals and dismissing the special leave petition, ^ 
 HELD: 1(i) The High Court was not justified in allowing the writ petition only on the basis of the proviso to Building Regulation No.3. The proviso to Building Regulation No.3 requires that the change of user of the sanctioned plan can be made only after the modification of the development plan. The key word in this regulation is 'change'. The general meaning of the word 768 'change' is to make or become different, to transform or cover. If the user was to be completely or substantially changed only then the prior modification of the development plan was necessary.
 In the instant case, the user of the plot has not been changed. It has been used for a bus depot combined with a commercial use to augment the income of the Corporation for public purpose. In this view of the connotation of the word 'change' the proviso has no application to the present case.
 [784 D; 785 A-C] 1(ii) It cannot be said that the plot has been used for a different purpose from the one for which it had been acquired. All that can be said is that a part of the plot is being used for constructing two buildings which would augment the income of Bombay Municipal Corporation that could be utilised for the public purpose. The plot is being substantially used for the purpose for which it had been acquired. The additional use of the property will not make the use of the property for altogether a different purpose.
 The purpose for which the plot was earmarked remains intact, that is, for the construction of a bus depot. The other public interest sought to be achieved by the construction of the two buildings in addition to the bus depot is equally important. [781 D-E; G] 2(i) Explanation IV to s.11 C.P.C. provides that any matter which might and ought to have been made ground of defence or attack in such former suit shall be deemed to have been a matter directly and substantially in issue in such suit. An adjudication is conclusive and final not only as to the actual matter determined but as to every other matter which the parties might and ought to have litigated and have had it decided as incidential to or essentially connected with the subject matter of the litigation and every matter coming within the legitimate purview of the original action both in respect of the matters of claim or defence. The principle underlying Explanation IV is that where the parties have had an opportunity of controverting a matter that should be taken to be the same thing as if the matter had been actually controverted and decided. It is true that where a matter has been constructively in issue, it cannot be said to have been actually heard and decided.
 It could only be deemed to have been heard and decided. The High Court was therefore not right in holding that the earlier judgment would not operate as res-judicata as one of the ground taken in the present petition was conspicuous by its absence in the earlier petition. [779 E-G] 769 2(ii) It is only when the conditions of Explanation VI to s.11 are satisfied that a decision in the litigation will bind all persons interested in the right litigated and the onus of proving the want of bona fides in respect of the previous litigation is on the party seeking to avoid the decision. The words "public right" have been added in Explanation VI in view of the new s.91 C.P.C. and to prevent multiplicity of litigation in respect of public right. [780 C] 2(iii) It cannot be disputed that s.11 applies to public interest litigation as well in view of Explanation VI but it must be proved that the previous litigation was the public interest litigation not by way of a private grievance. It has to be a bona fide litigation in respect of a right which is common and is agitated in common with others. [780 C-D] In the instant case, the High Court in the earlier writ petition had recorded a finding that it was not a bona fide litigation and that the petitioner in that case had been put up by a disgruntled builder. Therefore, this finding, excludes the application of s.11 C.P.C. [780 E] 
 3. Public interest law activities at times champion one public interest which clashes with another public interest thus benefiting one segment of public at another's expense.
 In the instant case, the avowed function of the Corporation is the improvement of Greater Bombay. The plot in question admittedly lies in a commercial zone and if any facilities are given to the people of that locality providing for commercial offices those facilities would go towards the improvement of Bombay. It cannot, therefore, be said that the transaction was outside the Bombay Corporation Act. [781 F; 782 C-D] 
 4. If commercial activities are to be pin-pointed in a commercial zone and for that purpose the Municipal Corporation takes a step to provide accommodation for commercial purposes it cannot be said that the property of the Corporation was being acquired or held for purposes other than the purposes of the Act.
