 Respondents field a suit for possession of certain property,stating that the father of appellant Nos.1 and 2 was in possession of the property as a care taker and that after his death appellant Nos.1 and 2 continued in posses- sion of the same and did not vacate inspite of promises;
 instead they got their names entered in the records in respect of the property the plaintiffs sought a decree for ejectment as well as pendente lite and future damages for use and occupation.The defendents-appellants contested the suit claiming that it was not maintainable in the Civil Court inasmuch as it related to agricultural land it was also claimed that the entire area came within the definition 'land' since no declaration was made under section 143 of the U.P.Zamindari Abolition and land reforms Act,1950.The Civil judge observed that the land occupied by the building or appurtenant thereto was excluded from the definition 'land'in the U.P.Tenancy Act,1939 and since the house was there even prior to the commencement of the U.P.Zamindari Abolition and land reforms Act,1950,the same is not applica- ble He,therefore held the land to be abadi land,the Revenue courts had no jurisdiction over it and the Civil Court Could entertain the suit.
 641 The appellants produced extracts of the relevant Khatauni which showed the plaintiff as bhumidhar of the suit property.The Civil judge help that reliance could not be placed on these and observed that under the law if the land appurtenant to a building is being used for agricultural purposes it would not lose its nature of land appurtenant to building The appellants preferred a Revision and the High Court dismissed the same.Against the High Court's order,the appellant preferred the present appeals by special leave.
 On behalf of the appellants, it was contended that all the three conditions stipulated in section 331-A of the U.P.Zamindari abolition and Land Reforms Act,were fulfilled in this case; that no declaration has been made under section 143 or 144 of the Act in respect of the suit land;
 that the question whether the land was used or not for purpose of agriculture etc.ought to have been considered since the respondents claimed that it was abadi landthat there was no justification in ignoring the entry in the relevant khatauni and entries in the revenue record;and that the civil judge had no jurisdiction to decide issue nos.5 and 6.
 On behalf of the respondents it was contended that admittedly there was a building on the land in dispute and since the land surrounding the building was appurtenant to the building the entire area was abadi land.
 Allowing the appeal,this court, 
HELD:1.1.In order that section 331-A of the U.P.Zamindari Abolition and Land reforms act,1950 may be invoked three conditions must be satisfied,viz (i) the suit must relate to land held by a bhumidhar;(ii)the question whether the land in question is or is not used for purposes connected with agriculture, horticulture or animal husbandry should arise or be raised in the said suit and (iii) a declaration has not been made in respect of such land under section 143 or section 144.(650 A-C) 1.2.In respect of abadi land it is implied that the land is not being used for purposes connected with agriculture,horticulture or animal husbandry and in view of the definition of 'land'contained in section 2(14) of the act such land is not land for the purpose of the act.In order to exclude the applicability of the act on the ground that the land is abadi land it is necessary to determine whether the said land is or is not being 642 used for purposes connected with agriculture,horticulture or animal husbandry. Such a determination is envisaged by sec- tions 143 and 144 and where such a determination has not been made in accordance with those provisions and this ques- tion arises before a Court in a suit it is required to be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 331- A.The scheme of the provision contained in section 143,section 144 and section 331-A is that the question whether a particular land is or is not used for the purposes connected with agriculture horticulture or animal husbandry has to be determined either under section 143 or section 144 and where no such determination has been made,it should be determined by following the procedure laid down in section 331-A.It is not open to a court dealing with a suit in which the said question arises to by pass the provision of section 331-A.and to proceed to determine the said question itself ( 649 E-H;650 A ) 1.3.This would be so even in a case where a building exists on the land and the land is claimed to be appurtenant to the building because in such a case it will be necessary to determine the extent of the land that is appurtenant to the building i e whether the entire land or only a part of it is so appurtenant to the building and for that reason is not held or occupied for purposes connected with agricul- ture,horticulture or animal husbandry. This determination has to be made in accordance with the provisions of section 143 and 144 or section 331-A of the Act.( 651 E ) 
2. In the instant case the conditions for applicability of the provisions of section 331-A were fulfilled. In view of entry in the khatauni for the year 1377 Fasli (Ex.A-A) which must be presumed to be correct in view of section 44 of the U.P.Land revenue Act,1901 the said land was held by the respondents as bhumidhar. The question whether the suit land is or is not held for purposes connected with agriculture arises in the suit filed by the respondents. There is no declaration in relation to land in dispute under section 143 of the Act.(651 F,G) 3.It was not open to the civil court to decide on its own,the question whether the said land was held or occupied for purposes connected with agriculture horticulture or animal husbandry and after holding that it is not so held,refuse to follow the procedure laid down in section 331-A on the ground that the said provision has no applica- tion to the land in dispute the only course which was open to the civil judge was to frame 643 an issue on the question whether the in land dispute is or is not used for purposes connected with agriculture, hortic- uture or animal husbandry and send the record to the assist- ant collector in charge of the subdivision for decision on that issue and decide the suit in the light of the finding recorded by the Assistant Collector on that issue. By decid- ing this question himself the civil judge has exercised jurisdiction not vested in him by law and in not following the procedure laid down in section 331-A he has committed illegality in exercise of his jurisdiction which error was required to be rectified by the high court in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction under section 115 CPC.( 651 H;
 652 A-C) 4.The judgment and order of the high court and the order passed by the civil judge are set aside. The civil judge is directed to frame an issue on the question whether the suit land is or is not used for purposes connected with agricul- ture, horticulture or animal husbandry which includes pisci- culture and poultry farming and after framing the said issue send the record to the assistant collector in charge of sub division for the decision on that issue ( 652 D-E )
