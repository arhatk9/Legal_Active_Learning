 The petitioner was remanded to the District Jail, Darjeeling, in connection with certain offences.
 Thereafter, two charge 'sheets were filed against him and others for various offences under the I.P.C., which were triable exclusively by a Sessions Court, before the Special Magistrate, Visakhapatnam. The Special Magistrate issued a warrant for the production of the petitioner in his Court, under s. 3(2) of the Prisoners (Attendance in Courts) Act, 1955, and the officer in charge of the, Dt. Jail Darjeeling, sent the petitioner to the Court of the Special Magistrate, Visakhapatanam. The petitioner was then remanded to the Central Jail. Visakhapatnam, pending the disposal of the. committal proceedings.
 In a petition for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus, the petitioner contended that his initial detention in the Dt.
 Jail, Darjeeling, was illegal, because, (1)(a) it was violative of Art. 22(1) (b) the concerned Magistrate in Darjeeling had no jurisdiction to try the offences in connection with which he was detained in Darjeeling and hence could not order detention beyond 15 days; and (2) the officer in charge of the Dt. Jail, Darjeeling should have refused to comply with the warrant for production issued by the Special Magistrate, Visakhapatnam, by reason of s. 6 of the Prisoners (Attendance in Courts) Act.
 
HELD: (1) As regards the earliest date with reference to which the legality of detention challenged in a habeas corpus proceeding may be examined, there are 3 views, namely, (a) that it is the date on which the application for habeas corpus is made to the Court, (b) that it is the date of the return, and (c) that it is the date of hearing.
 Whichever be the correct view, the earliest of the dates would be the date of filing of the application for habeas corpus. In the present case, the application was filed after the petitioner was ordered to be detained in the jai at Visakhapatnam. Assuming that there was some infirmity in the detention in the jail at Darjeeling, that cannot invalidate the subsequent detention off the petitioner in the jail at Visakhapatnam. The legality of the detention at Visakhapatnam has to be judged on its own merits.
 Therefore, it is unnecessary to examine the legality of the detention of the petitioner in the jail at Darjeeling. [283 t)-284 C] (2) Under s. 3(1) of the Prisoners (Attendance in Courts) Act, the order contemplated is an order by a civil or criminal court, for the production of a detained person for giving evidence. But the order contemplated by s. 3(2) is an order of production of a person for answering a charge in a criminal court. Under s. 5, when an order of production is made under s. 3(1) or (2), the officer in charge of a prison shall cause the detained person to be taken to the court where his attendance is required. Under s. 6, such officer shall abstain from complying with the order of production in certain circumstances. The proviso to the section carves out an exception if the 3 conditions for its applicability, laid down in the proviso, are satisfied. The first condition is that the order of production should be by a criminal court and the second is that the detained person should not be unfit to be removed, and the 280 third is that the place where the evidence of the detained person is required is not more than 5 miles from the prison where he is confined. [285 A-G] In the present case, the first two conditions are satisfied.
 The 3rd condition can have no application where an order is made by a criminal court under s. 3(2) requiring production for answering a charge. The fulfillment of the first two conditions would, in such a case, be sufficient to attract the applicability of the Proviso, and to take the case out of s. 6. Therefore, the officer in charge of the jail at Darjeeling was bound to send the petitioner to the Court at Visakhapatnam and he acted according to law. The subsequent detention in the jail at Visakhapatnam pending trial must be held to be valid and a writ of habeas corpus cannot be granted where a person is committed to jail custody by a competent court by an order which, prima facie, does not appear to be without jurisdiction or wholly illegal.
