 Mr. Banerjee was an employee of the appellant. His services were terminated on the ground that the appellant had lost confidence in him and in lieu of notice he was paid one month's salary. The union to which Mr. Banerjee belonged took up his cause and on the failure of the parties to reach a settlement the matter was referred to the Industrial Tribunal by the Government.
 The appellant contended before the Tribunal that the order of termination of service of Mr. Banerjee was an order of discharge which it was competent to make under R., 40 (1) 126 of the Service Rules. it was contended by the respondent that the termination was not a discharge simpliciter but was in substance dismissal and that the Tribunal was entitled to consider the propriety of the appellant's action.
 The Tribunal held that it had jurisdiction to look into the reasons behind the discharge of an employee. On the exa- mination of the evidence the Tribunal found that no malafides on the part of the employer had been proved and that the termination of service did not amount to victimisation or unfair labour practice. Even so it held that the discharge was not justified and directed the reinstatement of Mr. Banerjee. The present appeal is by way of special leave.
 Before this Court, in addition to the above contention the appellants contented that in the light of the evidence before the Tribunal its finding that the discharge was not justified, was wrong.
 Held, that in the matter of an order of discharge of an employee the form of the order is not decisive. An Industrial Tribunal has jurisdiction to examine the substance of the matter and decide whether the termination is in fact discharge simpliciter or it amounts to dismissal which has put on the cloak of discharge simpliciter. The test always has to be whether the act of the employer is bona fide or whether it is a malafide and colourable exercise of the powers conferred by the terms of contract or by the standing orders.

 Since the reasons given by the Tribunal in support of its conclusion were wholly unsatisfactory its order must be set aside.
