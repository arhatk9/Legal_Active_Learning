 One T who was the third Stanamdhar of a family, died in 1960. The sthanam owned several properties in his personal capacity. After his death a suit for the partition of the Sthanam was filed by various members of the Tarwad. The appellant was appointed a receiver of the properties covered by the third Sthanam of which the sthanamdar was the deceased T.. The receiver was in these circumstances, treated as an accountable person in respect of the sthanam properties. Pursuant to a notice issued under s. 55 of the Estate Duty Act, 1953, by the Assistant Controller of Estate Duty, the appellant filed the necessary accounts. But he raised the contention in the assessment proceedings that according to s. 7(3) of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, the deceased T was entitled only to 1/114th share in the sthanam properties and therefore only that share could be taken into account in determining the principal value, of the Estate liable-to duty.
 The respondent, however held that the entire estate passed on the death of the deceased and was liable to duty. The appellant filed a petition under Art. 226 challenging the assessment order. A learned Single Judge allowed the petition and quashed the assessment order. The respondent filed an appeal before a divisional bench which was heard by a full bench and negatived the contention of the appellant and held that on the death of the Sthanamdar the whole of the Sthanam property passed and was deemed to pass and the Estate duty was payable on the whole of the property.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) In Marumakkattayam branch of the Hindu law, the word 'Marumakkattayam' is inheritance through nephews and nieces. The essential difference between Marumakkattayam and the other schools of Hindu law is that the former is founded on the Matriarchate which the latter is founded upon the agnatic family. In the Mitakshara joint family, the members claim their descent from a common ancestor but in Marumakkattayam family which is known as the tarwad, the descent is from a common ancestress. Tarwad is the name given to a joint family consisting of males and females who have all descended in the family line from a common ancestress. [964 E] (ii)The legal fiction created by the words, "as if the Sthanam property had been divided per capita immediately before the death of the sthanamdar", in s. 7(3) of the Succession Act, is meant for the purpose of gradually liquidating the sthanams and distributing the sthanam pro- perties amongst the members of the sthanees' tarwad and his personal heirs without infringing the provisions of the Constitution. Neither the members of the Tarwad nor the personal heirs of the sthanee had any 962 interest in the sthanam properties. The first part of s.
 7(3) clearly provides that the property which passes on the death of the sthanamdar is the whole of the sthanam property held by him. The second part only deals with distribution of that property. The Sthanam property held by the sthanamdar has to pass from the sthanamdar to the members of the family to which he belonged and his heirs. Legal fiction in the words which have been set out, do not cut down the sthanam property that passes on the death of sthanamdar to a per capita share, the fiction having been introduced only for determining the respective shares for the purpose of distribution to the members of the family and the heirs of the sthanamdar.
