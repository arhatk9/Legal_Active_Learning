 C.his wife, and his three sons were originally assessed to income-tax in the status of 'a Hindu undivided family. C filed a suit in 1948 in the High Court of Bombay for partition and separate possession of his share in the joint family estate. In 1950 the High Court passed a decree by consent declaring that as from October 15, 1947 the joint family stood dissolved that all the members of the family had become separate in food, worship and estate from that date, and that each member of the family was entitled to a fifth share in the properties movable and immovable belonging to the family subject to the right of maintenance in favour of C's mother. Pursuant to the decree C took his share in the properties allotted to him, separately. The other properties remained undivided between C's wife and his three sons each holding a fourth share as tenant in common with the other co-sharers. In December 1952, C applied to the Income-tax Officer for an order recording the partition and requesting that assessment be made of the members of the family separately in accordance with the provisions of s. 23 read with s. 25A of the Income-tax Act, 1922. The Income- tax Officer by an order in January 1953 granted the application and for the period after the High Court's decree assessed all the members of the erstwhile family separately.
 Subsequently however a notice under s. 34 of the Act for the assessment years 1951-52, 1952-53, and 1953-54, for assessing the Hindu undivided family of four members, namely, C's wife and his sons, was issued on the ground that the income of the family had escaped assessment. The assessees' plea that they did not, in the years of assessment, constitute a Hindu undivided family and that they could not be so assessed after an order under s. 25A had once been passed was not accepted by the Income-tax Officer. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner reversed 'the Income-tax Officers order but the Appellate Tribunal restored it. The High Court in reference held in favour of the Revenue.
 The assessee came to this Court in appeal.
 
HELD:(1) The Income-tax Officer has jurisdiction under s. 25A(1) to make an order recording that joint family property has been partitioned if he is satisfied that the property has been partitioned 'in definite portions'. The jurisdiction may be exercised by the Income-tax Officer even if there be partition between 'groups of members' of the family. A complete partition in definite portions among all the members of the family is not a condition of the exercise of that jurisdiction, nor does the expression 'group of members' refer only to a group consisting of a head of a branch and his sons who remain undivided. [916'G-H] In the present case there was no doubt that C took possession of his share in the family estate which was allotted to him. The assessees constituted a group and between them and C there had been a partition indefinite portions. The conditions for the passing of an order under s. 25A(1) were thus satisfied. [918 A-B] 914 (ii) After the HighCourt had decreed the partition the original undivided family had noexistence in fact or in point of law-personal or income-tax. Section25A(3) did not help the Revenue for it only requires the Income-taxOfficer to continue to assess a Hindu undivided family which has beendivided under the personal law as long, as no order under s. 25A(1) has been recorded. Once an order under s. 25A(1) has been recorded cl. (3) of s. 25A has no application. [918 D] (iii) It is true that an assessment year under the Income- tax Act is a self contained assessment period and a decision in the assessment year does not ordinarily operate as res judicata. But this rule does not apply in dealing with an order under s. 25A(1). Income from property of a Hindu undivided family 'hitherto' assessed as undivided may be assessed separately if an order under s. 25A(1) had been passed. When such an order is made the family ceases to be a Hindu undivided family. Thereafter that family cannot be assessed in the status of a Hindu undivided family unless the order is set aside by a competent authority. [919 F-H] (iv)Section 34 of the Indian Income-tax Act confers no general power of reviewing an order passed under s. 25A(1) which is in its very nature effective for all subsequent years. The only course for the Income-tax Officer, if be wants the order to be reconsidered is to move the Commissioner of Income-tax to take action under s. 33B of the Act to set aside the order under s. 25A.
