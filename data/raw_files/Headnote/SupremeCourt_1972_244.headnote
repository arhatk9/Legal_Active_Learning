 The assessee-company (respondent) was initially doing the business of assembly and sale of Austin cars and Leyland trucks. It appointed Managing Agents under certain terms regarding office allowance and commission. In 1954, the respondent ceased to assemble Austin cars, in view of the decision of the Government and engaged itself in the manufacture of Leyland commercial vehicles. The progress of the scheme was reviewed in 1955 and the Government of India suggested to the respondent that Leyland, U.K., should provide part of the capital, that the remaining capital should be raised by the respondent in India and that the Government would arrange for such capital in India on condition that the managing agency was abolished. The respondent terminated the managing agency and paid a sum of money to the Managing Agents as compensation. The respondent also entered into an agreement with Leyland, U.K.
 for participation. The respondent claimed deduction of the amount paid as compensation to the Managing Agents, in its assessment, as revenue expenditure laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the business in the relevant previous year. The Income-tax Officer and Appellate Assistant Commissioner rejected the claim but the Tribunal and the High Court, on reference, held in favour of the assessee.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The managing agency was terminated on business considerations and as a matter of commercial expediency In view of the change in business activity, the continuance of the managing agents had become superfluous. It is true that by terminating the services of Managing Agents, whose continuance had become superfluous, the respondent not only saved expense that it would have had to incur in the relevant previous year but also for a few more years to come. But the payment was made only with a view to save business expenditure and it, will not be correct to say that by avoiding certain business expenditure the respondent acquired an enduring benefit or acquired an income yielding asset. Therefore, the expenditure was a revenue expenditure, and not a capital expenditure. [520A-D; 523C- E] B.W. Noble Limited v. Mitchell, [1927] EWCA Civ 1; 11 Tax Cas. 372, Atherton v.
