 The assessee, a public limited company paid dividends for 3 earlier years to the preference share holders out of the profits made in the accounting year ended on June 30, 1960.
 The assessee did not deduct any tax at source from the dividends already declared as paid. The assessee contended that the dividends were declared in respect of previous years relevant to the assessment year 1959-60 and the earlier years and under s. 19(4) of 1959-Act, the company was exempt from deducting tax at source for those years.
 The I.T.O. and the appellate authorities held against the assessee but on a reference to the High Court, the High Court held in favour of the assessee.
 In appeal to this Court, it was contended by the Revenue that under the provisions of the company law, dividend can be declared and paid only out of profits of a particular year, that since there was no profit during the three years in question it could not be said that the dividend declared in 1959-60 was in respect of the previous 3 years in question. In the eye of law, the dividend which were declared and paid in 1959-60 could only be dividend in respect of that year only, and could not be dividend in respect of earlier years in which the preference share holders were entitled to the same but were not paid.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) The word 'dividend' as understood in company law is not applicable in the present case because, a good part of s. 19(4) would become otiose if the word 'dividend' is given its technical meaning in accordance with its signification in Company Law. [785 A-B] (ii)The language of s. 19(4) is quite clear and unambiguous. In plain language, the legislature had enacted that any dividend declared or payable before June 30, 1960 in respect of any previous year etc. would be exempt from the operation of the amendments contained in the sections by which the obligation was imposed on the company to deduct the tax at source. The language used in s. 19(4) applied to payments, the right to receive which had been acquired in the previous years on account of the dividend of the preference shares and the said expression is wide enough to include payments relating to the undischarged liabilities in respect of those previous years.
