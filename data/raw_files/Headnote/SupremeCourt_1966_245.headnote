 A piece of land with some constructions on it situated in district Howrah was mortgaged by conditional sale. The mortgage deed provided that in case of default in payment of the mortgage amount by the due date the sale would become absolute. Subsequently the mortgagor sold his interest to H. As the mortgage amount was not paid by the due date the mortgagee filed a suit for foreclosure which was decreed.
 The trial court passed a preliminary decree ordering that in case the mortgage amount was not paid within six months the plaintiff would be at liberty to apply for a final decree for sale. H filed an appeal before the High Court which was dismissed. The final decree framed by the trial Court in pursuance of the High Court's orders was for foreclosure.
 While the above appeal was pending the respondent in execution of a money decree against H purchased the aforesaid mortgaged properties and was given possession thereof. However after the final decree passed by the Court in the mortgage suit the mortgagee was given possession of the properties. The respondent thereupon filed an application under O. 21 r. 100 for restoration of possession to him. This application was rejected by the trial court.
 The respondent then filed an appeal against the final decree in the High Court. His appeal was entertained and the High Court set aside the trial court's decree on the ground that there was lack of conformity between the preliminary decree which was for sale and the final decree which was for foreclosure. The matter was remanded to the trial court and leave was given to the respondent to participate in the matter. The appellants who in the meanwhile had purchased the mortgagee's interest, appealed.. with certificate under Art. 133(a) and (b) to this Court.
 
HELD : (i) The High Court had held that the respondent had a locus standi in the matter and had directed that he was to be allowed in the remand proceedings to plead that the final decree should be one for sale thus reopening the question of redemption of the mortgage which' had been extinguished by the final decree. The High Court's order as regards these' matters was certainly a final order and therefore the pro- priety of the certificate under Art. 133 granted to the appellants could not be questioned. [24 A-C] (ii)There is 'an inherent power in the -court which passes the judgment to correct a clerical mistake or an error arising from an accidental slip or omission and to vary its judgment so as to give effect to its meaning and intention.
 On the facts of the present case there could be little doubt that the court had no occasion to pass a preliminary decree for sale and that it was through an accidental slip or inadvertence that in 19 the penultimate part of its judgment the court used the phraseology proper in a mortgage decree for sale. Once this error had crept in the judgment it was repeated in the preliminary decree. This being the position the trial court had the power under s. 151 and s. 152 of the Code of Civil procedure to correct its own error which had crept in the judgment and the preliminary decree and to pass a proper final decree for foreclosure as intended by it. [24 E, 25 E, H] (iii)On the facts of the case it could not be said that the decree represented a wrong decision of the Court. [26 D- E] (iv)The principle of lis pendens applies even to involuntary alienations like court sales. The respondent having purchased the mortgaged property while the appeal against the preliminary decree in respect of the property was pending in the High Court, the doctrine of lis pendens must apply to his purchase and he was therefore bound by the result of the suit. [28 B-D] Case law considered.
