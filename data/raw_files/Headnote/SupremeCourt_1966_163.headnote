 B and R were two candidates of the same party for election to the U.P. Legislative Assembly in 1962. R, however, withdrew his candidature within the time fixed for withdrawal and B was eventually elected to the Assembly.
 After his election, a petition was filed by two electors seeking to set aside his election on the ground inter alia that a corrupt practice was committed during the election in that R, after he had with,drawn his candidature, had threatened an elector with a view to get him to vote for B and obtain others to vote similarly.
 The Election Tribunal held that the threat complained of amounted to a corrupt practice within the meaning of Section 123(2) 'read with the proviso (a)(i) thereof, that this corrupt practice was committed by R and it was therefore necessary to join him as a respondent to the petition. As this was not done, the Tribunal dismissed the petition. An appeal to the High Court was also dismissed.
 in the, appeal to this Court it was contended, on behalf of the appellants, firstly, that there was no allegation of corrupt practice against R, and secondly, that in any event R could not come within the meaning of the words "any other candidate" used in Section 82(b) inasmuch as he withdrew his candidature as provided in Section 37 of the Act.
 HELD : dismissing the appeal :
 (i) It could not be said that the allegation of corrupt practice was only against B and not against R. The primary allegation was against R though B was also made liable for the corrupt practice alleged to have been committed by R on the ground that it was done on his behalf and in furtherance of his election. [344 B-C] (ii) R continued to be a candidate as defined in Section 79(b) of the Act even after he withdrew his candidature;
 therefore if a corrupt practice was alleged against him, he was a necessary party under Section 82(b) of the Act. [347 A-B] if a candidate committed a corrupt practice before the withdrawal of his candidature under Section 37, the provisions of Section 82(b) would clearly apply and he would be a necessary party. There was no reason ,why he could not be a candidate for the purpose of Section 82(b) simply because he committed a corrupt practice after his withdrawal. [346 El Kapildeo Singh v.
