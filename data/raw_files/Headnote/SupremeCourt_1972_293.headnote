 The Keshav Mills Co. Ltd. and another challenged the validity of an order passed by the Government of India, under S. 18-A of the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951 by which the Gujarat State Textile Corporation Ltd. has been appointed and authorised controller of the Company for a period of five years. The Company is the owner of a cotton textile mill and it was established in 1934. Till 1965, the Company made flourishing business.
 After the year 1964-65, the Company fell on evil days and the textile mill of the company was one of the 12 sick textile mills in Gujarat, which had to be closed down during 1966 and 1968. On 31st May 1969, Government of India passed an order appointing a Committee for investigation into the affairs of the Company under the provisions of S. 15 of the Act. In due course, the Investigating Committee completed its inquiry and submitted its report to the Government. On 24th November, 1970, the Government of India passed an Order under S. 18-A of the Act authorising the Gujarat State Textile Corporation to take over the management of the Company for a period of five years from the date of publication of that order in the Official Gazette.
 The Company filed a writ petition before the High Court of Delhi praying for appropriate relief. The High Court dismissed the petition. The main contention of the appellants before the Delhi High Court was that Government of India was not competent to proceed under S. 18-A against the company without supplying before hand, a copy of the report of the Investigating Committee to the Company.
 Acocrding to the appelants, the Government should not only have supplied a copy of the report to the Company, but should also have given a hearing to the Company before finally deciding upon.taking over the company's undertaking under S.. 18-A of the Act. This contention was pressed on behalf of the appellants in spite of the fact that an opportunity had been given by the Investigating Committee to the management and the employees of the Company for adducing evidence and for making representation before the completion of the investigation.
 The only question that this Court had to decide was whether after the undertaking had already been given an opportunity of being heard at the time of investigation, the Company is entitled to have a copy of the report and to make, if necessary, further representation about that report before a final decision is made by the Government under S. 18-A of the Act. The answer depended on the following questions;
 (1) Is it necessary to observe the rules of n-atural justice before enforcing a decision under S. 18-A of the Act. (2) What-are the rules of natural justice in such a case. (3) (a) In the present case, have the rules to be observed once during the investigation under S. 15 and then again, after the it)vestigation is completed and action on the report of the Investigating Com 23 mittee taken under S. 18-A (b) Was it necessary to furnish a copy of the Investigating Committee's Report before passing an order of take over ? Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) Although the order of the Government of India taking over the management of the Company was a purely executive order, embodying an administrative decision, even so, the question of natural justice does arise in this case.
 It is too late now to contend that the principles of natural justice do not apply to administrative orders or proceed- ings. [29G] Regina v. Gaming Board, exparte Benaim [1970] EWCA Civ 7; [1970] 2 W.L.R. 1009, referred to.
 (ii) The concept of natural justice cannot be put into a straight jacket. It is futile to look for definitions or standards of natural justice. The only essential point that has to be kept in mind in all cases is that the person concerned should have a reasonable opportunity of presenting his case and administrative authority concerned should act fairly, impartially and reasonably. It only means that such measure of natural justice should be applied as was described by Lord Reid in Ridge v. Baldwin, as "insusceptible of exact definition, but what a reasonable man would regard as a fair procedure in particular circumstarces." However, every thing will depend on the actual facts and circumstances of the case. [30B] (iii)The Act was passed to provide for development and regulation of important industries, the activities of which affect the country as a whole and the development of which must be governed by economic factors of all India import.
 For achieving this purpose, the Act confers cerpowers on Government to secure the planning of future development on sound and balanced line by the licensing of all new under takings and also by making rules for the registration of existing undertakings for regulation and production and development of the industries and also in certain cases, by taking over the control and management of certain industrial concerns. Since the appellants have received a fair treatment and also all reasonable opportunities to make out their own case before Government, they cannot be allowed to make any grievance of the fact that they were not given a formal notice calling upon them to show cause why their undertaking should not be taken over, or that they had not been furnished with a copy of the report. [30H, 35H] (iv) In the present case non-disclosure of the report of the Investigating Committee has not caused any prejudice whatsoever to the appellants. Under the circumstances, the High Court's Order is confirmed. [38F] Local Government Board v. Arlidge, [1915] A.C. 120, referred to.
