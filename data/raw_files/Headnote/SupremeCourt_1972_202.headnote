 In Cr. A. No. 263 of 1971, accused Nos. 6 to 10 were acquitted by the trial Court but the High Court reversed the order of acquittal and convicted them under S. 302/149 and 148 of I.P.C. In Cr. A. No. 300 of 1971, accused Nos. 1 to 5 were convicted under S. 302/148 I.P.C. by both the Courts below.
 The alleged occurrence giving rise to the prosecution of the appellants took place on the night between December 13 and 14 at about 2 a.m. as a result of political animosity between two groups of people-the Marxists and the agriculturists called the "Karshak Sangham", in Puthupally village in Kottayam, Kerala. The eyewitnesses, for fear of retaliation, did not report the crime to the police. Only on the next day, a member of the local panchayat (P.W. 2), lodged the F.I.R. at 8 A.M. at Kottayam East Police Station, 9 K.M. away from the place of occurrence.
 Before this Court, the following points were raised on behalf of the appellants :-(i) that the first information report is highly belated and (ii) that the alleged eye- witnesses did not lodge the complaint because they had in fact not witnessed the occurrence, and the accused have been falsely implicated. Partly allowing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) The First Information Report relating to the commission of an offence is not a condition precedent to the setting in motion of a criminal investigation. [23 C] R. V. Khwaja, I.L.R. [1945] Lah. 1, referred to.
 Nor does the statute provide that such information report can only be made by on eye-witness. F.I.R. is not even considered a substantive piece of evidence. It can only be used to corroborate or contradict the informants evidence in court. But this information when recorded is the basis of the case set up by the informant. It is very useful if recorded before there is time and opportunity to embellish, or before the informants' memory fades.
 Undue or unreasonable delay lodging the F.I.R., therefore, gives rise to suspicion which put the Court on guard to look for the possible motive and the explanation for the delay and consider its effect on the trustworthiness of the prosecution version. No duration of time in the abstract can be fixed as reasonably for giving information of a crime to the police, the question of reasonable time being a matter for determination by the court in each case. [23 E] (ii) In the , present case, the eye-witnesses were afraid to go to the police station during night time and their evidence could not be shaken in cross-examination Keeping in view the local tense atmosphere and the effect of the ghastly murder on the eye-witnesses, their strong disinclination to go and lodge the report during the night after the alleged 17 Occurrence, which seems quite normal, cannot. by itself arouse any suspicion about the prosecution case. Further, the prosecution version as a whole, has also been accepted by both the Courts below for reasons which cannot be said to be unsound or implausible. Therefore, the delay in making the F.I.R. has reasonably been explained by the prosecution witnesses.
 (iii) It is not disputed and indeed both the Courts below have found that on December 12, 1970, there was full moon, and ,is such, there was moon-light at the time of the occurrence. The nearest street light was about 130 ft. away towards the west and the nearest electric post on the eastern side was about 90 ft. away from the place of occurrence. The light of the lorry, which was at the place, also helped eye witnesses to clearly see who the assailants were. The concurrent conclusion of the two Courts below leaves no doubt that the witnesses present at the place of occurrence were in a position to clearly see and identify the accused persons who \were not strangers to them.
 Therefore, conviction of accused Nos. 1 to 5 under S. 302 I.P.C. and S. 148 is upheld as also the Sentence under S.
 148 I.P.C. Accused No. 6 has also been rightly found guilty and his sentence is also confirmed.
 (iv)As regards accused Nos. 7 to 10, they did not form an unlawful assembly with the common object of killing the deceased. Therefore, they are acquitted.
 Khanna J. (dissenting) Held (i) From the evidence on record it was difficult to subscribe to the view that the witnesses refrained from reporting the matter to the police soon after the occurrence because of fear. The witnesses had not got into the lorry while the accused were on foot. It' would not have taken the lorry more than 15 or 20 minutes to reach the police station. Further, it cannot be said that the witnesses were not conscious of the necessity of informing the police about the occurrence.
 (ii) Even if the witnesses were afraid to go to the police station in the night, they could have gone to the station in the morning because they did not remain confined in their homes; but were moving about and go to different places on the following morning, there is no satisfactory explanation as to why they did not go to the police station and make a report. Their failure to report to the police the following day, creates considerable doubts about the veracity of their evidence.
 Thulia Kali v. State of Tamil Nadu Cr. A. 165/71 decided on February 25, 1972, referred to.
 (iii) Further, the prosecution evidence is of a partisan character.
 (iv) The circumstances of the case tend to show that the deceased was killed at late hour during the night between December 13 and 14, 1970 when he was coming from a place where he had taken toddy. The fact that no report was lodged with the police during the night and no one went to the village or raised a hue and cry tends to show that no one was present along with the deceased at that time.
 Therefore; it is not possible to sustain the conviction of the accused appellants on the evidence adduced in the case.
