 The petitioner was served on November 23, 1979 with an order of detention under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act 1974, and the grounds of detention were also served on the detenu on the same day. On December 1st, 1979, the advocate of the detenu requested for copies of the statements and documents upon which reliance was placed in the grounds of detention and at the instance of the detaining authority (Administrator, Union Territory of Delhi), the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence furnished the copies sought on December 7, 1979. On December 22, 1979, the detenu made a representation to the detaining authority which was actually received by the latter on December 26, 1979. A copy of the representation was forwarded to the Customs authorities for their remarks which were received on January 4, 1980. The representation was thereafter considered and rejected by the detaining authority on January 15, 1980. The rejection of the representation was communicated to the detenu on January 17, 1980.
 In the meanwhile, the Advisory Board to whom the detention had been referred met on January 4, 1980, and considered the matter. The detenu was produced before the Advisory Board and the concerned departmental officials were also present. On January 10, 1980, the Advisory Board recorded its opinion and forwarded the same to the detaining authority, which recommendation was placed before the Administrator on January 19, 1980, when the detaining authority confirmed the order of detention.
 In the writ petition under Article 32 it was contended on behalf of the petitioner (1) that the representation of the detenu made on December 22, 1979, was not communicated to the Advisory Board as it ought to have been when the board met on January 4, 1980, (2) that the detaining authority should have disposed of the representation before forwarding it to the Advisory Board and even if the detaining authority did forward it to the Advisory Board, the detaining authority should not have awaited the hearing before the Advisory Board and should not have allowed itself to be influenced by such hearing, and (3) that there was inexcusable delay in enabling the detenu to make a representation and in disposing of such representation.
 Dismissing the writ petition, ^ 
 HELD : 1. The representation of the detenu was forwarded to the Advisory Board and it was also considered by the latter. [1098H] 1096 
 2. On an examination of the records it is found that though the Administrator considered the representation of the detenu after the hearing by the Board, the Administrator was entirely uninfluenced by the hearing before the Board.
 [1104B] 
 3. If there appeared to be any delay in disposing of the representation of the detenu it was not due to any want of care but because the representation required thorough examination in consultation with investigators of facts and advisers on law. [1104A] In the instant case, the petitioner's request for copies of statements and documents was received by the detaining authority on December 3, 1979 and at the instance of the detaining authority, the Director of Revenue Intelligence furnished the copies sought on December 7, 1979. The detenu's representation was received by the detaining authority on December 26, 1979. Without any loss of time, copy of the representation was sent to the Customs authorities for their remarks. This was necessary because the information leading to the order of detention was laid by the Customs authorities and the facts were complex since the allegations against the detenu revealed an involvement with an international gang of dope smugglers. The comments of the Customs authorities were received on January 4, 1980.
 The Advisory Board was meeting on the same day and there could be no question of the detaining authority considering the representation of the detenu before the Board met. After obtaining comments of the Customs authorities it was found necessary to take legal advice as the representation posed many legal and constitutional questions. The same was obtained and the representation was finally rejected by the Administrator on January 15, 1980. [1103D-H] 
 4. The role of the court in cases of preventive detention has to be one of eternal vigilance. No freedom is higher than personal freedom and no duty higher than to maintain it unimpaired. The Court's writ is the ultimate insurances against illegal detention. The Constitution enjoins conformance with the provisions of Article 22 and the Court exacts compliance. Article 22(5) vests in the detenu the right to be provided with an opportunity to make a representation. [1100F] 
 5. The Law Reports tell a story and teach a lesson that the principal enemy of the detenu and his right to make a representation is neither high-handedness nor mean- mindedness but the casual indifference, the mindless in- sensibility the routine and the red-tape of the bureaucratic machine. [1100G] 
 6. The four principles to be followed in regard to representation of detenu enunciated by the Court in Jayanarayan Sukul v. State of West Bengal [1970] 3 S.C.R.
 225 as well as other principles enunciated in other cases, an analysis will show, are aimed at shielding personal freedom against indifference, insensibility, routine and red-tape and thus to secure to the detenu the right to make an effective representation.

 7. The time-imperative can never be absolute or obsessive. There has to be lee-way, depending on the necessities of the case.
 
 8. Several situations may arise compelling the departure from the time-imperative. But no allowance can be made for lethargic indifference. No allowance can be made for needless procrastination. But, allowance must surely be made for necessary consultation where legal intricacies and factual ramifications are involved. The burden of explaining the necessity for the slightest departure from the time imperative is on the detaining authority.
 
 9. There should be greater precision and perspicuity in affidavits filed into Court. Care and clearity are particularly important when the court is concerned with questions of personal freedom.
