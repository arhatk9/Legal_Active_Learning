 The petitioners were detained under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971, after they had been released as a result of the decision of this Court in Shambhu Nath Sarkar v. State of West Bengal [1973] INSC 86; [1974] 1 S.C.R. 1, on the same grounds as in the earlier orders of detention. The petitioners challenged the orders in petitions under Art. 32 on the ground of violation of S. 14 of the Act.
 Allowing the petitions, 
HELD : The contention of the respondent-state that the previous orders were illegal and that therefore the release orders did not amount to revocation is unsound. The expression 'revocation' includes not only revocation of an order which is otherwise valid and operative but also orders which are invalid. The word means annulling, rescinding withdrawing.' Further, the word 'expire' means 'to come to an end, or to put an end to, or to terminate, or to become void, or to become extinct.' The orders of release show that the Government accepted the position that the previous orders came to end and released the petitioners. Therefore, the orders of release were orders of revocation of the pre- vious orders of detention; and the previous orders of detention also expired when the respondent passed orders of release. Under S. 14 a detention order may be revoked or modified at any time, and the revocation or expiry of the detention order shall not bar the making of a fresh order of detention where fresh facts have arisen after the date of revocation or expiry on which the Government is satisfied that such an order should be made. But in the present case, the fresh orders of detention contained identical grounds as in the earlier orders. Therefore, the fresh orders are in violation of S. 14.
