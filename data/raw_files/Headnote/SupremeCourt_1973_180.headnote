 Under the Recruitment Rules of 1939, recruitment to the cadre of Assistant Engineers in the Jammu and Kashmir Engineering Service was to be made by direct recruitment of degree holders in Civil Engineering or by transfer of degree or Diploma holders who have served as Supervisor for a period of not less than 5 years. The rules further provided that appointments by transfer (that is by promotion) to the cadre of Executive Engineers could be made only from the cadre of Assistant Engineers on the basis of merit, ability and the previous record of the candidates. The Jammu and Kashmir Engineering (Gazetted) Service Recruitment Rules, 1970, provided that recruitment to the post of Executive Engineers and above was to be made only by promotion. And, as regards promotion to the post of Executive Engineers, and to those only, it was provided that only those Assistant Engineers who possessed a degree in Engineering would be eligible for promotion. Diploma holders in Engineering, like the respondents, were thus rendered ineligible for promotion as Executive Engineers. The respondents challenged the constitutionality of the Rule. The classification, according to the appellants, was made with a view to achieving administrative efficiency in the Engineering Service. The High Court, took the view that the impugned Rule was violative of articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the State that it is always open to the Government to classify its employees so long as the classification is reasonable and has nexus with the object thereto; that if there are different sources of recruitment, the employees recruited from different sources can either be allowed different conditions of Services and so continue to belong 'to different classes or the Government may integrate them into one class; that once the employees are integrated into one class they cannot for the purposes of promotion, be classified again into two different classes on the basis of differences existing at the time of recruitment; but, after integration into one class, the employees can, in the matter of promotion be classified into different classes on the basis of any intelligible differentia as, for example, educational qualifications, which has a nexus with the object of the classification. namely, efficiency in the post of promotion. The respondents urged that the Rules of 1939 did not make any distinction between diploma-holders and degree-holders; that the rules governing conditions of Service could not be changed retrospectively to classify employees on the basis of educational qualifications so as to deny promotion to the diploma-holders; that having regard to the fact that from 1939 to 1970 holders of diploma and degree were treated alike, the onus lay heavily on the appellants to prove the necessity for differentiating between the two, which onus was not discharged on the record of the cases; that there was no nexus between the classification and the objects to be achieved thereby and in fact the classification defeated that object; that if chances of promotion were denied to a few within a class of equals, there was an inherent vice attaching to the classification and no question of reasonableness of the new yardstick could possibly arise; that the unreasonableness of the classification was patent from the fact that a degree qualification was considered as a pre-condition for the promotion to the posts of Executive Engineers but not to higher posts; and 772 that if persons recruited from different sources were integrated into one class, they could not thereafter be classified so as to permit in. favour of some of them a preferential treatment as against others.
 
HELD : Though persons appointed directly and by promotion were integrated into a common class of Assistant Engineers, they could for purposes of promotion to the cadre of Executive Engineers be classified on the basis of educational qualifications. The rule providing that graduates shall be eligible for such promotion to the exclusion of diploma holders does not violate articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.
 (i) it is wrong to characterise the operation of a Service rule as retrospective for the reason that it applies to existing employees. A rule which classifies such employees for promotional purposes, undoubtedly operates on those who entered service before the framing of the rule but it operates in future in the sense that it governs the future right of promotion of those who are already in service. It is well settled that a Government servant acquires a I status' on appointment to his office and as a result his rights and obligations are liable to be determined under statutory or Constitutional authority which for its exercise requires no reciprocal consent. [779 E] (ii) It is no part of the appellant's burden to justify the classification or to establish its constitutionality. A classification founded on variant educational qualifications is, for purposes of promotion to the post of a Executive Engineer, to say the least, not unjust on the face of it and the onus therefore-cannot shift from where it originally lay.

 Kartar Singh [1964] 6S. C. R. 679, 687 and G. D. Kerkar v.
 Chief Controller of Imports and Exports [1967] 2 S.C.R. 29, 34, referred to.
 (iii) Classification is primarily for the legislature or for the statutory authority charged with the duty of framing the terms and conditions of service; and if, looked at from the standpoint of the authority making it, the classification is found to rest on a reasonable basis, it has to be upheld. Discrimination is the essence of classification and does violence to the constitutional guarantee of equality only if it rests on an unreasonable basis. [781 C] (iv) There is no justification for the respondent's plea that the record does not disclose the necessity for the impugned rule of 1970. The records show that till about 1968 there was a dearth of Engineering graduates. In 1962 the ratio between graduates and diploma holders was 1 : 2 and in 1968 it became almost 2 : 1 and in 1970 the position remained more or less unchanged. The appellants were entitled to take into account this spurt in the availability of persons with higher educational qualifications for manning the next higher post of promotion. Further, it cannot be overlooked that even under the recruitment rules of 1939 graduates in Civil Engineering were alone eligible for direct recruitment as Assistant Engineers in the Kashmir Engineering Service. [783 B] (v) The argument that if the nature of duties and responsibilities of the post of Executive Engineer has undergone no significant change, there would be no justification for restricting the field of choice to graduates assumes in the Court a right of scrutiny somewhat wider than is generally recognised. The concept of equality has an inherent limitation arising from the very nature of the constitutional guarantee. Equality is for equals. That is to say, those who are similarly circumstanced are entitled to an equal treatment.
 Classification, however, is fraught with the danger that it may produce artificial inequalities and therefore, the right to classify is hedged in with salient restraints; or else, the guarantee of equality will be submerged in class legislation masquerading as laws meant to govern well-marked classes characterized by different and distinct attainments.
 Classification, therefore, must be 7 7 3 truly founded on substantial differences which distinguish persons grouped together from those left out of the group and such differential attributes must bear a just and rational relation to the object sought to be achieved.
 Judicial scrutiny can therefore extend only to the consideration whether the classification rests on a reasonable basis and whether it bears nexus with the object in view. It cannot extend to embaring upon a nice or mathematical evaluation of the basis of classification, for, were such an inquiry permissible, it would be open to the courts to substitute their own judgment for that of the legislature or the rule-making authority on the need to classify or the desirability of achieving a particular object. [784 A-C] (vi) So judged, the classification of Assistant Engineers into degree holders and diploma holders cannot be said to rest on any unreal or unreasonable basis. If the classification was made with a view to achieving administrative efficiency in the Engineering Service, the classification is clearly correlated, to it, for, higher educational qualifications are at least presumptive evidence of a higher mental equipment. On the facts of the case the classification cannot be said to rest on any fortuitous circumstances. educational qualifications have been recognised by this Court as a safe criteria for determining the validity of classification.

 407, and The Union of India v. Dr. (Mrs.) S. B. Kholi, [1972] INSC 305; A.I.R. 1973 S.C. 811, 813.
 (vii) The seniority list of January 1, 1971 shows how unreal the argument is that the qualification rule not having been extended to the higher echelons of service, it can bear no nexus with the attainment of administrative efficiency in a comparatively lower hierarchy of Assistant Engineers. Dealing with practical exigencies, a rule making authority may be guided by the realities of life, just ,is the legislature, while making a classification, "is free to recognize degrees of harm and it may confine its restrictions to those classes of cases where the need is deemed to be the clearest." if the law presumably hits the evil where it is most felt, it is not to be overthrown because there are other instances to which it might have been applied, [785 C, G] Bain Peanut Co. v. Pinson 75 L. ed. 482, 489, Miller v.

 (viii) This Court's decision in Roshan Lal's case is no authority for the proposition that if direct recruits and promotees are integrated into one class, they cannot be classified for purposes of promotion on a basis other than the one that they were drawn from different' sources. All that Roshan Lal's case lays down is that direct recruits and promotees lose their birthmarks on fusion into a common stream of service and they cannot thereafter be treated differently by reference to the consideration that they were recruited from different sources. Their genetic blemishes disappear once they are integrated into a common class and cannot be revived so as to make equals unequals once again. In the instant case classification rests fairly and squarely on the consideration of educational qualifications : Graduates alone shall go into higher post, no matter'whether they were appointed 'as Assistant Engineers directly or by promotion.
 The discrimination, therefore, is not in relation to the source of recruitment as in Roshan Lal's case. [789 C] Roshan Lal Tandon v. Union of India, [1967] INSC 174; [1968] 1 S.C.R. 185, Mervyn Coutindo & Ors. v. Collector of Customs, Bombay & Ors., [1966] INSC 46; [1966] 3 S.C.R. 600) and S. M. Pandit v. State of Gujarat, A.I.R. 1972 S.C. 252, explained and held inapplicable.
 The Court emphasized the necessity of adopting a pragmatic approach in order to harmonize the recruitments of public service with the aspirations of public servants and cautioned against evolving, through imperceptible exten- 7 74 sions, a theory of classification which may subvert, perhaps submerge, the previous guarantee of equality.1 [790 G] Per Bhagwati and Krishna Iyer, JJ : (concurring); (i) The proposition that all men are equal has working limitations, since absolute equality leads to procrustean cruelty. An imaginative and constructive modus, vivendi between commonness and excellence must be forged to make the equality clauses viable. The social meaning of articles 14 to 16 is neither dull uniformity nor specious 'talentism'.
 it is a process of producing quality out of larger areas of equality extending better facilities to the latent capabilities of the lowly. [791 B-C] ii) In the present case, in the past decades, few Engineering graduates in the State and few Engineering Colleges in the country compelled Government to recruit diploma holders and promote them to higher offices. But circumstances have changed, needs have increased, availabilities have expanded and inequalities at the educational level have been partly eliminated. And so personnel policy, with an eye on efficiency have changed.
 [791 G-H] (iii) However, while striking a balance between the long hunger for equal chance of the lowlier and the disturbing concern of the community for higher standards of performance, the State should not jettison the germinal principle of equality alto,-ether. The dilemma of democracy is as to how to avoid validating the abolition of the difference between the good and the bad in the name of equality and putting to sleep the constitutional command for expanding the areas of equal treatment for the weaker ones with the dope of 'special qualifications' measured by expensive and exotie degrees. These are perhaps meta- judicial matters left to the other branches of Government, but the Court must hold the Executive within the leading strings of egalitarian constitutionalism and correct, by judicial review, episodes of subtle and shady classification grossly violative of equal justice. That is the heart of the matter. That is the note that rings through the first three fundamental rights the people -have given to themselves. [792 B]
