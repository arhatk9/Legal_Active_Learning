 The services of the respondent who was an Inspector Cooperative Societies in the Punjab were lent to the Himachal Pradesh Government in the capacity of Assistant Registrar. His date of superannuation was August 4, 1958.
 On July 16, 1958 he was granted 19 day,; leave preparatory to retirement by the Himachal Pradesh Government. On July 25, 1958 the Government of Punjab asked the Himachal Pradesh Government to cancel the leave ranted to the respondent and to direct him to revert to the Punjab Government immediately. On July 31, the Punjab Government sent a telegram to the respondent at his home address as he had gone there immediately after grant of leave. The telegram informed him that he had been suspended from service with effect from. August 2, 1958. On that very day a charge- sheet was issued to him, by letter dated August 2, 1958 the Himachal Pradesh Government informed the respondent that his leave was reduced by two days i.e. it would end on August 2, 1958. All these. communications reached the respondent after August 4, 1958. He attended the subsequent departmental enquiry under protest. After completing formalities the Punjab Government dismissed him from service. Thereupon the respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging his dismissal. It was urged that as he had already retired on August 4, 1958 the proceedings starting with the,order of suspension and ending with his dismissal were void and against the terms of r. 3.26(d) of the Punjab Civil Service Rules as they then stood. The said rule provided that a Government servant under suspension for misconduct shall not be permitted to retire on his reaching the date of compulsory retirement but should be retained in service until the enquiry into the charge was completed and a final order passed passed thereon. The Single Judge allowed the respondent's petition. The Division Bench in appeal upheld the order of the Single Judge relying upon its earlier judgment in Dr. Pratap Singh's cave which had held that an order passed under r. 3.26(d) took effect from the day it was served on the concerned Government servant. The State appealed, 
HELD : The communication of an order such as an order of suspension is only necessary because till the order is issued and actually sent out to the person concerned the authority making such order would be in a position to change its mind and modify it if it thought fit. Once such an order is sent out it goes out of the control of such an authority, and therefore, there would be no chance whatsoever of its changing its mind or modifying it.
 Therefore after an order is issued and sent out to the concerned Government servant. it must be held to have been communicated to him no matter when he actually received it.
 [665 B-C] The view that it is only from the date of the actual receipt by him that the order becomes effective could not be accepted for then it would 658 be possible for a Government servant to effectively thwart 'an order by avoiding receipt of it by one method or the other till after the date of his Retirement even though such an order is passed and despatched before such date. [665 D] Actual knowledge by the concerned Government servant of an order where it is one of dismissal may, perhaps be necessary because 'of the consequences which the decision in Amar Singh's case contemplates. But such consequences would not occur in the case of an officer who has proceeded on leave and against whom an order of suspension is passed because in his case there is no question of his doing any act or passing an order and such act or order being challenged as invalid. [665 E-F] In this view it must be held in the present case, that the order of suspension was validly passed and was communicated to the respondent before August 4, 1958 and therefore was effective as from July 31, 1958, Accordingly the State's appeal must be allowed.
