 By amending Act 3 of 1954, s. 38(E), by which the Government could declare by notification that ownership of all lands held by certain protected tenants were to stand transferred to such tenants, was inserted in the Hyderabad Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act (21 of 1950). Parbhani District of the erstwhile State of Hyderabad became part of the erstwhile Bombay State, and the State of Bombay after adopting the Hyderabad Act 21 of 1950, issued a notification under s. 38(E) of the Hyderabad Act 21 of 1950, declaring the tenants of the appellants to be the landowners. The Bombay Legislature passed Act 32 of 1958 after having received the assent of the President, making further amendments in the Hyderabad Act 21 of 1950. The appellants- landowners in Parbhani District filed a writ petition in the High Court assailing the vires of s. 38(E) of the Hyderabad Act 21 of 1950, as contravening Arts. 19(f) and 31 of the Constitution, and as not validly enacted on the ground that that Act had not 'received the assent of the President. The High Court dismissed the petition, and this Court granted special leave. While the appeal was pending, the Andhra Pradesh High Court in another case struck down Hyderabad Act 21 of 1950 as amended by Act 3 of 1954 on the sole ground that it had not received the assent of the President as required by Art. 31(3) of the Constitution. Thereupon State of Maharashtra enacted the Hyderabad Tenancy and Agricultural Lands (Re-enactment, Validation and 'further amendment) Act, 1961, after the assent of the President had been obtained. The Maharashtra Act of 1961 repealed and re- enacted the Hyderabad Act 21 of 1950 and the amending laws and declared that they shall be deemed to have come into force on an anterior date specified therefore. The appellants, withdrew their appeals from this Court and filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging the Maha- rashtra Act of 1961 on the grounds that the State Legislature had no power to reenact the provisions of the Hyderabad Acts with retrospective effect and that the Government notification declaring the tenants to be land- owners was ultra vires Arts. 19 and 31 of the Constitution.
 The High Court dismissed the petition. In appeal, 'by special leave, this Court HELD:The appeal must fail.
 The provisions of the Maharashtra Act of 1961 as also of the Hyderabad Act 21 of 1950 together with the amending Act were immune from any challenge on the ground of contravention of Arts. 19 and 31 of the Constitution. By the Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act, 1964, after entry 20, entries 21 to 66 were inserted in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. Entries 35 and 36 relate to the Maharashtra Act of 1961 and Hyderabad Act 21 of 1950, respectively.
 Article 31(B) gives full protection to an Act and its provisions in the schedule against any challenge an the ground of inconsistency with or abridging of any of the 318 rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution. This would be so notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any court or Tribunal to the contrary. The amending laws and, in particular, Hyderabad Act 3 of 1954 which inserted s. 38(E) would also be covered by the same protection because the parent Act, namely, the Hyderabad Act 21 of 1950 was included in the Ninth Schedule in the year 1964 which was long after the enactment of the amending Act. [320 D] Obiter : If the assent of the President had been accorded to the amending Acts, it would be' difficult to hold that the President had never assented to the parent Act, namely, Hyderabad Act 21 of 1950. Even if such assent had not been accorded earlier it must be taken to have been granted when Amending Act 21 of 1954 was assented to. [321 D]
