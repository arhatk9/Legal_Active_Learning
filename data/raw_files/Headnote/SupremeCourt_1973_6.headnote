 On 14-6-1956 the State of Jammu & Kashmir promulgated the Jammu & Kashmir Civil Services (Classification Control & Appeals) Rules 1956. Rule 19 provided that reservation was permitted to be made in favour of any backward class which in the opinion of the Government, was not adequately represented in service. Rule 25(2) related to promotions which were to be made on merit-cum-seniority basis. The State, relating Muslims as a backward class gave them a reservation of 50% in the matter of promotion of teachers to the post of headmasters. This Court in Triloki Nath v.
 State of Jammu & Kashmir, [1966] INSC 268; [1967] 2 S.C.R. 265 and Makhanlal Waza & Ors. v. State of Jammu & Kashmir & Ors., [1971] INSC 61; [1971] 3 S.C.R. 832 held that the ,promotions of muslims to the posts of headmasters or teachers-in-charge were made on the basis of a communal policy and against the aforesaid 1956 Rules.
 After the decision in Makhanlal Maza's case the State by an order dated 23-2-1971 reverted all those teachers who had officiated as headmasters or had-been designated as teachers-in-charge. A Departmental Promotion Committee was appointed in accordance with the rules and the Committee was directed to interview the candidates. The interviews were held from March to July 1971. The selections were to be made in accordance with the Jammu & Kashmir Civil Services (Classification Central and Appeals) Rules 1969 which had replaced the old rules of 1956. Meanwhile in accordance with the recommendations of the Backward Classes Committee the State Government had also issued on April 18, 1970 the Jammu & Kashmir Scheduled Castes & Backward Classes (Reservation Rules) 1970. Later, on August 8, 1970, a further order, was passed known as Jammu & Kashmir Scheduled Caste s & Backward Classes (Reservation of appointment by Promotion) Rules 1970. The present petitioners were adversely affected by the selections made by the aforesaid Departmental Promotion Committee in 1971. In their petitions under Art. 32 of the Constitution the questions that fell for consideration were : (i) whether the selections made after interviews were improper and illegal and should be set aside; (ii) whether the Rules of reservation of posts in favour of backward classes are in violation of Art. 16 of the Constitution and should be set aside.
 
HELD : (i) Undoubtedly when appointments to higher posts are made it may be perfectly legitimate to test the candidates at a Properly .conducted interview. But interview cannot be made the sole test in 237 cases of this kind. The efficiency of a teacher and his qualifications, to be appointed as Headmaster depend on several considerations. His character' his teaching experience, ability to manage his class, his. popularity with the students and the high proportion of successful students he is able to produce are all matters which must IV necessarily taken into consideration before a selection is made. For this any Committee which desires to make a selection after interview should insist that the character roll and the service record of the teacher should be before it. In the present case however the Committee did not have before it either the character rolls or service records- of the teachers nor any confidential reports about them. They had to go merely by the result of the interview. The Committee was wrong in undertaking to make the selections on the basis of mere interviews. [246 D] Further, the expert adviser had advised 50% as the cutting score,. but the Committee adopted 30% as the cutting score.
 The expert found that there were many candidates who could not score even 30% marks and so the Committee decided that even candidates who got only 20% marks from the expert may be considered. In this way those who got more than 30% marks from the Committee and more than 20% marks from the expert were declared eligible for selection. This was indeed a travesty of selection. A selection made on such a.
 poor basis cannot be called a selection at all. [248 H] For the reasons given above the whole process of selection must be held to be wrong and unsatisfactory.
 (ii) Art. 15(4) speaks about "socially and educationally backward. classes citizens" while Art. 16(4) speak only of "any backward classes of citizens". However it is now settled that the expression "backward. class of citizens" in Art. 16(4) means the same thing as the expression. ,, any socially and educationally backward class of citizens" in Art. 15(4). It is social and educational backwardness of a class which is material, for the purposes of both Articles 15(4) and 16(4). [249 G] Mere poverty cannot be the test of backwardness because in this. country except for a small percentage of the population the people are generally poor-some being more poor, others less poor. In the rural' areas some sectors of the population are advancing socially and educationally while other sectors are apathetic. These sectors require to be goaded into the social stream by positive efforts by the State. That accounts for the raison d'etre of the principle explained in Balaji's case which pointed out that backward classes for whose improvement special provision was contemplated by Art. 15(4) must be comparable to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes who are standing examples of backwardness socially and educationally. If those examples are steadily kept before the mind the difficulty in determining which other class is should be ranked as backward classes will be considerably lased [252 D] In identifying backward classes one has to guard oneself against including therein sections which are socially and educationally advanced' because the whole object of reservation would otherwise be frustrated.

 [1964] INSC 20; [1964] 6 S.C.R. 368 referred to.
 238 (iii) The Jammu & Kashmir Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes (Reservation Rules) 1970 were defective and incapable of being given effect to for the following reasons (a) Several of the occupations mentioned as traditional in Rule 4 Chapter I cannot be regarded as traditional. An agricultural labourer is just a labourer whose services are utilised wherever unskilled labour is required. His occupation cannot be identified as a traditional occupation.
 Similarly it is difficult to say that the occupations mentioned in items (5), (7), (1 1), (20), (21), (23), (29), (48), (51), (53), (58) and (62) of Rule 4 are traditional.
 These occupation do not require special skills developed by tradition and can be resorted to by any body with the requisite resources.
 (b) Priestly classes listed at Serial Nos. 34 and 56 though following a traditional profession can hardly be regarded as socially and educationally backward, (c) The definition of 'traditional occupation' in rule 2(j) is open to serious objection. Under it if a person wants the special advantage as a member of the backward class it is enough for him to show that his grand father was following a traditional occupation. His father may not be following the traditional occupation at all. If the father of the person who claims special treatment under Articles 15(4) and 16(4) has given up his low income occupation and become a trader or Government Servant it will be wrong to give the persons the, special benefit merely on the ground that his grandfather was following a certain traditional occupation.
 (d) It was not known on what basis the Government in Rule 5 had included castes mentioned at serial Nos. 20 to 23 as socially and educationally backward.
 (e) The designation of cultivators of land as backward on the basis of the size of the holding, as had been done in Chapter III of the Rules must be held to be erroneous. The error in such a, case lies in placing economic consideration alone above considerations which go to show whether a particular class is socially and educationally ,backward.
 (f) The same error is repeated in Chapter IV wherein the dependent ,,Of a. pensioner is supposed to belong to the backward class if such pensioner has retired from certain Government posts mentioned in Appendix I and if the maximum of the scale of pay of these posts did not exceed Rs. 100/- p.m. In days when sources of employment were few many people though socially advanced might have accepted low paid jobs.
 (g) Although the residents of certain areas specified in Chapter and VI of the Rules are rightly designated as backward, Rules 10 and 11 have been so framed that the advantage is likely to be misused by importers. Outsiders who, in the course of their trade or business happened to live in these areas for- 10 years out of the past 20 years would be able to claim the benefit. This loophole must be plugged and till that is done, the production of a certificate from the Tehsildar as to the backwardness of any person will be of little avail.
 In view of the above findings the selections made by the Departmental Promotion Committee must be set aside. [260 C] 239 [Since it would take time to revise the rules and to make new selections the Court gave directions to be followed by the State authorities].
