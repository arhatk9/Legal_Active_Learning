 Respondent State issued a Notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 seeking to acquire 1034.94 acres of land in Village Digha for the purpose of construction of houses by the Bihar State Housing Board and the price or compensation for the acquired land was to be paid by the Housing Board and not by the State from its own funds. In July 1977, the State Ministry of Revenue and Industry, after issuing Notifications under Sections 6, 7 and 9 and after considering the claims and objections confirmed the acquisition. On 24.5.1980 a portion of the land comprising 4.03 acres belonging to some influential persons (Pandey families) was released without there being any legal or constitutional justification for the same. This release was challenged by way of Writ Petitions in the Bihar High Court, out of which the Present Civil Appeals and Special Leave Petitions have arisen and by filling fresh Writ Petitions in the Court.
 Allowing the appeals and the petitions in part, the Court ^ 
 HELD : 1. The order of release passed by the Government under Section 48 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 was non est, as being violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.
 The release of land in favour of Pandey families was a pure and simple act of favouritism without there being any legal or constitutional justification for the same. [583G-H, 584G] 
 2. The entire Notification issued under Section 4 on 19th August, 1974 would be deemed to be valid and the land released to the Pandey 580 families would form part of the acquisition as it did on 19.8.74. The release being separate and subsequent act of the Collector could not invalidate the entire Notification but would only invalidate the portion released. Lila Ram etc. v. Union of India and Ors.[1976] 1 SCR 941 distinguished. [585C-D, E-F] 3: 1 The contention that compensation should be paid according to the value of land prevailing on the date of actual take over of possession, since the price of land had appreciated substantially, is not correct under the law for two reasons, namely; (i) that it is not the fault of the Collector for causing the delay in taking over the possession because the matter was pursued both in the Courts and before the Government and the proceedings had to be stayed, as a result of which Collector was prevented from taking possession or giving his award, although all proceedings had taken place; and (ii) The landowners being in continuous possession of the land had enjoyed the usufruct of the same, particularly the lands happened to be mostly mango orchards and they must have derived large benefits by selling them in the market. [586G-H, 587A-B] 3: 2 However, the appellants have undoubtedly a case for payment of some additional compensation in equity which relief cannot be denied by the Supreme court which is not only a Court of law but a Court of equity as well. Apart from the compensation which may be awarded by the Collector or enhanced by the Judge or a High Court the appellants should get an equitable compensation in the form of interest calculated at the rate of seven and a half percent per annum for two years on the value of land owned by each land owner.
 Thus equitable compensation has been awarded in the special facts of the case appeal, if any, under the Act on the amount of compensation payable. [587C-E]
