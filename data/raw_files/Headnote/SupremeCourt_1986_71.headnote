 The proviso to s. 29 of the U.P. Sales Tax Act 1948 provides that no claim to the refund of any tax or other amount paid under the Act shall be allowed unless it was made within 24 months from the date on which the order for assessment was passed or within 12 months of the final order passed in appeal, revision or reference in respect of the order of assessment whichever Period is later.
 The respondent-assessee had been taxed on the basis of sale of forward contracts for the assessment year 1949-50 and for subsequent years. After coming to know of the decision of the Supreme Court in Sales Tar officer, Pilibhit v. M/s. Budh Prakash Jai Prakash, [1954] INSC 58; [1955] 1 S.C.R. 243 that the provision for taxation of sales tax on forward contract was ultra vires, the respondent-assessee filed a Revision in 1955 for quashing the assessment order for the relevant year 1955 i.e. within a year of the assessment order. me revision was dismissed in September 1958 on the ground that it had been filed after a long delay and was barred by limitation.
 m e assessee there after made a formal application before the Sales Tax Officer for refund of the amounts which were deposited in accordance with various assessment orders under mistake. The Sales Tax Officer dismissed that application as barred by period of limitation prescribed under Article 96 of the First Schedule of the Indian Limitation Act 1908. The assessee then filed a revision to the court of Additional Judge (Revision) Sales Tax, U.P. against the order of the Sales Tax Officer. Relying 431 upon the decision of the Allahabad High Court in Sales Tax Commissioner, U.P. v. Sada Sukh Veopar Mandal, 1959 S.T.C.
 57, the Additional Judge (Revision) held that there was no period of limitation and ordered refund of sales tax of Rs.3535.3 for 1948-49, Rs.9,205.12 for 1949-50, Rs.3,653.8 for 1950-51 and Rs.5,014.3.3 for 1951-52. me High Court also upheld the order of the Additional Judge (Revision) in a reference at the instance of the revenue. It held: (a) that the period of limitation under Article 96 of the Limitation Act could not be taken into consideration by the Sales Tax Authorities in refusing to allow refund; and (b) that the Additional Judge (Revisions) Sales Tax, U.P. was legally justified in entertaining the revision application after the lapse of several years from the date of the assessment order and that the sums deposited by respondent-company towards sales tax for the year 1949-50 and onwards were refundable to the company.
 Dismissing the appeal of the appellant-revenue, this Court, ^ 
 HELD: 1.(i) Article 265 of the Constitution enjoins that no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law. Therefore, when moneys are paid to the State which the State has no legal right to receive, it is ordinarily the duty of the State subject to any special provisions of any particular statute or special facts and circumstances of the case, to refund the tax of the amount paid. [437 D-H] 1.(ii) Where indubitably there is in the dealer legal title to get the money refunded and where the dealer is not guilty of any latches and where there is no specific prohibition against refund, one should not get entangled in the cobweb of procedures but do substantial justice. [445 F- G] Suresh Chandra Bose v. State of West Bengal, 38 S.T.C.
 99 and State of West Bengal and Ors. v. Suresh Chandra Bose, 45 S.T.C. 118, approved.
 2.(i) The rights and the obligations of the parties must be found within the four corners of the Act and the Supreme Court in an appeal under an Act must act under the four corners of law, but in interpreting the relevant procedural provisions, fairness and justice should be the approach and 432 even in a fiscal statute, equity should prevail wherever language permits. [438 H; 493 A] 2.(ii) Section 7-F of the Act is significant in the sense that it proceeds on the basis that refund had to be made in certain cases. The section enjoins that notwithstanding anything contained in the Act, no tax, fee, interest or penalty under the Act shall be recovered and no refund shall be allowed if the amount involved for any assessment year was less than five rupees. It recognises liability and the obligation of refund if the amount is more than rupees five. Sub-section (5) of section 9 stipulates that if the amount of tax assessed, fee levied or penalty imposed was reduced by the appellate authority under sub- section (3), he shall order the excess amount of tax, fee or penalty, if realised to be refunded. Section 29 stipulates that the assessing authority shall, in the manner prescribed, refund to a dealer any amount of tax, fees or other dues paid in excess of the amount due from him under the Act. Sub-section (3) of section 29 provides certain embargo against refund in certain cases. Therefore, it is apparent that the obligation to refund in cases of excess realisation or excess payment by the Taxing Authority of the dues from the seller as well as from the assessee is recognised in the scheme of the Act. [439 G-H; 440 A-B; E-F] 3.(i) Section 72 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 recognises that a person to whom money has been paid, or anything delivered by mistake or under coercion, must repay or return it. Money paid under a mistake of law comes within 'mistake' in section 72 of the Indian Contract Act, and there is no question of estoppel when the mistake of law is common to both the assessee and the taxing authority. [440 G; 443 D] 3.(ii) If law of limitation is applicable then section 5 of the Limitation Act is also applicable and it is apparent that the application originally was made within time before two years as contained in the proviso. Article 96 of the First Schedule of the Limitation Act, 1908 prescribes a period of limitation of three years from the date when the mistake becomes known for filing a suit. If that principle is also kept in mind, the assessee had made the application in 1955, and it was not beyond time, since the judgment came to be known in May. 1954. [445 D-F] 433 In the instant case, the mistake indubitably was there.
 There was no dispute that the tax was not due and had been collected wrongly. There is no dispute that the assessee is entitled to the same. There is no dispute that the assesee made application within a year of the knowledge of the mistake. There is no dispute therefore that had a suit been filed under Article 96 of the Limitation Act, 1908 or an application made under section 29 of the Act, the claim would have been allowed but the revision was dismissed on the ground that it was belated. The revision of The assessment order was wrong but the consequential relief of refund could have been granted. The order of the Additional Judge (Revision) was correct and the assessee was entitled to refund. [443 G-H; 444 A-B] Gannon Dunkerley and Co.'s case, 9 S.T.C. 353 and The State of Kerala v.
