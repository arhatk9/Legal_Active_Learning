 A partnership of two partners was dissolved on the death of one of them on August 24, 1957 and the business was taken over by the surviving partner on his own account. The services of the employees were not interrupted and there was no alteration in their terms of employment. In proceedings for assessment to income-tax for the assessment year 1958-59 it was urged on behalf of the firm that an amount of Rs.
 1,41,506 taken into account under the head "gratuity payable to workers of the business" in settling the accounts of the firm till August 24, 1957 was a permissible outgoing. The Income-tax Officer rejected the claim and the Appellate Assistant Commissioner confirmed his order. However, the Tribunal, in appeal, held that on the dissolution of the firm, the workmen became entitled to retrenchment compensation under s. 25FF of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and the firm was therefore entitled to the deduction.
 The High Court, upon a reference, confirmed this view.
 On appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The amount claimed by the assessee as a permissible allowance in his profit and loss account could not be regarded as properly admissible either under s. 10(1) or under s. 10(2)(xv) of the Income-Tax Act, 1922. [735 B] Under the proviso to s. 25FF the liability.to pay retrenchment compensation arose for the first time after the closure of the business and not before. It arose not in the carrying on of the business, but on account of the transfer of the business. It was not therefore a liability of a revenue nature and could not be treated as a permissible deduction under s. 10(1). [733 H] Alex A. Apcar (Jr.) & Company v. M. V. Gan and Others, A.I.R, 1960 Cal. 14, referred to.

 Where accounts are maintained on the mercantile system, if liability to make a payment has arisen during the time the business is carried on. and the expenditure is for the purpose of carrying on the business, it may be deductible under Section 10(2)(xv) but where the liability is during the whole of the period that the business is carried on wholly contingent and does not raise any definite obligation during that time it cannot fall L9Sup.CI/67-3 728 within the expression "expenditure laid out or expended wholly or exclusively" for the purpose of the business.
