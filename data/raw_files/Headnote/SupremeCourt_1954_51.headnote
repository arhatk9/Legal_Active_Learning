 If for no fault of the accused reasonable opportunity has not been given to him to adduce his evidence under the imperative provisions of a. 257 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, there is no fair trial and the accused cannot be convicted, even though the prosecution evidence by itself may tend to establish a strong case against him.
 Rules of procedure designed to ensure justice must be scru- pulously observed and Courts should be jealous in seeing that there is no breach of them.
