 The assessee company with its registered office in Mysore State and its management vested in Oakley Bowden Co.
 Ltd.,Madras sold Chrome ore to buyers mostly outside India who were in America and Europe. The sales to the purchasers in Europe were put through in London by Borden Oakely and Co. Ltd., London, the agent of the assessee company in Europe, the said agent signing the contracts for sale in London. The sales to purchasers in America were effected through W. R. Grace & Co., New, York, who bought for undisclosed principals, the contracts for sale to American purchasers being signed by W. R. Grace & Co., Ltd., New York, in America and by Oakley Bowden & Co. Ltd. (Madras) in Madras. Under both forms of contracts with European pur.
 chasers and American purchasers the price was F.O.B. Madras.
 Provision was made for weighment, sampling and assay of goods at destination. The course of dealing between the assessee company and the purchasers was as follows:- Before the goods were actually shipped, the buyers used to open a confirmed irrevocable Bankers' credit with some first class Bank in London. Being informed of the opening of such credit the 850 Eastern Bank Ltd., London, sent intimation to the Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras, and the latter in its turn used to pass on the intimation by letter addressed to the assesses company. On receipt of such intimation the assessee company placed the contracted goods on board the steamer at Madras and obtained a bill of lading in its own name. If hereafter the assessee company used to make out a provisional invoice on the basis of the bill of lading weight and contract price for 48 percent Cr. 203 and used to draw a bill of exchange on the buyers' Bank, where the letter of credit had been opened, for 90 percent of the amount of the provisional invoice payable at sight in the case of European contracts and 80 percent of the amount of the provisional invoice at 90 days' sight in the case of American contracts end in either case the bills of exchange used to be drawn in favour of the Eastern Bank Ltd., London. The bill of exchange together with the bill of lading endorsed in blank by the assessee company and the provisional invoice was then negotiated with the Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras, the bankers of the assesses company, who used to credit the assessee company with the amount of the bill of exchange. The Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras, then forwarded the documents to the Eastern Bank Ltd., London, who used to present the bill of exchange to the buyers' Bank in London, and upon the bill of exchange being accepted the Eastern Bank Ltd., London, used to deliver the bill of lading and the invoice to the buyers' Bank. The buyers' Bank in due course used to pay the amount of the bill of exchange to the Eastern Bank Ltd., London. Thereafter, on arrival of the goods and after weighment and assay, the sale price was ascertained and the balance of price after deducting the payments made against the bill of exchange, used to be paid to the Eastern Bank Ltd., London, which was the assessee company s agent and Banker in London.
 It was common ground between the Income-tax department and assessee company that the income arose at the place where the sales took place.
 It was contended on behalf of the department that the sales must be regarded as having taken place in British India because (i) the price and delivery of goods were on F.O.B.
 terms, (ii) that in the European contracts, the insurance, if any, was to be the concern of the buyers, (iii) that the payment of the 80 percent or 90 percent as the case may be was made in Madras by the Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras, and as on these facts the property passed at Madras, ,;he sales were completed in British India.
 Held, (repelling the contention) that upon the terms of the contracts in question and the course of dealings between the parties ,he property in the goods could not have passed to the buyer earlier than the date when the bill of exchange was accepted by the Bank in London and the documents were delivered by the assesses company's agent, the Eastern Bank Ltd., London, to the duyers Bank and this admittedly always took place in London and in the promises the sales took place outside British India and ex 851 hypothesi the profits derived from such sales arose Outside British India.
 Held further, that the contention submitted on behalf of the department that irrespective of the place where the sales may have taken place the profits derived from such sales were received in Madras, as after shipment the assessee company, through its managing agent` in Madras, prepared provisional invoices and drew bills of exchange for 80 percent or 90 percent as the case may be of the amount of such invoices and handed over the same to the Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras, and received the amount of the bill of exchange from them in Madras and that the receipt of this payment ,by the assessee company was really the receipt of the price of the goods and amounted to receipt of profits in Madras, was also devoid of force because the price was paid on behalf of the buyers by their respective London Banks in London to the Eastern Bank Ltd., London, which was the agent of the assessee company. The first receipt of the price was by the Eastern Bank Ltd., London, on behalf of the sellers and the balance of the price ascertained after weighment and assay and deducting the amount paid on the bill of exchange was similarly received in London by the Eastern Bank Ltd., London, on behalf of the assesses company and subsequent adjustment made in the books of Eastern Bank Ltd., London, did not operate as receipt of profits in British India.
