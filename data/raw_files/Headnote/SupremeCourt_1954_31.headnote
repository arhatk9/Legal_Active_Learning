 Held, that the provision of a. 44 of the Bombay Public Trust Act, 1950, relating to the appointment of -the Charity Commissioner as a trustee of any public trust by the court without any reservation in regard to religious institutions like temples and Maths is unconstitutional and must be held to be void.
 The provisions of el. (3) to (6) of a. 47 of the Act to the extent that they relate to the appointment of the Charity Commissioner as a trustee of a religious trust like temple and Math are unconstitutional and must be held to be void.
 A religious sect or denomination has. the undoubted right guaranteed by the Constitution to manage its own affairs in matters of religion and this includes the right to spend the trust property or its income for religion and for religious purposes and objects indicated by the founder of the trust or established by ussage 137 1056 obtaining in a particular institution. To divert the trust property or funds for purposes which the Charity commissioner or the court considers expedient or proper, although the original objectes of the founder can still be carried out, is an unwarrantable encroachment on the freedom of religious institutions in regard to the management of their religious affairs.
 Therefore cl. (3) of s. 55, which contains the offending provision and the corresponding provision relating to the powers of the court occurring in the latter part of s.
 56(1), must be held to be void.
 Section 58 of the Act is not ultra vires of the State Legislature because the contribution imposed under the section is not a tax but a fee which comes within the purview of entry 47 of List III in Schedule VII of the Constitution.
