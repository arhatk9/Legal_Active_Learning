 On the question whether the Regional Transport Authority had jurisdiction under s. 46 of the Motor Vehicles Act to allow or refuse substitution of heirs in the case of death of an applicant for the grant of stage carriage, permit before the grant of a permit.
 
HELD : The decision of the Appeal Board as well as of the Minister was wrong in holding that the Regional Transport Authority had acted beyond jurisdiction. The Regional Transport Authority has jurisdiction and discretion in the matter of allowing or refusing substitution. In the case of death of an applicant for the grant of a stage carriage permit before the grant of a permit, the heirs can apply for substitution in place of, the original applicant. If the proceedings are likely to be delayed or a substitution will be detrimental to the interests of the public the Regional Transport Authority is not bound to allow substitution.
 There is jurisdiction to grant or allow or refuse substitution. The Regional Transport Authority will exercise discretion in a judicious manner in the facts and circumstances of each case as to whether the substitution may be allowed. [934 C-D; 933 G-H] In the instant case the Regional Transport Authority granted the permit in the name of the firm after observing the procedure prescribed under the Act.
