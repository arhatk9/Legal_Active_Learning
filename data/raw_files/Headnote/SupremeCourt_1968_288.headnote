 The appellant who carried on the business of export and import applied for an import licence to import certain goods. The licence was issued in 1959 for only a part of the value applied for. He filed appeals and exhausted all the remedies under para 85 of the order relating to the Export Promotion Scheme, as a result of which finally in March 1962 he was granted a supplementary licence to import a small part of the goods. In April 1964, the appellant approached the Minister, and he was informed that no further licence would be issued to him. Thereupon, the appellant filed a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution seeking a mandamus for the issue of the import licence. The High Court dismissed the petition in limine but granted certificate Under Art. 133(1)(a) of the Constitution. ' HELD: The appeal must fail.
 The petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution was filed after great delay. No explanation was given in the petition for the delay in filing the petition and it was not explained what the appellant was doing between March 6, 1962, when the supplementary licence was issued, and April 1964. The exchange position of this country and the policy of the Government regarding international trade, varies from year to year and it would be rather odd for this Court to direct that an import licence be granted in the year 1968 in respect of alleged default committed by the Government in 1959 or 1962. In these matters it was essential that persons who were aggrieved by orders of the Government should approach the High Court after exhausting the remedies provided by law, rule or order with utmost expedition. Even in the case of alleged breach of fundamental rights the matter must be left to the discretion of the High Court. [864 G, 865 B] Smt. Narayani Debi Khaitan v. State of Bihar, C.A. No.
