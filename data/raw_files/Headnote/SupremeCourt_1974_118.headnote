 G and deceased M were trade rivals. At about 7 a.m. G went to purchase a basket of melons from the deceased. The deceased declined to sell it. Hot words followed. G left in a huff. An hour later G went to the market with his son R and two other sons. G had a knife R a gun and the others carried lathis. They advanced aggressively towards the deceased who attempted to retreat. R shot him dead at point blank range. The Learned Sessions Judge convicted R under section 302 and sentenced him to death. G was convicted under section 302 read with section 34 and was sentenced to imprisonment for life. The other two sons were acquitted of all the charges. On appeal, the High Court of Allahabad acquitted R and G and confirmed the acquittal of the other sons.
 
HELD : Confirming the acquittal of G but restoring the conviction of R and awarding life sentence, (i) The burden which rests on the prosecution to establish its case beyond reasonable doubt is neither neutralised nor shifted because the accused pleads the right of private defence. The prosecution must discharge its initial traditional burden to establish the complicity of the accused and until it does so, the question whether the accused has acted in self defence or not does not arise.
 The Sessions Court accepted the evidence of 5 prosecution witnesses after a careful Secreting and the High Court was unduly suspicious of that evidence in the name of caution.
 Caution is safe and unfailing guide in the judicial armory but a cautious approach does not justify an a priori assump- tion that the case is surrounded in suspicion. Murders are not committed by coolly weighing the pros and cons. [412C-F, H; 414A] (ii) The right of private defence is a right of defence. not of a retribution. It is available in face of imminent peril to those who act in good faith and in no case can the right be conceded to a person who stage-manages the situation wherein the right can be used as a shield to justify an act of aggression. Evidently the accused went to the market with a preconceived design to pick up a quarrel. It is a necessary incident of the right of private defence that the force used must bear a reasonable proportion to the injury to be averted. There was no justification for killing the deceased selectively. The right of defence ends with the necessity for it. When a person is accused of an offence the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the general exceptions in the Penal Code is upon him and the court shall presume the absence of such circumstances. The right of private defence constitutes a general exception to the offences defined in the Penal Code. The burden which rests on the accused to prove the exception is not of the same rigour as the burden of the prosecution to prove the charge beyond a reasonable doubt. It is enough for accused to show as in a civil case that the preponderance of probabilities is in favour of his plea. The respondents led no evidence to prove their defence but that is not necessary because such proof can be offered by relying on the evidence led by, the prosecution, the material elicited by cross-examining the prosecution witnesses and the totality of facts and circumstances emerging out of the evidence in the case. The conclusion of the High Court in regard to Ram Swarup being plainly unsupportable and leading to- a manifest failure of justice it was set aside and the order of the Sessions Court convicting him under section 302 of the Penal Code was restored. The sentence was however. reduced to life imprisonment since the possibility of scuffle cannot be excluded. [414H; 416D-417G] 410 In regard to G although if this Court was to consider the case independently it might have come to a conclusion different from the one arrived at by the High Court, in view of the principles governing appeals under Article 136 the order passed by the High Court was not disturbed. [418A-D] (iii) The locus standi of State Governments to file appeals in this Court against judgments or orders rendered in criminal matters has been recognised over the years for a valid reason namely, all crimes raise problems of law and order and some raise issues of public disorder. The State Governments are entrusted with the enforcement and execution of laws directed against prevention and punishment of crimes. They have, therefore a vital stake in criminal matters. The objection that the State Government has no locus standi to file the appeal must be rejected. [421A-C]
