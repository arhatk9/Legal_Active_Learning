 In October 1953 upon an application made under s. 5 of the Madhya Pradesh Public Trusts Act, 30 of 1951, the Registrar held an enquiry ,on the question whether particular trust founded in 1891 in, Nagpur in the Vidharbha area of the ate, of which the properties were in the possession of and managed by the appellant, was a public trust. On the conclusion of the inquiry, in accordance with s. 6 of the Act. he recorded a finding in November 1955 that the trust in question was not a public trust. However, the Registrar did not, as required by s. 7 of the Act, cause an entry of this finding to be made in the register maintained by him under the Act.
 On November 1, 1956, as a result of the reorganisation of States, the Vidharbha area was merged in the then Bombay State. The Bombay Legislature thereafter passed the Bombay Public Trusts Unification and Amendment Act, 1959 (6 of 1960) and by a notification dated February 1, 1964, passed thereunder, the Bombay Public Trust Act, 1950, was, extended to the Vidharbha area. By s. 86 sub-ss. (1) and (2) of the Bombay Act of 1950 inducted into that Act by Bombay Act 6 of 1960, the M.P. Act was repealed and the saving provisions contained in cls. (a), (b)and (c) in s. 86(3) projected, inter alla anything ,done, any rights etc. accrued and any legal proceedings pending under the repealed Act .On march 2, 1962, Respondents 2 to 5 filed an application under s. 19 of the Bombay Act before the Assistant Charity Commissioner for an enquiry as to whether the said trust was a public trust. The appellant contended that since the trust was already declared not to be, a public trust under the M.P.
 Act, the Assistant Charity Commissioner was precluded from holding the enquiry under the Bombay Act. The Assistant Charity Commissioner however rejected this contention on September 6, 1962 and thereupon the appellant filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging this decision.
 Two contentions were raised by the appellant in support of his petition. Firstly, that the Registrar under the M.P.
 Act having found That the trust was not a public trust and six months having expired from the date of his finding, that finding became final under s. 8; That a right within the meaning of cl. (b) of s. 86(3) of the Bombay Act ,vested in the appellant and therefore the Assistant Charity Commissioner :was not competent to reopen that finding and start an inquiry abrogating his said right; and secondly, that it was obligatory on the Registrar to make an entry in the register of public trusts maintained by him 111 under the Act and that since he had not made such an entry the enquiry held by him was not completed; that being so the enquiry was a pending proceeding saved by s. 86(3) and therefore the only remedy which respondents 2 to 5 bid was to. proceed in that proceeding by calling upon the Registrar to make and notify such entry and if necessary to file a suit under s. 8 of the M.P. Act challenging that finding.
 The High Court rejected both these contentions and held that the M.P. Act did not confer any finality on the Registrar's finding and that under that Act finality attached to an entry made by the Registrar in the register of public trusts; as the only register that the Registrar was enjoined upon to maintain under the Act and the rules made thereunder was the register of public trusts it was not incumbent on him to make an entry in such register when his finding was a negative one. No such entry having been made, no right under s. 86(3) vested in the appellant which would bar a fresh inquiry under the Bombay Act. The High Court further held that there being no obligation on the Registrar to make such a negative entry, it could not be said that the proceedings before him amounted to it pending proceeding saved under s. 86(3). It was also held that the suit contemplated under s. 8 of the M.P. Act was a suit for the purpose of correcting an entry made by the Registrar and as no such entry was made, respondents 2 to 5 could not have filed a suit under that section.
 On appeal to this Court, 
HELD : A fresh inquiry under the Bombay Act was not competent and the Assistant Charitty Commissioner was precluded from entertaining it. [119 B] Reading ss. 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the M.P. Act it was clear that the Registrar is enjoined upon to- make an entry in the register of public trusts irrespective of whether his finding is in the affirmative or in the negative. For the entry he has to, make is the entry "in accordance with his finding" whatever that finding is. [117 E] The inquiry held by the Registrar under the M.P. Act was indisputably "a thing duly done" under that: Act. The inquiry and its result having been saved by s. 86(3), cl.
 (a), they continued to be governed by the M.P. Act in spite of its ceasing to apply in Vidharbha. It could not be said that the inquiry was completed because the Registrar bad yet to make the entry of his finding which he was bound to make under s. 7 of the M.P. Act; it was therefore a pending proceeding under that Act. [118 G; 119 A-B] Universal Import Agency V. Chief Controller, [1961] 1 S.C.R.305 referred to.
 Ramalal v. Charity Commissioner, 63 Bom. L.R, 418, distinguished.
 The cause of action for a suit under s. 8 of the M.P. Act is finding and not the entry which is merely consequential. It is therefore not right to say that a suit cannot. be filed unless the Registrar has made the entry. The legislature could not have left the right to file a suit to the mercy of the Registrar who may or may not make the entry. [114 B; 117 A-B]
