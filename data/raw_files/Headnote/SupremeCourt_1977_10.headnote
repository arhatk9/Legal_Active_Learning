 A notification was issued under section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 on 7.6.1966 intending to acquire a total area of 13,900 sq. yds of land including 474 sq. yards of the appellant's land in Surat City. After considering the objections under s. 5A a notification under section 6 was issued on 13.1.1969. The appellant filed a writ peti- tion in the High Court challenging the said notifications which was summarily dismissed. The High Court, however, granted a certificate under Art. 133(1) (b) & (c) of the Constitution on the question of vires of sections 4, 5A and 6 of the said Act.
 Appellant contended:
 (1) In spite of the appellant's request for furnishing a copy of the report under s. 5A the Collector did not give him a copy and, therefore, he did not have adequate and proper hearing under s. 5A.
 (2) There was considerable delay between the notifica- tion under sections 4 and 6.
 (3) Notification under s. 4 does not contain the public purpose as the requirement for "fire station". The notifi- cation merely mentions" station workshop and parking pur- pose." Dismissing the appeal, 
 HELD: (1) Ordinarily there should be no difficulty in furnishing a copy of the report under s. 5A to an objector when he asks for the same. However, it is not a correct proposition that hearing under s. 5A is invalid because of failure to furnish a copy of the report at the conclusion of the proceeding under the said Act, [608 F-G] (2) A second hearing by the State Government after the report is furnished by the Collector is not necessary.

 (3) Since other dags of land belonging to numerous persons were the subject matter of acquisition and individu- al objections had to be heard there was no inordinate delay in making the section 6 notification. Even the appellant has not submitted before the High Court a copy of his writ- ten objection. Nor has the same been produced in this Court with the result that one does not know how much delay was caused by the appellant himself. The delay in the present case is about 2-1/2 years and there is not even a clear statement of the appellant about delay to be attributable to the Government. [609 B-D] (4) Submission that s. 4 notification does not contain the public purpose is made on the basis of the copy of the notification annexed in the paper book. Even in the state- ment of case the appellant has not raised this objection.
 On 607 the other hand it was conceded that the purpose was fire station, workshop and parking place and the objection was that the appellant's 1 and was not suitable for con- struction of fire station. [609E-F]
