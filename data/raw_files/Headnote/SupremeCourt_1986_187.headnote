 This Court by its order dated 18th April 1985 in Union of India v. Rajnikant Bros. (Civil Appeal No. 1423 of 1984) directed that save and except items which were specifically banned under the prevalent Import Policy at the time of import, parties would be entitled to import all other items whether 'canalised' or 'uncanalised' and in accordance with the relevant rules. The effect of this direction came to be considered in Raj Prakash Chemicals Ltd. v. Union of India, [1985] INSC 34; [1986] 2 SCC 297, and M/s. Indo Afghan Chamber of Commerce & Ors. v. Union of India, (AIR 1986 SC 1567). The effect has also been explained in Union of India v. M/s. Godrej Soaps Pvt. Ltd., (S.L.P.No. 8144 of 1986).
 The applicant was neither a party nor was served with any notice of the aforesaid proceedings. The respondents having not permitted clearance of its goods in view of the decisions in Prakash's case and Indo Afghan Chamber of Commerce's case the applicant filed petitions contending that it was not bound by the directions contained therein.
 Disposing of the petitions, the Court, ^ 
 HELD: Decisions of this Court laying down the position in law, are laws binding on all. [782 G] 782 Whether importation of canalised items would be covered by the order was not adverted to in the first order dated 18th April, 1985. Use of the expression "Whether canalised or not" was intended to convey that both canalised and non- canalised items would be covered within the ambit of the order. [783 G] The position has been clarified by the respondent's letter dated June 18, 1986. The Government of India's letter dated April 23, 1986 which is not in consonance with the subsequent direction, would not in any way affect the position or create any estoppel. Nor can such a letter be used as an argument that that was the Government's understanding of the matter. [783 H: 784 A-B]
