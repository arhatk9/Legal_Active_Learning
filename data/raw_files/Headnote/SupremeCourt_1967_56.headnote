 The respondent obtained a preliminary decree in 1952 against the appellant for the sale of the mortgaged property. He appealed to the Court for interest and costs which was not allowed in the prelitry decree. The appellants did not appeal against the preliminary fee. On respondent's application, the preliminary decree was made in 1954. While execution proceedings were pending, the respondent's appeal was allowed in 1956 in respect of the interest and costs.
 960 the appellant objected under s. 47 C.P.C., that as no final fee. had been prayed for and passed after the judgment of the High court in appeal and as more than three years had passed since the judgment of the High Court, there was no final decree to be executed, as decree which had been prepared in 1954 on the basis of which union was going on must be held to have no force and effect after judgment of the High Court making a variance in the preliminary ee. The respondent contended that it was not necessary to a apply a fresh final decree after the judgment of the High Court in appeal that the final decree already passed in 1954 remained good and was suitable. The appellant's objection was rejected. In appeal, this it.
 HELD : The appeal must fail.
 Where a preliminary . decree has been reversed in appeal, the final fee must fall to the ground for there is no preliminary decree therein support of it. It is not necessary in such a case for the defendant to go to the court passing the final decree and ask it to set aside final decree. If an execution petition is made on such a final decree though more than three years after the decree in appeal has been raised, the defendant has simply to ask the court where the execution ton is made to refuse to execute the decree on the ground that the minary decree in support of it has been set aside. In such a case the duty of the executing court to take note of the fact that the minary decree in support of the final decree has been reversed and could refuse to execute the final decree even though the fact is right to its notice more than three years after the decree in appeal repairing the preliminary decree and no question of limitation arises.
 G-107 C] Where the decree in appeal from the preliminary decree confirms it into, the final decree already passed needs no change and must contend to stand. It is true that if no final decree has been passed before appeal from the preliminary decree is decided, the decree-holder gets years from the date of the decree in appeal from the preliminary fee to apply for a final decree. That however is a question of limitation and in such a case three years run from the date of the decree in final from the preliminary decree in order apparently not to compel older to apply for a final decree if he does not wish to do 102 so and wants to await the result of the appeal from the preliminary decree. But if the decree-holder does not wish to await the result of the appeal from the preliminary decree he can ask for a final decree in the mean time and if the preliminary decree is confirmed in toto the final decree will need no change and can be executed as it stands. the decree holder in such a case need not apply for a fresh final decree and can execute the final decree already passed in the meantime. In all cases where a final decree has been passed in the meantime while an appeal from the preliminary decree, is pending, the existence of the final decree ought to be brought to the notice of the appellate court and it is the duty of the appellate court to give directions with respect to the final decree if it considers necessary.
 Further in a case where an appeal from the preliminary decree is dismissed and the preliminary decree is confirmed in toto, it does not follow that the period of payment allowed in the trial court's decree is extended automatically even though a final decree has been passed in the meantime. It is the duty of the -appellate court to indicate, when dismissing the appeal from a preliminary decree in toto, whether the time for payment is to be extended and if it does not do so, the original time granted for the purpose must stand. where the appellate court, in an appeal from a preliminary decree,, says nothing about the time fixed for payment and confirms the preliminary decree In toto that time stands and does not automatically get extended for six months or such other period as might have been fixed in the preliminary decree from the date of the decree in appeal from the preliminary decree It is not obligatory on a court of appeal to fix a fresh date for redemption in a mortgagor's appeal from a mortgage decree for sale even where there is some variation in the amount payable under the preliminary decree. [110 B-111 C] Where the amount decreed is increased, as in the present case, matter stands on exactly the same footing as in the case where the appeal from the preliminary decree by the defendant is dismissed in toto Where variation is in favour of the defendant and the amount fixed for redemption is reduced, it is the duty of the appellate court when it is reducing the amount payable for redemption to fix some time for the purpose in the interest of justice. But it is not bound to do so and it does not do so, the original time fixed in the preliminary decree stands even though the amount for redemption may have been reduced. There is no harm to the defendant mortgagor in such a case, for, under O XXXIV r. 5(1) the mortgagor would have time up to the date confirmation of sale to deposit the amount and save the property. (111D-G] Even where there has been a variation in the decree, the final decree if passed in the meantime, requires no formal amendment in view of the form in which a final decree for sale is prepared. All that happens in that where the preliminary decree is varied one way or the other, the final decree which is entirely dependent on the preliminary decree stands varied by its own terms in accordance with the terms of the preliminary decree passed in appeal. It is the duty of the executing court when it is executing the final decree passed in the meantime to see that the execution is in accordance with the preliminary decree passed in appeal which is the support of the final decree. Of course, if the appellate court when deciding the appeal gives any particular direction with respect to the preparation of a fresh preliminary decree that direction has to be carried out. Where there are. no specific directions of the appel- late court with respect to the preparation of it new preliminary decree, and all that the appellate court orders is merely a variation in the amount for redemption, it is duty of the executing court to see when it .is asked to execute a final decree prepared in the meantime that the 103 modifications made by the appellate court in the appeal from the preliminary decree are given effect to during the execution proceeding% [111 H-112 E] in the circumstances of the present case it was the duty of the Executing court, when variations made by the appellate court in appeal form 6 and all that the executing court had to do was to take note of account in executing the final decree.' which had been prepared in the meantime. The final decree in terms required no change in view of from the preliminary decree were brought to its notice, to take them into the fact that the supporting preliminary decree bad been varied and to execute the final decree in accordance therewith.
