 In respect of the appellant's assessment to income-tax for three years from 1958-59 to 1960-61, the respondent filed three complaint petitions before the Chief Presidency Magistrate, Madras, at the instance of the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner, charging the appellant with having committed offences under s. 52 of the Income-tax Act, 1922, and under 's. 177 I.P.C. He also filed another complaint petition in respect of the appellant's assessment to tax for the year 1961-62 under s. 277 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 and under s. 177, I.P.C. It was alleged that the appellant had made statements in verification under the income-tax Act which were false knowing them to be false and had deliberately suppressed certain income. The appellant thereafter filed four applications before the Chief Presidency Magistrate praying that the legality of the trial for the offences should be tried as a preliminary issue.
 This application was dismissed and a revision petition to the High Court was also dismissed.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended inter alia on behalf of the appellant (i) that he could only be prosecuted under s. 52 of the 1922 Act which was a special provision and not under s. 177 I.P.C. which was a general 'provision and which should be taken to have been repealed by implication; and that his prosecution under s. 177 I.P.C.
 was therefore illegal; (ii) under clause (2) (a) to (m) of 
8. 297 of the 1961 Act the prosecutions in respect of assessment proceedings pending at the commencement of the 1961 Act were not expressly saved and it must therefore be presumed that Parliament bad not intended to save such prosecutions; (iii) in view of the provisions, of s. 26 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, the appellant could be prosecuted either under s. 52 of the 19 Act or under s. 177 I.P.C. and not -under both provisions at the same time (iv) the appellant's prosecution was illegal as the complaint petitions were required to be filed by the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner himself under the 1922 Act but this requirement had not been complied with: (v) as it was open to the Income-tax Officer to prosecute the appellant either under s. 177 I.P.C. of under s. 52 of the 1922. Act and the choice of prosecution was left to the arbitrary or unguided discretion of the Income-tax Officer, there was a violation of the guarantee under Art. 14 of the Constitution.
 
HELD : Dismissing the appeal (i) Although there were some differences between the provisions of s. 52 of the 1922 Act and s. 177 I.P.C, there was no repugnancy or inconsistency between -the two statutes. -Section 22 of the 1922 Act did not alter the nature or-quality of the offence under s, 177 t.p.C. but merely 66 provided a new course of procedure for what was already an offence. In a case of this description the new statute is regarded not as superseding. nor repealing by implication the previous law, but as cumulative. [69 D] R. v. Robinson (1759) 2 Burr. 800, 803 and R. v. Hopkins [1893] 1 Q.B. 621 relied on.
 (ii) Parliament had not made any detailed provision for the institution of prosecutions in respect of proceedings which were pending at the commencement of the 1961 Act. In view of this and the absence of any contrary intention expressed in the provisions of the 1961 Act, s. 6 of the General Clauses Act was applicable in the present case and the pro- secution of the appellant under s. 52 of the 1922 Act was therefore valid. [72 D] Kalawati Devi Harlalka v. C.I.T. West Bengal 66 I.T.R. 680 and The III Income-tax Officer, Mangalore v. Sri N. Damodar Bhat [1968] INSC 205; [1969] 2 S.C.R. 29, referred to.
 (iii) A plain reading of s. 26 of the General Clauses Act shows that there is no bar to the trial or conviction of the offender under both enactments but there is only bar to the punishment of the offender twice for the same offence.
 [72 H] (iv) There is no statutory requirement that the complaint petition itself must be filed by the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner. The clause "at his instance" in s. 53 of the 1922 Act only means "on his authority" and it is therefore sufficient compliance of the statutory requirement if the complaint petition is filed by the respondent on being authorised by 'the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner, which bad admittedly been done in the present case. [73 D] (v) The offence provided for in s. 52 of the 1922 Act is an offence specially constituted and the prosecution for that offence requires the sanction of the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner. No prosecution also can take place if penalty has been imposed under s. 28 of the 1922 Act. The institution of a complaint under s. 52 of the 1922 Act is therefore circumscribed by sufficient safeguards and there was therefore no violation of the Guarantee under Art. 14 of the Constitution.
