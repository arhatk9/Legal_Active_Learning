 The Imports (Control) Order, 1955 provides that the items of goods 301 set out in Schedule 1 to the said order cannot be imported except under a Licence or Customs clearance permit. Clause 11(4) of the Order, however, empowers the Central Government to issue an Open General Licence (OGL) permitting the import of such goods subject to the conditions specified. Appendix 6 to the Import-Export Policy 1988-91 deals with categories of goods that can be imported under an Open General Licence and lists out the Categories of importers, the items allowed to be imported by them and the conditions governing such importation. Item 36 of this Appendix permits the import, under OGL, "by all persons" of Life-saving equipment as per List 2 of the Appendix and their spares. List 2 which contains the List of life saving equipment allowed for import under OGL includes, as item no. 27, "Haemafiltration instrument/haemo-dialysers and accessories/spares thereof.
 By a Notification issued by the Government of India under Section 25 of the Customs Act, 1962 the Haemodialysers and accessories, thereof were exempted from duty. The Haemodialysers are, however, not included in Schedules I and III of the Exports (Control) Order, 1988, clause 3 of which prohibits or restricts the exports of items of goods specified in the two schedules.
 The appellant, a recognised trading house carrying on business as Exporters, imported Haemodialysers from West Germany under Open General Licence and obtained the import clearance of goods from Bombay Customs House for "Home consumption" free of duty by relying on the notification granting exemption from custom duty. After clearance the goods were taken to Ankleshwar factory at Gujarat where they were re-packed and presented to kandala port for export to U.S.S.R. The custom authorities detained the goods for examination because it was of the opinion the re-export of goods imported under Open General Licence was not permissible except with specific approval of Import-Export authorities. During the pendency of the proceedings before the Collector, the appellant obtained a No Objection Certificate of the Reserve Bank of India for export on "humanitarian grounds" that the goods were needed for the help of the victims of the Armenian Earthquake in Russia and consequently the goods were exported.
 The Customs authorities, with the appellant's concurrence, made a reference to the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports under para 24.1 of the Import-Export policy who clarified that the imports under the OGL and certain other licences were entirely meant for use within the country 302 and therefore cannot be allowed for re-exports as such.
 By its order dated 22.10.1990 the Collector of Customs held that the goods exported were liable to confiscation under section 113(d) of the Customs Act and imposed a penalty of Rs.50 lakhs under section 114. However, the Collector held that the goods imported were not liable to import duty. The appellant preferred an appeal before the Central Excise & Gold Control Appellate Tribunal which was dismissed.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that: (1) The confiscation or the penalty can be justified only if the goods fall under description in section 113(d) of the Customs Act. The appellant was entitled, as a matter of right, to export the goods because the goods were not included in Schedule I or III to the Export Control Order nor was the export of goods prohibited by or under any other law for the time being in force; (2) Appendix 6 of the Import and Export Policy imposes no specific conditions that the Life Saving equipment should be used in India and should not be exported. The words 'stock and sale' are very wide and there is no justification to restrict them to mean only sales within the country; and (3) The exports were made in pursuance of the mutual trade agreement between Government of India and U.S.S.R.
 considered beneficial to both countries and that this should be considered sufficient to justify the export.
 On behalf of the Revenue, it was contended that: (1) Under the provisions of the Customs Act clearance of goods can only be for "home consumption" or "warehousing" and the import of goods just for the purpose of export is not permitted under the Act. The appellant cleared the goods for home consumption and so they were to be utilised in India and it was not permissible to export the goods; (2) Under the Terms of the Open General Licence the goods imported were to be used in India and not to be exported.
 Permitting export would defeat the intent of placing the goods under O.G.L. because the duty free import was permitted so that life saving equipment and medicines are available for use in the country and not to enable a private party to make profit by their export; and (3) The goods in question were "prohibited goods" under section 2(33) of the Customs Act. Therefore, the imposition of penalty was justified.
 Dismissing the appeal, this Court, 303 
 HELD: 1. The Customs Act does not prohibit the export of imported goods. There are provisions which indicate that export of imported goods is very much envisaged under the statute. The provisions contained in section 74 fully reinforce this view. Para 174(1) of the Import Export Policy 1988-91 also impliedly recognises that imported goods can be re-exported. [315 E, 317 B-D] 
 2. The goods imported into India have to be cleared from the customs area for home consumption or warehousing and this is done by presenting a bill of entry under section 
46. The terms of this section read with Regulation 3 and Forms I, II or III appended to the Bill of Entry (Forms) Regulations, 1976, make it clear that there are three forms of the bill of entry: for home-consumption, for warehousing and for ex-Bond clearance for home consumption. The presentation of a bill of entry for home consumption only means that the importer does not intend to warehouse the goods. The form of the Bill of Entry prescribed under the Act does not require any declaration from the importer as to the purpose for which the imported goods are required or that they will be used or sold only in India. [314 C-D, 315 A-B] 
 3. The expression 'home consumption' has also, in the context, no clear or definite meaning and raises a lot of conundrums if literally interpreted to mean that imported goods should always be consumed in India. The uncertainities in the connotation of the expression 'home consumption' preclude one from giving an interpretation to this expression that the imported goods cannot be at all exported and incline one to hold that, in the context, it is only used in contrast to the expression 'for warehousing'.
 [315 B-D] 
 4. The Customs Act provides that that goods which are cleared from the customs area for warehousing can be cleared from the warehouse for home consumption under section 68 or for exportation under section 69. The suggestion that if an importer intends to export the imported goods, he should clear them for warehousing and then proceed in terms of section 69 cannot be accepted because that would mean that imported goods can be re-exported after being warehoused for some time even a day or a few hours - but that they cannot be exported otherwise. Therefore, it would not be correct to insist that an importer must clear goods for warehousing and then export them by clearing from the warehouse.
 Whether to deposit the goods in a warehouse or not is an option given to the importer. [315 E-F, 316 E, 316A] 304 4.1. There is nothing in the provisions of the Act to compel an importer even before or when importing the goods, to make up his mind whether he is going to use or sell them in India or whether he proposes to re-export them. Again, there may be cases where he has imported the goods for use or sale in India but subsequently receives an attractive offer which necessitates an export. It would make export trade difficult to say that he cannot accept the export offer as the goods, when imported, had been cleared for home consumption. Section 69, therefore, should be only read as a provision setting out the procedure for export of ware- housed goods and not as a provision which makes warehousing an imperative pre-con-dition for exporting the imported goods. [316 C-E] 
 5. Clause 15(g) of the Export (Control) Orders, 1988 cannot be interpreted to mean that imported goods cannot be exported unless they are cleared, at the time of import, under a bond for re- export. [324 E] 
 6. It will not be correct to say that since the goods do not fall under clause 11(i) (d) of the Import (Control) Order, 1955, their export was not permitted. To say that goods bonded for re-export will not be affected by the provisions of the order does not mean that goods, not so bonded, cannot be exported at all. Their export can be interdicted only if there is some other express or implicit prohibition in clause 3 of the Export Control Order or otherwise. [324 H, 325 A-B] 
 7. Prima facie the words "stock and sale" may be, generally speaking, wide enough to comprehends sales inside as well as outside the country and that their scope should not be restricted unless such a restriction can be read into the terms of the OGL itself. Whatever may be the position in regard to the other lists in Appendix 6 to the Import- Export Policy, 1988-91 the items of goods enumerated in list no.2 that Appendix stand in a class of their own. There is sufficient indication in the heading given to the List to show that the import of these items into India is permitted only because such life-saving equipment is required for use in the country. The use of the words "stock and sale" shows only that the items are not restricted to use by the importer but can be transferred by him to another. But it is not proper to read them as permitting a sale of goods outside the country. Note (44) in Appendix 6 also carries a mild indication that the equipment permitted to be imported is only for the purposes of use in the country. [320 B-F] Janak Photo Enterprises (1990) 49 E.L.T. 339, distinguished.
 305 7.1. Although there is no express prohibition, the re- export as such of items of goods specified in list 2 of Appendix 6 to Import-Export Policy 1988-91 and imported into India is prohibited by necessary implication by the language of, and the scheme underlying, the grant of OGL in regard to them. It is difficult to agree that the import-export policy envisages the re-export of goods belonging to this category. The opinion of the CCIE is also to the same effect. [321 B] 7.2. The appellant had obtained the import of the goods free of duty by relying on the notification granting exemption from customs duty. It is obvious that it could not have been the intention of the legislature to grant exemption from customs duty in respect of vital goods of the nature in question in order that an importer may make profit by selling them abroad. The notification is, therefore, relevant for the issue before us to the limited extent that it lends supports to the construction of List 2 of Appendix 
6. [322 F-H] 
 8. The Court should construe a provision in a harmonious way to make it meaningful having regard to the context in which it appears. In this case the language used is being interpreted for giving content and meaning to the classification and heading used in the order permitting imports under OGL in certain cases in the context of the provisions of the Imports and Exports Control Act, 1947, as well as the orders and notifications issued thereunder.

Union of India, [1991] INSC 36; [1991] 2 S.C.C. 87, referred to.
 
 9. Clause 10-C of the Imports (Control) Order enables the authorities to interfere in any individual case where they find that the purpose of the import is not being achieved. It does not impose an obligation on an importer to seek the directions or the permission of the CCIE before exporting the goods if otherwise permissible. While clause 11(4) of the order makes clause 10 C applicable to the subject imports, it releases them from the application of the other restrictions and conditions on imposed by the Import Control Order. [325 G-H, 326 A-B] 306 However, clause 10 C is of some indirect assistance in the present case. The CCIE's opinion on the Import and Export Control order is final and binding. In view of this, when the CCIE came to know that the appellant was seeking to export the goods, he could have intervened and issued directions under clause 10 C either permitting the export of the goods to the U.S.S.R. or directing them to be sold to needy hospitals or other parties in India. He could have effectively stopped the export of the goods. This shows that the export of the goods is not free or unrestricted.
 [326 C-E] 
 10. Since the goods imported were intended for use in India the circumstance that the appellants secured a no objection certificate of the RBI for export "on humanitarian grounds" is of no assistance. [323 E-F] 
 11. The mere fact that mutual trade was allowed between the two countries is not enough to hold that even goods of this type - which had been allowed to be imported with a specific end in view - could be exported. The export of such goods may also enure to the benefit of India indirectly but, in the absence of anything to show that the goods in question constituted one of the categories of goods specifically envisaged by the mutual trade agreement, it is not possible to override the prohibition implicit in the Import regulations. [324 A-B] 
 12. The goods in question were "prohibited" goods within the meaning of S.2(33) and their confiscation under S.113(d) and the penalty under section 114 of the Customs Act were fully justified. [322 E]
