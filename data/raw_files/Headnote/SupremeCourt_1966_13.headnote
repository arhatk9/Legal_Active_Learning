 The respondent, who was ordered to be detained under Rule 30 of the Defence of India Rules, 1962, filed a petition in the High Court for a writ of habeas corpus. The High Court- passed an order releasing the respondent on interim bail.
 In the appeal to this Court against the said order, it was contended, inter alia, on behalf of the appellant state that although ordinarily the High Court may have jurisdiction to grant interim bail in habeas corpus proceedings, this was not so in cases where a detenu is detained under R.30;
 the policy underlying the enactment of the Defence of India Act and the Rules and the object intended to be achieved by the detention which is authorised under R. 30, clearly indicated that there were other valid considerations of paramount importance which distinguished the detention made under R. 30 and that altered the character of the pro- ceedings initiated by or on behalf of the detenu under Art.
 226; that in such proceedings the Court could not ignore the fact that the detention is purported to have been made in order to safeguard the Defence of India and Civil Defence, Public Safety, etc.; that the very object of making an order of detention against a citizen is to put an end to his prejudicial activities which are likely to affect one or the other of the matters of grave public importance specified by R. 30 and it would therefore be illogical to hold that even before the Court comes to any decision as to the merits of the grounds on which the order of detention is challenged, it would be open to the Court to pass an interim order of bail; that furthermore any order of bail passed in such proceedings would not be interim but would be final and this also distinguished cases of this character from other habeas corpus proceedings.
 HELD : In dealing with habeas corpus petitions under Art.
 226 where orders of detention passed under R. 30 are challenged the High Court has jurisdiction to grant bail, but the exercise of the said jurisdiction is inevitably circumscribed by the considerations which -are special to such proceedings and which have relevance to the object which is intended to be served by orders of detention properly and validly passed under the Special Reference No. 1 of 1964 [1964] INSC 209; [1965] 1 S.C.R. 413; State of Orissa V. Madan Gopal Rungta and others, [1952] S.C.R.
 28; referred to.
 If on proof of certain conditions or grounds it is open to the High Court to set aside the order of detention made under R. 30 and direct the release of the detenu, then it cannot be held that in a proper case the High Court has no jurisdiction to make an interim order giving the detenu the relief which the High Court would be entitled to give him at the end of the proceedings. [348 C] 345 It cannot also be said that the jurisdiction of the High Court to pass interim auxiliary orders under Art. 226 is taken away by necessary implication when the High Court is dealing with habeas corpus petitions in relation to orders of detention passed under R. 30. [348 G] It is only when the High Court is satisfied that prima facie there is something patently illegal in the order of detention that an order for bail would be passed. The jurisdiction of the High Court to pass an interim order does not depend upon the nature of the order but its authority to give interim relief to a party which is auxiliary to the main relief to which the party would be entitled if he succeeds in- his petition. [349 E] The jurisdiction of the High Court to grant relief to the detenu in such proceedings is very narrow and very limited and that being so, if the Court takes the view that prima facie the allegations in a petition disclose a serious defect in the order of detention which would justify the release of the detenu, the wiser and the more sensible and reasonable course to adopt would invariably be to expedite the hearing of the writ petition and deal with the merits without any delay. [350 A-B] If an order of bail is made by the High Court without a full trial of the issues involved merely on prima facie opinion formed by it, the said order would be open to the challenge that is the result of improper exercise of jurisdiction. It is essential to bear in mind the distinction between the existence of jurisdiction and its proper exercise. Improper exercise of jurisdiction in such matters must necessarily be avoided by the courts in dealing with applications of this character. [351 C]
