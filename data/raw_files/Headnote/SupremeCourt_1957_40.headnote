 The appellant failed to prepare a budget of the Waqf Estate of which he was the mutawalli, for the year 1952-53 and send a copy of it to the Majlis before January 15, 1952, as he was bound to do under S. 58(1) of the Bihar Waqfs Act, 1947, and was convicted by the 'Magistrate under s. 65(1) of the Act and sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 100, in default to undergo fifteen days simple imprisonment. It was contended for him that the conviction and sentence were not valid because (1) s. 58 of the Act contravened Art. 19(1) (g) of the Constitution of India, as it gave unrestricted power to the Majlis to alter or modify the budget prepared by the mutawalli without a right of appeal against the action of the Majlis and so imposed an unreasonable restriction on the mutawalli in carrying on his occupation as such, and (2) s.
 65 Of the Act did not provide for any imprisonment in default of payment of fine.
 Held, that having regard to the fact that a mutawalli occupies the position of a manager or custodian and the supervision over him by the Majlis with respect to due administration of the waqf property is necessary and that the powers of the Majlis to alter or modify the budget prepared by the mutawalli are controlled by sub-s. (6) Of s.
 58 of the Act, the restrictions imposed by S. 58 Of the Act on the exercise of his powers 1033 by a mutawalli are reasonable. Accordingly, the provisions Of S. 58 'of the Act do not offend Art. 19 (i) (g) of the Constitution.
