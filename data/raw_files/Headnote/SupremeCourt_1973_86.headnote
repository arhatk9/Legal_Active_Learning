 The Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971, was passed on July 2, 1971. On December 3, 1971, a Proclamation of Emergency was issued and on the next day. the Defence of India Act. 1971, was enacted. Section 6 of the Defence of India Act introduced various amendments and a new section, s. 17A. in the Maintenance of Internal Security Act.
 Section 17A effectuated 3 main changes: (a) It overrides, by its non-obstante clause, the other provisions of the Act;
 (b) a person may be detained in a class or classes of cam or under the circumstances set out in 9. 17A(1) (a) and (b)- namely on the ground of prejudicial acts in relation to (i) defence of India, relations with foreign powers and security of India, and (ii) security of the State and maintenance of public order without obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board for a period longer than 3 months. but not exceeding two years from the date of detention; and (c) the maximum period of detention of such a person can be 3 years or until the expiry of the Defence of India Act, whichever is later.
 These changes were brought about by Parliament exercising the power contained in Art. 22(4)(b), (7) (a) and (b), in respect of all the heads under Entries 9 and 3 of Lists I and III of the VII Schedule to the Constitution, except the one with respect to maintenance of essential supplies and services.
 The petitioner was arrested on January 29, 1972, under a.
 3(1) and (2) of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, and on April 15, 1972,the State Government, after perusing the report of the Advisory Board, confirmed the order of detention under s. 12(1) and directed the detention to continue for 3 years from the date of detention.
 In a petition under Art. 32, 
HELD : The petitioner should be released from his detention forthwith.
 (1) (a) There is no question of discrimination or.
 violation of Art. 14 as a result of any such discrimination.
 By the use of the words 'may be detained in the first part of s. 17A, an unguided discretion has not been conferred on the detaining authority whether to take action under the more drastic provisions of s. 17A or under s. 3(1) read with as. 10 to 13. [10E] (i) The opening words in a. 10 'save as otherwise expressly provided in this Act', mean that s. 10 would apply only to cases not expressly provided for In the Act, that is it would not apply to cases falling under ss. 17 and 17A. [10B] (ii) The words 'may be detained' in s. 17A(1) go with the words which follow them, namely, 'without obtaining the opinion of the Advisory Board' and 'in any of the following classes of cases or under any of the following circums- tances . . ..". and hence. are words enabling the authority to detain in certain cases and are not words giving a choice to the authority to apply s. 17A or not. [10C-D] (b) Even if the operation of ss. 17A and 10 side by side were to result in any difference in the working of the Act.
 that difference would not amount to any discrimination, by reason of the provision in s. 17A(2) to the effect that in the case of a person to whom s. 17A(1) applies, s. 10 shall be read subject to the modifications set out therein. [10D- E] L944Sup.CI/74 2 (2) Article 22(4)(a) lays down a rule to which Art.
 22(4)(b) read with Art. 22(7)(a) is an exception. In that view, cl. (7)(a) must be construed as a restriction on Parliament's power of making preventive detention laws in the sense that it can depart from the rule laid down in cl.
 (4)(a) and dispense with reference of cases to an Advisory Board only by a law which prescribes both the circumstances under which and the class or classes of cases in which, a person may be detained for a period longer than 3 months without obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board in accordance with cl. (4) (a). Since s. 17A has failed to comply with the requirement of cl. (7)(a). it has to be declared bad as being inconsistent with that clause. [23F-H] (a) Parliament has no alternative power either to pass a law providing for it longer period of detention than 3 months with the intercession of an Advisory Board or to enact a law under Art. 22 (4) (b) read with Art. 22 (7) (a) providing also for a longer detention. but without the intercession of such a Board, for, if such a theory were accepted, it would mean that : (1) Art. 22 (4) (a) would be totally nullified by Art. 22(4)(b) read with Art. 22(7)(a), and (ii) whereas State laws providing longer detention would require the intercession of an Advisory Board, such laws passed by Parliament would not. Moreover, the construction, that cl. (4)(b) read with cl. (7)(h) lays down an exception to cl. (4)(a), harmonises the clauses. Therefore, the theory of independent or alternative power of Parliament cannot be accepted. [18E-H; 19C] (b) (1) An analysis of the 2 clauses, cls. (4) and (7) of Art. 22 shows : (A) that ordinarily, detention provided by a preventive detention law should not be for a period longer than 3 months; (B) that if however such a law does provide for a longer period than 3 months, it must provide for the intercession of an Advisory Board; and (C) that situations may arise when in certain classes of cases Parliament alone should be empowered to enact a law which provides for a longer detention even without the intercession of an Advisory Board. [19A-B] (ii) The law under cl. 7 (a) would be a drastic law, as compared to the one to which cl. (4) (a) would apply, and the presumption would be that such a drastic law would apply to exceptional circumstances and activities expressly and in precise terms described. Circumstances would ordinarily mean situation or events erroneous to the activities of a concerned person or a group of persons, such as riots etc., which might by their pre-existence accentuate the impact of such activities affecting the security of the country or a part of it or the public order. Class or classes of cases, on the other hand, relate to a group or groups of individuals, who, by the nature of their activities fall under one particular group or groups by their common or similar objective or objectives. [21B-C, E] (iii) The entries 9 in List I and 3 in List III of the VII Schedule lay down the topics in respect of which legislation can be made. They are intended to delineate the bounds within which legislatures can pass detention laws.
 The purpose of these entries and of Art. 22(7)(a) are distinct. The purpose of Art. 22 (7) (a) is to distinguish the ordinary from the exceptional to which only the salutary safeguards provided by cl. (4)(a) would not apply. [21C-E] (iv) Therefore, mere repetition of the subjects or topics of legislation from the entries would not mean prescribing either the circumstances or the classes of cases to which only. as against the rest of the individuals and their activities, the safeguard of intercession of an independent body would not apply. If enumeration of the heads in the entries were to mean compliance with prescribing of circumstances and classes of cases. Parliament would., in such a law, be dealing with all situations and all classes of cases from the lowest to the most extraordinary or abnormal and not with some only requiring a treatment different from that envisaged by cl. (4) (a); and in such a case, 61. (4) (a) would again be rendered nugatory, for, Parliament can, by enumerating verbatim the heads or subjects set out in the entries, do away with the requirement of cl. (4) (a). [20B-F; 21 E-H] (v) The meaning of the word 'and' in cl. (7) (a) must be held to have its ordinary conjunctive sense. the context in the clause requiring Parliament to prescribe both the circumstances and the classes of cases in which only consideration by the Board can be dispensed with. Hence, cl, (7) (a) envisages that Parliament should apply its mind and prescribe specific situations and types of cases which require a drastic law dispensing with the intervention of an Advisory Board. [22A-B] 3 (c) The classification of prejudicial activities set out in Regulation 18B of the British Defence of the Realm Regulations, 1939. in rr. 34(6) and 36(6) of the Defence of India Rules, 1939, and in a. 3(2) of the W. Bengal (Prevention of Violent Activities) Act, 1970, show, that there is no practical difficulty in prescribing specific circumstances under which and the classes of cases which need dispensing with the intercession of an Advisory Board.
 [23F] (3) This Court would review its earlier decisions if it is satisfied of its error or of the baneful effect such a decision would have on the general interest of the public or if it is inconsistence it with the legal philosophy of our Constitution and in constitutional matters, this Court would do so more readily than in other branches, of law as perpetuation of an error would be harmful to public interest Nevertheless, this Court will have to bear in mind the accepted rule that earlier decisions are not to be upset except upon a clear compulsion especially when the legislature has acted upon them as perhaps Parliament did, while enacting the impugned s. 17A. [16A-D] Majority view on the construction of Art. 22(4)(b) and (7)(a) in Gopalan v. Madras [1950] INSC 14; [1950] S.C.R. 88, over ruled. [230-H] The Bengal Immunity Co. Ltd. v. Bihar, [1955] 2 S.C.R. 603 and Legal Remembrancer, State, of West Bengal v. The Corporation of Calcutta, [1967] 2 S.C.R. 176, followed.
 [The following two questions were left open : ((1) Since the major premise in the majority decision in Gopalan that Art.
 22 was a self-contained code and therefore the provisions of a law made under that Article would not have to be considered in the light of the provisions of Art. 19, was disapproved in Cooper T. Union of India, [1970] 3 S.C.R.
 530, as. 3 and 8 to 13 of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, must be declared void as imposing unreasonable restrictions; and (2) the maximum period of detention prescribed by the amended s. 13 and by s. 17A(2)(d) did not satisfy Art. 22(7)(b), since the period fixed by Parliament therein is 3 years or until the expiry of the Defence of India Act whichever is later, which was an uncertain event.] [24A-E]
