 The appellant filed a suit in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Ottappalam against the Respondent claiming a sum of Rs. 5500 as damages for defamation. The Trial Court dismissed the suit with costs. In First appeal preferred by the appellant, the District Judge allowed the appeal, decreed the suit and awarded Rs. 500 as damages and proportionate costs both of the said appeal and suit. In the Second appeal filed by the Respondent, the High Court of Kerala reversed the decree of the District Judge and dismissed the cross objections filed by the appellant.
 Against the said judgment with no order as to costs throughout Special Leave was granted by the Supreme Court in 1972 and during the pendency of the Civil Appeal, the appellant died leaving behind him surviving two grandsons and two grand daughters. On November 4, 1985 one grandson and one grand-daughter moved two applications-one to bring the grand-sons and grand-daughters on record as Legal Representatives and the other to condone the delay in filing the said application and to set aside the abatement of the Appeal.
 Dismissing the petitions and the appeal, the Court ^ 
 HELD: 1.1 Reading section 306 along with Rules 1 and 11 of Order XXII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, it is clear that a cause of action for defamation does not survive the death of the appellant. [810 C-D] 806 
 1.2 Where a suit for defamation is dismissed and the plaintiff has filed an appeal, what the appellant-plaintiff is seeking to enforce in the appeal is his right to sue for damages for defamation and as this right does not survive his death, his legal representative has no right to be brought on the record of the appeal in his place and stead if the appellant dies during the pendency of the appeal. The position, however, is different where a suit for defamation has resulted in a decree in favour of the plaintiff because in such a case the cause of action has merged in the decree and the decretal debt forms part of his estate and the appeal from the decree by the defendant becomes a question of benefit or detriment to the estate of the plaintiff respondent which his legal representative is entitled to uphold and defend and is, therefore, entitled to be substituted in place of the deceased respondent-plaintiff.
 [810 D-F] 
 1.3 Though section 306 speaks only of executors and administrators, on principle the same position must necessarily prevail in the case of other legal representatives, for such legal representatives cannot in law be in better or worse position than executors and administrators and what applies to executors and administrators will apply to other legal representatives also. [810 G-H] 
 2.1 Rule 1 of Order XXII of the Code provides that "the death of a plaintiff or defendant shall not cause the suit to abate if the right to sue survives. Thus, if the right to sue does not survive, the suit will abate on the death of the plaintiff. Under Rule 3 of Order XXII, where a sole plaintiff dies and the right to sue survives, the court on an application made in that behalf will cause the legal representative of the deceased plaintiff to be made a party and shall proceed with the suit. If, however, no application in that behalf is made within the time prescribed by law, the suit will abate. Under Rule 9(2), the court may set aside the abatement of the suit on the application of the person claiming to be the legal representative of the deceased plaintiff if the proves that he was prevented by any sufficient cause from continuing the suit. Rule 11 further provides the applicability of Order XXII to appeals as well substituting the words "plaintiff", defendant" and suit by "appellant" "respondent" and "appeal" respectively.
 Thus, reading Rule 1 and Rule 11 of Order XXII together, in the case of an appeal Rule 1 would read "the death of an appellant or respondent shall not cause the appeal to abate if the right to sue survives." Thus, where there is only one appellant and be 807 dies during the pendency of the appeal, if his right to sue does not survive, the appeal will abate and his legal representative will have no right to be brought on the record to continue the appeal. [808 F-; 809 A-D] 
 2.2 In the present case, if the Appellant's right to sue had survived on his death, his right to prosecute the present appeal would also survive, but if the right to sue would not have survived on his death, this appeal also would not have survived and would abate. [809 D-E] 
 2.3 The position, therefore, is that had the appellant died during the pendency of his suit, the suit would have abated. Had be died during the pendency of the appeal filed by him in the District Court, the appeal would have equally abated because his suit had been dismissed by the Trial Court. Had he, however, died during the pendency of the second appeal filed by the respondent in the High Court, the appeal would not have abated because he had succeeded in the first appeal and his suit had been decreed. As however, the High Court allowed the second appeal and dismissed the suit, the present appeal by Special Leave must abate because what the appellant was seeking in this appeal was to enforce his right to sue for damages for defamation. This right did not survive his death and accordingly the appeal abated automatically on his death and his legal representatives acquired no right in law to be brought on the record in his place and stead.[811 A-C]
