 Special leave granted to the petitioner under Art. 136 of the Constitution was revoked for non-prosecution and his special leave petition was dismissed. He filed a petition under Art. 32 claiming that the said revocation of leave and dismissal of special leave petition was in violation of his fundamental right under Art. 14 inasmuch as he had been deprived of his right of appeal. The Court dismissed the writ petition, The petitioner then filed a petition for review of the order. The review petition was found defective as the cash security of Rs. 2,000 as required by O. XL r. 2(2) of the Supreme Court Rules, 1966 had not been deposited. The petitioner urged, relying on the decision of this Court in Prem Chand Garg v. Excise Commissioner U.P.
 that the said rule was ultra vires inasmuch as it obstructed his remedy under Art. 32 in defence of a fundamental right.
 
HELD:The raison d'etre for the rule in question may be three fold, namely (i) the petitioner has been given a full hearing and his case had been disposed of on merits; (ii) it is a deterrent against frivolous applications; and (iii) it is to safeguard the interests of the respondent who has the judgment in his favour. [16 B] There is an essential distinction between an application for the enforcement of a fundamental right and an application to review an order made therein. The main purpose of a review petition is not to enforce a fundamental right but to reopen an order vitiated by an error on the face of the record or for such other reasons. [16 H] Therefore while any onerous condition for enforcing a fundamental right may infringe Art. 32 itself as held as held in Garg's case, but the same thing cannot-be said for an application for review of the order made therein. [17 A] Prem Chand Garg v. Excise Commissioner, U.P. Allhabad [1963] Supp. I S.C.R. 885, distinguished.
 The fact that deposit of security is a pre-condition only in the case of a review petition does not lead to any discrimination because the main difference between a review petition and other proceedings is that in the case of the former this Court is asked to reopen a matter which has been closed after hearing the parties. This is a sufficient reason to sustain the distinction and it affords a reasonable nexus to the objects sought to be achieved by the imposition of the pre-condition. [17 F] The fact that a rule in certain circumstances proves prejudicial to the interests of a petitioner cannot invalidate the rule when admittedly this Court has power to make it under Art. 145 of the Constitution. [17 D] 15 [Having regard to the circumstances of the case however the Court reduced the amount of cash security from Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 250 only,]
