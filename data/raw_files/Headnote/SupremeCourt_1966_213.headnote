 Pending assessment to Sales-tax of respondent's turnover under the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947, the Madhya Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1958, came into farce repealing the former Act Thereupon, the respondent was assessed to tax under s. 11-A(1) of the repealed Act. After more than three years from this assessment, the Sales Tax Officer issued a notice for reassessment under s. 19(1) of the new Act, which provided five years period for reopening escaped assessment. The respondent objected that his sales had been assessed under the repealed Act, where the limitation of three years for reassessment was prescribed and the proviso to s. 19(1) of the new Act preserved the rights acquired under the repealed Act. The Sales-tax Officer rejected the objection. The respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court which was allowed. Thereafter, the principal clause of s. 19(1) was amended retrospectively to include assessments under the repealed Act. In appeal to this Court-. the appellant Sales-tax Officer, contended that the main clause of s. 19(1) was applicable and that by the subsequent amendment to s. 19(1), the principal clause became applicable to cases assessed under the repealed Act and not the proviso.
 HELD:The appeal must be dismissed.
 The mere enforcement of the new Act by the time the order of assessment was passed by the Sales-tax Officer could not lead to the conclusion that the assessment was made. under the new Act and not under repealed Act. [833 H] The assessment, after enforcement of the new Act, was an assessment in accordance with the rights and liabilities of the respondent under the repealed Act; so the proviso to s.
 19(1) of the new Act was applicable. The proviso to s. 52 of the new Act also preserved this right of the respondent.
 [834 E] Even if the effect of the subsequent amending Act was that under the principal clause of s. 19(1) the reassessment could be taken up within a period of five years, that provision became ineffective because of the Continued existence of the proviso.
 A proviso is added to a principal clause primarily with the object of taking out of the scope of that principal clause what is included in it and what the Legislature desires should be excluded. [835 D]
