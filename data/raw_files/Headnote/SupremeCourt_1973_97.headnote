 The appellants were convicted under Ss. 148 and 325/149 I.P.C. Dismissing the appeal to this Court by special leave, 
HELD : ((1) In cases of party factions, there is generally speaking a tendency on the part of the prosecution witnesses to implicate some innocent persons along with the guilty ones, but normally where the general substratum of the occurrence cannot be held to arouse any reasonable doubt or suspicion about its having taken lace, then the prosecution witnesses, provided they are held to have witnessed the occurrence and to be in a position to identify the assailants, are not ordinarily to be assumed to have left out the actual offenders or the guilty persons. Although the witnesses for the prosecution are, in such circumstances, prone to exaggerate the culpability of the actual assailants as also to extend the participation in the occurrence to some possible innocent members of the opposite party as well, the court has to sift the evidence and after a close scrutiny with anxious care and caution to try to come to a judicial conclusion as to who out of the accused persons can be safely considered to have taken part in the assault. [105E-G] (2)The maxim falsus in uno falsus in omnibus is not a sound rule to apply in the conditions in this country and, therefore, it is the duty of the court in cases where a witness has been found to have given unreliable evidence in regard to certain. particulars to scrutinise the rest of his evidence with care and caution. If the remaining evidence is trustworthy and the substratum of the prosecution case remains intact then the court should uphold the prosecution case to the extent it is considered safe and trustworthy.
 [105G-H; 106A] Deep Chand v. State of Haryana, [1959] 3 S.C.C. 890, followed.
 (3) The question of delay in examining a witness during investigation is material only if it is indicative and suggestive of some unfair practice by the investigating agency for the purpose of introducing a got-up witness to falsely support the prosecution case: it' is, therefore, essential that the Investigating Officer should be asked specifically about the, delay and the reasons therefore.
 [106 B-C] (4) This Court does not, normally speaking, undertake the appraisal of evidence in an appeal under Ar. 136 of the Constitution. [107B-C]
