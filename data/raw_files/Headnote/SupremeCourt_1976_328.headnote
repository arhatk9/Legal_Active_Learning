 The plaintiffs-respondents who became owners of the land in dispute, as remainder-men, sued to evict the appellant, a cultivating tenant, on the ground that his tenancy rights created by Annamalai Ammal, a life-estate holder had ceased with her death. The appellant claimed protection under s.
 3(1) of the Madras Cultivating Tenants Protection Act, 1955.
 The respondents contended that such protection was only available against the creator of a lease, to persons who were cultivating tenants in 1955 when the Act came into force, and not to the appellant who became a cultivating tenant in 1961.The eviction suit was decreed. by the Dis- trict Court and the High Court.
 Allowing the appeal, the Court, 
 HELD: (1 ) The statutory definition of the term "land- lord" relates not only to the person who created the lease but contemplates and takes in every successive holder who could be entitled to evict a tenant. That. person can only one who has the right, at the time of filing the suit, to realise rents or evict persons in wrongful occupation.
 [449G-H] (2) The terms of the statutory protection apply to all tenancies governed by the Act irrespective of the nature of rights of the person who leased the land so long as the lessor was entitled to create a tenancy. [447E] The Court observed-- The Madras High Court's view that a life estate holder cannot create a. tenancy which could last beyond his life- time, applied to statutory tenancies runs counter not only to the principles underlying creation of statutory tenancy rights in agricultural land, through out the country, but is in conflict with the particular statutory protection con- ferred upon cultivating tenants in the State of Madras.
 [447E-F] (3) The provisions of the Act' are prospective except for section 4(1) and even s. 4(1) shows that the protection was not meant merely for those who were cultivating tenants in 1955. The provisions became enforceable as soon as the Act became operative and there is nothing in the Act to show that it ceased to be operative at any time or was limited in its operation only as a protection given to persons who were cultivating tenants in 1955.
