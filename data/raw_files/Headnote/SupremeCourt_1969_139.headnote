 The, appellant was convicted for the offence of murder in that he had removed the fish plates, nuts and bolts of a rail joint and thus knowingly caused a derailment resulting in the death of ten passengers travelling in a passenger train. The evidence against him consisted of his confessional statement to the Magistrate, discovery of a spanner as a result of his statement to the police, and his identification by a police tracker dog.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended that : (1) the confession was not voluntary because it was made after prolonged police custody of about a fortnight; and (2) evidence of identification by the tracker dog was not admissible in evidence.
 
HELD : (1) The appellant himself never said that he made the confession on account of any inducement or coercion on the part of the police. Further, immediately before he made the confession, he spent four days in judicial custody -and was not under the influence of the investigating agency. Also, he had 24 hours to think after he was told by the Magistrate that he was not bound to make any confession and that if lie made one it would be used against him. Therefore, it could not be said the confession was not voluntary. [555 F-H; 556 C-D] Nathu v. State of U.P. A.I.R. 1956 S.C. 56 and Swaran Singh v. State of Punjab, [1957] INSC 34; A.I.R. 1957 S.C. 637, distinguished.
 (2)In the present state of scientific knowledge evidence of dog tracking even if admissible, is not ordinarily of much weight. But, even on the assumption that the identification of the appellant by the tracker dog was not admissible, the rest of the prosecution evidence, namely, the appellant's confession and the discovery of the spanner at the instance of the appellant, conclusively established the guilt of the appellant.
