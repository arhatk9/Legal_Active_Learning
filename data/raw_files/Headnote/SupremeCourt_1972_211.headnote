 The appellant filed a suit for a declaration that her marriage with the respondent was null and void and for other reliefs. The parties professed the Roman Catholic faith.
 The marriage was solemnised by a Minister of the Roman Catholic Church who had received episcopal ordination and was competent to solemnise the marriage under sub-s. (1) of s. 5 of the Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872. The appellant claimed that she was a minor at the time the marriage was solemnised and the consent of her father or her guardian was not taken nor did she give her own consent freely to the marriage. Further, the marriage was void because the parties were within the prohibited degree of consanguinity. The High Court held that from the standpoint of Canon Law if the Roman Catholic church the objection to the validity of the marriage on the ground of lack of consent could not be sustained. The High Court expressed the view that the consent of the parents was not necessary as' required under s. 19 of the Indian Christian Marriage Act since the marriage was solemnised by a person failing under s. 5(1), nor was there any provision in the Indiar Divorce Act. 1869 which rendered a marriage null and void on the ground of minority of a party. On the question of the marriage being within the prohibited degree of consanguinity it was found that since the consanguinity between the par- ties was of the second degree it was certainly an impediment in the way of the marriage under the Roman Catholic law; But the impediment could be removed by dispensation which was granted by the competent authorities of the church; for that reason the marriage could not be held to be null and void.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) The High Court was right in holding that the pro- visions of s. 19 of the Christian Marriage Act was not applicable to the present case since the marriage was solemnised by a person falling tinder s. 5(1).
 The making of separate provisions in Parts III, V and VI of the Indian Christian Marriage Act relating to marriage of minors and the requirement of consent of the parents or the guardian shows that each part is meant to be self--contained. The categories of persons covered by those parts and the provisions appearing therein cannot be applied to marriages solemnised by persons falling in categories and 11 mentioned in section 5.In these two categories a person who can solemnize the marriage cando so only according to the rules. rites, ceremonies and customs of theparticular church to which the Minister belongs.
 123 In other words, if a marriage has to be solemnised by a Minister belonging to the Roman Catholic Church which fall within category 1, he is bound to follow only the rules, rites and ceremonies and customs of the Church to which he belongs and it is not possible to apply the provisions of Part III to him. Part III only applies to Ministers of Religion licensed under the Act., Section 19 could not therefore, be applicable to the marriage of the appellant and the respondent which was solemnized by a person in category 1 of section 5. [128G-129B] Rev. Father Caussavel v. Rev. Saure, I.L.R. 19 Mad. 273, referred to.
 There is no _provision in the Canon Law which contains a prohibition against the marriage of a minor in the absence of the consent of his or her parents It appears that under Canon Law so long as a minor has reached the age of capacity to contract the marriage can be solemnized and the lack or absence of consent of the parents or guardian will not invalidate the marriage. [130B-C] (ii)Once dispensation is granted by the appropriate authorities the parties cannot be regarded under the Canon Law as being within the prohibited degrees with the result that ground No. 2 in s. 19 cannot be availed of. The parties, at the time of their marriage, professed Roman Catholic religion and the question of capacity to marry and impediments in the way of marriage would have to be resolved by referring to their personal law. That, for the purpose of deciding the validity of the marriage would be the law of the Roman Catholic Church, namely, the Canon Law of that Church. If the parties are related by consanguinity in the secon d degree, that per se, is an impediment to marriage:
 but, under the Canon Law itself it is dispensable and can be removed by dispensation. [132H] V.H. Lopez v R. J. Lopez, I.L.R. 12 Cal. 706, H. A. Lucas v.
