 The petitioners, who reside and carry on business in Delhi, filed suit No. 262/1974 for perpetual injunction against the landlord's (Respondent's son) interfering with their quiet and peaceful possession of their tenanted premises. The suit, having been dismissed for default, the respondent made an application u/s. 95 r/w s. 151 C.P.C. claiming Rs. 3000/- as compensation from the petitioners for malicious prosecution of the civil suit. Since the written statement filed in the said application by the petitioners was stated to contain several serious defamatory allegations against the respondent whereby he was lowered in public esteem and reputation, the respondent instituted suit No. 690 of 1975 on the original side of the Calcutta High Court after obtaining ex parte leave under clause (12) of the Letters Patent for the Calcutta High Court claiming Rs. 2,00,0001- as damages from the petitioners.
 In the transfer petition, the petitioners contended (i) it is a clear case of harassment of the petitioners in order to drag them to the Calcutta High Court where the respondent had not to pay any court fee in instituting such a suit for libel; (ii) Defendants reside and carry on business in Delhi and it will be a great hardship to defend such a suit by them in Calcutta; and (iii) there is no prima facie justification to institute a suit in Calcutta and there is a clear lack of territorial jurisdiction as the publication of libel was in Delhi even according to the pleadings.
 Allowing the petition, the Court, 
HELD :(1) Section 25, Civil Procedure Code, in terms confers a new power on this Court which was earlier in the old section with the State Government. Section 25 C.P.C.
 provides that this Court, if satisfied that an order under the section is expedient for the ends of justice, may transfer any case from one High Court to another or from a civil court in one State to a civil court in another State.
 [420 H, 421 A] (2)This Court is the highest Court of appeal under the Constitution from all the High Courts in India. All High Courts in India within the meaning of Art. 366(14) of the Constitution r/w s. 3(25) of the General Clauses Act stand on the same footing so far as the Supreme Court is concerned and there is no basis for the submission that the suit cannot be transferred u/s. 25, C.P.C. from the original side of the chartered High Court to the Delhi High Court or that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain such a transfer application. [420 H, 421 A-D] (3)It cannot be said that if a particular suit is ex facie instituted deliberately in a wrong Court it will not have any bearing whatsoever on the question of transfer. The Court may bear it as an additional factor if there is prima facie, on the pleadings sufficient justification for such a plea. [421 F] (4)The fact that the plaintiff will be greatly handicapped in several ways in being deprived of the procedure extant in Calcutta High Court is not an impediment u/s 25(5) C.P.C. in the matter of entertainment of the petition of transfer by this Court. [422 B] (5)What is expedient for the ends of justice u/s. 25 C.P.C. will have to be judged upon the totality of facts and circumstances in a given case. The 41 9 instant case is a fit one where it is expedient for the ends of justice to transfer suit No. 609 of 1975 on the original side of the Calcutta High Court to the Delhi High Court.
 Having an overall view of the case, the relationship between the parties, the nature of the suit as well as the circumstances in which the suit has been filed in the Calcutta High Court, great hardship will be caused to the petitioners in defending such a suit in Calcutta.
 Convenience of the parties for a smooth and speedy trial will be more in Delhi. Since the cause of action has arisen out of the civil proceedings instituted by the respondents in the Delhi Court, it will add to the convenience of the parties so far as the production of records and even witnesses before the Trial Court is concerned.
