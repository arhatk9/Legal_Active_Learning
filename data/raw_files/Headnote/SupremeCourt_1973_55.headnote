 Rule 216(2) of the Mysore Motor Vehicle Rules, 1963, provides for the fixation of minimum seating capacity of a public service vehicle. Under a permit granted to him the respondent was running a bus with a. seating capacity of 
30. He wanted to replace the bus with a new one and applied forpermission to alter the seating capacity of the new bus from 40 to 30,but, the permission was refused.In a petition for the issue of a writof mandamus, the High Court struck down the rule and directed the Regional Transport Officer to grant the necessary permission. Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (i) The power conferred by s. 70 of the Act is wide enough to enable the making of the impugned rule. The validity of the rule has to be considered not merely from the point of view of the effect it has on the particular individual like the respondent but from the point of view of the generality of the motor vehicle operators as well as the public. there is no reason for not accepting the statement made on behalf of the State that passenger traffic on every route in the State had increased considerably, that generally it was found that stage carriage operators were carrying passengers in excess of the seating capacity specified in the registration certificate and the permit to the serious inconvenience and discomfort of the travelling public, in addition to causing loss of revenue to the State, and that it was with a view to' eliminate such evils that the impugned rule had been framed. It is true that the .State_ has necessary machinery to check such contravention, but it cannot always succeed in doing so.
 [774D; 775D- 776B-D] (2) There is no difficulty in getting the permit amended in order to allow for the increased capacity, because, under Rule 131, the procedure for replacing any vehicle covered by a permit by a vehicle of a different type or of a different capacity is made simple. [775B-C] (3) The tax on a bus with a minimum capacity of 40 is more than the tax on a bus with a minimum capacity of 30; but there is no basis for the contention that the rule is intended to secure more revenue indirectly; because, the State can do it directly by increasing the rate of tax.
 [776A-D] (4) The High Court erred in holding that any regulation regarding the minimum number, being uncommon has to be specially defended. The High Court also erred in holding that the State had not taken into account the prevailing conditions in the country with regard to the manufacture and availability of bus chassis. When a certain chassis is capable of having a body constructed on it so that it can carry a certain number of passengers to construct a lesser number of seats is waste of valuable transportation facility. [774E-F; 776D-F] (5) Stage carriage operators, exclusively in cities and towns, form a class by themselves and the exemption in their case has a direct relation to the objectives sought to be achieved. Therefore, there is no question 771 of any arbitrary or excessive invasion of the respondents rights. The rule is one of general application in the interest of the general travelling passengers.
