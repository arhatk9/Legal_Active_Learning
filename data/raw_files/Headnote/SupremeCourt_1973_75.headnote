 The appellant was convicted of an offence under s. 384 read with s. 511 Indian Penal Code. The conviction was solely based on the conclusion that the two anonymous letters demanding ransom for the kidnapped boy had been written by him. The appellant having categorically denied his authorship of those letters a handwriting expert was produced in support of the prosecution case, and believing the expert testimony the three courts below agreed in convicting the appellant. In this Court the sole question for consideration was as to the legality and propriety of the appellant's conviction on the, uncorroborated testimony of the handwriting expert. It was urged by the appellant that it was not safe to record a finding about a person's handwriting merely on the basis of comparison because the opinion of the handwriting expert is not conclusive.
 Dismissing the appeal.
 
HELD : (i) The legal position enunciated in Fakhruddin's case cannot be said to be inconsistent with the ratio of anyone of the earlier decisions to which reference has been made therein. [916A] Fakhruddin v. State of Madhya Pradesh, A.I.R. 1967 S.C.
 1326, Ram Chandra v. State of U.P., A.I.R. 1957 S.C. 381, Ishwari Prasad Misra v. Mohammad Isa, [1962] INSC 238; A.I.R. 1963 S.C. 1728 and Shashi Kumar Banerjee, v. Subodh Kumar Banerjee, A.I.R.
 1964 S.C. 529, referred to.
 It is no doubt true that the opinion of a hand-writing expert given in evidence is no less fallible than any other expert opinion adduced in evidence with the result that such evidence has to be received with great caution. But this opinion evidence which is relevant may be worthy of acceptance if there is internal or external evidence relating to the document in question supporting the view expressed by the expert. If after- comparison of the disputed and the admitted writings by the Court itself when the Presiding Officer Is familiar with the language, it is considered safe to accept the opinion of the expert, then the conclusion so arrived at cannot be assailed on special leave on the, mere ground that comparison of handwriting is generally considered as hazardous and inconclusive.
 In the present case the Trial Magistrate, the Sessions Judge who heard the appeal and the High Court themselves compared the writing with the help of the expert's opinion and came to the conclusion that the disputed handwriting tallied with the specimen handwriting of the appellant. There was, therefore no ground for interference by this Court with the appellant's conviction. [916B] (ii) Though a large number of factors fall for consideration in determining the appropriate sentence the broad object of punishment 9 1 2 of an accused found guilty in progressive civilized societies is to impress on the guilty party that commission of crime does not pay and that it is both against his individual interest and also against the larger interest of the society to which he belongs. The sentence to be appropriate should, therefore, be neither too harsh nor too lenient. The sentence of rigorous imprisonment for one year imposed in the present case would not in the normal course be considered to be too harsh but considerable time had elapsed since the commission of crime and the appellant had been on bail granted by this Court since January, 1970. To send him back to jail after so many years would be somewhat harsh. [917B] [Sentence reduced to period already undergone with fine.]
