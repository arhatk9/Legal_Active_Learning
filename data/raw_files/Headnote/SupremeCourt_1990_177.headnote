 The Petitioner was born in Tenali in the State of Andhra Pradesh and belonged to the Gouda Community which is claimed to have been recognised as 'Scheduled Tribe' under the Constitution. His father had been issued an Scheduled Tribe Certificate and it is on the basis of the quota reserved for Scheduled Tribes that he was appointed in the Fertilizer Corporation of India and later with the Rashtriya Chemical & Fertilizer, Ltd., and posted in Bombay since 19.6.1978. The Petitioner was also living with his father in Bombay since the age of nine years and took his education there upto 12th standard securing 165 marks in the aggregate, in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics.
 For the academic year 1989-90 he applied for admission to the M.B.B.S. Course in three colleges run by the Bombay Municipal Corporation and one by the State of Maharashtra seeking the benefit of reservation in favour of the Sched- uled Tribes. The Petitioner was not admitted to any of the colleges though some scheduled tribe candidates who had secured lesser marks than him were admitted. The reason for denial of admission to him was that he was not entitled' to scheduled tribe Status of his origin and birth as Gouda was not recognised as Scheduled Tribe in Maharashtra State.
 844 Disposing of the Writ Petition filed by the Petitioner, this Court, HELD: Equality is the dictate of our Constitution.
 Article 14 ensures equality in its fullness to all our citizens. State is enjoined not to deny to any person equal- ity before law and equal protection of the law within the territory of India. Where, it is necessary, however, for the purpose of bringing about real equality of opportunity between those who are unequals, certain reservations are necessary and these should be ensured. Equality under the Constitution is a dynamic concept which must cover every process of equalisation. Equality must become a living reality for the large masses of the people. Those who are unequal, in fact, cannot be treated by identical standards;
 that may be equality in law but it would certainly not be real equality. Existence of equality of opportunity depends not merely on the absence of disabilities but on the presence of abilities. Dejure equality must ultimately find its reason of the indefacto equality. [848E-G] Balancing must be done as between those who need protec- tion and those who need no protection, i.e., those who belong to advantaged castes or tribes and those who do not.
 Treating the determination under Articles 341 and 342 to be valid for all over the country would be innegation to the very purpose and scheme and language of Article 341 read with Article 15(4). [855C-D] Nothing is surplus in a Constitution and no part should be made nugatory. Having regard, however, to the purpose and the scheme of the Constitution which would be just and fair to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes not only of one State of origin but other states also where the Scheduled Castes or Tribes migrate in consonance with the rights of other castes or community, rights would be harmoniously balanced. Reservations should and must be adopted to advance the prospects of weaker sections of society, but while doing so care should be taken not to exclude the legitimate expec- tations of the other segments if the community [858A-B] The petitioner is not entitled to be admitted to the Medical Colleges in Maharashtra on the basis that he be- longed to the scheduled tribe in Andhra Pradesh. The ques- tion of petitioner's right to be admitted as being domicile does not fail for consideration. [860E] 845
