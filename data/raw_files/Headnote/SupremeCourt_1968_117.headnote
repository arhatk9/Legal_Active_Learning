 The appellant entered into a contract to sell certain goods to the respondent which he was importing under 'actual users' licence. Under the terms of the licence the sale of the, goods was prohibited and was to be utilised for consumption by the importer. The goods arrived, and were cleared by the appellant. The respondent filed a suit, which was contested by the appellant on the ground that the contract was illegal, and, therefore, void. The trial court decreed the suit holding that the contravention of the terms of licence entailed only an administrative penalty, the sale could not be held to be prohibited by law and the contract was a legal contract The High Court upheld the decree. In appeal, this Court :
 HELD: The appeal must be allowed.
 (i) The licence was granted by virtue of a statutory notification issued under the Defence of India Rules. The;
 notification authorises the licensing officer to impose one or more conditions prescribed by that order and the licensing officer has therefore power to impose conditions in the licence, issued by him, but if the licensee contravenes the conditions imposed by the licence it is merely a contravention of the conditions of a licence and not a contravention of the provisions of s. 5 of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, Section 5 of Act was amended by the Amending Act 4 of 1960 much after the present controversy, so as to include contravention of a condition of a licence granted under any order as an offence under s.
 5 of the Act. Therefore on the material date a breach of the condition of a licence was not tantamount to a breach of the statutory order within the meaning of s. 5 of the Act 18 of 1947.
 [73H; 74A-D] East India Commercial Co. Ltd., Calcutta, v. The Collector of Customs, Calcutta, [1962] INSC 199; [1963] 3 S.C.R. 338, followed.
 (ii) The goods which arrived at the Indian Port on 13th December 1955 were governed by the provisions of Imports (Control) Order, 1955 which came into force on 7th December 1955. Clause 5(4) of the 1955 order expressly provided that the licensee shall comply with all the conditions imposed or deemed to be imposed under that clause. Therefore the sale of the imported goods would be a direct contravention of cl.
 5(4) and under s. 5 of the Act any contravention of the Act or any order made or deemed to have been made under the Act was punishable with imprisonment or fine or both. In consequence, even though the contract was enforceable when it was entered, the performance of the contract became impossible or unlawful when the 1955 Order came into force, and so the contract became void under s. 56 of the Indian Contract Act. [75B-D] 66 The doctrine of frustration of contract is really an aspect or par; of the law of discharge of contract by reason of supervening impossibility or illegality of the act agreed to be done and hence comes within the purview of s. 56 of the Indian Contract Act. It should be noticed than s. 56 lays down a rule of positive law and does not leave the matter to be determined according to the intention of ,,he parties.
 In English law the question of a frustration of contract has been treated by courts as it question of construction depending upon the true intention of the parties In contrast, the statutory provisions contained in s. 56 of the Indian Contract Act lay down a positive rule of law and English authorities cannot therefore be of direct assistance, though they have persuasive value in showing how English courts have approached and decided cases under similar circumstances.

[1951] 1 K.B. 190; House of Lords, [1952] A.C. 166 at 185, referred to.
 (iii)The licensing authority could have given written permission for disposal of goods under cl. 1 of the notification but the condition imposed in the licence, in the present case was a special condition imposed under cl.
 (v) of paragraph (a) of the notification and there was no option given tinder this clause for the licensing authority to modify the condition of the licence prohibiting disposal of the goods. [78D-E] (iv) The appellant was not under obligation, to have purchased the gooods from the open market and supplied it to the respondent. Under the contract the quality of the goods to be sold was of specific description as described therein.
 The doctrine of frustration of contract cannot apply where the event which is alleged to have frustrated the contract arises from the act or election of a party, i.e., to a "self induced frustration". This principle could not be applied to the present case for there was no choice or election left to the appellant to supply the goods other thin under the terms of the contract.
