 Pursuant to s. 135 of the Indian Railways Act, 1890, the Governor General in Council issued a notification dated 24 August, 1911, declaring that the administration of the East Indian Railway shall be liable to pay in aid of the funds of the local authorities set out in the Schedule thereto the taxes specified therein. In one of the local authorities so set out, 'the railway administration constructed 32 blocks of buildings, some after 31 March 1937 and some after 25 January 1950. These buildings were assessed to municipal tax by the respondent with effect from the fourth quarter of 1965-66. The appellant contended that there was no liability to pay the municipal tax because of s. 154 of the Government of India Act, 1935, and Art. 285 of the Constitu- tion. The High Court held that the notification issued by the Government in 1911 continued by virtue of s. 4 of the Railways (Local Authorities Taxation) Act, 1941, that the 1941-Act was a federal law, that the 1.911 notification was.
 not in respect of any particular property, and that, therefore, the railway properties whether in existence before 1st April, 1937, or coming into existence thereafter, were liable to pay the taxes.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD, : The High Court was in error in construing that the, notification issued in 1911 under the 1890-Act continued by virtue of s. 4 of the 1941-Act. [544G-H] Under S. 154 of the 1935-Act all property vested in His Majesty for purposes of the Federation shall save in so far as any Federal law may otherwise provide, be exempt from all taxes imposed by, or by ,,any authority within, a Province or a State. The proviso to the section states that until any Federal law otherwise provides any property so vested, which was immediately before the commencement of Part III.
 of the 1935-Act liable to any such tax shall, so long as that tax continues, continue to be liable. Article 285 of the Constitution also provides that the property of the Union shall, save in so far as Parliament may by law otherwise provide, be exempt from all taxes imposed by a State or by any authority within a State, and, cl. (2) of that Article states that nothing in cl. (1) shall, until Parliament by law or otherwise provides, prevent any authority in a State from levying any tax on any property of the Union to which such property was immediate before the commencement of the Constitution. liable, so long as that tax continues to be levied in that State. [543B-F] The 32 blocks of buildings were not in existence before 1 April, 1937, and hence were not vested in His Majesty for purposes of the Federation, and were not liable to pay the municipal tax before that 542 date. They were, therefore. exempt from all taxes imposed by any authority within a Province until a Federal law other wise provided; and could be made liable only if Parliament, by law, provided to that effect. Section 4 of the 1941-Act did not provide, for payment of taxes in respect of Railway property. Section 3 of the Act, however states that a railway administration shall be liable to pay any tax in aid of the funds of any, local authority' if the Central government by notification in the official gazettee declares it to be so liable. But no such notification declaring railway properties to be liable to pay any tax in aid of the funds of any local authority under s. 3 of the 1941-Act has been issued.
