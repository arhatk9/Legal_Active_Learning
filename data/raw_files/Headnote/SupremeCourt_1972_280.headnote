 The petitioner committed thefts of electric copper wire and when challenged by the inhabitants of the area, he and his associates hurled bombs at them. The thefts totally disrupted the electric supply for several hours in the areas concerned. The petitioner was detained by an order of preventive detention under s. 3(1) and (2) of the Mainten- ance of internal Security Act, 1971. In a petition under Art. 32 he contended that he ought to have been proceeded against in a court of law a,-id that the investigating agency did not put him on a regular trial for want of evidence.
 
HELD : (1) (a) The Act was necessitated because in view of the prevailing situation in the country and the developments across the border the existing laws available to deal with the situation were found to be inadequate and it was considered necessary for urgent and effective preventive action, in the interest of national security, to have powers- of preventive detention to deal effectively with threats to the defence and the security of India. Section 3 of the Act carries out the statutory purpose of preventive detention and has nothing to do with trial and punishment of person-, for commission of offences. If, therefore, for any reason, it is not possible to successfully try and secure the conviction a,-Id imprisonment of the persons concerned for their past activities, which amount to an offence, but which are also relevant for the satisfaction of the detaining authority for considering it necessary that a detention order under s. 3 be made for preventing such persons from acting in a prejudicial manner as contemplated by the section, then the Act would made. The detention order in such a case cannot be challenged on the ground that th e detained person should have been tried for the offence committed or that proceedings under Chan. VIII Cr. P. C.
 could have been initiated against him. The Act creates in the authorities concerned, a new jurisdiction to make orders of preventive detention on their subjective satisfaction of grounds of suspicion of commission in future of acts prejudicial to the community. This jurisdiction is different from that of judicial trial in courts and of judicial orders for prevention of offences. Therefore, even an unsuccessful judicial trial or proceeding would rot operate as a bar to the detention order. or render it ala fide. [993 B-H, 994 A-C] Saheb Singh Dugal v. Union of India.

State of West Bengal [1972] 2 S.C.R. 550 followed (b) The right to personal liberty is protected by the Constitution, but this liberty is not absolute and is not to be understood to amount to license to indulge in activities which wrongfully and unjustly deprive the community or society of essential services and supplies. The 99 1 right of society as a whole is, from its very nature, of much greater importance than that of an individual, and in case of conflict between the two, the individual's right is subjected by the Constitution to reasonable restriction to the larger interests of society. [996 D-F] (c) In the present case, the grounds of detention are clear, relevant and germane to the object and purpose for which preventive detention is authorised by the Act, and the detention order is not open to challenge. [996 B-D] (2) This Court normally accepts without reservation the sworn affidavits of responsible officers on the assumption that the facts stated therein are absolutely true and that there is no misstatement or concealment of relevant facts.
 it is therefore obligatory on the part of the State to place before the Court all the relevant facts relating to the impugned detention truly, clearly and with utmost fairness, and it is incumbent on the officer concerned, swearing the counter affidavit, to take good care to satisfy himself that what he states on oath is absolutely true according to the record.
