 The appellant company deals in petrol and other petroleum products which it manufactures in its refineries situated outside the octroi limits of Belgaum Municipality. It brings those products inside the said area either for use or consumption by itself or for sale generally to its dealers and licensees who in their turn sell them to others. The Company also directly sells its products to Government, both civil and military, and to local bodies and big private concerns. The goods brought by the company within the octroi limits fall into four categories, viz. (i) goods consumed by the Company, (ii) goods sold by the Company through its dealers or by itself and 217 consumed within the octroi limits by persons other than the Company, (iii) goods sold by the Company through its dealers or by itself inside the octroi limits to other persons but consumed by them outside the octroi limits and (iv) goods sent by the Company from its Depot inside the octroi limits to extramunicipal points where they are bought and consumed by persons other than the Company.
 The Company filed a writ petition in the High Court against the respondents for a writ or writs to prohibit them from charging octroi from the Company on its products brought inside the octroi limits for sale. The writ petition was dismissed by the High Court. The appellant came to this Court by certificate under Art. 133(i)(b) of the Constitution. During the course of arguments, the respondents agreed to grant a refund on those goods belonging to the appellant company which were actually sent outside octroi limits. The appellant also admitted its liability to pay octroi on goods consumed by itself This Court was required to give its decision only on the rest of the two categories of goods.
 Held, that the Company was liable to pay octroi tax on goods brought into local area (a) to be consumed by itself or sold by it to consumers direct and (b) for sale to dealers who in their turn sold the goods to consumers within the municipal area irrespective of whether such consumers bought them for use in the area or outside it. The company was held not liable to octroi in respect of goods which it brought into the local area and which were re-exported.
 The word consumption in its primary sense means the act of consuming and in ordinary parlance means the use of an article in a way which destroys, wastes or uses up that article. But in some legal contexts, the word 'consumption' has a wider meaning. It is not necessary that by the act of consumption the commodity must be destroyed or used up.
 Octroi and terminal tax resemble in the sense that they are both leviable in respect of goods brought into a local area.
 Otherwise, they are quite, different from each other. While terminal taxes are leviable on goods "imported or exported" from municipal limits denoting thereby that they are connected with the traffic of goods, octrois are leviable in respect of the goods brought into a municipal area for consumption or use or sale. The history of these two taxes shows that while terminal taxes were a kind of octroi which were concerned only with the entry of goods in a local area irrespective of whether they would be: used there or not, octrois were taxes on goods brought into 218 the area for consumption, use or sale. They were leviable in respect of the goods put to some use or the other in the area but only if they were meant for such user. Another difference between the two is that there is no system of refund under terminal tax but that is so for octroi.
