 After the Government of U.S.S.R., under an agreement, granted a licence to the Government of India for manufacturing and assembling of aircrafts, both the Governments signed a protocol in the matter of manufacturing of MIG aircrafts in India. The Government of India in their turn entrusted the manufacture of the said aircrafts to the appellant, M/s Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd., (H.A.L. for short). The Government of India informed H.A.L. that the materials imported by H.A.L. for this purpose and other equipment etc. were the property of Government of India. For the implementation of the entrustment H.A.L. had three divisions namely, Koraput (in the State of Orissa), Nasik (in the State of Maharashtra) and Hyderabad (in the State of Andhra Pradesh). The H.A.L. manufactured MIG aircraft engines at Koraput (Orissa) and sent some of them to its Nasik Division for being fitted to the MIG aircrafts to be supplied to the Government of India and some to the Indian Air Force directly as per instructions from the Ministry of Defence. The H.A.L. received payments from Government of India or Indian Air Force for the manufacturing programme.
 In respect of payments so received, the Sales Tax Officer, Koraput I Circle of the State of Orissa levied central sales tax on the ground that the transactions were inter-State sales. The Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax while confirming the order of the Sales Tax Officer observed that H.A.L. had charged some percentage of profit in the invoices sent to the Government of India for the MIG engines as in a commercial transaction in case of sale which gave a clear indication that this was a case of transaction of sale and not of agency. In appeal the Sales Tax Tribunal negatived the contention of H.A.L. that the transaction was a works contract and not a sale. Hence this appeal.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: The transaction is not a contract for sale but a contract for work and labour. [275 D] There is no rigid or inflexible rule applicable alike to all transactions which can indicate distinction between a contract for sale and contract for work and labour. Whether a particular contract was one of sale or for work and labour depended upon the main object of the parties in the circumstances of the transactions. In a contract for sale, the main object of the parties is to transfer property in and delivery of possession of a chattel as a chattel to the buyer. The primary 268 difference between a contract for work or service and a contract for sale of goods is that in the former there is in the person performing or rendering service no property in the thing produced as a whole notwithstanding that a part or even the whole material used by him may have been his property. In the case of a contract for sale, the thing produced as a whole has individual existence as the sole property of the party who produced it some time before delivery and the property therein passes only under the contract relating thereto to the other party for price.

 In the instant case, taking into consideration the correspondence and circumstances under which this entrustment had to be understood, there was no transfer of property in the MIG Aero Engines by H.A.L. to the Government of India. The materials and equipments sent by the Government of U.S.S.R. and the MIG Aero Engines assembled by H.A.L. from such materials belonged to the Government of India at all material times. The Appellant had no ownership in the materials which were all supplied by the Government of U S S R nor in the finished products and no question of sales tax on the impugned transaction could arise. Even on the indigenous materials procured or manufactured by the appellant in the process of fitting in and assembling, the appellant had no disposing power as the appellant was never the owner of these materials. The H.A.L. only performed the job entrusted to them for and on behalf of the Government and all incidental steps naturally entering into contract, procurement, payment of price and billing and invoices had to be done in that light. The transfer of the Aircrafts to the Nasik Division was for the purpose of completion of the job and the making of the invoices was a matter of accounting and carrying out the job of entrustment [275 G-H;
