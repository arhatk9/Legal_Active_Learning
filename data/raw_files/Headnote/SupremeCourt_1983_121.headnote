 A certain extent of land was acquired under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The acquired land included a piece of land which had been mortgaged by its owners and let out by the mortgagee to a tenant who in turn had let out to the first respondent in both the appeals. The Collector awarded compensation to the land-owners. The first respondent objected to the award on the ground that since he had acquired the status of Bhumidhar under the Delhi Land Reforms Act, 1954 he was entitled to receive the entire compensation. On an application made by the first respondent the Collector made a reference to the District Judge. In the meantime in disposing of an application under s. 15 of the Delhi Land Reforms Act made by the land-owners for redemption of mortgage, the Revenue Assistant declared that the first respondent was Bhumidhar of the land which was in his possession as sub-lessee with effect from the date of commencement of that Act. The Additional District Judge held that the first Respondent was entitled to the entire compensation. The appeal filed by the land-owners was dismissed by the High Court. In this appeal the land-owners submitted that since they had redeemed the mortgage by resort to the provisions contained in s. 15(1) of the Delhi Land Reforms Act, they had become Bhumidhars under s. 15(2) of that Act and were, therefore, entitled to the entire compensation as Bhumidhars which was rightly paid by the Collector.
 Dismissing the appeals, ^ 
 HELD: The first respondent is entitled to the Bhumidhar's portion of compensation. [937G] Section 15(2) of the Delhi Land Reforms Act, 1954 says that if the proprietor mortgagor applies for redemption of the mortgage under sub-sec. (1) of sec. 15, he shall be declared as Bhumidhar only in respect of the mortgaged area which was in the personal cultivation of the mortgagee. In the present case, before the commencement of the Delhi Land Reforms Act, the mortgagee Ram Swarup had let the land in question to one Inder Singh and he in turn 930 had sub-let the land to the first respondent Sewa Ram and he was in possession of the same on the date of commencement of that Act. Therefore, the appellants in Civil Appeal 1195 of 1970 as owners could not have become Bhumidhars in respect of that portion of land. [936 B-D] Sub-sec. (4) of sec. 15 states that where any portion of the mortgaged land has been let out to tenants they shall be declared as Bhumidhars of the area let out to them.
 Therefore, the appellants in C. A. 1195 of 1970 could not in law have been declared as Bhumidhars under. s. 15(2) of the Delhi Land Reforms Act when that land was admittedly under the cultivation of the first respondent Sewa Ram as subtenant under the mortgagee's tenant. [936 E-F] Section 13(1) of the Act lays down that on the commencement of that Act, the Deputy Commissioner shall declare certain classes of tennnts as Bhumidhars who shall, with effect from the same date, have all the rights and be subject to all the liabilities conferred or imposed upon Bhumidhars under that Act. There could be no doubt that the first respondent Sewa Ram would have acquired Bhumidhari rights under s. 13(1) of the Act on the date of its commencement. Merely because there is some delay in the Deputy Commissioner or Revenue Assistant declaring a tenant as Bhumidhar under the provisions of the Act or because there is no such declaration at all the tenant entitled to acquire such rights under the Act from the date of its commencement cannot be said to have not acquired those rights having regard to the words of s. 13(2) of the Act which says that any person who acquires Bhumidhari rights under any provisions of this Act shall have all the rights and shall be subject to all the liabilities conferred or imposed upon Bhumidhars under this Act with effect from the date of acquisition of those rights. Subsections (2) and (4) of s. 15 cast an obligation on the Deputy Commissioner to declare as Bhumidhars persons who have become entitled to that right under the provisions of the Act by admission or acquisition under the provisions of the Act as Bhumidhars.
