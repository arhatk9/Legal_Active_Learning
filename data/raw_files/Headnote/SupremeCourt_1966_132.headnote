 During the pendency before the Industrial Tribunal, Bombay, of a reference under s. 73-A of the Bombay Industrial Relations Act, 1946, which arose out of a demand for the payment of bonus for the years 1961 and 1962 the Payment of Bonus Ordinance 3 of 1965 was promulgated by the President on May 29, 1965 with immediate effect. The representatives of the workmen claimed that even if the plea of the employers that the profit and loss account of establishment for the years in question disclosed a loss, was correct, the ordinance governed the dispute and that the employees were entitled to receive bonus, at the minimum rate of 4% of the salary or wages or Rs. 40 whichever was higher. The Industrial Court upheld the plea of the workmen and directed the employers subject to the provisions of the Bonus Ordinance, 1965 to pay to each employee bonus for the year 1962 equivalent to 15 days' of the salary or wages or Rs. 40 whichever was higher. With special leave the employers appealed to this Court and challenged the validity of the payment of Bonus Act, 1965, which repealed Ordinance 3 of 1965 and especially of the provisions under which bonus at minimum rate was made payable under the Act.
 
HELD: (i) The impugned legislation was within the legislative competence of Parliament and therefore not a colourable exercise of power or a fraud on the Constitution.

 (ii) The power to exempt certain establishments from the operation of the Act given to the appropriate Government under s. 36 was not an unguided power because the Government was enjoined to take public interest, the financial position of the establishment, and other relevant circumstances into consideration before exercising the said power. There was therefore no excessive delegation of leg= authority by s. 36 and the section was valid, [31 F-G] (iii) Per Wanchoo, Shah and Sikri, JJ.-Section 10 is an integral part of a scheme for providing for a payment of bonus at rates which do not juctuate from year to year. It is not in the interest of capital or labour that there should be wide fluctuation in the payment of bonus by an establishment from year to year. [33 H] The object of the Act being to maintain peace and harmony between labour and capital by allowing the employees to share the prosperity of 16 the establishment reflected by the profits earned by the contributions made by capital, management and labour, Parliament has provided that bonus in a given year shall not exceed 1/5th and shall not be less than 1/25th of the total earning of each individual employee, and has directed that the excess shall be carried forward to the next year, and that the amount paid by way of minimum bonus not absorbed by the available profits shall be carried to the next year and be set off against the profits of the succeeding years.
 This scheme of prescribing maximum and minimum rates of bonus together with the scheme of 'set off' and 'set on' not only secure, the right of labour to share in the prospertity of the establishment but also ensures a reasonable, degree of uniformity. [34 C-D] Equal protection of the laws is denied if in achieving a certain object persons, objects or transactions similarly circumstanced are differently treated by law and the principle underlying that different treatment ha,,, no rational -relation to the object sought to be achieved by the law. Examined in the light of the object of the Act and the scheme of set off and 'set on', the provision for payment of minimum bonus cannot be said to be discriminatory between different establishments which are unable on the profits of the accounting year to pay bonus merely because a uniform standard of minimum rate of bonus is applied to them. [34 F] Kunnathat Thathunni Moopil Nair v. State of Kerala and Another, [1960] INSC 285; [1961] 3 S.C.R. 77, distinguished.
 Section 10 undoubtedly places in the same class establishments which have made inadequate, profits not justifying payment of bonus, establishments which have suffered marginal loss, and establishments which have suffered heavy loss. The classification so made is not unintelligible as all establishments which are unable to pay bonus under the scheme of the Act, on the result of the working of the establishment,, are grouped together. [35 F] Section 10 therefore is not open to attack on the ground of denial of equality under Art. 14. [36 C] Nor was the attack under Art. 31(1) well founded. The article guarantees the right against deprivation of property otherwise than by authority of law. Compelling an employer to pay sums of money to his employees which he has not contractually rendered himself liable to pay may amount to deprivation of property : but the protection under Art.
 31(1) is available only if the deprivation is not by authority of law. There was however deprivation by authority of law in the present case. [36 F-H] Per Hidayatullah, (Ramaswami, J. concurring) Taking the provision for minimum bonus with the provision for set off it can hardly be said that the section is so exorbitant that it amounts to deprivation of the property of the employers with a view to giving it to the workmen. [56 E-F] The observations in Moopil Nair's case, wide as they may appear, must not be extended by analogical application to a case of minimum bonus which is intended to promote industrial peace and to be a first step towards the goal of need-based wage. Even if the payment of minimum bonus is viewed an compulsory payment of wage, the power to impose it as part of minimum wage is not lacking. It must not be forgotten that the fixation of minimum wage was also criticised along the same lines but was held justified. 'Me differentials, the paying capacity of establishments or absence of profit made no difference. (56 G-H] 17 Kunnathat Thathunni Moopil Nair V. State of Kerala & Anr,.

 State of Kerala[1961] INSC 158; , [1962] 1 S.C.R. 946, relied The provision for payment of 15 days' wages to workmen as bonus irrespective of profits is a measure well-designed to keep industrial peace and to make way for the need-based wage which the Tripartite Conference emphasized Some unequal treatment can always be made to appear when laws apply uniformly. Two establishments cannot be entirely Differences must exist but that does not prevent the making of uniform laws for them provided the law made has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved and the inequality is trivial or hypothetical. Classification can only be insisted upon if it is possible to classify and a power to classify need not always be exercised when classification is not reasonably possible. Section 10 does not lead to such inequality as may be called discrimination.
 [57 D-E] (iv) Per Wanchoo, Shah and Sikri, JJ.-Application of the Act retrospectively under s. 33 depends upon the pendency immediately before May 29, 1965, of an industrial dispute regarding payment of bonus relating to any accounting year not earlier than the year ending on any day in 1962. If there be no such dispute pending immediately before the date on which the Act becomes operative, an establishment win be governed by the Full Bench Formula and will be liable to pay bonus only if there be adequate profits which would justify payment of bonus. If however a dispute is pending immediately before May 29,, 1965 the scheme of the Act will apply not only for the year for which the dispute is Pending but even in respect of subsequent years. Assuming that the classification was founded on some intelligible differential which distinguish an establishment from other establishments the differentia has no rational -relation to the object sought to be achieved by the statutory provision viz., of ensuring peaceful relations between capital and labour by making an equitable distribution of the surplus profits of the year Arbitrariness of the classification becomes more pronounced when it is remembered that in respect of the year subsequent to the year for which the dispute is pending, liability prescribed under the Act is attracted even if for such subsequent years no dispute is pending, whereas to an establishment in respect of which no dispute is pending immediately before May 29, 1965, no such liability is attracted. Therefore two establishments similarly cir- cumstanced having no dispute pending relating to bonus between the employers and the workmen in a particular year would be liable to be dealt with differently if in respect of a previous year (covered by s. 33) there is a dispute pending between the employer and the workmen in one establishment and there is no such dispute pending in the other. [40 C-G] Liability imposed by the Act for payment of bonus is more onerous than the liability which had arisen under the Full Bench Formula prior to the date of the Act. Imposition of this onerous liability depending solely upon the fortuitous circumstance that a dispute relating to bonus is pending between workmen or some of them immediately before May 29, 1965, is plainly arbitrary and classification made on that basis is not reasonable. [40 HI Discrimination also results from the distinction made in the section between a dispute pending before, this Court or the High Court and one 18 pending before the Industrial Tribunal or the appropriate Government, the former not being treated as a pending dispute for the purpose of the section. There is no, logical basis for the distinction. [41 C] Per Hidayatullah and Ramaswami, JJ. (dissenting) : Sections 33 by providing uniformly for all cases pending on May 29, 1965, without any discrimination between them,, has established a rational classification. The section therefore cannot be said to be invalid by reason of inequality. [64 E-F] In s. 33 no note was taken of cases pending before the High Court and Supreme Court because the jurisdiction of the High Courts and the Supreme Court is either supervisory or appellate and the intention was to cover cases in which no decisions of the authorities appointed under the law relating to, industrial disputes was yet made. Disputes prior to 1962 were not taken note of because a date line had to be fixed and 1962 was the 'rational date to fix because the Bonus Commission began its deliberations that year. [63 G] In several statutes a date is generally selected to demarcate pending cases and the selection of the date has never been challenged successfully if there is some rational ground for its selection. If the resolution of the dispute by the instrumentality of the Act was contemplated, the Act had also to say which dispute would be so resolved and the only rational date to select was the, date on which the Ordinance was promulgated. Thus the pendency of disputes with reference to the Ordinance, and reopening of accounting years up to, the year in which the Bonus Commission began its deliberation was logical and not arbitrary. [63 H] The provision with regard to the reopening of the intervening account years for re-fixation of bonus was also logical. If the dispute regarding 1962 or a later year was decided by the application of the Act it was imperative to reconsider the subsequent years even though there was no dispute in those years. The process of the Act is an integrated one and by the principle of set on and set off four accounting years are involved to avoid extraordinary results. [64 E] By the different treatment of those establishments where a dispute is pending there is no violation of equality. The fact that in one there is a dispute and in the other there is not, clearly distinguishes the two establishments. The distinguishing feature of the pendency of the dispute on the date of the promulgation of the Ordinance clearly demarcates a distinct class of cases and the classification made by the Act is a rational one. No doubt the liability for bonus under the Act may be more in some cases but it is likely to be less in others. The Act does not make any difference in the treatment within the class it deals with. All establishments in which disputes were pending are treated alike. [64 C-E] (v) Per Wanchoo, Shah and Sikri, JJ--Section 34 imposes a special liability to pay bonus determined on the gross profits of the base year on an assumption that the ratio which determine-, the allocable surplus is the normal ratio not affected by any special circumstance and perpetuates for the duration of the Act that ratio for determining the minimum allocable surplus each year. If bonus contemplated to be paid under the Act is intended to make an equitable distribution of the surplus profits of a particular year, a scheme for computing labour's share which cannot be less than the amount determined by the application of a ratio derived from the working of the base year without taking into consideration the special Circumstances governing that determination is prima facie arbitrary and unreasonable. It may be that the ratio was intended to stabilise the previous grant of bonus and maintain in favour of labour whatever was 19 achieved by collective bargaining in the base year. But the validity of a statute is subject to judicial scrutiny in the context of fundamental freedoms guaranteed to employers as well as employees and the freedom of equal protection of the laws becomes chimerical if the only ground in support of the validity of a statute ex facie discriminatory is that the Parliament intended inconsistently with the very concept of bonus evolved by it to maintain for the benefit of labour an advantage which labour had obtained in an earlier year based on special circumstances of that year, without any inquiry whether that advantage may reasonably be granted in subsequent years according to the principles evolved by it and for securing the object of the Act. If the concept of bonus as allocation of an equitable share of the surplus profits of an establishment to the workmen who have contributed to the earning has reality, any condition that the ratio on which the share of one party computed on the basis of the working of an earlier year, without taking into consideration the special circumstances which had a bearing on the earning of the profits and payment of bonus in that year, shall not be touched, is arbitrary and unreasonable.
 The vice of the provision lies in the imposition of an arbitrary ratio governing distribution of surplus profits.
 Section 34(2) is invalid on the ground that it infringes Art. 14 of the Constitution. [45 H-46 F] Per Hidayatullah and Ramaswami, JJ. (dissenting) Section 34(1) which is criticised because it sacrifices all principles which this Court- had established in the past and fixes a ratio for all time to come is also not invalid. The Act was passed to make for greater certainty, for improving relations between the employers and the workmen and for the avoidance of disputes. It must not be forgotten that in many establishments the payment of bonus in the past was the result of collective bargaining and the advantage which labour has so achieved was not likely to be given up so readily. Any legislation to be successful had to preserve as far as possible what labour considered to be its right in a particular establishment. By establishing a base year and by insisting that the same proposition should be maintained in the payment of bonus the establishment knew with certainly what their liabilities in respect of bonous would be in the future years. If extraordinary circumstances appear set on and set off will make them less onerous for the employers or employees. The existence of a rigid ratio which applies to all establishments which come tinder s.
 34(2) does not therefore create inequality. [64 F-65 C] (vi) Per Wanchoo, Shah 'and Sikri, JJ.-Section 37 authorises the Government to determine for itself what the purposes of the Act are and to make provisions for the removal of doubts or difficulties. This in substance amounts to exercise of legislative authority which cannot be delegated to an executive authority. Sub-section (2) of s. 37 which purports to make the order of the Central Government in such cases final accentuates the vice in sub-s. (1) since by enacting that provision the Government is made the sole judge whether difficulty or doubt had arisen in giving effect to the provisions of the Act, whether it is necessary or expedient to remove the doubt or difficulty, and whether the provision enacted is not inconsistent with the purpose of the Act. Section 37 therefore is invalid. [32 A-C] Per Hidayatullah and Ramaswami, JJ. (dissenting) The functions exercised under s. 37 are not legislative functions at all but are intended to advance the purpose which the Legislature had in mind. Apprehending that in the application of the new Act doubts and difficulties might arise and not leaving their solution to the courts with the attendant delays and expense, Parliament has chosen to give power to the Central Government to remove doubts and.
 differences by a suitable order. The order of course 20 would be passed within the four corners of the parliamentary legislation and would only apply the Act to concrete cases as the courts do when they consider the application of the Act. The order of the Central Government is made final for the reason that it is hardly practical to give power to the Central Government and yet to leave the matter to be litigated further. The fact that in the Government of India Act, 1935 and in the Constitution such a power was and is contemplated and it has been conferred in various Acts without a challenge before, shows amply that the argument that the section amounts to delegation of legislative powers on the Central Government is erroneous. Accordingly s. 37 is valid. [As to the validity of s. 32 with reference to Art. 14 of the Constitution the Court found that there was not enough material on record to decide the issue.] [58 H-59 E]
