 A first information report was filed stating that the respondent No.1 and some others committed murder. There- after a person claiming to be a relative of the deceased filed a complaint alleging that the first information report was false and that certain persons other than those stated in the first information report had committed the murder.
 It was prayed that process be issued against these persons.
 The Sub-Divisional Magistrate before whom this complaint was filed directed the First Class Magistrate to inquire into the allegation and to make a report. Subsequently the nephew of the deceased filed a complaint alleging that respondent No.1 had committed the murder. The Sub- Divisional Magistrate directed the First Class Magistrate to enquire into this complaint also and to report. During the enquiry apart from the witness produced 640 by the complainant, respondent No.1 was allowed to be represented by a counsel and two persons who had been named in the first information report along with respondent No. 1 were examined as court witnesses. The First Class Magistrate after conducting inquiry under s. 203 Criminal Procedure Code, 1898, made a report stating that a prima facie case had been made out against the persons mentioned in the first complaint. He made another report on the second complaint stating that no prima facie case had been made against respondent No. 1. Sub-Divisional Magistrate directed the initiation of committal proceedings against the persons mentioned in the first complaint. On a revision application filed by the complainant in the second complaint the Sessions judge directed the Sub-Divisional Magistrate to conduct further inquiry against respondent No. 1 who took the matter in revision to the High Court. The three-.
 persons against whom committal proceedings were ordered also filed revision application before the High Court. Both the petitions were heard together. The revision applications by respondent No. 1 and one of the three others were allowed.
 The present appeal is under a certificate granted under Art.
 134 (1) (c) of the Constitution of India.
 The main contentions of the appellant before this Court were (1) the respondent No. 1 had no locus standi to appear and contest a criminal case before the issue of process (2) the test applied by the High Court for determining the question of issue of process was erroneous (3) the Magistrate making an inquiry under s. 202 Criminal Procedure Code had no jurisdiction to weigh the evidence as if it were a trial (4) the Sub. Divisional Magistrate ought to have given his reasons under s. 203 Criminal Procedure Code for dismissing the complaint.
 Held, that an accused person does not come into the picture at all till process is issued. Even though he may be allowed to be represented by counsel he has no right to take part in the proceedings nor has the Magistrate jurisdiction to permit him to do so. The Magistrate cannot put questions at the instance of a, person named as accused but against whom no process has been issued nor can he examine any witnesses at the instance of that person. The inquiry made by the Magistrate was therefore vitiated.
 Vadilal Panchal v. Dattatrya Dulaji Ghadigsonkar, [1961] 1 S. C. R. 1, referred to.
 For determining the question whether process is to be issued or not the test to be applied is whether there is "sufficient 641 ground for proceedings" and not whether there is sufficient ground for conviction.
 Parmand Brahmchari v. Emperor, A. I. R. 1930 Pat. 30 Radha Kishun Sao v. S. K. Misra, A. I. R. 1949 Pat. 36, Ramkisto Sahu v. State of Bihar, A. I. R. 1952 Pat. 125, Emperor v.
 J. A. Finan, A. 1. R. 1931 Bom. 524 and Baidya Nath Singh v.
 Muspratt, (1886) 1. L. R. 14 Cal. 141 discussed.
 While acting under s. 202 Criminal Procedure Code it is not open to the Magistrate to consider the statements recorded by the police during investigation or to consider the evidence adduced before him in another complaint. What the Magistrate could not do the High Court also was incompetent to do.
 Where there is a prima facie case even though much can be said on both sides, a committing Magistrate is bound to commit the accused for trial.
 Ramgopal Ganpatrai Ruia v. State of Bombay, [1958] S. C. R.
 618, referred to.
 When a Magistrate dismisses a complaint because there are no sufficient grounds for proceeding with the trial he shall record his reasons for doing so.
 Willie (Williams) Slaney v. State of Madhya Pradesh, [1955] INSC 60; [1955] 2 S. C. R. 1140, considered.
 There is nothing which prevents the undertaking of an inquiry against one person when an inquiry is pending against different persons with reference to the same offence.
