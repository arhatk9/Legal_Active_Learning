 The appellant joined service as a clerk in the erstwhile Patiala and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU) on 2nd Sept. 1949 Being a temporary employee. he was discharged from service on 30th September 1953. On 22nd February, 1954, he was again recruited as a clerk and later on promoted as senior clerk. The PEPSU government sanctioned condonation of break from Oct. 1, 1953 to Feb. 21, 1954 in the service of the appellant under Note to sub-para (iii) of para 3 Annexure B' of the Pepsu Civil Services (Temporary Service) Rules, 1955 for the purpose of issuing quasi-permanent Certificate only. On the reorganisation of Punjab State in 1966 the appellant came to be allocated to Punjab State. On 20th August. 1975 the Deputy Commissioner of Bhatinda, in exercise of the power conferred by Rule 3(1) (a) of the Punjab Civil Services (Premature Retirement) Rules, 1975 passed an order prematurely retiring the appellant from service on tho Ground that he had completed more than 25 years of service. The appellant challenged the said order before the High Court on the ground (i) That he could not have been retired under Rule 3(1) as he had not completed 2 S years of service; and (ii) that the impugned order of premature retirement suffered from the vice of non- application of mind inasmuch as it did not state that the power of prematurely retiring the appellant was exercised in public interest. The respondent contended (i) that the appellant had completed more than 25 years of service because the break in service was condoned by the PEPSU Govt;
 and (ii) that the power of prematurely retiring tho appellant was exercised in public interest. The High Court dismissed the Writ Petition holding that once The break in service was condoned, the appellant had completed 25 years of service and therefore the pre-requisite for exercise of power under Rule 3(1) (a) was satisfied.
 The appellant contended before this court (1) that the order sanctioning the condonation of break in service of the appellant was for 1041 the limited purpose of granting quasi-permanent status and issuing quasi-permanent certificate only and that the condonation of break in service did not qualify for pension as observed by the Accountant General of Punjab in his memo addressed to the S.D.O. Bhatinda and therefore the High Court was in error in holding that the appellant had put in 25 years of qualifying service on the date of the impugned order; and (ii) the order suffers from tho vice of complete non-application of mind in as much as in the impugned order there is not the slightest whisper that the power was exercised in public interest.
 Allowing the appeal by the appellant, ^ 
 HELD; (1) Rule 3(1) (a) of the Premature Retirement Rules confers power on the appropriate authority to retire any employee, if it is of the opinion that it is in the public interest to do so, on the date on which he completes 25 years of qualifying service or attained 50 years of stage. Therefore, the appropriate authority must first male up its mind that it is in public interest to retire the employee Once having reached that satisfaction, it must further find out whether the concerned employee has on the relevant date completed 25 years of qualifying service or whether he has attained the age of 50 years. In the former case it is not 25 years of service but it is 25 years of qualifying service which must have been completed on the date of premature retirement. The power can be exercised on the date on which one of the two alternative fact situation becomes available or on any date thereafter. The expression 'qualifying service' has been defined in rule 2(3) of the Premature Retirement Rules to mean 'service qualifying for pension'. Condition No. 2 in para 4.23 of Chapter IV of the Punjab Civil Services Rules, which deal with condonation of interruption or break in service while computing qualifying service for pension, provides that interruption in service may be condoned if amongst others, service preceding the interruption is not less than five years. [1046D-F; 1047A] Sub para (iii) of para 3, Annexure of Pepsu Civil Services (Temporary Service) Rules, 1955 provides that before a certificate of quasi-permanent capacity can be issued, the Government servant should have on the crucial date rendered service for more than three years. Note appended to the para provides that broken periods of temporary service will not count for purposes of this instruction unless the breaks are condoned specifically by the Government in consultation with the Finance Department and the service thus rendered continues. It further provides that while condoning break in service for the purpose of issuing quasi-permanent capacity certificate, it should be made clear to the persons concerned that the condonation will not entitle them to any benefits regarding the fixation of pay, seniority, pension, gratuity etc. and that the periods condoned will be ignored and not counted as service actually rendered. [1049D-E] (2) It thus becomes crystal clear that the certificate issued by Rajpramukh under the PEPSU Civil Services (Temporary Service) Rules, 1955 condoning break in service was for the limited purpose of issuing quasi-permanent capacity certificate. Not only that the codonation was for this 1042 limited purpose but the negative is clearly spell out when it is specifically provided that the condonation will not enable a person in whose favour the certificate is issued to claim any pension or gratuity etc. In other words, the condonation will not render the earlier service if it is otherwise not includible in the computation of qualifying service to so claim it. For the purpose of computing qualifying service for pension the period for which there was interruption will remain a break in service and as the earlier service as provided by Para 4.23, condition No. 2, was for a period less than five years, the same cannot be taken into account for computing qualifying service Thus the conclusion is incapable that the qualifying service which the appellant is shown to have rendered commenced from February 22. 1954. Inevitably, therefore on August 20, 1975 he had not completed 25 years of qualifying service and therefore, the primary prerequisite for exercises of power is not satisfied and the appellant could not have been compulsory retired from service. The High Court unfortunately overlooked the basic requirement for exercise of power namely, completing 25 years of qualifying service and proceeded on the basis that rendering 25 years of service will permit exercise of power. There is a marked and not worthy distinction between service and qualifying service. [1049F-G & ; 1050A-C] (3) The impugned order merely recites that as the appellant has completed more than 25 years of service, he is retired from the service from tho date of the order. Silence about recital of public interest is both conspicuous and glaring probably as the power was exercised by an officer of the rank of Deputy Commissioner who was blissfully unaware of it. The argument of the respondent that the appropriate authority exercised the power to compulsorily retire the appellant in public interest in view of an entry made in the annual confidential report of the appellant for the year 1971-72 that his conduct was unsatisfactory and his integrity was doubtful, is not convincing for two reasons:
 (i) that no record was placed before the Court to show as to whether the adverse entry was ever communicated to the appellant; and (ii) his record previous and subsequent to the year 1971-72 was not placed before us. Therefore, the impugned order also suffers from the vice of non-application of mind. Accordingly, tho impugned order compulsorily retiring the appellant from service is illegal and invalid and must be quashed and set aside. [1050F, G, 1051A-D]
