 The theatre tax imposed by Nagar Mahapalika, Allahabad was challenged before the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. A Single Judge of the High Court dismissed the writ petition. Appeal against the judgment of the Single Judge was dismissed by a Division Bench, which was reported as Niranjan Lal Bhargava Trust, Allahabad v.
 State of U.P. & others, (1972) All. L.J. 279.
 Petitioner No.6 challenged the initial imposition of theatre tax by filing a civil suit in the court of Civil Judge, which was dismissed. A Single Judge of the High Court, following the judgment in Niranjan Lal Bhargava 705 Trust case, dismissed the second appeal filed by him.
 About 20 days after the dismissal of the regular second appeal by the High Court, the petitioners filed a Write Petition No.3512/76 in the High Court challenging the imposition of theatre tax. The said petition is still pending before the High Court.
 The petitioners - the cinema owners/lessees in these Writ petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution of India challenged the imposition of theatre tax by the Respondent- Nagar Mahapalika, Lucknow, contending that Section 172(2) of the Act was unconstitutional because the legislature abdicate its function by delegating the essential legislative powers upon the Nagar palikas to levy all or any of the taxes enumerated in the Section; that the classification of cinemas on the basis of annual rental value for the purpose of fixing the rate of tax was arbitrary and as such was violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India; and that the classification had no nexus with the objects sought to be achieved.
 Dismissing the writ petitions of the cinema owners/lessesse, this Court, HELD : 1.01. The taxes under Section 172(2) of the U.P.
 Nagar Mahapalika Adhiniyam, 1959 can be levied by the Mahapalikas only for implementing those purposes and for no other purpose. The Mahapalikas have to provide special civic amenities at the places where cinemas/theatres are situated. So long as the tax has a reasonable relation to the purposes of the Act the same cannot be held to be arbitrary. The rate of tax to be levied and the persons or the class of persons liable to pay the same is determined by inviting objections, which are finally considered and decided by the State Government. [709 F-H] 1.02. The tax is levied in accordance with the statutory rules framed by the State Government and the said rules are laid before each House of the State Legislature for not less than 14 days and are subject to such modifications as the legislature may make during the session they are so laid.

 Municipal Corporation of the City of Poona, [1959] Supp. 2 S.C.R. 71, followed.
 1.03. The annual rental value under the Act indicate the extent of the 706 accommodation, its quality, the locality in which it is situated and other factors which relate to the enjoyment of the building. The theatre tax is levied as a tax on amusement and entertainment. The amusement in a building is affected by all those factors which are taken into consideration while fixing the annual rental value of the building. Higher rental value in relation to a cinema house shows that it has better accommodation, better situation and better facilities for amusement and entertainment. The higher annual value is indicative of a better quality cinema house, as compared to a cinema house, which has a lesser annual rental value. There is nothing unreasonable or improper in classifying the cinema houses on the basis of annual rental value. [710H-711B] The Western Indian Theatres Ltd. v. The Cantonment Board, Poona Cantonment,, [1959] Supp (2) S.C. R. 63 followed.
