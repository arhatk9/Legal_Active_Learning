 The document Ex. B-6 in so far as it related to the suit lands purported to be a kanam executed in favour of the predecessor-in-interest of the present appellants by the predecessors-in-interest of the present respondents. The document had a counter-part Ex. A-1. The suit was filed for the redemption of the kanam on payment of the mortgage debt. The appellants contended in defence that Ex. B-6 was not a mortgage deed but a lease and, therefore, there was no right to redeem. One of the incidents of the kanam as defined in s. 2(22) of the Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1964 was the "payment of michavaram or customary dues on renewal on the expiry of any specified period". Against the decision of the Kerala High Court in favour of the plaintiffs- respondents, the present appeal was filed by special leave.
 The only question for consideration was whether the appellants were protected against eviction by reason of their contention that Ex. B-6 created a tenancy. The decision of this question depended upon the further consideration whether the provision in Ex. B-6 for payment of land revenue for properties by the appellants amounted in law to a stipulation as rent or michavaran to the landowner.
 
 HELD : (1) The mere description of the deed as kanam will not be decisive of the essence of the transaction. The description of the deed by itself, isolated from the terms and provisions may be misleading or a misnomerq. The circumstances and the conduct of the parties are always a very useful guide in ascertaining the true character of the transaction.
 [587 B-C; E] (2) The first and foremost element to be found for a lease is whether there is the intrinsic intention in the written document for enjoyment of the property by the transferee in lieu of rent or perquisites. Secondly the term of renewal of the enjoyment would indicate the features of a lease.
 Thirdly it has to be found out whether there is any provision for payment .of customary dues. [587 R; 588 Al The dominant feature of the mortgage transaction on the other hand will be ascertainment of the ratio of the value of land to the amount advanced. It the ratio of the amount advanced bears a substantial proportion to the value of the property transferred it would be a strong piece of intention and circumstance to indicate loan and a mortgage. The provision entitling the transferee to ask for a return of money by sale of the property would be a very important feature to indicate that the transaction is a loan and a mortgage and not a lease. The absence of such a provision, however would not totally repel the transaction to be a mortgage. The execution of counter-part is sometimes a common feature in the case of possessory mortgage though the existence of a counter-part by itself will not be conclusive of the question. [588 B-D] 583 (3) The High Court correctly held that a mere direction to pay therevenue of the property by the grantee particularly when no payment is stipulated to be made to the grantor or when the payment is not directed to be made out of anything which is due or payable to the grantor, cannot be considered as a payment or rent or michavaran to the grantor. [588 G] (4) In the present case the features which favoured the construction of the transaction to be a mortgage and not a lease were; first there was no provision for renewal;
 secondly there was no provision for payment of customary dues; thirdly the property was to be enjoyed by the defendants. by way of interest on their advance after payment of land tax to the State; fourthly the payment of land tax was not a deduction from rent or perquisites;
 fifthly there was a provision for surrendering the property with a registered release at the cost of the transferee on the receipt of the consideration of kanam and the balance amount; sixthly when the consideration was paid back the counter-pattam deeds and prior deeds would he returned;, and finally there was liability to pay interest on the advance and possession and enjoyment of the property was in lieu of interest. The proportion of the amount advanced under Ex.
 B-6 to the value of the property was also, substantial [589 E-G-, A-C] Parameswaran Embranthiri v. Narasimha Nambudri, [1962] K.L.T. 404, Sankunni Variar & Ors. v.
