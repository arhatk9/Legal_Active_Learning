 The Bombay Agricultural Produce Markets Act (22 of 1939) was, enacted by the Provincial Legislature of Bombay and under the said Act the Bombay Agricultural Produce Market Rules, 1941 were framed. By a notification issued under the Act, the whole area within a radius of 12 miles of Ahmedabad City was declared in respect of certain agricultural produce, a market area for the purposes of the Act. A market yard and a market proper were also established for transactions in specified commodities. Under the Bombay Reorganisation Act 11 of 1960 which became operative as from May 1, 1960 two States-Maharashtra and Gujarat were carved out of the territory of the former State of Bombay and the town of Ahmedabad was included within the State of Gujarat, but Bombay Act 22 of 1939 continued for the time being to remain applicable to the Gujarat region by virtue of s. 87 of Act 11 of 1960. Subsequently the Gujarat Agricultural Produce Markets Act 20 of 1964 was passed but under s. 64 of the Act the Bombay Agricultural Produce Market Rules, 1941 remained in operation. The petitioner filed a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution seeking a declaration that Gujarat Act 20 of 1964 was illegal, ultra vires, unconstitutional and violative of Arts. 14, 19 and 31 of the Constitution of India and therefore null and void and that the rules framed thereunder (being the Bombay Agricultural Produce Market Rules, 1941) were also ultra vires, unconstitutional, illegal, null and void. He prayed for a writ of mandamus forbidding the State of Gujarat from enforcing any of the provisions of the Act and the Rules.
 The following grounds were urged in support of the petition : (1) The powers conferred by ss. 5 and 6 of the Act were unfettered, wide and unguided and on that account the fundamental rights of the petitioner were infringed. (2) Retail sales which were not regulated by the provisions of the earlier Act were sought to be regulated by Gujarat Act 20 of 1964. (3) Retail trade was completely prohibited by the Act and the prohibition amounted to an unreasonable restriction upon the fundamental rights of the petitioner.
 (4) Section 30 of the Act gave wide powers to evict a person carrying on business without a licence from the market area.
 (5) Section 27(2) not having provided the maximum licence fee chargeable was illegal. (6) The market committee had no power to function as it was not constituted according to law. The period of office of the old committee which was to function for three years under Bombay Act 22 of 1939 had expired in 1961 but the committee continued to function and no fresh elections were held. (7) The rules pursuant to which the market committee was constituted and functioned not having been placed before the Legislature in the first meeting after the rules were promulgated under Act 22 of 1939 as required by that Act, the rules were unauthorised and so there was complete absence of machinery for enforcement of the Act. Despite the suspension of Art. 19 by virtue 506 of the operation of Art. 358 of the Constitution in the state of Emergency declared by the President in December 1962, the Court decided the petition on merits because breach of fundamental rights under Arts. 14 and 31 was also alleged.
 
HELD: (i) The object of the Act being to ameliorate the condition of agriculturists and to do away with middlemen, who, it is a matter of common knowledge, make large and unconscionable profits out of the transactions carried out through them, declaration under s. 5, of intention to regulate trade in agricultural produce in a specified area, after hearing the objections and suggestions of interested parties, cannot be regarded as imposing unreasonable restrictions on the right to carry on trade. The preamble to the Act and the scheme of the Act clearly indicate that the powers conferred upon the Director are to be exercised for the purpose of regulating buying and selling of agricultural produce and for that purpose to establish markets for sale and purchase of agricultural produce. The powers under s. 6 are also to be exercised after giving an opportunity to persons interested to raise objections or to make suggestions as to the proposed introduction of control on sale and purchase of agricultural produce. The authority conferred upon the Director is not wide and arbitrary merely because no principles are indicated for guidance. [515 D-H] (ii) If regulation of trade in agricultural produce by the declaration of market area and imposition of restrictions may be regarded as reasonable when operating on the wholesale trade it would be difficult to hold that the identical restriction when operating on retail trade may be per se unreasonable.. [516 F] Mohan Hussain Gulam Mohammud and Anr. v, State of Bihar & Anr., [1961] INSC 206; [1962] 2 S.C.R. 659, referred to.
 (iii) Apart from the generality of the provisions made in the Gujarat Act and the omission of retail sales from the scheme of exclusion, the Act and the rules clearly indicate that retail sales are not sought to be regulated by the provisions of the Act. It was rightly conceded on behalf ,of the State that the Act read together with the rules does not purport to place any restriction upon retail transactions in agricultural produce. Therefore no licence is required under the Act for carrying on retail trade in Agricultural produce in the market area, and there is no prohibition against the carrying on of retail sale in agricultural produce in the market area. [518 C-D] (iv) Section 30 of the Act authorises the eviction from the market of any person found to be operating in the market without holding a valid licence. The power of eviction by the market committee is limited to eviction from the precincts of the market. The provision is apparently enacted for the purpose of imposing an additional penalty against infraction of the prohibition contained in s. 6(2).
 'Operating in the market area' can in the context only mean using a place in the market area for the purchase or sale of agricultural produce specified in the notification under s.
 6(2) otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The apprehension of the petitioner that a person infringing the regulatory provisions of the Act may be compelled to leave his hearth and home at the instance of the market authorities, was totally unfounded. [518 H-519 C] (v) In terms s. 27(2) provides that the licences may be granted in such forms for such periods, on such terms and conditions and restrictions as may be prescribed or determined by the bye-laws and on payment of fees determined by the market committee within such maxima as may be prescribed,. This clearly contemplated fixation of maxima by the rules 507 made under s. 59. Therefore the suggestion that s. 27(2) not having provided the maximum licence fee chargeable was illegal, could not be accepted. (519 D] (vi) The life of the market committee elected in 1958 was validly extended from time to time by legal enactments or steps taken thereunder. Finally by virtue of s. 64 of Act 20 of 1964 the market committee established under the earlier Act was deemed to be a market committee established under the new Act and members of the market committee holding office immediately before the commencement of the new Act continued to hold office under the new Act. The contention that there was no legally constituted market committee had therefore no force. [521 D] (vii) Section 26(5) of Bombay Act 22 of 1959 does not prescribe that the rules acquired validity only from the date on which they were placed before the Houses of Legislature. The rules are valid from the date on which they are made under s. 26(1). Failure to place the rules before the Houses of Legislature does not affect the validity of the rules. Having regard to the purposes for which it is made and in the context in Which it occurs, s.
 26(5) cannot be regarded as mandatory. The rules had been in operation since the year 1941 and by virtue of s. 64 of the Gujarat Act 20 of 1964 they continued to remain in operation. [522 B-D]
