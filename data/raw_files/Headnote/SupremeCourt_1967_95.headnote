 The appellant, which was a private limited company, was formed and registered under the Indian Companies Act, 1913, on 8th November, 1951. The erection and construction of its factory was completed in December 1953 and production commenced from 1-1-1954. On the question-whether the company was established on 8th November, 1951, the date of its incorporation and was therefore liable to pay wealth tax for the assessment years 1957-58, 1958-59 and 1959-60, on the basis that the exemption from payment of wealth tax under the proviso to s. 45d) was only for five successive assessment years commencing with the assessment year next following the date on which the company was established.
 
HELD : A comparison of clauses (d) and (f) of s. 45 shows that the word "established" in cl. (d) and its proviso, does not mean "incorporated". The word "established" has the same meaning it has in s. 5(1) (xxi) of the Act, namely, that the Company has been put into such a shape that it can start functioning as a business or a manufacturing Organisation. So construed, the appellant was established within s. 45(d) only in December, 1953, or 1st January 1954, and the five assessment years next following would be 1954- 55, 1955-56, 1956-57, 1957-58 and 1958-59. Therefore, the appellant would be entitled to exemption for the assessment years 1957-58 and 1958-59 but not for 1959-60. [451F; 452D- E; 453B-C] Commissioner of Wealth Tax, Madras v.
