 The petitioner's son was detained under s. 3(1) of the COFEPOSA Act, 1974 pursuant to a detention order passed on March 31, 1986. He was found in possession of a large quan- tity of contraband goods worth over Rs. 21 lacs, hidden in his premises, which he had brought from Hongkong.
 On April 29, 1986, before the Advisory Board the detenu wanted to prove that the premises in which the contraband goods were found was not in his possession and in support thereof he wanted to examine five witnesses, who were present when the matter was being heard by the Advisory Board. The Board declined to examine the witnesses, but permitted the detenu to produce their affidavits. Since it was net possible to secure the affidavits, on the next hearing date, an application was made for their examination, but the Board decline this request and forwarded its pro- ceedings to the Central Government who confirmed the deten- tion order.
 The detenu filed a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution challenging the detention order. The High Court dismissed the petition holding that the witnesses were not required under the law to be subjected to crossexamination, that the Advisory Board was right in suggesting to file the affidavits of the witnesses, that the plea that the witness- es declined to file their affidavits was flimsy and without any valid reason, that the plea that evidence in the shape of affidavits is an inferior type of evidence hardly de- serves any worthwhile consideration, that if on perusal of the affidavits the Advisory Board considered to call any of the deponents it could have been done and that it cannot be said that the detenu was deprived of his right of defence before the Advisory Board.
 In the Special Leave Petition and the Writ Petition before this Court on behalf of the detenu it was contended (i) that the Advisory Board acted in violation of law in denying the detenu his right to examine witnesses in rebut- tal, who were readily available and present on the dates of hearing; (ii)that the 426 Advisory Board was bound under law to send the entire re- cords of the proceedings to the Central Government for applying its mind before making the order of confirmation;
 and (iii)that the Central Government, in this case, was not informed about the presence of five witnesses before the Advisory Board, ready to be examined and the Board's refusal to record their evidence.
 Allowing the petitions, the Court, 
 HELD: 1. The Advisory Board committed an error in law in denying to the detenu the fight to examine the witnesses, rendering his continued detention bad. The detention order is quashed, the judgment of the High Court set aside and the detenu directed to be released forthwith. [434 E-F] 
 2. The "trinity of rights" available to the detenu before the Advisory Board are: (i) the fight of legal repre- sentation; (ii)the right of crossexamination; and (iii)the right to present his evidence in rebuttal. [429 E-F] 
 3. The law recognises the right in a detenu to lead evidence in rebuttal of the allegation against him before the Advisory Board. All that is necessary is that the detenu should keep the witnesses ready for examination at the appointed time. There is no obligation cast on the Advisory Board to summon them. The Advisory Board is competent to regulate its own procedure within the constraints of the Constitution and the statute and this procedure is referable to the time limit within which the Advisory Board must complete its inquiry. [430 D-E] 
 4. The right to adduce oral evidence by examining wit- nesses is a right available to a detenu under the decision of this Court in A. K. Roy's case [1981] INSC 209; 1982, 2 S.C.R. 272 and this should be deemed to be incorporated in the statute dealing with detention without trial. Therefore, the right in a detenu to adduce oral evidence in rebuttal being a right in the nature of Constitutional safeguard embodied in Article 22(5) of the Constitution as construed by this Court in A.K. Roy's case (supra) has necessarily to be read into section 8(b) and (c) of the COFEPOSA Act. If this right is denied to a detenu, the necessary consequence must follow.
 [430 G, 431C] A.K. Roy v. Union of India, [1981] INSC 209; [1982] 2 S.C.R. 272 and Narendra Purshotam Umrao v. B.B. Gujral& Ors., [1978] INSC 230; [1979] 2 S.C.C. 637, followed.
 
 5. Article 22(7)(e) enables Parliament to prescribe by law the procedure to be followed by an Advisory Board in an inquiry under Article 22(4)(a). Section 8 of the COFEPOSA Act is sequel to this prescription. There is nothing in s. 8 prohibiting oral evidence of witnesses tendered by a detenu being taken. The 427 concept of inquiry by the Advisory Board takes within its ambit this aspect of 'hearing' also. [431 D] 
 6. The High Court was wrong in saying that the witnesses were not required under law to be subjected to cross-exami- nation "admittedly". This Court has only laid down that witnesses on behalf of the detaining authority cannot be cross-examined by the detenu. It has nowhere been held that the witnesses on behalf of the detenu produced in rebuttal of the allegation against him cannot be cross-examined.
 Cross-examination of such witnesses has to be by the detain- ing authority and that right cannot be denied to them.
 
 7. Unless there is any legal bar for oral evidence of the detenu being adduced before 'the Advisory Board it should be left to the detenu to choose between affidavit evidence and oral evidence subject of course to the rigorous limitation placed upon this right relating to constraints of time [433 C] 
 8. In the instant case in deying the right to examine witnesses present before the Advisory Board, the Board acted in violation of the law. [433 D] 
 9. The complaint that the report of the Advisory Board did not contain all the necessary information regarding the availability of the witnesses on 29.4.1986 and 1.5.1986, the readiness of the detenu to examine them, rejection of the requests to examine them and directing instead filing of the affidavits cannot be said to be wholly unjustified. [434 D] 
 10. The Central Government is under an obligation to apply its mind to the entire material before Confirming the order of detention.
