 The first appellant's second wife died of burn injuries sustained by her. The first appellant and his son from his first wife were tried for the murder of the deceased and also for subjecting her to cruelty. The trial court convicted both of the them under section 302 and 498-A read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code on the basis of the dying declaration made by the deceased before the Judicial Magistrate. The High Court, on appeal, maintained their conviction and sentence under Section 302 read with Section 34 Indian Penal Code but acquitted them of the offence under Section 198-A read with Section 34.
 In the appeal, by special leave, on behalf of the appellants-accused it was contended that the statement made by the deceased before the doctor, who had admitted her in the hospital, giving cause of her death as burn injuries sustained by her while cooking food on gas stove was the earliest version and amounted to a dying declaration, and there being two contradictory statements made by the deceased, the dying declaration recorded by the magistrate was not worthy of credit and conviction of the appellants could not be based on it.
 Dismissing the appeal, this Court, 
 HELD : 1.1. The conviction of the appellants is based on the dying declaration made by the deceased in the hospital before a Judicial Magistrate. The doctor certified that the patient remained conscious 911 during the period her statement was recorded. The Judicial Magistrate recorded a certificate that the statement of the deceased was recorded by him and it contained true version of her statement and she had thumb marked the same. In view of the doctor's certificate, there is no infirmity in the recording of the dying declaration by the magistrate and the same inspires confidence. [912 C-D] 
 1.2 It was the first appellant who brought his wife, deceased, to the hospital and he remained present while the deceased was examined by the doctor. It is nowhere mentioned in the record that what was recorded by the doctor was stated by the deceased. Therefore, what was recorded by the doctor could not be the version of deceased herself. Had it been so, the doctor may not have used the word "alleged" while recording that the patient received injuries while cooking food in gas-stove. The doctor, did not mention anywhere of the record about the state of mind of the deceased, whether she was conscious or not. It is more probable that what was recorded by the doctor was at the instance of the husband who was accompanying his wife at the time of her examination by him. Therefore, the courts below have rightly rejected the defence plea that what was recorded by the doctor was at the instance of the deceased.
 The trial court has also rightly rejected the evidence of defence witnesses. There is no infirmity in the judgments of the courts below. [1912 G-H, 913 A-C]
