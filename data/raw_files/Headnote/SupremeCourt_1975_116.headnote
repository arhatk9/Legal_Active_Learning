 The suit land was acquired under the Land Acquisition Act.
 The Land Acquisition Officer awarded Rs. 800 per ground as compensation. The City Civil Court awarded at the rate of Rs. 1000/- per ground. The High Court on appeal awarded Rs.
 1800 per ground. The appellant himself purchased the suit land about 10 months before the notification under s. 4 was made at a price of Rs. 410 per ground. The appellant spent a little money on filling up the pond.
 
HELD : Dismissing the appeal, This Court interferes with the judgment of the High Court only if the High Court applies a principle wrongly or because some important point affecting valuation has been overlooked or misapplied. A court of appeal interferes not when the judgment under attack is not right, but only when it is shown to be wrong. [404 E-FG] 
HELD FURTHER-Market value is what a willing purchaser will pay a willing vendor. The best evidence of the value of property is the sale of the very property to which the claimant is a party. If the sale was long ago, the Court would examine more recent sales of comparable lands a,% throwing better light on current land value. In the present case, the appellant himself purchased the land at the rate of Rs. 410 per ground. [404 H. 405 A.B] 
HELD-There is no error in principle in the High Court judgment nor has any of the limited grounds on which these Court's jurisdiction can be legitimately exercised been made out. [408-CD]
