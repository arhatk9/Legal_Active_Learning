 The appellant, a Railway contractor, having Refreshment Rooms and Tea stalls at various stations, was registered as a dealer under the Bihar Sales Tax Act 1947. He being aggrieved by the assessment for the year 1950-51 made by the sales Tax officer took the usual appeals to the Sales Tax Authorities and after the appeals were rejected he took a revision under s. 24 of the Act before the Board of Revenue Bihar which was dismissed. He then applied under s. 25 of the Act to refer six questions of law to the High Court.
 The Board referred only one question to the High Court. The High Court after reframing the question answered it in the negative against him. Against the order of the Board of Revenue the appellant brought an appeal by special leave to the Supreme Court but he did not appeal against the judgment and order of the High Court.
