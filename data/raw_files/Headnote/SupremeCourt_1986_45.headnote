 The respondent, a private company under the Companies Act, 1956 in C.A. 1533 of 1974, had shares in two private companies. during the relevant period, it sold those shares and according to the respondent-assessee, the sales resulted in a loss. The shares were not quoted in stock market.
 However, the Income tax Officer held that the break-up value on the date of files of the shares in the two companies was Rs.1,72,800 and Rs.1,54,000 and after deducting the cost price of the aforesaid shares of Rs.81,201 and Rs.1,00,000 respectively from the above said break-up value, he determined the capital gain at Rs.91,599 and Rs.54,000 respectively under the first proviso to section 12-B(2) of the 1922 Act. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner as also the Tribunal rejected the appeals of the respondent-assessee and upheld the order of the Income tax Officer.
 Aggrieved by the order of the Tribunal, the respondent assessee went to the High Court in a reference. The High Court allowed the reference holding that the first proviso to subsection (2) of section 12-B of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 was not applicable. It observed : (i) that the sale was true; (ii) that the consideration was not understated; and (iii) that the explanation given by the assessee for effecting the sale was not acceptable. The same question of law arose in the other civil appeals.
 Dismissing the appeals, 882 ^ 
 HELD : 1.1 The proviso to section 12B(l) of the Act can be invoked only where the consideration for the transfer of capital asset has been understated by the assessee. The first proviso to section 12B(1) of the Act provides 'full value of the confederation for which the sale, exchange, relinquishment of transfer is made', to be taken as the basis for the computation of the capital gains. Therefore, unless there is evidence that more than what was stated was received, no higher price can be taken to be the basis for computation of capital gains. The onus is on the Revenue - inferences might be drawn in certain cases but to come to a conclusion that a particular higher amount was in fact received must be based on such material from which such an irresistible conclusion follows. The proviso helps or enables the department by providing a way to determine the market value. But the proviso is applicable only where the full value for the consideration has not been stated. [889 G-H] 
 1.2 When a conclusion of the fact finding body is based on an inference from primary facts, then the findings of facts are not amenable to challenge but the inference drawn from the primary facts are open to challenge as conclusions of law. It is also open to challenge the same on the ground that the conclusion of fact drawn by the Tribunal was not supported by legal evidence or that the impugned conclusion drawn from the fact was not rationally possible. In such a case, it is necessary to examine the correctness of the conclusion. [886 H; 887 A-B] Commissioner of Income-tax v. Rajasthan Mines. 78 I.T.R. 45, relied upon.
 In the instant case, the facts found were that there was d sale. The High Court has stated that the Tribunal had found that the consideration was not understated. The High Court also notices that the explanation given by the assessee for effecting the sale was not acceptable. The onus was on the Revenue to prove that there was understatement in the document not that the goods were sold at under value.
 There is no evidence that the full consideration received by the assessee in the transfer of the asset involved in these cases has been understated. The revenue has made no attempt to establish that there was any under-statement though it might be that sharee were sold at an under value. [888 B-D] 883 K.P. Verghese v. Income-tax Officer, Ernakulam & Anr., 131 I.T.R. 597, followed.
 2. Understatement of value is a mis-statement of value.
 Selling goods at an undervalue to defeat Revenue is different from understanding the value in the document of sale. [888 D] In the instant case, there is no evidence direct or inferential that the consideration actually received by the aesessee was more than what was disclosed or declared by him [888 F] Capital gd ns was intended to tax the gains of an assescee, not what an assessee might have gained. What is not gained cannot be commuted as gained. All laws fiscal or otherwise must be both reasonably and justly interpreted whenever possible. Capital gains tax is not a tax on what might have been received or could have taxed. [889 L]
