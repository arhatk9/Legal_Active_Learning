 The appellant was tried by the Magistrate of the First Class for offences under ss. 170, 342 and 392 of the Indian Penal Code and was acquitted. On appeal, the High Court set aside the acquittal, and in respect of the offence under s. 392, sentenced him to 4 years R.I.
 In his appeal to this Court,, the appellant contended that if the Magistrate had convicted him be could not have passed a sentence exceeding 2 years for the offence under s. 392 by virtue of s. 32 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and therefore, the High Court was incompetent to pass the sentence of 4 years.
 
HELD: As an appellate court is not competent to impose a punishment higher than the maximum that could have been imposed by the trial court, the High Court was in error in sentencing the appellant to undergo imprisonment in respect of the offence under s. 392 for a period exceeding 2 years.
 [826 G; 827 C] An appellate Court is a "court of error", that is, a court established for correcting an error. If, while purporting to correct an error, the appellate court were to do something which was beyond the competence of the trial court, it could not be said to be correcting an error of the trial court. Therefore, the power of the appellate court to pass a sentence must be measured by the power of the court from whose judgment an appeal has been brought before it.
