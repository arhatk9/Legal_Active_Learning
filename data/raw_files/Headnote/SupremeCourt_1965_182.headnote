 The appellant was Head. Warder in Rajasthan and in the permanent service of the State. On April 14, 1950 he proceeded on leave for two months. He later asked for extensions of the leave on medical grounds. He was due to join on August 13, 1950; his request for leave beyond that date was refused. Thereafter he made further applications for leave, the last of them supported by a medical.
 certificate. To his last and some of the earlier applications be received no reply but on November 8, 1950, he received a communication from the Deputy Inspector General of Prisons that he was discharged from service from August 13, 1950. Departmental remedies having failed he filed a suit challenging his removal from service. The trial court decided against him and the first appellate court in his favour. The High Court however restored the order of the trial court whereupon the appellate came to this Court by special leave.
 It was contended on behalf of the appellant that in not giving him any notice before terminating his services the State Government had acted in contravention of Art. 311 of the Constitution. On behalf of the respondent State reliance was placed on Regulation 13 of the Jodhpur Service Regulations which laid down that an Individual who absented himself without permission for one month or long after the end of his leave would be considered as having sacrificed his appointment and could only be reinstated with the sanction of the competent authority. On the basis of this Regulation it was contended that the appellant's appointment bid terminated automatically and no question of his removal from service attracting the provisions of Art. 311 arose.
 
HELD : The constitutional protection given to Government employees by Art. 311 cannot be taken away in this manner by a side wind. Regulation 13 no doubt speaks of reinstatement but it really comes to this that a person will not be reinstated if he is ordered to be discharged or removed from service. The question of reinstatement can only be considered if it is first considered whether the person should be removed or discharged from service. Whichever way one looks at the matter, the order of the Government involves a termination of the service when the incumbent is willing to serve. [828 G; 829 C-D] The Regulation involves a punishment for over-staying one's leave and the burden is thrown on. the incumbent to secure reinstatement by showing cause. It may be convenient to describe him as seeking reinstatement but this is not tantamount to saving that because the person will only be reinstated by an appropriate authority that the removal is automatic and outside the protection of Art. 311. A removal is removal and if it is punishment for overstaying one's leave an opportunity must be given to 826 the person against whom such an order is proposed, no matter how the Regulation describes it. To give no opportunity is to go against Arc. 311. [829 E-G] The appellant was entitled to a declaration that his removal from service was illegal.
