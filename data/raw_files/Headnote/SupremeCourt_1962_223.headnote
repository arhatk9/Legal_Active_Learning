 The present appeal arises out of an industrial dispute between the appellant and the respondents. The Industrial Tribunal gave an award and the appellant filed an appeal to this Court by way of special leave.
 The main contention of the appellant was that no case bad been before the tribunal for the framing of a gratuity scheme. It was further urged that even if a gratuity scheme had to be framed the tribunal was in error in not placing any ceiling on the amount of gratuity payable to the employees. The third point raised was that one month's basic wages which had been provided by the scheme was excessive and it should be reduced to 15 days' basic wages.
 Held, that having regard to the financial position of the appellant the framing of the gratuity scheme was justified.
 As a general rule, where is no provision for superannuation and gratuity is, paid at a fairly reasonable rate a ceiling should be placed on the amount of gratuity payable under the scheme. Even though gratuity schemes framed in the same industry in the same region should not disclose radical or violent differences the rate of gratuity which should be awarded in'. a particular case will depend on the facts of that case.
