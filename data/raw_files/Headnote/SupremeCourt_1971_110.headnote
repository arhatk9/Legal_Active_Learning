 The appellant who was born on January 1,1910 entered the service of the former Indian State of Mayurbhanj in Orissa as an engineer on 1st November 1937. On the merger of that State with the Province of Orissa on January 1, 1949 he became an officer of the said province. 'The age of superannuation of Government employees in Orissa was then 55 years. On May 21, 1963 the Government of Orissa passed a resolution raising the age of compulsory retirement to 58 years with effect from December 1, 1962. The power of Government to retire an employee at the age of 55 years was however retained and so was the right of the employee to voluntarily retire at that age after giving requisite notice. The resolution aforesaid also stated that the above provision will be in addition to the provisions already contained in the Liberalised Pension Rules according to which Government could compulsorily retire an employee who had put in 30 years service, the employee also having a corresponding right to retire after the said period of service. On February 5, 1954 a notification was issued by the Government of Orissa laying down inter alia that in any case where Government had reasonable cause to believe that employee lacked integrity it would be appropriate to determine upon his retirement. On July 14, 1964 the appellant was asked to retire from Government service with effect from January 1, 1965. His representation for reconsideration was not accepted. His writ petition in the High Court was rejected. By certificate the appellant came to this Court contending (i) that in view of the Liberalised Pension Rules he could not be retired before he had completed 30 years of service, and (ii) that having regard to the criteria laid down by the notification dated February 5, 1964 the order of retirement cast a stigma on him and as such was violative of Art. 311 of the Constitution.
 
HELD: (i) Before May 21, 1963 an employee of the Government of Orissa would have been due for superannuation when he attained the age of 55 years whether he had or had not put in thirty years qualifying service. Government had before the said date an option to ask him to retire if he had completed 30 years qualifying service even though he had not reached the age of fifty five years; correspondingly the officer had the right to retire if he wanted to do so before he reached the age mentioned if he had 30 years' qualifying service to his credit. The resolution of May 21, 1963 raised the age of superannuation from 55 to 58 but nevertheless under paragraph 3 thereof the Government reserved to itself a right to ask any employee to retire when he attained the age of 55 years without assigning 3 53 any reason. Correspondingly the employee was not bound to continue in service beyond the age of fifty years unless he wanted it. There was no alteration in the rule under which a Government servant could voluntarily retire or be asked to retire in a case when he had completed thirty years' service. In other words, the right of Government to require an officer to retire at any time after he had completed 30 years' service was and still remained intact. This right which was not linked with the age of superannuation before May 1963 remained unaffected even after that date. Although the age of superannuation was raised from 55 to 58 years Government armed itself with the power to require any employee to retire when he attained the age of 55 years without assigning any reason. The petitioner's argument based on the fact that he had not completed 30 years' of service, must therefore, fail. [355H-356E] (ii) Since the age of superannuation fixed was not unaccountably early there was no violation of Art. 311(2).

 (iii) Nor was Art. 311 attracted by any aspersion or stigma cast on the appellant by the order dated July 14, 1964. Under paragraph 3 of the resolution of May 21, 1963 the Government had a right to require any Government servant to retire at the age of' 55 without assigning an reason.
 The fact that by notification of 5th February 1964 certain guidelines were indicated to the Heads of Departments in considering whether a Government servant should continue in service beyond the age of 55 years, one of the factors being lack of integrity, did not imply that any officer whose continuance in, service was not advised lacked integrity.
 On the facts of the case it could not be said that any aspersion .was cast on the appellant. [358F-G] The appeal must accordingly be dismissed.
