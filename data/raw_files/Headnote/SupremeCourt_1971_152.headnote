 The Madras Motor Vehicles (Taxation of Passengers and Goods) Act 1952 became applicable to the State of Andhra and subsequently to Andhra Pradesh when the respective reorganisation of States took place in 1953 and 1956. In 1959 the Andhra Pradesh legislature enacted the Motor Vehi- cles (Taxation of Passengers and Goods) Andhra Pradesh (Amendment) Act with a view to augmenting the revenue of the State. By this Act the rates in respect of state carriages as well as goods vehicles were increased. The Act came into force with effect from 8th May 1959. On 7th May 1959 by G.O. Ms. No. 1077 the State Transport Authority was directed by the Government to fix maximum fares inclusive of the leviable tax tinder the Act for the state carriages in the State of Andhra Pradesh. The 1959 amendment was struck down by the High Court. The legislature thereafter passed Act 34 of 1961 by validating the levy under the Act which had been struck down by the High Court and also for imposition of a surcharge. The operators again questioned the Amendment Act of 1961 on the ground that they had not collected the fares on the enhanced rates fixed by the Transport Authority because by the conditions of their permit they were precluded from collecting the fares at a rate higher than 7 1/2 pies or 4 NP per passenger per mile. In view of the fact that the Regional Transport Authorities had not taken action to modify that condition suitably they could not collect this amount and therefore were not liable to pay surcharge at enhanced rates. The High Court held that the directions issued by the Government in G.O. Ms. No. 1077 of 7th May 1959 pursuant to which the Regional Transport Authority by its proceedings dated 12th May 1959 called upon the Regional Transport Officers to notify the operators and which the said officers had notified authorising them to collect the enhanced fares was sufficient authorisation for them to collect the enhanced fares as if the fare tables had been amended. The operators appealed to this Court. The constitutionality of the surcharge having been upheld by this Court in Nazeeria Motor Service etc. etc. v. State of Andhra Pradesh & Anr., [1969] INSC 195; [1970] 2 S.C.R. 52, the only question that survived for consideration was whether there was any impediment preventing the operators from collecting the enhanced fares without the conditions of the permit being amended.
 
HELD: in view of the directions given by the Government in its notification under s. 43 the Regional Transport Authority called upon the Regional Transport Officers to notify the operators to collect the enhanced 817 fares and accordingly the officers concerned in compliance with these directions notified the operators. Once the provisions of section 43(1)(i) and 44(4) are complied with section 59(3) (c) comes into play and it has the effect of incorporating the maximum fares as notified including the tax leviable, as a condition of the permit. This being the legal position there was no justification for the contention that the collection by the operators of the enhanced fares without the table of fares being amended would entail the cancellation of the permits.
