 The appellant who was the landlord of certain premises in Ahmadabad, filed a suit against M for ejectment from the premises,and for an order for payment of rent.. The trial court dismissed the suit in appeal. The District Court passed a decree in ejectment and further appeals against that decision were rejected.
 In proceedings filed by the appellant for execution of the decree, M contended that the court of Small Causes which had tried the suit 'had no jurisdiction to entertain it as the suit premises were not governed by Bombay Act 57 of 1947.
 The court executing the decree rejected this contention.
 The order was confirmed by a Bench of the Court of Small Causes. The High Court of Gujarat in a petition filed by M under Article 227 of the Constitution, ordered that the petition for execution ,be dismissed.
 On appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The appeal must be allowed and the order of the Court of Small Causes restored.
 When a decree which is a nullity, for instance, where it is passed without bringing the legal representatives on the record of a person who Was dead at the date of the decree, or against a ruling prince without :a certificate, is sought to be executed an objection in that behalf may be raised in a proceeding for execution. Again, when the decree is made by a Court which has no inherent jurisdiction to make it, objection as to its validity may be raised in an execution proceeding if the objection appears on the face of the record : where the objection as to the jurisdiction of the Court to pass the decree does not appear on the face of the record and requires examination of the questions raised and decided at the trial or which could have been but have not been raised, the executing Court will have no jurisdiction to entertain an objection as to the validity of the decree even on the ground of absence of jurisdiction. [68 F] In the present case the question whether the Court of Small Causes had jurisdiction to entertain the suit against M depended upon the interpretation of the terms of the agreement of lease and the user to which the land was put at the date of the grant of the lease. These questions could not be permitted to be raised in an execution proceeding so as to displace the jurisdiction of the Court which passed the decree. [69 B] Jnanendra Mohan Bhaduri & Anr. v.
