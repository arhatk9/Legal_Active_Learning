 By Mysore Act 11 of 1961 which came into force on October 1, 1961 sugarcane was included at Serial No. 11-A in the Third Schedule to the Mysore Sales Tax Act, 1957. As a result of the amendment the appellants were subjected to levy of tax on purchase of sugarcane. Their writ petitions challenging the levy were dismissed by the High Court. In appeals by certificate the appellants contended before this Court that : (i) on account of the Central & State Control Orders applicable to the transactions there was no mutual assent by and between the appellants and the growers of sugarcane in regard to supply of sugarcane by the growers and the acceptance by the factories and therefore there was no purchase and sale of sugarcane-, (ii) the appellants were not dealers within the meaning of s. 2(k) of the Mysore Sales Tax Act; (iii) the levy of tax on purchase of sugarcane at different rates in different States was dis- criminatory and in violation of Art. 14.
 
HELD : (i) The decisions relating to 'compulsory sales' establish that statutory orders regulating the supply and distribution of goods by and between the parties under the Control Orders in a State do not absolutely impinge on the freedom to enter into contract. Legislative measures or statutory provisions fixing the price, delivery, supply, restricting areas for transactions are all within the realm of planning economic needs ensuring production and distribution of essential commodities and basic necessities of community. The recent trends in these legal rules delimit the variety of structure of rights and duties which individuals may create by such acts and transactions. The complexity of modern activities and the consequent difficulty of providing for every eventuality have shaken fervour for freedom of contract as there was during the nineteenth century. The economic environment has changed.
 The individual freedom is to be reconciled with adequate performance by the Government of its functions in a highly organised society. Delimiting areas for transactions or parties or denoting price for transaction are all within the area of individual freedom of contract with limited choice by reason of ensuring the greatest good for the greatest number by achieving proper supply at standard or fair prices to eliminate the evils of hoarding and scarcity on the one hand and availability on the other. [244 G-Z45 B] In the present case the Control Orders are to be kept in the forefront for appreciating the true character of transactions. It is apparent that the area is restricted.
 The parties are' determined by the order. The 229 minimum price is fixed. The minimum quantity of supply is also regulated. These features do not complete the picture.
 The entire transaction indicates that the parties agree to buy and sell. The parties choose the terms. of delivery..
 The parties have choice with regard to obtaining supply of a quantity higher than 95 per cent of the yield. The parties can stipulate for a price higher than the minimum. The parties can have terms for payment in advance as well in cash. A grower may not cultivate and there may not be any yield. A factory may be closed or wound up and may not buy sugarcane. A factory can reject goods after inspection.
 Inspection and appropriation of goods, which in the present case were unascertained goods indicates not only freedom in the formation but also in the performance of contracts. The combination of all these factors indicates that the parties entered into agreement with mutual assent and with volition for transfer of goods in consideration of price. [248 B-E;, 247 B] The transactions accordingly amounted to sales within the meaning of s. 2(t) of the Mysore Sales Tax Act.

 (ii) If a person carries on the business of buying or selling a commodity it is not necessary that he shall sell the same commodity to become a dealer. The commodity may be converted into another saleable commodity or it may be used as an ingredient in the manufacture of a commodity.
 Therefore, the factories which bought sugarcane could be said' to carry on the business of buying and selling sugarcane and the factories were 'dealer' within the meaning of s. 2(k) of the Mysore Sales Tax Act, [249 C] State of Andhra Pradesh v. Abdul Bakshi & Bros. [1964] INSC 114; A.I.R. 1965 S.C. 531, relied on.
 (iii) It was not disputed that all the factories in Mysore had been treated equally. Different rates of purchase tax in different States are applicable on various grounds. The quantity available, the conditions of agriculturists, the number of factories will all have distinctive features.
 Therefore there could be no infraction of Art. 14 of the Constitution.[249 E] (iv) In view of the decision of this Court in Tata Iron & Steel Co.'s case the appellants could not impeach the imposition and levy of sale tax on the ground that the appellants could not collect from the purchasers of sugar the purchase tax paid by the appellants on purchase of Sugarcane.
