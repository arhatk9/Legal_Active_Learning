 The appellant's land was acquired and the Land Acquisition Officer awarded compensation at the rate of Rs. 14/- per katha. The appellant applied for reference under s. 18 of the Land Acquisition Act and on 18-8-1961 the Additional District Judge held that he was entitled to compensation at Rs. 200/- per katha. The respondent State applied for review of the judgment under 0.47, r.1, C.P.C. On 26-9-1961 the Additional District Judge allowed the application for review and reduced the compensation to Rs. 75/- per katha.
 The respondent filed an appeal to the High Court purporting to be against both the decrees dated 18-8-1961 and 26-9-1961 but in fact was only against the latter, and the appellant filed a cross appeal challenging the maintainability of the review petition before the Additional District Judge. The High Court held that the Addl. District Judge was wrong in entertaining the review, but on merits the High Court dismissed the appeal of the respondent as well as the cross appeal of the appellant thereby maintaining the compensation awarded at the rate of Rs. 75/- per katha.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : It is well settled that the effect of allowing an application for review of a decree is to vacate the decree passed. When the respondent filed the appeal before the High Court it could not have filed an appeal against the decree dated 18-8-1961, because, that decree had already been superseded by the decree dated 26-9-1961 passed on review. So the appeal filed by the respondent before the High Court could only be an appeal against the decree passed on review. When the High Court held that the lower court was wrong in allowing the review it should have allowed the cross appeal. Since the decree passed on 18-8-1961 awarding compensation at the rate of Rs. 200 per katha had been revived and ,come into life again, and no appeal was preferred by the respondent against that decree, that decree had become final. [943 0-944 A-C] Per Krishna Iver. J :
 [While the appeal has to be allowed, Parliament may consider the wisdom of making the judge the ultimate guardian of justice by a comprehensive, though guardedly worded, provision where the hindrance to rightful relief relates to infirmities, even serious, sounding in procedural law. In the present case; almost every step a reasonable litigant could take was taken by the State to challenge the extraordinary increase in the rate of compensation awarded by the civil court but the omission to attack the increase awarded in the High Court resulted in procedural law dominating substantive rights and substantial justice.] [944 F-H]
