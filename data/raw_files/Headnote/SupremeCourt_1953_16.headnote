 The evidence on record did not establish the custom which had been pleaded, namely that among the community of dasis 940 (dancing girls) in South India a dasi daughter succeeded to her mother in preference to the married daughters; and in the absence of such custom, succession to a dasi must be governed by the rule of propinquity of Hindu law as a rule of justice, equity and good conscience and dasi daughters and married daughters would succeed to their mother's property in equal shares.
 A rule that degraded relations are preferential heirs to undegraded ones cannot be evolved merely on logical grounds the existence of such a rule can only be justified on the basis of established custom.
 Custom cannot be extended by analogy. It must be establish- ed inductively, not deductively, and it cannot be established by a priori methods. It cannot be a matter of mere theory but must always be a matter of fact and one custom cannot be deduced from another.

 The rule of Hindu law by which a maiden is a preferential heir to her married sisters does not apply to daughters who are admittedly married to an idol and lead a life of prostitution.
