 HEld, that a local custom of pre-emption exists in the city of Banaras and the right attaches at least to all house properties situated within it and no such incident of custom is proved which would make the right available only between persons who are either natives of Banaras or are domiciled therein.
 When a right of pre-emption rests upon custom it becomes the lex loci or the law of the place and affects all lands situated in that place irrespective of the religion or nationality or domicile of the owners of the lands except where such incidents are proved to be a part of the custom itself.
 The right of pre-emption is an incident of property and attaches to the land itself.
 Byjnath v. Kapilmon (24 W.R. 95) and Parsashth Nath v.
 Dhanai' (32 Cal. 988) disapproved.
