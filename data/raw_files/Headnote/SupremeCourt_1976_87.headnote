 Under section 12 of the U.P. Rent Act both the landlord and the tenant are required to intimate a vacancy to the District Magistrate, as and when a vacancy is deemed to have occurred in the circumstances specified therein. On the intimation of a vacancy, the District Magistrate may under section 16 pass either an order allotting the premises to a person specified by him or he can release the vacancy in favour of the landlord on being satisfied that he requires the premises for the purposes mentioned in section 16(2).
 Such an order can however be passed only after "ascertainment of vacancy" under Rule 8 of U.P. Rent Rules 1972, through the Rent Inspector and after "notifying the vacancy" by display on the notice board of the District Magistrate for a period of three days from the date of such notification.
 For the purposes of disposal of an application made by respondents 2 and 3 u/s 16(1) (b) of the Act for the "release" of certain residential premises of which the appellants claim to be their tenants, the District Magistrate passed an order on May 20th 1974 viz. "Let the vacancy be notified" admittedly without granting any hearing to the appellants, which the appellants challenged as violative of the principle of "Audi Alteram Partem" in the Allahabad High Court. The High Court, though it granted an interim stay, after show cause notice rejected the Writ Petition summarily with a brief speaking order on the ground that the petition was premature and that the proper remedy lay to them u/s 16(5) (a) of the Act for review of the order directing that the vacancy be notified. Aggrieved by the said order the appellants filed a petition for special leave in this Court. During its pendency, the respondent No. 1 issued a notice to the appellants that the release application filed by respondents 2 and 3 would be taken up for hearing on May 19th 1975 and on May 20th 1975 passed an order of release, after refusing to stay further proceedings. On May 30th 1975, the appellants filed an appeal against the release order to the District Judge Lucknow, who has stayed further proceedings and the appeal is pending. The question is whether the order dated May 20th 1974 was illegal for the reason that it was passed without affording a hearing to the appellants.
 Dismissing the appeals the Court, ^ 
 HELD : (1) A Study of the scheme of the Act and its provisions show the untenability of the contention as regards the illegality of the order passed by respondent No.
 
1. [945A] (ii) The Act does not provide for a hearing at the stage when the Distric Magistrate passes an order of allotment or release. [945-C] (iii) An order passed under rule 8(2) of the U.P. Rent Rules for "ascertainment of vacancy" is what is meant by "notifying the vacancy". The District Magistrate need not hear the parties before notifying the vacancy because under the scheme of the U.P. Rent Act an order notifying the vacancy does no injury and causes no prejudice to the interests of any party. A notification of the vacancy is a step-in-aid of an order of allotment or release and it is only when such an order of allotment or release is passed that the landlord or the tenant as the case may be have a grievance. Orders of allotment and release are in the first instance reviewable u/s 16(5)(a) by the District 943 Magistrate himself and an order passed u/s 16 is appealable u/s 18. The Act thus contemplates successive opportunities being afforded to persons whose interests are likely to be affected by an order passed by the District Magistrate.
 [945F-G, 946A, C] (iv) In the instant case, the Writ Petition was premature in the sense that the order impugned thereby did not affect the apellants' interest in the particular premises. The appellants have since filed an appeal against the order of release to the District Judge and that appeal is pending. That is the proper forum for adjudicating on the rival claims. [946E]
