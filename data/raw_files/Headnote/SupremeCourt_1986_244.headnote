 The writ petition, a sequel to the expeditious consider- ation of the bail application of two industrialists by this Court at a late night sitting on 5th September, 1986, solic- ited the same anxiety to permeate the attitude and inclina- tion of the Court in all matters where questions relating to the liberty of citizens arose, and required that the special leave petitions of small men against orders refusing ball must receive the same importance and should be taken up for consideration immediately.
 Disposing of the writ petition, the Court, 
 HELD: The Supreme Court should not ordinarily, save in exceptional cases, interfere with orders granting or refus- ing bail or anticipatory bail, because these are matters in which the High Court should normally be final arbiter. It should interfere only in the limited class of cases where there is a substantial question of law involved which needs to be finally laid at rest by it, or where there is grave, blatant and atrocious miscarriage of justice. [299 E, A] It is not correct to say that this Court is not giving to the small men the same treatment as it is giving to the big industrialists. Their special leave petitions are as much entitled to consideration as that of the industrial- ists. The Court has always regarded the poor and the disad- vantaged as entitled to preferential consideration than the rich and the affluent, the businessmen and the like. [298 A, 297 D] 296 The Court has evolved, as a matter of self discipline, certain norms to guide it in the exercise of its discretion in cases where special leave petitions are filed against orders granting or refusing bail or anticipatory bail. The question whether such petitions should be listed immediately or not is a question within the administrative jurisdiction of the Chief Justice and every such petitioner has an oppor- tunity of mentioning the case before him in that capacity for urgent listing and where a case deserves urgent listing he makes an appropriate order. [299 C, 298 BC] The Supreme Court was never intended to be a regular court of appeal against orders made by the High Court or the Sessions Court or the Magistrates. It was created as an apex court for the purpose of laying down the law for the entire country and extraordinary jurisdiction for granting special leave was conferred upon it under Article 136 of the Consti- tution so that it could interfere whenever it found that the law was not correctly enunciated by tower courts or tribu- nals and it was necessary to pronounce the correct law on the subject. This extraordinary jurisdiction could also be availed by the apex court for the purpose of correcting grave miscarriage of justice, but such cases would be excep- tional by their very nature. It is not every case where the apex court finds that some injustice has been done that it would grant special leave and interfere. That would be converting the apex court into a regular court of appeal and moreover by so doing it would soon be reduced to a position where it will find itself unable to remedy any injustice at all on account of the tremendous backlog of cases which is bound to accumulate. [298 D-F] It would be desirable to set up a National Court of Appeal which would be in a position to entertain appeals by special leave from the decisions of the High Courts and the Tribunals in the country in civil, criminal, revenue and labour cases and so far as the present apex court is con- cerned, it should concern itself only with entertaining cases involving questions of constitutional law and public law.
