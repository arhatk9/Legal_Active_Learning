 Where in a petition for transfer of criminal case, very serious allegations are made by the petitioner on affidavit which are not denied specifically by the other side this court must go by the affidavit filed by the petitioner. In proceedings of this kind, the court does not examine witnesses in support of allegations of fact made bay either side. Ordinarily, the court acts upon the affidavit of one aside or other, but if one side omits to make an affidavit in reply, the affidavit of the other side remains uncontroversial.
 Held, that where the petitioner, as in the present case, has by his affidavit made out a sufficient case from which it is possible for the court to infer that he reasonably entertains apprehension that he would not get justice in his case, the interests of justice demand that the case should be transferred outside the State.
