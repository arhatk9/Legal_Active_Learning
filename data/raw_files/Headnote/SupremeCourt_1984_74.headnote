 One Harnam Singh, father of the respondents, was owner of some agricultural land in the erstwhile Sind Province now forming part of Pakistan. After the partition of the country he along with his wife and three sons migrated to India. As displaced person, he lodged a claim on March 15, 1948 in respect of his entire holding on Pakistan. On the introduction of the Punjab Refugees (Registration of Land Claims) Act, 1948, on April 3, 1948 the said Harnam Singh, his sons and his wife filed separate claims alleging that in 1946 there was an oral partition of the land which originally belonged to Harnam Singh. The claims were verified and allotments were made in favour of each claimant. The Chief Settlement Commissioner rejected a reference from the department and by his order dated August 21, 1961 held the allotments to be valid. Apprehending that the claim of ownership of land in Sind and the partition between himself, his sons and his wife and the allotment of land was being re-examined, on March 13, 1962 Harnam Singh submitted a representation to the Government of India for issuing a direction under s. 33 of the Act that the matter be treated as finally settled. On this representation, Shri N. P. Dube, Joint Secretary to the Government of India, Department of Rehabilitation wrote a D. O. letter dated May 31, 1963 to Shri J. M. Tandon, Deputy Secretary to the Government of Punjab, Rehabilitation Department, saying, inter alia. "that there is no point in waiting any more and the matter should be finalised on the basis of the judicial findings arrived at in the case. We also feel that there are no reasons to differ from those judicial pronouncements at this stage. The record received from the Punjab Government is, therefore, returned with the request that the case may be finalised as mentioned above". It appears that the Managing Officer of the Rehabilitation Department, Punjab Government submitted a note to move the Central Government under s. 33 of the Act for reopening and cancellation of the order of the Chief Settlement Commissioner dated August 21, 1961. The reopen a notice was issued to the allotees calling upon them to show cause why the order of the Chief Settlement Commissioner dated August 21, 1961 should not be set aside and allotment in favour of each of them should 392 not be cancelled. The allotees contended that since the power of revision conferred by s. 33 of the Act had already been exercised by the Central Government, the same power of revision could not be repeatedly exercised particularly when no fresh material against the allotees was produced after the earlier decision. Ultimately a Joint Secretary to the Government of India exercising power of revision conferred by s. 33 by his order dated March 15, 1965 quashed and set aside the order of the Chief Settlement Commissioner dated August 21, 1961 and further directed that the allotment of land favour of Harbans Singh his sons and his wife be cancelled and that a fresh allotment be made on the footing that Harnam Singh alone was the owner of the land situated in Sind. The validity of the order dated March 15, 1965 of the Joint Secretary was challenged in the High Court by two sons of Harnam Singh, respondents in this appeal. Broadly agreeing with the view taken by a learned single Judge, a Division Bench while dismissing the Letters Patent appeal in the High Court, held that the D. O. Letter of the Joint Secretary dated May 31, 1963 conveyed the decision of the Government of India in exercise of powers under s. 33 and therefore, the power of revision against the order of the Chief Settlement Commissioner was exhausted because a quasi- judicial tribunal had no power to revise or review its earlier decision on merits even if the earlier decision was wrong on facts or law. Accordingly, the High Court held that the impugned order of the Government of India dated March 15, 1965 was without jurisdiction and was invalid and of no legal efficacy. Hence this appeal.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD : The contention that the power of revision cannot be repeatedly exercised and finality must attach to the orders would necessitate an examination in depth of the nature and extent of power conferred by section 33 of the Punjab Refugees (Registration of Claims) Act, 1948 which enables the Central Government to revise and reopen any proceeding under the Act and to pass any order in relation thereto as in the opinion of the Central Government the circumstances of the case require and as is not inconsistent with any of the provisions contained in the Act or the Rules made thereunder. But in the facts of the present case it is not necessary to undertake this exercise. The Court would proceed on the assumption that section 33 of the Act does not provide reservoir of power from which revisional jurisdiction can be exercised more than once in respect of the same order or the same proceeding. [403E-F] In the instant case the question which would squarely arise is whether on an earlier occasion, the Central Government had exercised any revisional power conferred by section 33 in respect of the order dated August 21, 1961 of the Chief Settlement Commissioner. In other words, whether, as contended by the appellants, the letter of Shri N. P.
 Dube, Joint Secretary dated May 31, 1963 is a decision recorded by the Central Government in exercise of the power conferred by section 33 ? The letter of Mr. Dube dated May 31, 1963 does not record any decision of the Central Government. It merely says that it is not necessary to wait any more for response to the queries addressed to authorities in Pakistan and 393 the matter should be finalised on the basis of finding arrived at in the case. It further proceeds to aver that there is a feeling that there is no reason to differ from those judicial pronouncements at `this stage'. Such expression of feeling could hardly tantamount to a decision of the Central Government under Sec. 33. By this letter the Central Government informed the Government of Punjab that the record is returned with the request that the case may be finalised as indicated in the letter. The revisional power is the power is the Central Government and not of the Punjab Government. There decision was left to the Punjab Government. There was nothing pending with the Punjab Government for finalisation Therefore, the High Court was clearly in error in treating the letter of Shri Dube dated May 31, 1963 as a decision of the Central Government in exercise of the power conferred by Sec. 33. There was no occasion for the Central Government to exercise power under Sec. 33 and therefore, it is not possible to agree with the High Court that the letter records the decision of the Central Government under Sec. 33. If the letter of Shri Dube is not a decision of the Central Government under Sec. 33 of the Act, as a necessary corollary, the impugned decision must be treated as one renderer for the first time in exercise of the revisional power under Sec. 33 and therefore, it cannot be said to be one without jurisdiction.

 If every litigant in whose favour a competent authority has made an order can still approach the higher authority for the affirmance of the order without any rhyme or reason, the whole gamut of power of revisional jurisdiction would become a play thing for already successful party who may foreclose the decision and when needed can successfully urge that the power of revision is exhausted.
