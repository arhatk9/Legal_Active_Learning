 The first respondent instituted an action in the Court of the Subordinate Judge Alipore for a decree of ejectment in respect of land occupied by a company. The suit was decreed. Before the decree was passed the company took a loan from the appellant and mortgaged its fixed assets in favour of the appellant. After the passing of the decree the company executed a second mortgage of its fixed assets in favour of the appellant against another loan. The decree obtained by the first respondent against the company was confirmed in first appeal. Thereupon the company and the first appellant filed Second Appeal No. 1380 of 1954 in the High Court of Calcutta. The appellant also filed a suit in the said High Court an its original side to enforce the two mortgages in his favour and obtained a preliminary mortgage decree in the suit. Another creditor of the company applied for and obtained an order directing that the company be wound up. The liquidators of the company and the appellant prosecuted Second Appeal No. 1380 of 1954. The decree of the first appellate court was confirmed by the High Court.
 The first respondent then instituted an application for enforcement of the decree in ejectment against the company.
 The appellant resisted the application on the ground that the same was not maintainable since leave of the High Court under s. 171 of the Companies Act, 1913 had not been obtained., Thereafter on the motion of the first respondent the Company Judge granted leave to execute the decree in Second Appeal No. 1380 of 1954. The Subordinate Judge before whom the proceedings were pending dismissed the objections of the appellant against execution of the decree and the order of dismissal was confirmed by the first appellate court and the High Court. The appellant's applications for a certificate for leave to appeal to this Court was also rejected. in appeal by special leave challenging the refusal of certificate.
 
HELD : (i) The object of s. 171 is plain. It is intended to ensure that the assets of a company ordered to be wound up by the Court shall be administered for the benefit of all the creditors and that some creditors only shall not obtain an advantage over others by instituting or prosecuting proceedings against the company. The section is intended to maintain control of the Court which has made an order of winding up on proceedings which may be pending against the company or may be initiated after the order of winding up, and the Court may remain seized of all those matters so that its affairs are administered equitably and in an orderly fashion. [480 B-C] 477 If sanction of the Court under s. 179 to prosecute the appeal before the High Court was obtained by the liquidators in the present case-and it must be so assumed-the contention raised on behalf of the appellant lost all significance for an execution application is only a continuation of the suit and the control of the High Court enures during the execution proceedings also. It would be giving effect to a technicality divorced from the object of s. 171 of the Companies Act to hold that even in a suit filed or prosecuted with the sanction of the Court the decree may not be enforced by a successful party without leave under that section. [480 E-G] Even granting that sanction under s. 179 does not dispense with the, leave under s. 171 of the Act, to institute a proceeding in execution against a company ordered to be wound up, there is nothing in the Act which makes the leave a condition precedent to the institution of a proceeding in execution of a decree against the company and failure to obtain leave before the institution of the proceedings entails dismissal of the proceeding. The suit or proceeding instituted without leave of the Court may be regarded as ineffective until leave is obtained but once leave is obtained the proceeding will be deemed to be instituted on the: date granting leave.
