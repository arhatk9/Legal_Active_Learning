 By virtue of the powers conferred- by s. 115 of the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, read with Art. 309 of the Constitution, the Allocated Government Servants (Absorption etc.) Rules were made by the Government of the reorganised State of Bombay. In October 1960, Government resolved, that the post of first grade clerks in the Revenue Department in the districts of the Nagpur division which were integrated with the former Bombay State to form the new State, need not be equated to any other post but that its pay-scale should be revised from 1st May 1960. Some of the first grade clerks filed a petition in the High Court for the issue of appropriate writs to quash the resolution and for ordering the Government to equate their posts with the post of Aval Karkuns in the former State of Bombay or in the alternative for directing the Government to fix the revised scale of pay from 1st November 1956 on which date the Act took effect, instead of 1st May, 1960. The High Court rejected the contention of the petitioners as to equivalence but accepted their contention that the new scales of pay ought to commence on 1st November, 1956 and not 1st May, 1960 as ordered by Government. The clerks as well as the State appealed to the Supreme Court.
 In their appeal, the clerks contended that : (i) the Government was bound to find an equivalent post for them and that the nearest equivalent post was that or Aval Karkuns and (ii) by not assigning them to an equivalent post they had been discriminated against, and r. 12, which provides that a post need not be equated to an equivalent post is discriminatory. In its appeal, the State Government contended that, under r.10 it was open to Government to fix the pay scales of an allocated Government servant not only from 1st November, 1956, but also from any subsequent date because the words of the rule "except where Government otherwise directs".
 
HELD: (i) The duties of A val Karkuns in the former State of Bombay were entirely different from those which first grade clerks performed and therefore, it was not possible to make the post of Aval Karkuns as an equivalent post to that of first grade clerks. [138 G-H] (ii) Discrimination can be proved only if equivalence is not carried out although an equivalent post is available. A rule which provides for a special treatment of an odd case is not necessarily discriminatory. Rule 12 was made in view of the multifariousness of the posts existing in the different components from which the principal successor State was formed and because, some existing posts could not be equated with posts in the principal successor State and had to be treated on an independent footing. [139 A] 135 (iii) On the sense of the matter, as well as on their construction and position, the words of r. 10 were not intended to change the date on which the scales of pay were to come into operation, namely 1st November, 1956, but to enable Government to make special orders which were not in accordance with cls. (i) and (ii) of the rule. [140 C-D] The power which is conferred on Government by r. 12 to prescribe a new pay-scale must be exercised from 1st November, 1956. Every one of the rules, 14 to 19 and r. 23 mention over and over again that the new scales of pay shall be as on or from 1st November, 1956. The intention was to enable Government to make a change in the scale of pay but not to change the date of 1st November, 1956, which was always the fixed date line. [140 F-G]
