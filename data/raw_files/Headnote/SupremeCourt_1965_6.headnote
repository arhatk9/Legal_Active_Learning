 In July 1954, two groups of shareholders led by P and 1, who, together held an equal number of shares of the value of Rs. 21 lakhs out of a total share capital of Rs. 25 lakhs in the respondent company (then a private ate company), entered into a private agreement with the Appellant, whereby, (i) the share capital of the company was to be increased by Rs.
 10 1/2 lakhs and shares of this value allotted to the appellant so that the total shares held by him would be equal to the holding of each of the other two groups; (ii) each of these three groups of shareholders would have an equal number of representatives on the Board of Directors;
 (iii) the appellant undertook to arrange certain credit facilities for the company; and (iv) the appellant was to be the Chairman of the Board. In accordance with this agreement, the appellant was made the Chairman and though various resolutions were passed by the company to implement the agreement, these resolutions did not in terms refer to the agreement. and no change was made in the Articles of Association of the company so as to embody the terms of the agreement. Some time later, the subscribed capital of the company was increased to Rs. 61 lakhs and the new shares were so allotted as to maintain the parity in the share holdings of the three groups. When one of the two minority shareholders sold 250 shares, these were equally divided between the three groups and one odd share was held by P, L and the Appellant jointly.
 In 1956-57, the company desired to raise a loan from the Industrial Finance Corporation and as this Corporation made advances only to public limited companies, in January 1957 the company was converted into a public company.
 Appropriate amendments were made in its Articles of Association, but even on this occasion, no attempt was made to incorporate into the Articles the terms of the Agreement of July 1954. After sanction had been obtained of the Controller of Capital Issues for the issue of additional share capital, the appellant suggested at a meeting of the board of directors in March 1958 that the new shares should be issued proportionately to the existing shareholders in accordance with the provisions of Section 81 of the Companies Act, 1956. On the other hand those representing the P and L groups proposed that the new shares should be offered privately in the best interests of the company at the sole discretion of the directors; this proposal was made because these two groups did not have money to subscribe for the new capital and they feared that if shares were offered in the first instance to existing shareholders, the appellant could get all of them and thus acquire control of the company. In view of the majority of the P and L groups in the Board, their proposal was adopted and subsequently a resolution to that effect was also accepted at a General Meeting of the shareholders held in March 29, 1958. The appellant thereafter instituted a suit to have the resolution declared illegal and void and obtained an ex parte injunction against the company from allotting shares pursuant to this resolution. On July 13, 1958, the appellant's suit was dismissed by the Subordinate Judge and the injunction vacated by him 721 at 11 A.M. The Board of Directors at a meeting held on that date, immediately on receiving the news that the injunction had been vacated, allotted the new shares to seven persons who had previously applied for them. On the same day, the appellant filed an appeal and applied for and obtained an order staying the operation of the order of the Subordinate Judge. Eventually these appeals were also dismissed and the stay vacated.
 In September 1960 another General meeting of the company was called to approve a proposal to increase the share capital of the company from Rs. 1 crore to Rs. 3 crores. It was also intended that these new shares should be offered to outsiders with a view to making the company more broad- based.
 At that stage the appellant filed a petition in the High Court under Section 397 and 398 of the Companies Act, 1956, complaining inter alia, that the issue of new shares was in furtherance of a continuing oppression of the apperant's minority group; that by allotting such shares to benamidars of P and L in disregard of the agreement of July 1954, it was intended to exclude the appellant from all control of the affairs of the company; that the resolutions passed in March 1958 as to the manner of allotment of new shares contravened s. 81 of the Companies Act, 1 956 and this resolution as well as the hasty allotment on July 30, 1958 were in abuse of the power of the P and L groups and oppressive of the minority. The petition was allowed by the single Judge but this decision was reversed in appeal by a Division Bench of the High Court. On appeal to the Supreme Court.
 
HELD : (i) On the facts no case had been made out, of oppression within the meaning of section 397.
 For a petition under section 397 to succeed, it is not enough to show that there is just and equitable cause for winding up the company, though that must be shown as preliminary to the application of section 397. It must further be shown that the conduct of the majority share- holders was oppressive to the minority as members and this require.,, that events have to be considered not in isolation but as a part of a consecutive story. There must be continuous acts on the part of the majority shareholders, continuing up to the date of the petition, showing that the affairs of the company were being conducted in a manner oppressive to some part of the members. The conduct must be burdensome, harsh and wrongful and mere lack of confidence between the majority shareholders and the minority shareholders would not be enough unless lack of confidence springs from oppression of the minority by a majority in the management of the company's affairs, and such oppression must involve at least an element of lack of probity or fair dealing to a member in the matter of his proprietary rights as a shareholder.

Meyer and another, [1958] 3 All. E.R. 66. Re. H. R. Harmer Ltd., [19581 3 All E.R. 689; discussed and applied.
 (ii) The agreement of July 1954 on which the case of oppression was based was not binding even on the private company and much less so on the public company when it came into existence in 1957. It was really an agreement between a non-member and two members of the company and although for some time the agreement was in the main carried out, clearly some of its terms could not be put in the articles of association of the public company. As the company was not bound by the 722 agreement, the mere fact that it was decided at the meeting in March 1958 to offer the new shares to outsiders and not the existing shareholders did not necessarily amount to an oppression of the minority shareholders. The majority shareholders were not bound to accept a proposal of the minority shareholders that the new shares should be allotted only to the existing shareholders. Furthermore the general meeting having decided that new shares should not be issued to the existing shareholders but to others, there was no contravention of s. 81 of the Companies Act 1956 and the resolution of March 28, 1958 was in accordance with law as it stood at the time. [739 B-C; 740 G-H; 741 C-E; 745 D-F] (iii) it could not be said that the allottees of new shares were benamidars or stooges of the P or L group and that by allotment of shares to them, the majority shareholders were oppressing the minority. These allottees were independent persons and the fact that the P and L groups might be able to get the support of the holders of the new shares did not necessarily mean oppression of the appellant, for the new shareholders may support the P and L groups on the ground that such support would be for the benefit of the Company. [744 C-E] (iv) The haste in issuing now shares upon the vacation of the injunction of July 30, 1958 could not be held to be a part of the design to oppress the minority. The company was in need of money for expansion and its ability to obtain a loan from the Finance Corporation depended upon the increase of its subscribed share capital. The haste became necessary because the injunction was vacated on that day and it was felt that if immediate action was not taken and the new shares allotted, there might be a further injunction and consequent delay. The haste in the allotment of shares arose out of circumstances brought about by the appellant's conduct. [743 A-E] Held also, that no case had been made out for action under section 398 on the ground that the affairs of the company were being conducted in a manner prejudicial to its interests. [749 C]
