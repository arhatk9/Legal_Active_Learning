 The employees of the appellant made certain demands which were not accepted and they went on strike. The appellant issued notices to the employees that if they did not return to work immediately, they would be deemed to have abandoned their employment. The strike was continued and thereupon the following notice was issued :
 "Further to our notices dated January 1, 1957, and January 3, 1957, the workers who are not attending work since December 31, 1956, in spite of several requests to resume work, are hereby advised that their names are removed from the Muster as from 2 p.m. today (January 14, 1957) as their having left our services of their own accord. Arrangements have been made to fill up the vacancies occurring as a result of desertion of workers from their places of duty.
 "Arrangements will be made to make payment of their dues, if any." The strike was called off on March 26, 1937. A number of employees could not be taken back as their 'vacancies had been filled up. The first respondent in C.A. No. 94 and the first 97 respondents in the other appeal, who were not taken back, applied, along with others, for relief to the Authority under the Payment of Wages Act, who dismissed the application. Most of the employees moved the High Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution and their writ petitions were allowed. Standing Order 25(1) which applied provided as follows: - "The employment of permanent employees on monthly rates of pay may be terminated by giving one month's notice 406 or on payment of one month's wages (including all allowances) in lieu of notice........
 Held, that the Standing Order contemplated termination of employment by the employer and in the instant cases there could be no doubt that the appellant had terminated the employment of the respondents by removing their names from the Muster roll without giving them any notice of such removal.
 If employees absent themselves from work because of strike in enforcement of their demands, there can be no question of abandonment of employment by them. The management cannot by imposing a new term of employment unilaterally, convert the absence from work into abandonment of employment.
 If the strike was in fact illegal, the appellant could take disciplinary action against the employees under the Standing Order and dismiss them. If that were done, the strikers would not have been entitled to any compensation under Standing Order 25 ; but that was not what the appeal. plant purported to do. The respondents were therefore entitled to the relief.
