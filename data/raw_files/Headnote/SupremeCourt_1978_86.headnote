 A considerable sum of money was recovered by the Police from the appellant and seized in connection with an offence registered against an accused Person' namely, Sri Bansi Lal.
 An application made under Section 457 of the Criminal Procedure Code was rejected by the Courts below holding that the Special Judge had no power to release the seized property.
 Allowing the appeal by special leave, the Court, 
HELD : 1. Chapter 34 of the Criminal Procedure Code deals with disposal of property. There is a trichotomy in the sense that where property has been seized by the Police, but not produced before the Court, the power to dispose it of is covered by section 457. Where property has been seized and/or otherwise produced before the Court, the manner to dispose of such property is governed by Sec. 451. If the question of disposal arises after the enquiry or trial in any criminal court is concluded, the disposal of the property involved in the case is governed by Sec. 452. The situation is squarely covered by s. 457 Crl. Procedure Code. [692 B-C, E] 2.(a) The fact that the Court has power to dispose of property seized by the police but not yet produced before the Court does not mean that the Special Judge must always release such property to the person from whom the property has been recovered, specially when the stage of the case is in suspicion, the investigation is not over and charge-sheet has not yet been laid. The Court has to be circumspect in such a situation before releasing the property. [692 E-F] (b)Whenever the claimant asks for the property back, it does not mean that he should be given back the said property. That has to be decided on its own merits in each case and the discretion of the Court has to be exercised after due consideration of the interests of justice including the prospective necessity of the production of 'these seized- articles at the time of the trial. If the release of the property seized will, in any manner, affect or prejudice the course of justice at the time of the trial, it will be a wise discretion to reject the claim for return.
