 The karta of a joint Hindu family executed in 1907 a deed of mortgage with possession in respect of certain family properties. After the death of the karta, the coparceners, by an agreement of sale in 1930 agreed to sell, subject to the mortgage, the properties to respondents 1 and 2. Later, the coparceners, by a registered sale deed, sold the properties to L and K, sons of the original mortgagee.
 Respondents 1 and 2 filed a suit for specific performance of the earlier agreement. The suit was decreed. In the sale deed obtained from the Court, in pursuance of the decree, K was not made one of the conveying parties, but was made an attesting witness. In 1947, respondents 1 and 2 filed a suit for redemption and possession against L and K. L contended, inter alia, that as a result of the later sale deed, he and K became absolute owners and the right of redemption by the mortgagors and those claiming through them became extinguished; that his possession, being to the knowledge of respondents 1 and 2, was adverse against them and therefore the suit was barred by limitation; and that the decree for specific performance could not affect the adverse nature of the possession of K and L as K was not one of the conveying parties but only an attesting witness. In appeal by L, this Court, 
HELD : In spite of the existence of a previous contract of sale, a sale to a subsequent purchaser even with notice is not void, but voidable at the instance of the party agreeing to purchase under a previous contract and except for the obligation arising from s. 91 of the Trust Act and paragraph 2 of s. 40 of the Transfer of Property Act, the title to the property would pass from the vendor to the subsequent transferee. [879 G-H] The sale in favour of K and L was nor void but voidable at the instance of respondents 1 and 2 by reason of their earlier contract and though as between the mortgagors and K and L the sale was valid and binding, it was subject to the right of specific performance which respondents 1 and 2 had acquired and K and L being in a fiduciary position, their possession was not adverse as against respondents 1 and 2.
 Therefore the suit for redemption was not barred even though the statutory period bad expired. [880 E-F] Further, being an attesting witness, K, both for himself and on behalf of L, was made fully aware that the sale deed conveying the title of the property was being passed in favour of respondents 1 and 2 and that the only right in them was to receive the mortgage amount and no more.
