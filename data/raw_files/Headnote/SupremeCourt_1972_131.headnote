 The appellant had a 'sweet meat shop in Bombay whose running he had entrusted to his nephew. The food inspector acting under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act 1954 took a sample of buffalo milk from 'he shop. One of the three portions of the sample was given to the vendor, another was sent to the Public Analyst and the third was kept by the inspector. The Analyst reported that the fat content of the milk was lower than prescribed. The appellant was prosecuted under s. 116(1)(a)(i) of the Act; the case against his nephew was dropped since he was untraceable.
 The Magistrate acquitted the appellant. He held that there was long delay between taking the sample and the commence- ment of the prosecution and since the preservative added to the sample was less than prescribed, the sample must have become decomposed. As a result according to the Magistrate, the appellant lost his valuable right of having his portion of the sample analysed by the Director. The High Court reversed the judgment of acquittal holding that since the appellant did not make any application under s. 13(2) he could not be said to have lost any valuable right. In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The High Court's view was in consonance with the decision of this Court in the case of Babulal Hargovindas that unless an application to send the sample to the Director is made, the vendor cannot-complain that he was deprived of his right to have the sample analysed by the Director. [486 A-C] The Magistrate was wrong in thinking that no useful purpose would be served by sending the sample for analysis by the Director.It was not for the Magistrate to decide without any date that the samplewould be decomposed and was incapable of being analysed. There was no evidence before him to justify this conclusion. [486 D] The conviction of the appellant must accordingly be upheld.
