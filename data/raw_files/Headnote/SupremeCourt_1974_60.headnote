 P & G were convicted u/s. 302 and were sentenced to death.
 The High Court set aside the convictions of both the accused and acquitted them. The State has filed the present appeals against the acquittal of the 2 accused by special leave.
 The prosecution case is that on account of a family feud, the deceased was murdered by one P. with a double-barrel gun, in front of one A, the widow of a rich landlord.
 The trial court accepted the prosecution version of occurrence and relied upon the evidence of A which was corroborated by the youngest son and the daughter, that P, was holding a gun etc. and he was convicted along with G, an associate.
 On appeal the High Court found that the F.I.R. was recorded subsequently after due deliberation and consultation. The High Court also found that the witnesses, relied on by the trial court had supported another version of the occurrence.
 It was found that an attempt had been made to improve upon the story with a view to save D, the eldest son of the landlord. The High Court, therefore, set aside the conviction of the accused and acquitted them.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : In the present case, the prosecution witnesses have come out with two inconsistent versions of the occurrence.
 One version of the occurrence is contained in the evidence of the witnesses in Court, while the other version is contained in their statements made before the police.
 According to the version given before the Court, it was P, who shot dead the deceased while according to other version, it was G of village Ramana, who was responsible for the crime. Again, according to the version given in Court, the occurrence was witnessed by A. As against that, the version contained in the police statement was that A had not witnessed the occurrence. In view of these contradictory versions, the High Court rightly set aside the conviction and there is no ground for interference by this Court in the present appeal. [664B-D]
