 The appellant, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay, established the Bombay Electric Supply and Transport Undertaking for the purpose of providing and operating motor transport and supplying electricity to the consumers in the city of Bombay.
 Workman Shri Naik, employed as Assistant Fitter in the Transportation Engineering Department at the Appellant's Workshop and another employee employed under the Appellant as a mechanic were found by the S.I. of Police with gunny bags in their hands and each bag contained 22 brass bearings. On investigation it was found that Naik was an employee under the Appellant and that the brass bearings had been removed from the Appellant's Workshops with the help and cooperation of the mechanic. A complaint of theft against the two workmen was launched.
 An inquiry was held by an officer of the appellant and after evidence by the police officers and others, the Enquiry Officer found Shri Naik guilty and an order of dismissal was passed on February 11, 1970. Appeals to the Executive Engineer and Assistant General Manager of the appellant were all dismissed.
 Naik and the mechanic thereafter, filed applications before the 5th Labour Court at Bombay challenging the order of dismissal on various grounds. The Labour Court, after considering all the facts and evidence held that as the orders of dismissal were not passed within six months of the misconduct coming to the notice of the employer, they were illegal and have to be set aside under s.78(1)(d)(i) of the Act. The Labour Court further ordered the appellant to pay each of the workmen his back wages from the date of dismissal till the date, of order and also in addition to pay compensation of Rs. 15001-.
 The main point that arose for consideration was the interpretation of the provisions of s.78(1)(d) of the Act etc.
 Held : (i) The word "shall" in s. 78(1) should not be strictly construed and when the relevant provisions are read in the context in which they appear, it cannot be doubted that the Labour Court will have to consider the circumstances of a particular case and the- nature of the misconduct and also the nature of contravention of any provisions of law or standing order. The fact that s. 78(1) of the Act has conferred certain powers on the Labour Court does not mean that the Labour Court must necessarily and under all circumstances grant the reliefs which it has the power to grant. It is well established proposition that the power to grant certain reliefs includes the power of refusing the relief. If an employer in a particular case has passed an order of punishment beyond the period of six months and if it is found that he has no satisfactory explanation for the delay. the Labour Court may be justified in straightaway setting aside the orders 286 on the ground that they have been passed beyond the period of six months. If, on the other hand, as in the present case, an employer has been vigilant in initiating disciplinary proceedings and the Labour Court is satisfied about the reasons for the delay in passing the orders of punishment, the Labour Court is not justified in setting aside the orders solely on the ground that the period of six months had expired. [296E-H; 297A-C, E-H] (ii)Provisions contained in s.78(1)(d)(i) are not mandatory, but only directory. Therefore, the interpretation based by the Labour Court on s.78(1)(d)(i) is erroneous. Accordingly, the two orders granting reliefs to the workmen are set aside. [298D-E; 302B] Raipur Co-operative Central Batik Ltd. and Anr. v.
