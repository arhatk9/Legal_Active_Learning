 The appellant hold a licence under s. 3(1) of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 to supply electricity in certain areas in the State of U.P. The 3rd respondent was a factory manufacturing electrical equipment in the appellant's area of supply, and was receiving energy from the appellant. The 3rd respondent made complaints to the State Government that the supply of electrical energy by the appellant was inadequate and fluctuating. There was no improvement in the supply even after discussions between the parties.
 Thereafter at the request of the 3rd respondent, the State Government by order dated December 26, 1961 under 's.
 3(2)(e)(ii) of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 as amended by the Indian Electricity (Uttar Pradesh Sanshodhan) Adhiniyam 1961 directed the State Electricity Board to supply electrical energy directly to the 3rd respondent.
 The appellant made representations to the Government against the order but these were rejected. The appellant then filed a writ petition in the High Court which was dismissed by a Single Judge.- A Letters Patent Appeal against the decision was also dismissed although the High Court allowed the appellant to raise an additional plea based on Art. 14 of the Constitution without allowing further evidence to be given for that purpose. In this Court, in appeal against the High Court's (order it was contended : (i) That owing to the different rates at which electricity was supplied by the State Government, there was discrimination, (a) between the 3rd respondent and other consumers, and (b) between the 3rd respondent and the appellant; (ii) That the impugned order of the State Government was not made in the public interest within the meaning of s. 3(2)(e)(ii) of the Act; (iii) That the impugned order amounted to compulsory acquisition of the property of the appellant without compensation-, and (iv) That the impugned order was passed in violation of the principles of natural justice.
 
HELD : (i) Article 14 of the Constitution ensures equality among equals : its aim is to protect persons similarly placed against discriminatory treatment. It does not operate against rational classification. A person setting up a grievance of denial of equal treatment by law must establish that between persons similarly circumstanced, some were treated to their prejudice and the differential treatment had no relation to the object sought to be achieved by the law. [870 D] 866 in the present case, as to the alleged discrimination between the 3rd respondent and the other consumers in the area there was no evidence on record showing the operative rates on the date of the impugned order, and no grievance by any consumer of any prejudicial treatment accorded to, him.
 Further the 3rd respondent and other consumers did not belong to the same class because in the one case energy was being supplied by the appellant and in the other by the Electricity Board. [870 E-G] Similarly in respect of the alleged discrimination between the 3rd respondent and the appellant there was no evidence that the rates charged by the State Electricity Board to the 3rd respondent were lower than the rates charged to the appellant. The appellant and the 3rd respondent again did not belong to the same class inasmuch as the appellant was a distributor of electric energy, whereas the 3rd respondent was a consumer. [870 H-871 B] The plea of violation of Art. 14 of the Constitution on behalf of the appellant, could not therefore be accepted.
 The Western U.P. Electric Power and Supply Co. Ltd. v. State of U.P. & Ors., [1968] INSC 47; A.I.R. 1968 S.C. 1099, distinguished.
 (ii)The question whether an order under s. 3 (2) (e). as amended by U.P. Act 30 of 1961 is in public interest is not one on which the opinion of the Government is final. If challenged, the Government must show that exercise of the power was necessary in the public interest. The court is thereby not intended to sit in appeal over the satisfaction of the Government. If there be prima facie evidence on which a reasonable body of persons may hold that it is in the public interest to supply energy directly to the consumers, the requirements of the statute are fulfilled.
 Normally a licencee of electrical energy though he has no monopoly, is the person through whom electrical energy would be distributed within the area of supply since the licencee has to lay down electric supply lines for transmission of energy and to maintain its establishment. An inroad may be made in that right in the conditions which ate statutorily prescribed, but the satisfaction of the Government that the supply is necessary in the public interest is in appropriate cases not excluded from judicial review. [872 B-D] In the present case there was ample evidence on record to prove that uninterrupted supply of electrical energy to the 3rd respondent was necessary in the public interest and the, appellant was unable to- ensure it. a large industry which gave scope and earned foreign exchange, if it was necessary to give direct supply of electrical energy to the 3rd respondent the order to the electricity board to make a direct supply to the 3rd respondent was in the public interest within the meaning of s. 3(2) (e) (ii) of the Act [872 G; 873 D-E] (e) D-E] (iii) Even assuming that the right to supply electrical energy is property (a question on which the court expressed no opinion) there was in the present case no infringement of the guarantee under Art. 31(2). By cl. (2A) of Art. 31 there is no compulsory acquisition or requisitioning of property unless ownership or right to possession of the property stands transferred to the State or a corporation owned or controlled by the State. By the order granting direct supply of electricalenergy ownership of property unless ownership or to right to possession of property was not transferred to the State or to a corporation owned or controlled by the State and on that limited ground it must be held that Art. 31(2) had no application to the case. [873 G-874 D] 867 (iv) In view of the fact that the complains made by the 3rd respondent were discussed with the appellant and that several representations were made by the appellant to the State Government which were by the latter and rejected it could not be said that the denied natural justice.
