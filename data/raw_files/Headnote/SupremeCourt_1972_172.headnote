 The appellant and another were convicted u/s 457 and 380 read with s. 75 I.P.C. by Add., Munisiff Magistrate. The prosecution case was that on 9th February 1964, certain gold and silver ornaments,were stolen from a jewelles house in Jaipur City. The accused Hira Singh was arrested after some time. The finger prints left by the culpritallied with the specimen finger impressions of Hira Singh accused. Further in pursuance of disclosure statement made by Hira Singh accused, certain amount of money was recovered from the wife of the Hira Singh's brother. A number of stolen articles and an instrument of house-breaking were also found. On interrogation of Hira Singh accused, police raided the house of the appellant and recovered from the place 18 stolen articles on February 21, 1964. The appellant was arrested 4 days later and 'from his personal search, 26 items of stolen property were recovered. In pursuance of information sup- plied by the appellant, the police recovered a number of stolen gold articles buried in a graveyard. The trial court accepted the prosecution case and convicted and sentenced the accused persons. Appeals and revision petitions filed by the accused were dismissed. On appeal to this Court, appellant's counsel raised inter alia, the following objections:-(1) the propriety of the identification of the recovered articles was assailed; (2) the 'judgments of the trial court and the Additional Sessions Judge were not very satisfactory (3) that there has been a misjoinder of charges (4) the conviction of the appellant should have been under s. 411 I.P.C, and not under sections 457 and 380 I.P.C.
 Dismissing the appeals, 
HELD : (1) The recovered articles were mixed with other similar articles and all necessary precautions were taken by the Magistrate The article were correctly identified by the complainant and his father. Nothing cogent has been shown as to why the statement of the Magistrate in this respect be not accepted.
 (2) Although the High Court observed that the judgments of the trial Court, the Additional Sessions Judge were not satisfactory, but this circumstance is not very material because the High Court considered the evidence in details and came to the conclusion that the case against the accused had been proved. Therefore, it cannot be said that the accused persons had been prejudiced in any way.
 (3) So far as the question of misjoinder of charges is concerned, the submission is without any force, because the circumstances of the case show that the accused jointly committed the offences with which they were charged and that those offences were committed in the course of the same transaction. The two accused could consequently be charged and tried together Such a course is permitted by s. 239 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
 881 (4) The house-breaking and theft took place on the night between February 8 and February 9, 1964. The various stolen articles were recovered from the appellant'$ house on February 21,, 1963 an there, after from his person on February 25, 1964. The appellant was in police custody after February 25 1964 and more stolen articles were recovered on March 3, 1964 from the graveyard in pursuance of his disclosure statement. The articles which were recovered on March 3, 1964 can therefore, be held to be in possession of the appellant on February 25, 1964. It would thus follow that within 17 days of the theft, the appellant was found in possession of the stolen articles. According to the illustration (a) of s. 114 of the Indian Evidence Act, a man who is in possession of the stolen goods soon after the theft, is either the thief or has received the goods knowing them to be stolen, unless he can account for his possession. In the present case, the appellant has not been able to account for his possession of the stolen articles. The explanation furnished by him is not all worthy of credence. The courts below were right in convicting the accused. The fact that the appellant was found soon after the theft in possession of a very large number of stolen articles as well as the other circumstances, show that the appellant was himself the thief and not the receiver of stolen goods.
