 The appellant-company filed a suit against the Union of India demanding payment at an enhanced rate over the basic rate stipulated in a construction contract with the Union of India. The claim related to revision of rates due to the complex nature and increase in the quantity of work and in respect of work not covered by the, contract. The addi- tional work was done at the request of the Engineer-in- charge who under the terms of the contract was competent to give instructions for work not covered by the terms of the contract and fix the rate at which remuneration was to be paid in respect of such work. The Union of India contended that the claim was barred, by the law of limitation. The trial court decreed the suit for the amount certified by the Superintending Engineer. On appeal the High Court held that the claim was governed either by Art. 56 or by Art. 115 of the First Schedule, to the Limitation Act, 1908, and a suit, more than three years of the date on which the work was done and in any event of the, date on which the claim was rejected, was barred. Allowing the appeal to this Court and restoring the decree for the trial court, 
HELD : (i) Article 56 of the First Schedule to the Indian Limitation Act, 1908, prescribes a period of three years for a suit for the price of the work done by the plaintiff for the defendant at his request, where no time has been fixed for payment, and the, period of limitation commences to run from the date when the work is done. A suit is governed by Art. 56 if it arises out of a contract to pay the price of work done at the request of the defendant., The claim in the present case is for payment at an additional rate over the stipulated 'rate in view of change in circumstances and not for the, price of work done by the appellant, even though the additional work was done :at the request of the Engineer-incharge. [51 F] (ii) Article 115- of the First Schedule to the Limitation Act is a residuary article dealing with the claim for compensation for the breach of any contract, express orimplied, not in writing registered and, not specially provided for in the first schedule. The period of limitation in such cases is three years and it commences to ran when the contract is broken, or where there are successive breaches when the breach in respect of which the suit is instituted occurs or where the breach is continuing when it ceases. The suit filed by the appellant company is not a suit for compensation for breach of' contract express or implied; it is: a suit for enhanced rate because of change of circumstances, and in respect of work not covered by the contract. The additional work directed by the Engineer-in-charge when carried out May be deemed to be done under the 48 terms of the contract; but the claim for enhanced rates does not aris out of the contract : it is in any case not a claim for compensation for beach of contract. [51 H] (iii)The claim is, therefore, not covered by any specific article under the First Schedule and must fall within the terms of Art. 120. Under this Article the period of six years commences to run when the right to sue accrues. There is no right to sue until there is an accrual of the right asserted in the suit and its infringement or at least a clear and unequivocal threat to infringe the right by the defendant against whom the suit is instituted.
