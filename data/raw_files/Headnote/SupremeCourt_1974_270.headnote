 Section 4(a) of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956, provides that any custom of Hindu law in force immediately before the commencement of the Act, shall cease to have effect with respect to any matter for which provision is made in the Act. Section 15 provides that no adoption which has been validly made can be cancelled by the adoptive father or mother nor can the adopted' person renounce such status; and s. 30 provides that nothing contained in the Act shall affect any adoption made before its commencement, and, the validity and effect of any such adoption shall be determined as if the Act had not been passed.
 The appellant claimed that he was adopted by the respondent in 1956, before the Act came into force, in the 'Goda Datta' form. The respondent filed a suit for a declaration that the appellant was not so adopted, and while the suit was pending, she made a written declaration stating, (a) that the adoption had nevel taken place, and (b) that even if it was believed that it had taken place it stood revocked by that document. The trial court decreed the suit and the High Court confirmed the decree.
 (Per Bhagwati and Untwalia, JJ.) Dismissing the appeal to this Court.
 
HELD : An adoption in the 'goda datta' form made before the commencement of the Act, can be cancelled after the coming into force of that Act.
 (per Bhagwati, J.), (a) Section 15 has no application to adoption made prior to- the coming into the force of the Act. The first part of s. 30 enacts the main saving provision. The second part is merely a provision introduced ex abundanti cautela with a view to emphasizing that the validity and effect of the adoption made before the commencement of the Act shall remain untouched by the provisions of the Act. it is clear from the plain and unambiguous language of the first part of the section that the legislature intended to exclude the applicability of all provisions contained in the Act to an adoption made before the commencement of the Act and not merely the applicability of those provisions which affect the validity and effect of such adoption. The true meaning and effect of the first part of the section, uninhibited by the provisions in the second part, is that nothing contained in the Act shall affect any adoption made prior to the commencement of the Act. The word 'affect' is a word of wide import and in the context in which it occurs it must be construed to mean 'touch' of 'relate to' or 'concern'.
 Therefore, nothing contained in the Act shall touch or apply to an adoption made prior to the commencement of the Act.
 So construed, what s. 30 enacts is that nothing contained in the Act-and that includes s. 15-shall touch or concern, or in other words apply to an adoption made prior to the Act.
 [37C-38D; 39C.] (b) The intendment and effect of s. 4(a) of the Act is to abrogate the existing law or custom in so far as it is replaced by the law enacted in the statute. If there is a provision made in the statute which operates in the same area as there existing law or custom, the statutory provision must prevail and the existing law of custom must give way. If s. 15 were applicable to an adoption made prior to the Act it would govern the matter of cancellation;
 but the section applies only to an adoption made after the commencement of the Act, and therefore, so far as 33 the matter relating to cancellation of an adoption made before the act is concerned, any existing law or custom making provision in that behalf cannot be said to have been abrogated by reason of s. 4(a). Hence, if an adoption could be cancelled by the adopter prior to the commencement of the Act, the right of the adopter to cancel it is not taken away. Such a custom enabling cancellation would continue in force and govern the matter of cancellation of an adoption made before the commencement of the Act. [39E-H] (c) Prior to the commencement of the Act, by custom, a goda datta adoption could be cancelled by the adopter. The Act, in Ss. 5 to 1 1, has laid down the conditions and requirements for making an adoption. Therefore, the custom of goda datta adoption ceases to be in force on the commencement of the Act by virtue of s. 4(a); that is, no such adoption could be made after the commencement of the Act according to custom, and consequently, no question of its cancellation could arise. But, where the adoption was made before the Act, the custom gave a right to the adopter to cancel the adoption and this custom, in so far as it operated on the adoption made prior to the Act, did not cease to be in force under s. 4(a), as s. 15 is not applicable to such an adoption. [40 A-C] (d) It is true that the custom of goda datta adoption has two limbs-One relating to the making of adoption and the other providing for its revocability at the option of the adopter. Therefore, since the custom of such an addition has ceased to be forced on the commencement of the Act, as regards adoption made subsequent to the Act, the second limb also came to an end, because, if no such adoption could be made after the commencement of the Act there could be no question of its cancellation; but, where under the first limb the adoption was already made before the commencement of the Act, the second limb would not have to depend for its survival on the continuance of the first. in such a case, the second limb of the custom could operate, and in relation to such an adoption, the second limb would be the law in force. Therefore, the second limb of the custom relating to revocability continued in force in its application to such an adoption. [40C-H] (Per Untwalia, J.) (1) There is no substance in the contention that revocation could be made only on some reasonable grounds and the custom required it to be so. No reason was necessary to be stated or proved to sustain the revocation. [43G-H] (2) In the deed of cancellation the respondent had stated that if it was believed that the respondent had taken the appellant in adoption, then she was cancelling and annulling it. It could not, therefore, be said that the document does not legally revoke the adoption. [43A; 44A-B] (3) (a) Section 30 is a saving clause in the Act and according to it the provisions of the Act are not to affect any adoption made before its commencement, that is to say, the validity of the adoption made before the commencement of the Act as also its effect will have to be examined and determined with reference to the law or the custom as it stood prior to the coming into force of the Act and not in accordance with it. The expression "affect any adoption" necessarily mean; affect in adoption as to its "validity and effect". Neither of the expression takes within its sweep any of the other incidents or characteristics of the law or the custom of adoption under which it was made. Therefore, the incident or characteristic of this custom which entitled either party to revoke the adoption was not a matter concerning the validity and effect of adoption, and the High Court was not right in holding that the right of revocation is one of the effects or goda datta adoption and is saved by s. 30. [44D-B] (b) Section 4 is clearly prospective and not retrospective.
 No adoption could be made in the goda datta form after the coming into force of the Act and hence there would be no question of its revocation. if s. 15 prohibits cancellation of an adoption validly made even prior to the commencement of the Act then it is manifest that s. 4 finishes the custom of cancellation after the commencement of the Act, by a prospective operation and not by any retroactive action.
 The question therefore, would be whether cancellation of the adoption of the appellant was in contravention of s. 15 of the Act. If it was so, the cancellation was invalid and could not be saved by s. 30. [46D-G] 4-L379Sup CI/75 34 (c) Section 15, however, applies only to an adoption which has been validly made in accordance with the provisions of the Act and after its commencement. In its context and set up, its applicability cannot be enlarged and the section can.not be permitted to embrace any adoption which has been validly made before the commencement of the Act. The legislature did not intendto change the incident or characteristic of a goda datta adoption, which made the position of the adopted person in that form, nothing higher than that of adignified employee engaged to perform rites and enjoy the privileges for the timehe continued to be such a son. Or it may be that the legislature inadvertently lift thecustom of revocability of goda datta adoption untouched by s. 15. Ineither view of the matter cancellation, of the adoption of the appellant made by the respondent, by the registered document, is in accordance with the custom of goda datta and hence, there is no violation of the law contained in s. 15. [47 C-G] Per Mathew, J; (dissenting) (1) The custom of goda datta adoption has been abrogated by s. 4(1) read with s. 5 of the Act and s. 30 saves only the effect ;and validity of an adoption made before the Act. But it is difficult to think how a custom revoking such an adoption could continue in force after the custom of making the adoption in that form has been abrogated by the Act, because, the continuance of the custom of cancellation was dependent upon the continuance of the custom of making the adoption, [35B-D] (2)The Act provides only for the method and form of adoption after the cominginto force of the Act and it has made no provision for cancellation of an adoption except in s. 15. Assuming that s. 15 relates only to an adoption made after the commencement of the Act, unless the right to cancel the adoption under the custom become an. accrued right before the commencement of the Act, the -custom of cancelling an adoption would not continue. Therefore, if the adoption wants to cancel such an adoption after the commencement of the Act he can do so only by establishing that he had an accrued right on the date of adoption or, at any rate, before the abrogation of the custom to cancel it, in which case, the ,custom to cancel the adoption would be deemed to continue for cancelling it notwithstanding the fact that, as custom, it has ceased to operate after the commencement of the Act. The effect of the abrogation of the custom can be equated in principle to the repeal of a law. [35E-H] (3)That apart, the legislature has saved by s. 30 only an adoption made, before the Act, its validity and effect.
 When the legislature has, chosen to make a specific provision to save only the validity and the effect of adoptions already made,, (-which would have been saved even without such a provision under the ,general principle of law notwithstanding the abrogation of the custom) the inference is that the legislature did-not want to save the right to cancel the adoption. The express saving in s. 30 of only the validity and effect of adoption can only lead to the.
 conclusion that the legislature did not want to save the incident of revocability attached to it by custom.
