 By Presidential resolution dated 12th August, 1959, the Government of India, under the proviso to Art. 309 of the Constitution, combined two services of Central Excise Service Class I and Indian Customs Service Class I with effect from 15th August, 1959. AR the petitioners joined the respective services with effect from 13th July, 1'959.
 Later by decision dated 7th April 1970 the Government decided that a combined list of seniority of officers in the service should be prepared with reference to April 1, 1959, as being the date of merger. The petitioners complained that by reason of this they were excluded from the list of officers appointed to the initial constitution to the combined cadre even though they had joined the two separate services on 13th July, 1959, with the result that persons junior to them had become seniors.
 It was contended that the date of 1st April, 1959 on which the two services were combined for the purpose of inter se seniority was an artificial date chosen arbitrarily and is sought to be given effect to without any legal authority.
 
HELD : The contention must be upheld. The Government had no authority to override the Presidential resolution by any subsequent decision which lacked legal authority and was violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution. The Presidential Resolution of 12th August, 1959 which drew its authority from the proviso to Art. 309 was clear and categorical in that it not only showed that the question of integration of the Central Excise Service Class I and the Indian Customs Service Class I which was older of the two services was under consideration of the Government of India for quite sometime but that "the President has now been pleased to decide that the two services should be constituted into a single service with effect from 15th August, 1959" and that "the services will initially be formed from amongst all the existing class I officers of the Customs and Central Excise Services who will henceforth be borne on a single combined cadre for all purposes". The subsequent decision of the Government conveyed in the letter of 7th April 1970 had no legal authority as it was not purported to have been made in the name or with the authority of the President of India nor did it in any way seek to amend the Presidential Resolution of 12th August, 1959 nor did it purport to change the date on and from which the integration was given effect to. [594 C; 593 B-D] Since a final decision was taken on 7th April, 1970 the petitioners could not have come to this Court earlier. [592 H]
