 The appellant was a contractor entrusted to construct a Dam by the Kerala State Electricity Board. Disputes arose between the appellant and the respondent about the non- execution of the work. 5 points were referred for the deci- sion of 2 arbitrators. The arbitrators appointed an Umpire.
 The Arbitrator did not make the award within the time limit which was extended from time to time. Thereupon the appellant filed an application for revoking the authority of the arbitrators on the ground that the arbitrators did not make the award within the time limit and it was further prayed that the Umpire might be directed to enter upon the reference to proceed with the arbitration. One of the arbitrators in his statement submitted that he had no objection to his being discharged as he no longer wished to be an arbitrator. The appellant also filed another applica- tion praying to appoint the Umpire as a Sole Arbitrator in place of the two arbitrators. The Court by its order dated the 22nd June, 1972 revoked the authority of the arbitrators and directed the Umpire to enter upon the reference in his capacity as Umpire and also appointed the Umpire as the sole arbitrator. The trial court noted in its order that the Umpire was directed to make the award by consent of parties.
 The appellant and the respondent participated in the proceedings before the Umpire without demur. The Umpire made an award in favour of the appellant for nearly Rs. 30 lacs. The respondent filed an application challenging the award under sections 16, 30 and 33 of the Arbitration Act and praying to set aside the award. The appellant field an application to pass a decree in terms of the award. The Trial Court dismissed the application filed by the respondent and passed decree in terms of the award.
 On an appealfiled by the respondent, the High Court came to the conclusion that the Umpireas sole arbitrator had no jurisdiction to pass the award as the orders revoking the authority of the arbitrators to pass an award and appointing the Umpire as sole Arbitrator was bad in law and that no sufficient opportunity was given to the respondent to substantiate its objections to the award.
 On appeal by special leave it was contended by the respondent before this Court that the Umpire as sole Arbitrator had no jurisdiction to enter upon the reference and pass the award. It was also contended that the Umpire has allowed certain time barred claims of the appellant without examining the grievances of the claims.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : Since the order was passed by the consent of the parties the Umpire had the jurisdiction. Even apart from the consent of the parties rule 4 in the First Schedule to the Arbitration Act authorities the Umpire to enter upon the reference in case arbitrators fail to make award within the time specified. The Umpire did notlose his jurisdiction to pass the award merely because he wanted in order fromcourt by way of abundant caution authorising him to enter upon the reference.[818E-G] 
HELD FURTHER : There is no doubt that the order was consent order. The respondent made no endeavour to have that order vacated by filing a review, if the statement in that order that it was passed on the basis of consent proceeded on a 812 mistake of the court. On the other hand respondent participated in the proceedings before the Umpire. The respondent is precluded from challenging the jurisdiction of the Umpire by acquiescence. [817G-H] 
HELD FURTHER: Negativing the contention that the Umpire should have examined the genuineness of the claims and whether the claims were time-barred. In the award the Umpire has referred to the claims under this head and the arguments of the respondent for disallowing the claim and thereafter awarded the amount without expressly aderoting to or deciding the question of limitation. From the findings of the Umpire under this head it is not seen that these claims were barred by limitation. No mistake of law appears on the faze of the award. The Umpire as sole arbitrator was not bound to give a reasoned award and if in passing the award he makes a mistake of law or fact that is no ground for challenging the validity of the award. It is only when a proposition of law is stated in the award and it is the basis of that award that is erroneous, can the award be set aside or remitted on the grounds of error of law apparent on the face of the record. An error of law on the face of the award means that you can find in the award or a document actually incorporated thereto stating the reasons for his judgment, some legal proposition which is the basis of the award and which you can say is erroneous. The Court has no jurisdiction to investigate into the merits of the case and to examine the documentary and oral evidence on the record for the purpose of finding out whether or not the arbitrator has committed an error of law. [820F-H; 821E-D] ARGUMENTS For the appellants :
 
1. The High Court of Kerala erred in holding that the order of the Subordinates Judge, Trivandrum, dated the 22nd June 1972 in O.P. 11 of 1972 was made without jurisdiction and in further holding that the Umpire who entered on reference consequent upon the said order had no jurisdiction for the following reasons :
 (a) The order in O.P. 11 of 1972 is by consent of parties.
 The consent given by the counsel for both sides before the learned Sub Judge amounts to a fresh arbitration agreement.
 Therefore, the Umpire had jurisdiction to enter on reference.
 (b) Before the learned Subordinate Judge both the arbitrators expressed their unwillingness to continue as arbitrators. Admittedly, the arbitrators failed to make an award within the prescribed time. The time having been extended five times earlier and the last date of the extended period having expired on 18th December, 1971 the Umpires could have entered on the reference on any day after the 19th December, 1971. However, as the appellant approached the Court of Subordinate Judge on 28th January, 1972 and as the respondent Board by its letter informed the Umpire that they would be approaching the court for enlarge- ment of time, the Umpire did not enter on reference forthwith. After O.P. It was allowed as per the agreement of parties and after O.P. 19 filed by the Board for enlargement of time of the arbitrators, was dismissed on the same date, the Umpire was bound to enter on reference forthwith both under the order of the Court and under Rule 4 of Schedule I of the Arbitration Act. Therefore, all that the court did in asking the Umpire to enter on reference as Umpire was to parry out the provisions of Rule 4 of Schedule I to the Arbitration Act.
 (c) The Board is precluded from challenging the authority of the Umpire inasmuch as he entered on reference pursuant to consent of parties. The Respondent Board participated in the proceedings without any protest. Therefore, the Board is estopped from challenging the authority of the Umpire.
 The Board by their conduct in participating in the proceedings before the Umpire is deemed to have waived the objections, if any, against the jurisdiction of the Umpire.
 There was no inherent lack of jurisdiction in the Umpire and therefore the participation by the Board amounts to acquiescence. They are estopped from challenging his authority.
 (d) After 18-12-1971 on which day the enlarged time for the arbitrators to make the award expired the arbitrators became functous officio.
 (e) In substance, the function of an 'Umpire' and a 'sole arbitrator' is the same. In fact the order of Court under Section 12(2) is later in point of time and hence it can be ignored if it was unnecessary.
 813 2.The High Court was in error in exercising its suo moto jurisdiction in setting aside the order dated the 22nd June 1972 in O.P. 11 of 1972. The learned Subordinate Judge was the competent authority to entertain an application under Sections 5, 11 and 12 of the Arbitration Act. Therefore, his order asking the Umpire to enter on reference does not suffier from jurisdictional errors enumerated in Section 115 of the C.P.C. The court could exercise suo moto power of revision only if the order could be revised under Section 115.
 3.The award being an award of money and there being no reason given for the award, there could be no error in the award much less on the face of it. The arbitrator is not bound to give reason for the award and he has given none.
 The court is not competent to enter into an elaboratre discussion of the evidence etc., in order to find out whether there is any error in the award. The synopsis of contesting parties does not form part of an award.
 The High Court has proceeded as though it is sitting in appeal on the award.
 The arbitration agreement specifically states that no other question of dispute, or difference, arisings, settlements except those detailed in the agreement remains. So, the dispute as to who caused the breach of contract has also been given up. Since there is no dispute as to who caused the breach of contract the security amount which is appellant's own money is liable to be refunded without any protest. Hence the Umpire was competent to make the award in respect of the said sum and has rightly awarded it to the appellant. The 'retention amount' and the "amount withheld" are clearly in respect of the 'work'.
 The claim of the appellant was to the extent of about Rs. 78 lakhs. The Umpire, after considering the objection of the respondent disallowed claims upto about Rs. 48 lakhs on the ground that they are outside the scope of the arbitration agreement. After this, the respondent participated in the arbitration without protest. They are now estopped from challenging the award on the ground of excess of jurisdiction.
 The Umpire, being a Judge, both in respect of questions of law and fact is competent to decide even the question of limitation. From the synopsis of arguments narrated by the Umpire it is clear that he has considered the plea of limitation raised by the Respondent. If the Umpire has considered the question the court cannot be asked to reopen the matter.
 The appellant has withdrawn O.S. 33 in the Court of Subordinate Judge, Badagara pursuant to the arbitration agreement. The suit was within the period of limitation.
 Therefore, the claim is within the period of limitation.
 Since the claim under Item No. 1 specifically formed part of the arbitration agreement the Board is precluded from raising the plea of limitation. The Board was competent to contract and admit even time-barred claims under Section 25 of the Contract Act.
 Therefore, the award is not liable to be set aside either on the ground of limitation or on the ground that the matter relating to security deposit etc., falls outside the scope of reference. At any rate, both the above claims are distinct and severable from the rest of the award.
 3.The court has to decide the application under Section 33 only on affidavits. It is only if the court feels that evidence is required it can permit adducing of evidence.
 The court in this case considered the affidavits and arguments and found that no ground is made out to require oral evidence being adduced. The application filed by the respondent to set aside the award and the affidavit in support of it clearly show that on none of the grounds mentioned therein the award can be set aside. Therefore, the court was right in not permitting adducing of evidence.
 The respondent had sufficient opportunity to convince the court that the award suffers from error apparent on the face of the award.
 Arguments for Respondent No. 1 1.The High Court, was right in holding that the Umpire had no jurisdiction to make the award and that the award is therefore invalid. The order passed by the trial court on O.P. 11 of 1972 on 22-6-1972, revoke the authority of the two 814 arbitrators, was wholly outside the scope of Sections 5 and 11 of the Arbitration Act, 1940. In the trial court the appellant's advocate had expressly given up all contentions of fact including the contention that the said order on O.P.
 11 of 1972 was a consent order. He must also be deemed to have given up the contention that the respondent Electricity Board had acquiesced in the proceedings before the Umpire and is estopped from challenging the award. The correspondence between the Umpire and the appellant shows that the Umpire had rightly refused to enter on the reference under clause 4 of Schedule I of the Arbitration Act. If the trial court had not wrongly allowed O.P. 11 of 1972, it was bound to allow the respondent's application for extension of time of the arbitrators, being O.P. 1 9 of 1972. The Umpire's purported jurisdiction must therefore be traced only to the trial court's order on O.P. 11 of 1972 which was clearly invalid.
 2.Supposing that the Umpire had jurisdiction to make the award, the order of thetrial court passed on 10-4-1973 in O.P. 21 of 1973 (dismissing the respondent'sapplication for setting aside the award and granting the appellant's application for passing a decree in terms of the award) deserves to be set aside and the respondent's application for setting aside the award restored. The trial court's order dated 10-4-1973 is vitiated because the court arbitrarily refused to allow the respondent to lead any evidence and even to file an affidavit in rejoinder. This had caused injustice to the respondent.
 3.Without prejudice to the above contentions, it is submitted that in any case the award is clearly bad in respect of the following :
 (a) The arbitrator acted beyond the scope of reference in awarding to the appellant the sum of Rs. 1,81,500/- which was paid by him by way of security for the due performance of the contract. Under item 2(a) of the agreement of reference the appellant was only entitled to be paid for the value of the work done by him;
 this item did not include the amount of security which could be refunded to him only if he had duly performed his part of the contract. The question whether the appellant had duty performed his part of the contract and was entitled to a refund of the security, was not referred to arbitration, and the arbitration agreement had specifically provided that points of dispute not referred to arbitration were "deemed to be abandoned".
 (b) The four claims amounting to Rs.
 4,95,000/- which were covered by point I of the points of reference were patently barred by limitation. The award on its face shows that these claims had arisen before the end of March 1966 that the agreement of reference was made more than three years thereafter on 22-8- 1970 and that there was not even a contention raised by the appellant that there was any acknowledgement or part payment so as to extend the period of limitation. The award of Rs. 4,95,000/- was thus clearly based upon an erroneous assumption of law and the award is to that extent vitiated by in error of law apparent in the face thereof.
