 On October 2, 1946, the Associated Hotels of India Ltd., and its managing director, Mohan Singh Oberoi, appellant 1 and 2 respectively, entered into an agreement with the respondent for purchasing certain property from the latter for a price of Rs. 52,75,000 and paid Rs. 5 lacs as earnest money; but as the respondent's title to the property was found to be defective the sale was not completed. The appellants filed a suit in the Court of Senior Subordinate judge at Lahore for the recovery of Rs. 5,10,000 which included the earnest money and interest accruing thereon, and the suit was decreed for Rs. 5,08,333/5/4 with future interest in favour of appellant NO. 2 on March 14, 1949. The claim of appellant No. I was rejected. On appeal by the respondent the High Court at Lahore reversed the decree of the trial court and dismissed the suit on November 21, 1949. The Federal Court of Pakistan on appeal by the appellants allowed the appeal of appellant NO. 2 on December 21, 1953, and restored the decree passed in his favour by the trial court. After the passing of the decree by the trial court and before the decision of the respondent's appeal in the Lahore High Court the appellants had put the decree in execution which was stayed at the request of the respondent on condition that the respondent should deposit Rs. 3,00,000 in the High Court and furnish security for the balance of the decretal amount. In course of the execution proceedings and after the Federal Court's decree in favour of appellant NO. 2 the main question that arose, inter alia, was whether the deposited sum of Rs. 3,00,000 should be applied towards the satisfaction of the decree of the Federal Court and paid to the decree-holder after transferring it to India or whether the custodian of evacuee property in Pakistan was entitled to the money as evacuee property. The decree- holder and the judgment-debtor were both agreed that the money in question vested in the decree-holder and 34 260 should as requested by him be either transmitted to India or paid to him. This was resisted by the custodian and the High Court held that the money could not be transferred to India, and directed the custodian to report what interest any evacuee had in the money. It was under these circumstances that the appellants made the present application to the Punjab High Court (India) under O. 45, r.
 15, and s. 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure with a prayer for transmitting to the Court of the Senior Subordinate judge, Simla, the proceedings' between the parties for execution of the said decree in accordance with the provisions applicable for execution of original decrees passed by the said judge. Their contention was that as a result of the provisions of Art. 4(3) of the Indian Independence (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1947, the decree passed in favour of appellant No. 2 by the Federal Court of Pakistan had become executable in India as if it had been passed by the Supreme Court of India. The respondent resisted this on the grounds that the application was not entertainable and the decree could not be executed in the absence of a certificate as required by O. 21, r. 6(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure, that the decree did not attract the provisions of Art. 4(3) of the Order and that the decree in question having vested in the Custodian appellant NO. 2 was not entitled to execute it. The relevant portion of Art. 4 of the Indian Independence (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1947, runs thus:- " Notwithstanding the creation of certain new provinces and the transfer of certain territories from the Province of Assam to the Province of East Bengal by the Indian Independence Act, 1947- (1) All proceedings pending immediately before the appointed day in any civil or criminal court (other than a High Court) in the Province of Bengal, the Punjab or Assam shall be continued in that court as if the said Act had not been passed, and that the Court shall continue to have for the purpose of the said proceedings all the jurisdiction and powers which it had immediately before the appointed day;
 (2) Any appeal or application for revision in respect of any proceedings so pending in any such court shall be to the court which would have appellate or as the case may be divisional jurisdiction over that court if the proceedings were instituted in that court after the appointed day, and (3) effect shall be given within the territories of either of the two dominions to any judgment, decree, order or sentence of any such court in the said proceedings, as if it had been passed by a court of competent jurisdiction within the Dominion." Although the High Court held that the decree sought to be executed fell under Art. 4(1) of the order and could be executed under Art. 4(3) of the said order, it came to the conclusion that 261 the " Court of competent jurisdiction " was the Senior Subordinate judge at Simla and that the appellants should have filed their application under O. 45 T. 15, Code of Civil Procedure in that Court. The High Court further held that the application was incompetent owing to absence of a certificate under O. 21, r. 6(b), of the Code, that the judgment debt was property and its situs was Pakistan and that the decree vested in the Custodian of Evacuee Property at Lahore and was not executable at the instance of the appellants. Consequently the High Court dismissed the appellant's application under O. 45, r. 25. On appeal by the appellants on a certificate of the High Court, Held, (Kapur, J., dissenting), that the provisions of Art. 4 of the Indian Independence (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1947, did not apply to the decree sought to be executed by the appellants. The pending proceedings to which Art. 4(1) of the order applied would continue before the specified courts even though the jurisdiction of the said courts might otherwise have been affected by the passing of the Indian Independence Act or the transfer of certain territories.
 Article 4(1) could not be extended to pending proceedings in respect of which the trial court's jurisdiction was in no way affected by the passing of the Act or the transfer of any territories.
 Appeals would be taken against the judgments or orders passed in the said proceedings in the same manner in which they would have been allowed if the Original proceedings had been instituted after the appointed day.
 Protap Kumar Sen and An.Y. v. Nagendra Nath Mazumday, A.I.R.
 1951 Cal. 511, Ahidhar Ghose v. Jagabandhu Roy, A.I.R. 1952 Cal. 846, Naresh Chandra Bose v. Sachindra Nath Deb and Ors, A.I.R. 1956 Cal. 222, not applicable.
 Per Kapur, J.-The High Court could and should have sent down the decree in question to the Senior Subordinate judge, Simla, to execute it in accordance with law.
 The effect of Art. 4(1) and (3) of the Order was that " all proceedings " meaning all suits and other proceedings would continue unaffected by the passing of the Act and the setting up of two provinces of West Punjab and East Punjab, and also that once a decree was passed or sentence pronounced by a court in either of the new provinces of the two Dominions it was to be given effect to as if it was a decree or order passed by a Court of competent jurisdiction in the other Dominion. The amplitude of the language of Art. 4 is not cut down by any words in the article or the Order.
 The meaning of the words appellate jurisdiction " as used in cl. (2) of Art- 4 of the Order is not affected by the subsequent extension of restriction of the jurisdiction of the Court and the decree of the Federal Court of Pakistan is covered by these words.
 262 The word effect " in cl. (3) of Art. 4 is wider than the words " enforce or " execute " and is not equivalent to " being enforced " by suit on a foreign judgment.
 Clause 3 of the Art. 4 is in the nature of a deeming clause and makes the decree of the Pakistan Court (West Punjab) a decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in East Punjab (India).
 Situs of the decree was not Pakistan alone but by a fiction of law the decree was a decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in what was the Dominion of India.
 The provisions of the evacuee law in Pakistan would not affect the rights of the appellant to execute the decree in question in India.
