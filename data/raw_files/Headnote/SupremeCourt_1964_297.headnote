 The appellant was an "occupier", as defined in s. 20(n) of the Factories Act, of certain mills. The manager of the mills contravened the provisions of s. 52 of the Act under which, whenever workers are required to work on a weekly holiday, specific permission of the Chief Inspector of Factories in respect of each and every worker who is required to work on such a day should be obtained. though the manager apprised the appellant of what he was proposing to do, the appellant took no steps to restrain him from putting into operation a new schedule of work which was in violation of s. 52. The appellant was charged with an offence under s. 92 read with s. 52 of the Act and convicted. The conviction was confirmed by the Sessions Court in appeal and by the High Court in Revision. In appeal to the Supreme Court it was contended that under s.
 52(i) (b) (i), the duty was cast upon the manager to give notice to the appropriate authority, of a change in the weekly holiday, and the omission of the manager to give such notice would not render the occupier vicariously liable.
 
HELD : The opening words of the section indicate a prohibition from requiring or permitting an adult worker to work in a factory on the first day of the week. This prohibition is general and is not confined to a manager Me prohibition is lifted if steps are taken under cls. (a) and (b). Under cl. (b) the manager could give and display a notice only for the purpose of securing an exemption from the prohibition and therefore it does not impose a positive duty on the manager to do something. It follows that, where something was done in breach of the prohibition enacted by s. 52(1), both the manager and the "occupier" would be liable. [641 E-G] Moreover, what the manager did was done with the full knowledge and possibly with the consent of the appellant.
 The "occupier" having actual knowledge that the manager was doing something which was not within the purview of s. 52(1) cls. (a) and (b), he must be held guilty of the contravention of the provisions of the sections. [644 E] State Government of Madhya Pradesh v. Magan Bhai Desaibhai, A.I.R. (1954) Nag. 41, referred to.
