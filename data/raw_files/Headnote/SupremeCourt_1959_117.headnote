 The appellant as a trader made purchases of full pressed, cotton bales in the market area of Broach without requisite licence from the market committee, thereby contravening the provisions of r. 65(1) of the Bombay Agricultural Produce Market Rule 1941. The appellant, inter alia, contended that the Act and Rules passed thereunder did not apply to pressed cotton which having been pressed into bales had lost its identity and was no more an agricultural produce and that r.
 65 was ultra vires inasmuch as its provisions were in excess of the rule making power of the State Government.
 Held, that an agricultural produce by being packed in containers or pressed into bales does not in any way change its essential character, and continues to be an agricultural produce, 765 The fact that the cotton ginned or unginned is pressed into bales, or packed otherwise does not make it any less the cotton and is an agricultural produce as defined under S. 2 of the Bombay Agricultural Market Act, 1939.
 Under S. 26 of the Act, the State Government has ample powers to make rules for the regulation of business and conditions of trading in the market and sub-s. (1) of the said s. 26 confers power on the State Government to make r.
 65.
