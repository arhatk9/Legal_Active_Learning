 The respondents were shareholders of a public limited company. The Company maintained its accounts according to the Calendar Year. The company went into liquidation on October 31, 1954. The Liquidators of the company, distributed on March 10, 1955 among the shareholders for each share of the company a share of another company a I share of equal face value. The distribution was made out of profits earned by the company between January 1, 1954 and October 31, 1954. The Income-tax officer brought the value of the shares received by the shareholders to tax on the footing that it represented "accumulated profits" as contemplated by s. 2(6A)(c) of the Income-tax Act. 1922. In appeal the Appellate Assistant Commissioner held that the profits earned between January 1, 1954 and October 31, 1954 were not accumulated profits and when distributed the amount in question represented capital in the hands of the share- holders. This order was confirmed by the Tribunal and upon a reference, by the High Court. On appeal to this Court, 
HELD:Dismissing the appeal, The question whether the distribution was dividend had to be determined in the light of the provisions of s. 2(6A) (c) of the Income-tax Act as amended by the Finance Act of 1955.
 The amount distributed by the liquidator on March 10, 1955, represented the current profits and not profits earned before January 1, 1954. The amount distributed as dividend out of the current profits could not, in the state of law in force in the year of assessment 1955-56, be deemed dividend in the bands of the shareholders.
