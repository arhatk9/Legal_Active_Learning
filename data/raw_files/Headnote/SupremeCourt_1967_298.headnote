 The respondent-Jagirdar, on the resumption of his jagir under the provisions of the Rajasthan Land Reforms and Resumption. of Jagirs Act, 1952, claimed certain agricultural lands as his Khudkhast land. The Divisional Commissioner accepted the recommendation made by the Collector and directed the Collector to enter the land as Khudkhast of the respondent. On appeal the Board of Revenue, remanded the case to the Divisional Commissioner with a direction that he should refer the matter to the Jagir Commissioner. The Jagir Commissioner, held it to be the personal property of the respondent. The State appealed to the Board of Revenue, which remanded the case to the Jagir Commissioner to dispose of the matter after proper enquiry in accordance with the provisions of Jagir Rules framed under the Act. Thereupon the respondent move(] the High Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution and the High Court quashed the orders of the Board of Revenue holding that no enquiry under s. 23(2) of the Act was necessary and it required disposal in accordance with the procedure laid down in Rajasthan Land Revenue Act, 1956 regarding the correction of the entries. In appeal, to this Court, the appellants contended that (i) the dispute related essentially to the character of he properties, and therefore the Jagir Commissioner had the exclusive jurisdiction to determine the question; and (ii) the Board of Revenue was right in remanding the case the second time, as rr. 23, 24 and 28 of the Jagir Rules, 1954 were not followed inasmuch a,-, the date of hearing was fixed within less than 2 months of the receipt of the order and report was submitted to the Jagir Commissioner without giving the notices and without holding the enquiry.
 HELD : The appeal must be allowed.
 (i) The dispute in this case was essentially as to the character of the property claimed by respondent as khudkhasht and fell directly within the purview of s. 23 of the Act and therefore the Jagir Commissioner was the exclusive authority to hold enquiry into the dispute and give a decision thereon. [670 C] Reading s. 23 of the Act in the context of ss. 46 and 47 of the Act it is manifest that an exclusive jurisdiction is conferred upon the Jagir Commissioner to decide the question as to whether any property of the 662 Jagirdar is of the nature of khudkasht and the decision of the Jagir Commissioner on this question is final and cannot be challenged collaterally in a Civil or Revenue Court. It is true that ss. 125 and 136 of the Rajasthan Land Revenue Act confer power on the Land Records Officer to decide disputes with regard to the entries in the record of rights or in the annual registers, as the case may be. But neither the Land Records Officer nor any other Revenue Courts contemplated by the Rajasthan Land Revenue Act have jurisdiction to enquire into the question whether the property claimed by the Jagirdar is khudkhasht within the meaning of s. 23 of the Act. The reason is that the Rajasthan Land Reforms and Resumption of Jagirs Act, 1952 is a special Act and the general maxim is that a subsequent General Act does not affect a pror special Act by implication- generalia sepcialibus non derogant. [670 F-H;
 671 A] Section 23 of the Act is independent of s. 37 of the Act as it deals with an enquiry of the nature of the property mentioned in s. 23(1) and it has nothing to do with the question of determining the right, title or interest of the Jagirdar in the land. Section 23 empowers the Jagir Commissioner to determine the character of the properties claimed by the Jagirdar as Khudkhasht for determination of the compensation to be paid and determining other questions which are incidental to the resumption of the Jagir land., On the other hand s. 37 of the Act deals with questions of disputed titles and with regard to such a question the section makes a provision for enquiry either by the Jagir Commissioner or by a revenue authority under the Rajasthan Land Revenue Act, 1956. It is manifest that the scope of s.
 37 is quite different from that of s. 23 and the nature of the enquiry contemplated by the two sections also is different. [671 E-G] Barker v. Edger [1898] A.C. 748. referred lo.
 (ii) The Board of Revenue was right in taking the view that the Jagir Commissioner should have followed the procedure prescribed by the statutory rules. [673 F]
