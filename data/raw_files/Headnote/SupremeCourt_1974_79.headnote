 The appellant was convicted u/s 353/332/333 of the Indian Penal Code and was sentenced accordingly. The prosecution case was that the appellant obstructed 3 inspectors and a peon of the Delhi Municipal Corporation, when they went to seize the appellants' buffalo in the discharge of their duty to realise the milk tax from him and struck one of the officers on the nose with the result that it bled and was found fractured.
 The main contention of the appellant was that the attempt to realise the arrears of milk tax and recovery charges was illegal because no demand noticed under Sec. 154 of the Act was served on the appellant, and therefore, he had the right of private defence.
 The prosecution relied on Sec. 99 Indian Penal Code which provides that there is no right of private defence against an act of a public servant, done in good faith under colour of his office, though that act may not be strictly justi- fiable by law. Further according to the prosecution, Sec.
 161 of them Act empowered the Inspector of the Corporation to seize and remove the appellant's buffalo for non-payment of tax and the section gave them an over-riding power to resort to seize and detention of the animal. Therefore, according to the prosecution, the appellant was guilty of the offences charged.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) Although the interpretation placed by the High Court that seizure and detention of a vehicle or an animal is possible under sec. 161 at anytime after the tax has become due' when read in the light of other provisions of the Act, it has to be remembered that section 161 would become the repository of a rather drastic power of acting without previous notice to seize any animal' or vehicle at any time after the tax became, due, and thereby, of seriously injuring even innocent individuals who may have every intention and the capacity to pay the demanded tax, but may have defaulted only by some oversight and may be unable to produce the required money on the spot. It is well settled that out of two possible internationals, the one which confines the content of such power of seizure to reasonable limits and fair modes of operation should be preferred. [831 D] Therefore, although Sec. 161 of the Act can be used 'at any time'. against a defaulter, yet a defaulter in view of sees.
 154 and 155 of the Act would be a person who refuses to pay within a period specified in Sec. 155 of the Act after a notice of demand u/s. 154 of the Act. Although the demand of notice is optional, yet, but the option has to be exercised if it is intended to invoke the powers contained in sec. 161. [831 F] (ii) The Inspectors were acting honestly in exercise of the powers delegated' to them, but they had erred in the exercise of their powers. They, however, cannot be presumed to know that a notice under sec. 154 must precede any attempt of seizure. Therefore. there was no legal defect which vitiated their actions. Sec. 99, therefore, did confer a protection upon the employees of the Corporation who acted in good faith under the colour of their office.
 But since they acted in an improper manner in demanding immediate payment, the sentences imposed upon the appellant were excessive. The sentenced, therefore, were reduced to the period already undergone by the appellant but the convictions were upheld. The fine imposed upon the appellant was also set aside.[832 A-C] 828
