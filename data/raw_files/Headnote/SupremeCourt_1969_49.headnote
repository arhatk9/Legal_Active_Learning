 The assessee carried on two businesses in Bidi leaves as partner in two different firms. The first firm consisted of two partners, and the second of four; both these firms were assessed to income tax separately and it was admitted that the two firms had nothing to do with each other. The first firm sustained losses and was dissolved. The assessee claimed that the losses sustained by him in the previous year (sustained in the first firm) should be carried forward and set off against his profit in the subsequent year (earned in the second firm) under s. 24 (2) (ii) of the Income-tax Act, 1922 as the assessee carried on the business in Bidi leaves during that year. The Income-tax Officer rejected the claim, and his order was upheld by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. But the Appellate Tribunal accepted the claim and the question was answered by the High Court in the assessee's favour. The Revenue appealed to this Court and contended that for getting the benefit under s. 24(2) (ii) the same concern or partnership which carried on in the previous year should continue to function in the year of assessment.
 HELD : The appeal must be dismissed.
 In order to get the benefit of s. 24 (2) (ii) of the Act especially after the amendment made by the Finance Act 1955 it was not necessary that the assessee should carry on the same business in the year of assessment. The change in the language of the provision substituted by the Amending Act was significant and all that the assessee had to show was that the business in which loss was originally sustained continued to be carried on by him in the assessment year.
 If the first partnership was dissolved it did not mean that his business in Bidi leaves came to an end so long as he continued to do that business either individually or in partnership with others. During the assessment year in question he was carrying on that business in partnership with three others. According to the provisions of s. 24(2) as they stood before the amendment made by the Finance Act of 1955 he continued to carry on the same business but for the purpose of the present case s. 24(2) (ii) as it stood after the amendment was relevant and on the plain language of the aforesaid provision the business in which the loss was originally sustained was continued during the assessment year. The word "business" has been defined in s. 2(4) of the Act as including any trade, commerce or manufacture or any adventure or concern in the nature of trade, commerce or manufacture. These words are of wide import the underlying idea being of continuous exercise of an activity. In the present case, the business did not depend on the constitution of a partnership firm through which it was carried on nor could it come to an end so long as the assessee carried on the same systematic or organised course of activity with a set purpose. [786 G--787 C] 783 When the profits of a registered firm are ascertained, the assessee for the purpose of paying tax is not the registered firm but each partner of that firm. The identity of the business for the purpose of s. 24(2)(ii) does not change by reason of the change in persons who carry on that business since it continues to be carried on by the same individual.
 A set off for loss which had been carried forward from the earlier years under the provisions of s. 24 would only be available to the individual partner who had suffered the loss and not to the other partners of the firm or the firm.
