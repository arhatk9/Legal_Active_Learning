 By a common judgment the petitioner and the two other accused (JS and KS) were convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of four persons. The High Court affirmed their conviction and sentence.
 The special leave petition filed by JS was dismissed and he was executed. The sentence of death passed on KS was commuted by this Court into imprisonment for life. The petitioner's ('HS's) special leave petition and later his review petition were dismissed by this Court and his petition to the President of India for commutation of death sentence was dismissed, whereupon he filed the present petition.

 HELD: The petitioner and the other two co-accused were sentenced to death by a common judgment. No distinction could at all be made between the part played by KS and the petitioner. Since the death sentence in his case was commuted by this Court it would be unjust to confirm the death sentence imposed upon the petitioner. [238 B-C] In view of the background of the case it would not be wrong if this Court had commuted the sentence of death imposed upon the petitioner but in the interest of comity between the powers of this Court and the powers of the President it would be more in the fitness of things if this Court were to recommend that the President be so good as to exercise his power under Article 72 of the Constitution to commute the death sentence into imprisonment for life because the President had already considered the mercy petition of the petitioner once and had rejected it. [238 E- G] [The Court directed that prior to the actual execution of any death sentence the Jail Superintendent should ascertain personally whether the sentence of death imposed upon any of the co-accused of the prisoner 236 who was due to be hanged had been commuted. If it had been commuted, the Superintendent should apprise the superior authorities of the matter, who must take prompt steps for bringing the matter to the notice of the Court concerned.] [239 A-B] (Per A.N. Sen, J. concurring) It would be unjust to allow the death sentence imposed on the petitioner executed. [242 G] Considering that the responsibility, involvement and complicity of the petitioner in the commission of the offence is the same as that of the other co-accused, it would be sheer travesty of justice if for the same offence the petitioner had to pay the extreme penalty of death while the death sentence imposed on the co-accused, for the very same offence had been commuted to one of life imprisonment.
 Had the petitioner mentioned either in the special leave petition or review petition or mercy petition to the President this all important and significant fact, death sentence imposed on him would have been commuted.[242 C-F] Apart from the very wide jurisdiction and powers conferred on this Court under Arts. 32 and 136 of the Constitution this Court retains and must retain, an inherent power and jurisdiction for dealing with any extra-ordinary situation in the larger interests of administration of justice and for preventing manifest injustice being done.
 This power must necessarily be sparingly used for furthering the ends of justice. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of this and interfere case, this is a fit case where this Court should entertain the present petition. [243 A-C] Since in the instant case the petitioner's mercy petition had earlier been considered by the President propriety and decorum require that the matter should be referred back to the President.
