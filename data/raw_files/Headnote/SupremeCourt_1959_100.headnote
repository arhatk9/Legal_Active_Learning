 The suit, out of which the present appeal arose, was one originally brought by the respondent against the State of junagadh, later on substituted by the State of Saurashtra, for a declaration that the Administrator's order dated October i, 1948, resuming the immoveable property in suit was illegal, unjust and against all canons of natural justice. The suit was decreed by the Civil judge and the decree was affirmed by the High Court in appeal. The only point for determination in this appeal was whether the act of Resumption by the Administrator was an act of State performed on behalf of the Government of India and involved an alien outside the State and was not, therefore, justiciable in the municipal Courts. With the passing of the Indian Independence Act 1947, and lapse of paramountcy by -reason Of S. 7 thereof, the Nawab of junagadh became sovereign, but instead of acceding to the new Dominion he left for Pakistan. It appeared from the White Paper on Indian States that the Government of India took over the administration of the State on November 9, 1947, at the request of the Nawab's Council, but did not formally annex it till January 2o, 1949, and during that period the Administrator maintained law and order and carried on the administration.
 Held, that there could be no, doubt that the act of the Dominion of India in assuming the administration of junagadh State was an act of State pure and simple and the resumption in 538 question having been made by the Administrator before that act was completed and at a time when the people of junagadh, including the respondent, were aliens outside the State, the act of resumption, however arbitrary, was an act of State on behalf of the Government of India and was not, therefore, justiciable in the municipal Courts.
 The test in such cases must be whether the State or its agents purported to act " catastrophically " or subject to the ordinary course of law.

 The essence of an act of State was the arbitrary exercise of sovereign power, on principles other than or paramount to the municipal law. Although the sovereign might allow the inhabitants to retain their old laws and customs, it could not itself be bound by them until it purported to act within them, thus bringing to an end the act of State.
