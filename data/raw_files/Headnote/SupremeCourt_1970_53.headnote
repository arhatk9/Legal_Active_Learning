 The appellant, who was the President of the local Municipal Committee, was convicted under Section 500 of the Indian Penal Code on a complaint that he had made defamatory remarks in respect of the character of the complainant, a- Nurse attached to the Civil Dispensary, at a public meeting;
 that he wrote a letter to the Civil Surgeon which contained defamatory statements against her character and also repeated the defamatory allegations before the Civil Surgeon. The appellant's plea of justification under exceptions 1, 8 and 9 of s. 499 I.P.C. was rejected by the trial court and his appeal to the High Court was also dis- missed. On appeal to this Court HELD On the facts, the appeal must be dismissed.
 In order to come within the First Exception to s. 499 it has to be established that what has been imputed concerning the respondent is true and the publication of the imputation is for the public good. The onus of proving these two ingredients was on the appellant but he totally failed to establish these pleas. On the contrary, the evidence showed that the imputation concerning the respondent was not true but was motivated by animus of the appellant against the respondent. [917 H] The Eighth Exception to s. 499 indicates that an accusation in good faith against the person to any of those who have lawful authority over that person with respect to the subject matter of the accusation is not defamation, but in the present case there was utter lack of good faith in the accusation. Good faith requires care and caution and prudence in the background of context and circumstances.
 The position of the person making the imputation will regulate the standard of care and caution. 1918 Cl The Ninth Exception provides. that if the imputation is made in good faith for the protection of the person making it or for another person or for the public good it is not defamation. Apart from the lack of good faith there was no evidence to support the Plea that the imputation was for the public good. Furthermore the interest has to be real and legitimate when communication is made in protection of the interest of the person making it. [918 D] The plea that the letter to the Civil Surgeon was privileged because as the President of the local Municipal Committee the appellant had to write to the Civil Surgeon about the work of the complaint was not taken at the trial and there was no evidence to support it. Furthermore, the privilege extends only to a communication upon the subject with res- pect.to which the privilege extends and the privilege can be claimed in exercise of the right or safeguard of the interest which creates the privilege. In the present case the concurrent findings of fact repel any suggestion 914 of protection of the interest of the appellant in making the insinuations against the respondent contained in the letter forming the subject matter of the complaint.
