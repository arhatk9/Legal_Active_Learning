 Respondent No. 1 is an undertaking in the Textile Processing Industry which was recognised as such under the Bombay Industrial Relations Act. Respondent No. 2 namely, the General Workers' Union, Bhadra, Ahmedabad is a representative union of all the employees of the various undertakings registered by the Registrar as undertakings in the Textile Processing Industry in the local area of Ahmedabad city and city Taluka irrespective of the fact that the employees of any of the aforesaid undertakings may or may not be members of the representative union and is registered and recognised as such under the provisions of the Act. An industrial reference No. 176/1976 was made to the Industrial Court at Ahmedabad on 27-7-76 as respondent No. 1 did not agree to a desire of respondent No. 2 for a change in respect of classification, pay scales, dearness allowance, casual leaves, festival holidays and certain other industrial matters. In May, 1976 a new rival union was formed under the name and style of "New Labour General Trade Union, Ahmedabad" which was registered under the Trade Unions Act on June 3, 1976. This new Union by its letter dated June 8, 1976, raised certain demands regarding issue of permanent entry passes, casual leave, festival holidays, provident fund, Employees State Insurance Scheme, bonus, dearness allowance which were not heeded to by respondent No. 1 on the ground that the Union could not be treated as a representative union under the Act. Since every effort of theirs failed to elicit any response from respondent No. 1, the New Union gave a strike notice on September 2, 1976.
 Pursuant thereto 131 employees of respondent No. 1 went on strike on September 24, 1976, whereupon an application No.
 1455/76. was made on the following day, by respondent No. 1 to the Third Labour Court at Ahmedabad u/s. 79(1) and (4) r/w ss. 78(1)(A)(C) and 97(1) of the Act for a declaration that the action of the workers mentioned in Annexures 'A' and 'B' to the application amounted to an illegal strike.
 In the said proceedings respondent No. 2 appeared as the representative and approved union for the processing industry in the local area where the mills of respondent No.
 1 are situate and filed written statement admitting that the strike resorted to by the workmen was illegal. On October 4, 1976, the appellant and five other employees of respondent No. 1 made an application to the said Labour Court for impleading them as parties to the aforesaid proceedings No. 1455/76 and allowing them to appear and defend the same. On the same day, the appellant and 15 other employees of respondent No. 1 requested the Labour Court to declare the strike as legal. The aforesaid application for being impleaded as parties was rejected by the Labour Court, as per its order dated 6-10-76. On 12-10- 76, the Labour Court allowed the application No. 1455 of 1976 of respondent No. 1 u/s. 79(1) and (4) read with ss. 78 (1 ) (A) (C) and 97 (1 ) of the Act and declared that the employees mentioned in Annexures 'A' and 'B' to the application resorted to an illegal strike w.e.f. 24-9-1976 the continuation whereof was also illegal as it had been resorted to during the pendency of the reference No. 176 of 1976, wherein as a result of negotiations, an interim settlement was arrived at on November 17, 1977. A special Civil Application No. 1845/76 filed by the appellants under Art. 227 of the Constitution for quashing the two orders of the Labour Court dated 6-10-76 and 12-10-76 was dismissed in limine by the Gujarat High Court.
 Dismissing the appeal by special leave, the Court, 12-1114SCI/77 388 
HELD : (1) The legislative intent underlying the scheme of the Bombay Industrial Relations Act being to inculcate and encourage the practice of collective bargaining so that the labour is neither exploited nor victimised and industrial peace and harmony is ensured, the provisions of the Act are designed to emphasize that if labour in an industry is organised through its own union which is registered and recognised under the Act, then it is that union which can appear and do all acts and agitate matters in its representative capacity for the labour and if it does choose to appear or act, then no individual employee is competent to appear and present his point of view. [392 B-C] (2)Section 80 of the Act makes it clear that the Labour Court can permit the parties affected by the dispute to appear in the manner provided by ss. 80A to 80C of the Act, but the discretion conferred on the Labour Court has specifically been made subject to the provisions of Chapter V which deals with "representation of employees and employers and appearance on their behalf". [392 E-F] (3)Section 27A of the Act consists of two parts. While the second part contains the general rule prohibiting the grant of permission to an individual employee to appear or act in any proceeding under the Act except through the representative of the employees, the first part carves out three exceptions to the said general rule which are mentioned in s. 32, 33 and 33A of the Act. Whereas the last exception, that is, the one carved out by s. 33-A of the Act relates to proceedings where the dispute is between employees and employees, the other two exceptions mentioned in ss. 32 and 33 of the Act relate to proceedings in respect of certain other disputes. Sections 32 and 33 of the Act, no doubt, engraft exceptions on the aforesaid general rule embodied in s. 27A of the Act, the provisos appended thereto specifically preclude individual employees from appearing or acting in any proceeding under the Act where the representative union enters appearance or acts as the representative of employees. [392 G-H, 393 A-F] Girja Shankar Kashi Ram v. The Gujrat Spinning and Weaving Co. Ltd [1962] 2 Supp. SCR 890 [1962] 2 L.L.J. 369 (S.C.) and Textile Labour Association, Bhadra Ahmedabad v.
 Ahmedabad Mill Owners Association, Ahmedabad (1970)3 SCC 890 at p. 891, followed.
 (4)Mala fides or bona fides of a representative union has no relevance while considering the provisions of s. 27-A and ss. 32 and 33 of the Act which taken together impose an absolute ban on the appearance of any individual employee in any proceeding under the Act where the representation union chooses to appear or act as representative of the employees.
 In case the employees find that the representative union is acting in a manner which is prejudicial to their interest, their remedy lies in invoking the aid of the Registrar under Chapter III of the Act and asking him to cancel the registration of the union. [395 A-C] Girja Shankar Kashi Ram v. The Gujarat' S inning & Weaving Co. Ltd. [1962] 2 Supp. SCR 890=(1962) 2 L.L.J. 369(S.C), applied.
 N. M. Naik v. Golaba Land Mills (1960) L.I.J. 448, over- ruled.
 (5)A combined reading of ss. 80, 27A, 30, 32 and 33 of the Act leaves no room for doubt that consistent with its avowed policy of preventing the exploitation of the workers and augmenting their bargaining power, the Legislature has clothed the representative union with plenary power to appear or act on behalf of employees in any proceeding under the Act and has deprived the individual employee or workman of the right to appear or act, in any proceeding under the Act where the representative union enters appearance or acts ,is representative of employees. [383 B-C] Girja Shankar Kashi Ram v. The Gujarat Spinning & Weaving Co. Ltd. [1962] 2 Supp. SCR 890=(1962) 2 L.L.J. 369 (S.C.), applied.
 (6)In the instant case (a) neither the appellant nor his other co-employees had any locus standi to appear or act as individual employees in the proceedings initiated by respondent No. 1 in which respondent No. 2 which is a representative union in the industry in the local area had the right to appear and act as the representative of the employees in the industry and did appear or act as such;
 [395 G-H] 389 (b)The new union to which the appellant and some of his co-employees belonged would have no right to appear or act on behalf of the appellant or his co-employees in the proceedings initiated by respondent No. 1 as it had not been registered and recognised as the representative union of employees under the Act. [396 A] [In view of the abstention of the parties from addressing the court regarding the legality or otherwise of the strike, the court refrained from making any observation in regard thereto.]
