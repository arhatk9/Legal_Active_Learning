 Where the report made by a police officer to the Magis- trate complies with the requirements of s. 173 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code the Magistrate can take cognisance of the case 730 under s. 190 (1) (b) of the Code. The fact that a second challan was put in later would not necessarily vitiate the first and invalidate the proceedings taken before the second challan was submitted.
 The right conferred by s. 340 (1) of the Criminal Proce- dure Code does not extend to a right in an accused person to be provided with a lawyer by the State or by the Police or by the Magistrate. That is a privilege given to him and it is his duty to ask for a lawyer if he wants to engage one, or to engage one himself, or get his relations to engage one for him. The only duty cast on the Magistrate is to afford him the necessary opportunity.
 An accused should be properly examined under s. 342 of the Code and, if a point in the evidence is considered important against the accused and the conviction is intended to be based upon it, then it is right and proper that the accused should be questioned about the matter and be given an opportunity of explaining it if he so desires. This is an important and salutary provision and should not be slurred over.
 It is not a proper compliance of s. 342 to read out a long string of questions and answers made in the Committa Court and ask ,the accused whether the statement is correct.
 A question of that kind is misleading. In the next place, it is not sufficient compliance to string together a long series of facts and ask the accused what he has to say about them. He must be questioned separately about each material circumstance which is intended to be used against him.
 Dwarkanath v. Emperor (A.I.R. 1933 P.C. 124) referred to.
 In view of the words "subject to the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act" which occur in s. 288 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the evidence given by a witness in the Committal Court cannot be used as substantive evidence in the Sessions Court unless the witness is confronted with those parts of his evidence which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him, even though, if the only object of the prosecution is to discredit the evidence given in the Sessions Court by cross-examining him with reference to previous statements made in the Committal Court, it is not necessary to do so.
