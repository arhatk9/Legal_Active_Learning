 The Andhra Pradesh Cooperative Societies Act, 1974 created a Central Land Mortgage Bank to supervise the functioning of the Cooperative Land Mortgage Banks in the State. The scheme of the Act is that the provisions of 'Chapter XIII thereof relating to advancement of loans and mode of recovery of the amounts are made applicable to the Cooperative. Land Mortgage Banks in the State. Sec. 85 permits a mortgage bank to advance loans for the purpose specified therein and to hold lands, the possession of which is transferred to it. By virtue of the provisions of section 100-109 any loan granted by a mortgage bank including any interest chargeable thereon and costs, if any, incurred in connection therewith shall, when they become due. be recoverable by the mortgage bank. All powers in respect of the recovery of loans are conferred on the mortgage-banks. The Collector is empowered to make recoveries during a certain period; he is also given the power of distraint and sale. When the power of sale is to ;be exercised, the powers of the mortgage bank where mortgaged property, is destroyed or security becomes insufficient, the power of the Board of Trustees to distrain and sell property are also provided for. The title of the purchaser is not to be questioned on the ground of irregularity nor can a mortgage be questioned on the insolvency of the mortgagor.
 Appointment of a Receiver and his powers are provided for Sections 93 and 94 empower a mortgage bank or the ,Central Mortgage Bank notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force to purchase any mortgaged property sold under Chapter XIII of the Act and the property so purchased shall be disposed of by such banks by sale within such period as may be fixed. Sec. 95 provides, that payment of all monies due to mortgage hanks are payable to it and such payments shall be valid as if the mortgage had not been so transferred. The mortgage bank shall, in the absence of any specific direction to the contrary, issued by the Board of Trustee Ind communicated to the mortgage bank, be entitled to sue on the mortgage or take any other proceeding for the recovery of the moneys due under the mortgage. Sec. 115 provides that subject to the provisions of the Act the Board shall have such power of supervision over the mortgage banks including the power of appointment, transfer and disciplinary action in respect of the employees of mortgage banks as may be prescribed. ]By section 130, the Government is empowered to make rules for carrying out all or any of the purposes of the Act. Sec. 116-A empowers the Registrar of Cooperative Societies to create a common cadre of employees in any class of cooperative society if he considers it necessary in the interest of the cooperative movement to do so.
 Sub-Rule (1) of Rule 70 empowers the Board of Directors of the Central Land Mortgage Bank to constitute a centralised service for the mortgage banks in the State and with effect from such constitution the Board shall have power to make appointments to the posts brought under the centralised service and the 441 mortgage banks shall have no power to make appointments to such posts. Sub-Rule (13) empowers the Board to levy contributions from the mortgage banks towards the cost of service rendered by the Central Mortgage Rank. Sub-rule (14) provides that once a centralised cadre is constituted all rights and privileges accrued and liabilities incurred by the employee in relation to his service in the mortgage bank shall stand vested with the Board.
 In three writ petitions filed before the High Court by employees of different Cooperative Land Mortgage Banks and by one of the banks, it was contended, inter- alia, that r.
 70 was ultra vires of sec. 130(1) read with sec. 115 of the Act. The High Court upheld the contention and allowed the writ petitions. On appeals by special leave to this Court the only question for consideration was whether the High Court was right in declaring Rule 70 of the Rules to be ultra vires of Sec. 115 of the Act.
 Dismissing the appeals, 
HELD : (1) There is nothing in the Act which empowers the Central' Mortgage Bank notwithstanding the fact that it provides funds to the mortgage banks, to make collection of such advances by the mortgage banks. The rule making Power conferred on the Government for carrying out all or any of the purposes of the Act must be confined to such of the purposes as are, enumerated or indicated in the preamble or in any of the provisions of the Act. Under Sec. 115, the Central Mortgage Bank does not have the power either to directly collect the loans and advances given by the member banks, viz., mortgage banks, or to create a centralised cadre of service from among the employees of the mortgage banks which are members of the Central Mortgage bank. That section merely confers power of supervision on the Board of the Central Mortgage Bank over the mortgage banks which power includes the power of appointment, transfer and disciplinary action in respect of the employees of the mortgage banks. It may be that some questions ay be raised in respect of the actions of the mortgage banks in the matter of appointment, transfer and disciplinary actions of its employees. Whenever such questions are raised, the Board of Directors of the Central Mortage Bank in exercise of its power of supervision can go into the question of such appointments, "transfers and disciplinary action made or taken by the mortgage banks. The power conferred by Sec.
 115, therefore, can in no circumstances be construed as empowering the Board of Directors of the Central Mortgage Bank to recruit employees for the mortgage banks or to make appointments to a common cadre created by it from out of the employees of the member mortage Banks. If the employees one appointed by the Central Mortgage Bank, their salaries and other emoluments should be paid by it. But evidently, this is not so as sub-rules (13) and (14) or r. 70 authorise the Central Mortgage Bank to call for contribution for the cost of the service rendered by it to be borne by the mortgage banks and provides that once a centralised service is constituted all rights and privileges accrued and liabilities incurred by ,he employee in relation to his service in the mortgage bank shall stand vested with the Board. The key words in section 115 are "employees of the mortgage banks". The power of supervision including the power of appointment, transfer and punitive action, may be taken by the Central Mortgage Bank against presons who are the employees of the mortgage bank. But rule 70 seeks to bring into being a centralised service, the employees where of' shall be the, eniployees of the Central Mortgage Bank and not of the mortgage banks. Such a centralised service is not contemplated by Sec. 115. [445 E-446 E] (II) The supervisory power in respect of the employees of the mortgage batiks does not include the power of transfer of employee from one mortgage bank to another creating thereby a contract of service with a different employer.
 The word "transfer" in Sec. 115, therefore, must be read as a transfer from one branch of the same mortgage bank to another of its branch. [446 F-G] (III) While the Central Mortgage Bank may be concerned with securing its loans tot the mortgage banks, the provisions of the Act do not confer upon the Central Mortgage Bank the power to collect any loans advanced by 442 the member banks, i.e. the mortgage banks. The security given to the mortgage banks in respect of the loans advanced by them no doubt is deemed to have been transferred to the Central Mortgage Bank, but that is only by way of securing the monies 'advanced by the Central Mortgage Bank to the ,mortgage banks. Nevertheless, the duty to collect loans is upon the mortgage banks and notwithstanding the deemed transfer to the Central Mortgage Bank of any property mortgaged to the mortgage banks, the amount due the mortgage banks is payable to the mortgage banks only and not to the central Mortgage Bank. Unless there is any specific provision in the Act which directly creates a contractual liability between the Central Mortgage Bank and the borrowers from the mortgage banks, the liability of the bor- rowers for payment of loans advanced to them is only to the mortgage banks which actually advanced the loans to them.
 The borrowers have no liability to the Central Mortgage Bank. [447 B-E] (IV) The legislature apparently realised the absence of any power in the Act, and therefore provided for creation of a common cadre of employees when it enacted sec. 116A empowering the Registrar to create a common cadre of employees for any class of society, if he considers it necessary in the interest of the cooperative movement to do so. The power is of a general nature and is applicable to the mortgage banks as well as other societies registered under the Act. Section 116-A also empowers the Registrar to require the affiliated societies to make contribution of such sum every year towards expenditure as may be incurred for the purpose of creation of any common cadre and make such payment enforceable. The High Court is right in hold- ing that when a centralised service or any cadre of employees of the mortgage banks cannot be created by the Board in exercise of its power tinder,s. 115 of the Act, r. 70 cannot vest such power in the Board. In this view, r.
 70 is ultra vires the rule-making power of the State under sub.sec. (1) of Sec. 130 read with Sec. 115 of the Act.
