 Section 3 of the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966 provides penalty for unlawful possession of railway property, the essential requirements being (1) the property in question should be railway property (2) it should reasonably be suspected of having been stolen or unlawfully obtained and (3) it should be found or proved that the accused was or had been in possession of that property. The prosecution alleged that accused 1, 2, 5 (respondents) and the other absconding accused had stolen tyres and tubes from a railway wagon in transit, that accused 1 sold them to accused 3, who removed them in his motor lorry. The prosecution further alleged that accused 3 produced some tyres from his lorry but sold the remaining tyres to accused 4. They were later seized from his possession. The prosecution, therefore, contended that accused 1, 2, 5 and the absconding accused were proved to "have been found in unlawful possession of railway property", while accused 3 and 4 were found in "unlawful possession thereof" within the meaning of section 3 of the Act.
 The trial magistrate refused to frame a charge under section 3 against any of the accused but framed charges under sections 379, 461 and 411 of IPC against all the accused. The State's revision application was rejected by the Additional Sessions Judge. The High Court held that it was not necessary to frame the charge under s. 3 of the Act against accused 1, 2, S and the absconding accused but it however, directed that a charge under that section might be framed as an alternative charge only against the accused 3 and 4.
 The prosecution evidence had not been recorded. On the question whether on the allegations made by the prosecution there was justification for framing a charge under s. 3 of the Act against the accused 1. 2, S and the absconding accused, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The question before the Court was whether it could be said that the accused were found or were proved to have been in possession of the railway property. It was permissible for the prosecution to establish, either that the accused were "found" to be in possession of the railway property, or that they were proved "to have been" in possession thereof. As accused 1. 2, S and the absconding accused were not "found" in possession of the railway property, it was permissible for the prosecution to allege and prove that they had been in possession of that property in order to attract the application of sec. 3 . 11 93E-F] 191 
 2. In view of the categorical allegations against accused 3 to 4 the High A Court was right in directing that they should be charged for an offence under 8. 3 of the Act.
 [193H] 
 3. The allegation against accused 1, 2, 5 and absconding accused was that they had removed the tyres by breaking open the wagon. It is an essential ingredient of the offence of "theft" that the movable property which was the subject matter of the theft should have been "moved" out of the possession of any person without his consent. This could be possible only if the person moving the property had taken it out of the possession of the person concerned and transferred it to his own possession for the purpose of taking it dishonestly. Therefore, transfer of possession of the property, however transient is an essential ingredient of an offence of theft. The allegation against accused 1, 2, 5 and the absconding accused was therefore to the effect that they "had been in possession" of the railway property in question, and that was sufficient to attract the application of s. 3 of the Act. [194 B-D, F] 
 4. The High Court erred in taking the view that it was necessary for the purpose of bringing a case under s. 3 to prove that the accused were found to be in possession of the railway property at the time of its seizure, and that it would not be attracted in the case of an allegation that the railway property was the subject matter of dacoity or theft by the accused. The High Court was wrong in holding that s.
 3 of the Act was meant to meet a situation "analogous to the one for meeting of which s. 124 of the Bombay Police Act has been enacted." Unlike s. 3 of the Act, that section does not go to the extent of penalising the accused where he is proved to "have been found in possession' of that property.
 [194G-195A] 
 5. Although the gravamen under s. 3 of the Act is "possession" of the property, it need not necessarily be a subsisting possession. It is sufficient if the accused was proved to "have been in possession" of that property at any point of time. [195A]
