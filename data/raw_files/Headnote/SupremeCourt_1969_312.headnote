 By article 2 of the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, 1958, to which India was a party, each contracting State, agreed to recognise an agreement in writing under which the parties thereto undertook to submit to arbitration dispute between them and the Court of a contracting State when seized of an action in a matter in respect of which parties have made an agreement "shall at the request of one of the parties refer the parties to arbitration". To implement this Convention Parliament enacted the Foreign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement) Act XLV of 1961 Section 3 of the Act provides, inter alia, that "if any party to a submission made, in pursuance of an agreement" commences any legal proceedings in any Court any other party to the submission may at any time after appearance and before filing a written statement or taking any other step in the proceedings apply to the Court to stay the proceedings and the Court, unless satisfied that the agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed. shall make an order staying the proceedings.
 In respect of a contract entered into by the respondent, an Indian Firm, with the appellant, a Russian firm, the respondent instituted a suit in the Madras High Court alleging breach of contract. Thereafter the Russian firm instituted proceedings in terms of the arbitral clause in the contract before the Foreign Trade Arbitration Commission of the U.S.S.R Chamber of Commerce, Moscow. The Russian firm also entered appearance, under protest, before the Madras High Court and on the same date filed an application under section 3 of the Act for stay of the suit. The Indian firm filed an application for an interim injunction restraining the Russian firm from taking -any further part in the arbitration proceedings at Moscow. The High Court dismissed the application filed by the Russian firm for stay of the suit and granted the interim injunction sought by the Indian firm. In appeal to this Court, the Indian firm contended that s. 3 of the: Act could be invoked by the Russian firm only if it had implemented the arbitration agreement by actually submitting the, dispute for arbitration prior to the institution of the suit. On the questions (i) whether the words "a submission made in pursuance of an agreement" ill section 3 of the Act meant an actual or completed reference made pursuant to an arbitration agreement or they meant an arbitration agreement that has come into existence as a result of commercial contract and (ii) whether the courts in India could grant an injunction restraining a party in Moscow from proceeding with the conduct of arbitration before a tribunal there, 54 
HELD : (Per Shah and Grover, JJ.) The word "submission" in section 3 means an actual submission made in pursuance of an arbitration agreement or arbitral clause to which the Convention setforth in the Schedule to the Act applies. If submission means "agreement to refer" or an arbitral clause in a commercial contract it makes the entire set of words unintelligible and completely ambiguous. It is difficult to comprehend in that case, why the legislature should have used the words which follow the term "submission", namely "made in pursuance of an agreement". If by "agreement" is meant a commercial contract the words "made in pursuance of" convey no sense.
 The difficulties disappear if the word submission, is given the meaning of an actual submission of a particular dispute to the authority of an arbitrator. There is no rule. of interpretation by which rank ambiguity can be first introduced by giving certain expressions a particular meaning and then an attempt can be made to emerge out of semantic confusion and obscurity by having resort to the presumed intention of the legislature to give effect to international obligations. In this country, as is the case in England, a treaty or international protocol or convention does not become operative by its own force unless domestic legislation has been introduced to attain a specific result.
 Once Parliament has legislated the court must first look at the legislation and construe the language employed in it.
 If statutory enactments are clear in meaning they must be construed according.to their meaning even though they are contrary to the comity of nations or international law. A clear deviation from the rigid and strict rule that the courts must stay a suit whenever an international commercial arbitration, as contemplated by the protocol and the Conventions, was to take place, is to be found in Section 3.
 It is of a nature which is common, to all provisions relating to stay in English and Indian arbitration laws, the provision being that the application to the Court for stay of the suit must be made by a party before tiling a written statement or taking any other step in the proceedings. If the condition is not fulfilled no stay can be granted. [65 G-66 H; 68 D] Owners of Cargo on Board the Merak v. The Merak (Owners), (1965) 2 W.L.R. 250, Unipat A.G. v.

 (Per Ramaswami, J. dissenting.) The expression "submission made in pursuance of an agreement" in section 3 has to be construed in its historical setting. The word "submission" must be interpreted to mean tile arbitral clause itself and the word "agreement" as the commercial or the business agreement which includes or embodies that clause. In other words the word "submission" in the opening words of the section means an agreement to refer to arbitration and the words "the agreement to which the convention setforth in the schedule applies" means the business agreement or contract containing the arbitral clause. It follows therefore that if there is an arbitral clause whether this is followed by actual reference to arbitration or not, the very existence of this clause in the commercial agreement would render the stay of the suit mandatory under section 3. This view is considered with the rule of construction that as far as practicable municipal law must be interpreted by the courts in conformity with international obligations which the law may seek to effectuate., It is well settled that if the language of a section is ambiguous or is capable of more than one meaning the protocol itself becomes relevant, for, there is a prima facie presumption that Parliament does not intend to act in breach of international law including 55 specific treaty obligations. Article, 2 of the convention imposes a duty on the court of a contracting state when seized of such an action to refer the parties to arbitration. Section 3 must therefore be read in consonance with this international obligation. The doctrine of literal intepretation is not always the best method for ascertaining the intention of Parliament. The better rule of interpretation is that a statute should be so construed as to prevent the mischief and advance the remedy according to the true intent of the makers of the statute.

 (ii) (Per Shah and Grover, JJ.) The point about the.
 Russian firm having no representative in India was not agitated before the High Court and the position taken up in the plaint was that the-Russian firm was carrying on business in the U.S.S.R. and at Madras. The principle; em- bodied in s. 35 the Arbitration Act, 1940 cannot be completely ignored while considering the question of injunction. In the present case when the suit is not being stayed under section 3 of the Act it would be contrary to the principle underlying s. 35 not to grant an, injunction restraining the Russian firm from proceeding with the Arbitration at Moscow. The principle essentially is that the arbitrator should not proceed with the arbitration side by side in rivalry or in competition as if it were a civil court. [69 H, 70 H] (Per Ramaswami J dissenting.) Even assuming that 3 of the Act is not applicable this is not a proper case in which the High Court should have issued an injunction restraining the appellant from proceeding with the arbitration. As a rule the Court has to exercise its discretion with great circumspection for it is imperative that the right of access; to the tribunals of a country should not be lightly interfered with,. It is not sufficient merely to show that two actions have been started for it is not prima facie vexatious to commence two actions about the same subject matter, one here and one abroad. The reason of this reluctance to exercise the jurisdiction is that owing to a possible difference between the laws of the two countries, the stay of one of the actions may deprive 'the plaintiff of some advantage which he is justified in pursuing. Thus he may have a personal remedy in one country and a remedy only against the goods in another; or a remedy against land in one State but no such remedy in another., The rule, therefore is that a plea of lis alibi pendens will not succeed and the court will not order a stay of proceedings unless the defendant proves vexation in point of fact. He must show that the continued prosecution of both actions is oppressive or embarrassing, an onus which he will :find it difficult to discharge if the 56 plaintiff can indicate some material advantage that is likely to result from each separate action. Each case, therefore depends upon the setting of its own facts and circumstances. [86 H] Mettenry v, Lewis, 22 Ch.D. 401, referred to.
