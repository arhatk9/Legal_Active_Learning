 The respondents were charged with an offence under s. 7 read with s. 16 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954, on the ground that they had stored for sale articles of food, which were adulterated and of sub-standard quality.
 Before the Magistrate, the respondents contended that no articles of food were sold in the hotel to non-resident visitors or the public generally and that the hotel provided residential services and other amenities including meals only to resident customers against a composite charge and that no rebate was allowed for food if a resident customer chose not to eat it. The Magistrate acquitted the respondents.
 On appeal the Division Bench of the High Court referred two questions to the Full Bench, namely, (i) whether for the purposes of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954, there was no sale of food provided by a hotelier to a guest when a consolidated charge was made; and (ii) whether the expression "store" used in ss. 7 and 17 of the Act means storage simpliciter or storing for sale ? The Full Bench held (1) that there was no 'sale' of food to the customer within the contemplation of the Act and (2) that the word "store" used in ss. 7 and 16 means storage for sale.
 Allowing the appeals, ^ 
 HELD : (1) The High Court has over-looked the important distinction between the connotation of "sale" for the purposes of Sales Tax Act and the one under the Prevention of food Adulteration Act. The supply of food by a hotelier to a customer when a consolidated charge is made for residential accommodation and other amenities, including food, amounts to a "sale" of an article of food for the purposes of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act. [1057 B and 1058 F] (a) A comparative study of the definition of 'sale' in the Sales Tax Act and the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act would show that the connotation of "sale" for the purposes of Prevention of Food Adulteration Act is far wider than the meaning assigned to it in the Sales Tax Act. [1056 B] (b) The object of the Sales Tax Act is to levy tax on sales or purchases of certain articles of commerce. The object of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act is to prevent, in the interest of the health of the community, supply of adulterated foodstuffs by a person as a part of his business activity. [1056 F & H] (c) For the purposes of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act the broad test applicable would be, whether the article of food was offered by the hotelier to the resident customer for a money consideration, it being immaterial whether such consideration was a distinct item or was an inseparable element of the consolidated charge made by the hotelier for providing residential accommodation, services, amenities and food. The mere fact that the property in the food article does not pass to the customer before he eats it does not take it out of the definition of "sale" under the Food Act. In the case of food actually consumed, the property does pass to the customer. In other cases, even when the 1051 resident customer does not eat the food offered to him by the hotelier, such an offer by itself would be sufficient to constitute a "sale" of that article of food within the contemplation of s. 2(xiii) of the Food Act. The fact remains that the supply or offer of food to a customer is for a money consideration as a part of business activity and, as such, constitutes "sale" under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act. [1057 C-D 1058 C] (d) The object of assigning so extensive a meaning to the term "sale" is to bring within the ambit of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act all commercial transactions whereunder an adulterated article of food is supplied for consumption by one person to another. [1056 D] Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Shri Kacheroo Mal [1975] INSC 232; [1976] 2 S.C.R. 1, referred to.
 (e) The dominant object of the transaction and the intention of the parties, while entering into the transaction in question, was to provide against payment wholesome food for consumption, besides residential accommodation and services. [1058 B] State of Punjab v. M/s Associated Hotels of India Ltd.
 [1972] INSC 6; [1972] 2 S.C.R. 937, referred to.
 (2) (a) The Full Bench has rightly answered the second question. The expression "store" in s. 7 means "storing for sale" and consequently, storing an adulterated article of food for purposes other than for sale would not constitute an offence under s. 16(1)(a). [1054-H] (b) The terms "store" and "distribute" take their colour from the context and the collocation of words in which they occur in ss. 7 and 16. "Storage" or "distribution" of an adulterated article of food for a purpose other than for sale, does not fall within the mischief of this section. Under s. 10, the Food Inspector is authorised to take samples of an article of food only from particular persons indulging in a specified course of business activity, the immediate or ultimate end of which is the sale of an article of food. The section does not give a blanket power to the Food Inspector to take samples of an article of food from a person who is not governed by any of the sub-clauses of s. 2(i) (1)(a). Sub-s. 2 makes it clear that a sample can be taken only of that article of food which is "manufactured", "stored" or "exposed for sole". If an article of food is not intended for sale and is in the possession of a person who does not fulfil the character such as is referred to in s. 10, the Food Inspector will not be competent under the law to take a sample, and on such sample being found adulterated, to validly launch prosecution thereon.
