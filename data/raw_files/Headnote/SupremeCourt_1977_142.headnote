 The appellant gave his date of birth as March 13, 1912, while joining the service of the Mysore State Electricity Department in November, 1945. The date was accepted and entered in the service register, on his producing a horo- scope in support of his claim. In or about 1950, the State Government in pursuance of a policy decision, started revising the entries relating to the dater. of birth in case of those of its employees whose service register entries differed from the dates as recorded in their school or college registers. In the educational institutions where the appellant had studied, his date of birth was found to be recorded as January 28, 1904, and the State Government accordingly refixed the service register entry. The appellant protested and made several unsuccessful representations. On August 14, 1958, the State Government issued a Notification directing the grant of extension of service equal to half the period of difference between the original and revised dates of birth, but on April 1, 1959, the appellant received a formal written communication that he had been retired from service with immediate effect. The appellant filed a suit against the order, seeking mandatory injunction directing the Government to accept his date of birth as originally entered in the service register. In the alternative, he claimed the benefits of the Notification of August, 1958. The trial Court decreed the suit holding that the Government was not justified in altering his date of birth on the basis of the entries in his college register.
 It directed the Government to accept the service register entry. In a State appeal, the High Court partially upheld the decision, but quashed the direction regarding the acceptance of the service register entry. The High Court left it open for the Government to refix the appellant's date of birth according to law. An enquiry was held and the Government again fixed his date of birth as 28-1-1904. The appellant's writ petition was dismissed in limine.
 Partly allowing the appeal by special leave, the Court, 
HELD : (1) The State is not precluded merely because of the acceptance of the date of birth of its employee in the service register from holding an enquiry if there exists sufficient reasons for holding such enquiry and refixing his date of birth. [151 F-G] State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Del & Ors. [1967] 2 S.C.R. 625A.I.R. 1967 SC 1269, followed.
 (2) Nothing tangible has been brought to our notice which could have justified the Government to deprive the appellant of the benefit of the clear and categoric directions contained in its memorandum dated August 14, 1958. The course adopted by the Government in not allowing the appellant to continue in service for half of the period of difference between the date of birth as originally recorded in the service register and the revised date of birth, has manifestly resulted in grave injustice to the appellant.
