 S. 3 of the Imports and Exports Act 1947, empowers the Government to issue orders making provisions for prohibiting restricting or otherwise controlling the imports and goods of special description and the Export Control Order 1968, and provides that no person shall export goods of the descriptions specified in Schedule-I of the said order, except under 'licence granted by the Central Government etc.
 Mica scrap and Mica waste are included in item No. 22(a) of Part B of Schedule-1 of the 1968 order. The export of these items is allowed on merits, or subject to ceilings or other conditions to be specified, from time to time.
 The Controller of Imports and Exports issued the impugned notice and under it, the export of Mica was decided to be under the scheme of canalisation through the Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation of India. The impugned notice further stated that this canalisation of export scheme would be effective from 24 January, 1972. With regard to cases failing under pre-canalisation commitment category, the Port Licensing Authorities might allow export if the shipping documents produced by the exporters were accompanied by documents showing that the contracts were entered into with the foreign buyers before January 1972 or telegraphic offer or acceptance were dated January 1972 and irrevocable Letter of Credit at site was opened in a Bank of India, or in the foreign country before the 24 January, 1972.
 The impugned notice further stated that the exporters who wished to avail themselves of the pre-canalisation commitment category were to furnish particulars, such as name of buyers, quantity, delivery period etc., at the office of the Controller of Imports and Exports.
 The Corporation further issued a Press Note prescribing the procedure to be adopted by the exporters taking recourse to the canalisation scheme. Further, the Corporation would realise from the local suppliers as Service Charges not exceeding I per cent of the F.A.S. value. The foreign buyers would have to open unrestricted Letters of Credit in favour of the Corporation.
 The Press Note further stated that where Letters of Credit had been opened on or after 24th January 1972 in the name of private agencies, foreign buyers would be requested so that the Letters of Credit were duly amended in the name of the Corporation and contracts finalised directly by shippers were also to be amended in favour of the Corporation for the balance quantity.The payment due to the suppliers would be paid by cheque after realising the proceeds of sale from the foreign buyers, after retaining the marginal I percent of the F.A.S. value as Service Charges of the Corporation.
 Afterwards, on representation from several exporters, the Government issued an Export clarification Circular that in respect of cases where Letter of Credit was opened before 31 March 1972, but the period of shipment had expired, exports might be allowed in the name of private parties'. provided the shipment is made not beyond 30 June 1972.
 571 The petitioner challenged the canalisation of exports scheme, inter alia, on the following grounds :- (1)) It was not a canalisation scheme. It was in fact a scheme to transfer the business of the petitioner and good-will in favour of the Corporation which is outside the purview of the Act.
 (2) The scheme was an unreasonable restriction and it violated Art. 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India.
 (3) The scheme violated Art. 14 of the Constitution because there was discrimination between the exporters of Mica Powder and Mica Scrap and Mica Waste.
 (4) Fixing 24 January 1972 as the date for coming into force of the scheme was arbitrary.
 Letters of Credit had not reasonable relation to the objects of the Scheme. Therefore, fixing of the date of 24 January 1972 violates Art. 19. The extension of the date from 24 January 1972 to 31st March 1972, is mala fide and is to offer benefits to some and deny the same to the petitioner.
 (5) The levy of a charge of I percent on F.A.S. value without conferring any corresponding benefit is an unreasonable restriction and is in substance, a tax, and is, therefore, in contravention of Art. 265 of the Constitution.
 Dismissing the Petition, 
HELD (i) The policies of imports or exports are fashioned not only with reference to internal or international trade, but also on domestic policies. If the Government decides an economic policy that imports and exports should be by selected channels or through the agency of selected channels, the court would proceed on the assumption that the decision is in the interest of the general public, unless the contrary is shown. [576G] (ii)The scheme of canalisation is not acquisition of right to carry on trade. The canalisation scheme means that only the recognised agency can carry on trade. The effect of refusal of licence to other traders is that they cannot carry on the trade in house goods. The Corporation carries on trade itself but not because of any acquisition by the Corporation of the right to carry on trade of the unsuccessful applicant for licence. Therefore, there is no violation of Art. 31 or Art. 19(i)(f) of the Constitution.
 The dominant purpose of the scheme is canalisation of export and not to acquire the business or goodwill of the traders in favour of the Corporation. As the canalisation of Export through the Corporation would ensure uniform good quality of goods and an increase in the volume of export, the restriction on traders is reasonable. There is no acquisition of property of traders. The Corporation is an agency through which export is canalised to the total exclusion of citizens.

 referred to. [576H-577D] (iii)Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation is a State- owned body. The Corporation is appointed to undertake the scheme for export of Mica. No preference is shown to the Corporation. Where canalisation is decided, no licence is granted in favour of any one. Therefore, there is neither any competition, nor any choice in the matter of grant of licence. It is a total exclusion of citizens in order to enable all the country's exports to be made by one licensee.
 Therefore, Art. 14, is not infringed. [577E] (iv)Further, Art. 19(1)(g) is also not violated. If the traders wish to export quantities represented by their contracts, they are at liberty to avail themselves of the concession of exports through the Corporation. It is only if they will volunteer not to accept the concessional offer that there would he self induced loss of foreign exchange earnings. Further, the other advantages where the Corporation will enter into a principal to principal contract with the 572 foreign buyers are that the traders will be getting facilities of entering into contract with the Corporation which enters into a back-to-back contract with the suppliers. The Service Charges of I per cent of the F.A.S.
 value cannot be described as a loss because the Corporation is really servicing the contracts. [1578D] (v)The Service Charge collected by the Corporation is not in the nature of a tax and therefore, provisions of Art. 265 are not attracted. Further, the levy of service charges is not under the 1947 Act. The corporation is a licensee under 1947 Act and the 1968 Order. The Corporation acts in accordance with the terms and conditions of the licence.
 The government and the licensing authority under the Act, are not collecting any fee or charges from the traders. It is the Corporation which is collecting the Service Charges from the traders who avail the services of the Corporation.
 The Corporation is in the nature of a commercial undertaking to Which a licence has been granted for the export of certain commodities. The service Charges are nothing but quld pro quo for the services rendered by the Corporation.
 [578F] (vi)Further, fixing 24 January 1972 as the date for coming into force of the Canalization Scheme was also not arbitrary. If no date is fixed for bringing into effect the canalization scheme with reference to opening of letter of credit it will give rise to ingenious devices of creating specious contracts. Contracts may be brought into existence by antedating such contracts. Therefore, the opening of Letters of Credit has rational relationship with the object of the canalisation scheme, and there is no violation of Art. 14. [579D] (vii)Ordinarily, the import or export of goods under international contracts .of sale frequently requires in modern times the protection of a governmental authority in the form of import or export licence. Where this is the case, the parties usually provide in the contract which of them is to apply for the necessary licence and what is to happen, if an application is refused. If the contract is altogether silent, a term is usually implied making this the duty of one party .or the other. Normally, this duty is upon the seller particularly in the case of F.O.B. and F.A.S. contracts. Nothing has been shown that the contracts in the present case were not subject to the usual terms of contract in such cases that the export was subject to the licence laws of our country for the export of .goods.
 Therefore, the question that the petitioner would be sued by the foreign buyer would not arise. [579G] (viii)The impugned notice is not violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution on the ground that there is discrimination between the exporters of Mica powder and exporters of Mica scrap.The exclusion of mica power from the canalization scheme is to develop mica powder industry in our country because this ,industry is developing and is practically nascent is growth. There is an intelligible differentia between mica powder on the one hand and mica scrap and waste on the other in excluding mica powder from the canalisation scheme. [580G] (ix)The relaxation of the date for opening Letters of Credit from 24 January 1972 to 31 March 1972 is not intended to benefit influential people. This relaxation was made because several exporters made representations that they did not understand the import restrictions and went on opening Letters of Credit. The relaxation was to minimise the hardships which the traders were likely to suffer on account of the coming into force of the impugned Trade Notice. The relaxation was to prevent dislocation of trade on a large scale. here was no mala fide on behalf of the Government in relaxing the date for opening the Letters of Credit from 24 January 1972 to 31 March 1972.
