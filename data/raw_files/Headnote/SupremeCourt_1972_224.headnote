 On receipt of certain information, and,, as a result of information disclosed in documents seized from the respondent, the appellant issued a notice under s. 12 (8) of the Orissa Sales Tax Act. 1947, in the Form prescribed under r. 23 made under the Act, for reassessing the turnover of the respondent. The High Court, quashed the notice on the ground that the appellant had not indicated any reason for issuing the notice.
 Allowing the appeal to this 
HELD: (1) Although the opening words used in the section are "if for any reason" and not "if the sales tax authority has reason to believe" the difference in phraseology does not make any difference. A reason cannot exist in vacuum, and in the context, it should be the sales-tax authority issuing the notice who should have reason to believe that the turnover of a dealer has escaped assessment or has been under assessed. The words used in the prescribed Form also are "whereas I have reason to believe that your turnover has escaped assessment....... Any view which would make the opening words of the section unworkable should be avoided.
 [317 C-E] (2) The ingredients of s. 12 (8) of the Orissa Sales-tax Act, 1947, are: (i) there must exist reason for the belief that, (a) the turnover of, a dealer for any period to which the Act applies has escaped assessment or has been under-assessed; or, (b) the tax has been compounded when composition is not permissible under the Act and the rules made thereunder; (ii) in cases mentioned in cl. (i) the sales;-tax authority may at any time within 36 months from the expiry of the year to which the above mentioned period relates call for a return under s. 11 (1) of the Act; (iii) after taking the steps mentioned in cls. (i) and (ii) above, the sales tax authority may proceed to assess the amount of the tax due from the dealer in the manner laid down in s.
 12 (5) of the Act; (iv) the sales tax authority may also direct in cases where escapement or under-assessment or composition is due to the dealer having concealed particulars of his turnover or having without sufficient cause furnished incorrect particulars thereof that the dealer shall pay penalty in addition to the tax assessed;
 and (v) such penalty shall not exceed one and a half times the amount of the tax so assessed. [316 F-H; 317 A-C] The proceedings for assessment or re-assessment under the section start with the issue of a notice and it is only after the service of the notice that the assessee whose turnover is sought to be assessed or re-assessed becomes a party to the proceedings. Therefore, it is not necessary to intimate to the assessee the nature of the alleged escapement in the notice issued to him under the section.
 To hold that the, reasons which led to the issue of the said notice should be incorporated in the notice and that the failure to do so invalidated the notice would be tantamount to reading something into the statute which, in fact, is not there. However, if the sales-tax officer is in 311 possession of material which he proposes to use against the dealer in proceedings for re-assessment the said officer must, before using that material, bring it to the notice of the dealer and give him an adequate opportunity to explain and answer the case on the basis of that material.

 Commissioner of Income Tax, Bangalore, [1967] 63 I.T.R. 219, (S.C.) followed.
 (3) The fact that it is mentioned in the notice that penalty may also, be imposed would not make any difference to the validity of the notice. The question of imposition of penalty will only arise at the time of making.. an order for re-assessment. At that stage, the sales-tax officer would go. into the question whether the escapement or under- assessment has been due to the fact that the dealer concealed particulars of his turnover or without sufficient cause furnished incorrect particulars. In such an event he would have to give an opportunity to the dealer to show cause why penalty, in addition to the tax should not be imposed. [320 A; 321 A-C] (4) The existence of the reason that the turnover of the dealer had, escaped assessment or has been under-as is a sine qua non for the issue of the notice. In the present case, the appellant had brought material on record to indicate that there did exist such reasons. [322 B]
