 The respondent who was the occupant of an unalienated land had erected several structures on it without obtaining the prior permission of the Collector and became liable to be evicted. The Collector served a notice of eviction on the respondent under s. 66 of the Bombay Land Revenue Code and called upon him to remove the unauthorised structures. On the respondent not having complied with the notice, he was evicted from the land and some of the buildings were demolished.
 The High Court held that the order directing the removal of the structures was ultra vires of s. 66 of the Bombay Land Revenue Code and though the order of eviction was legal and intra vires but in spite of the eviction, the land or the buildings did not vest in the Government and the occupant continued to be the owner of the building and the land and the only consequence of eviction was physical removal of the occupant from the land.
 The question was whether the occupier who had been evicted as required to remove the building and in default could the collector demolish the building and was liable to damage for such demolition.
 Held, that on a true construction of ss. 65 and 66 of the Bombay Land Revenue Code an occupant was only entitled to the use and occupation of unalienated land for the purpose of agriculture, and could not alter the user to non- agricultural purposes except with the permission of the Revenue Authorities, and any such altered user entitled the Revenue Authorities to summarily evict the occupant from the land and once evicted the right of user and occupation could not be exercised by him.
 The words " eviction " and " vacation " did not mean mere physical removal of the occupant, they meant that his rights came to an end. For the purpose of " vacation " it was necessary that any unauthorised construction put up must also be removed, and no specific powers were necessary for such removal, the ,power to remove them was incidental and ancillary to the powers to evict and to get the land vacated.
 The true effect of eviction was physical removal of the occupant from the land with all the consequences, i.e.
 demolitione of all unauthorised superstructure, 96 748 The word " eviction " as used in s. 66 of the Code meant that on eviction, land had to be restored to the original position so as to be used for the purpose for which it was 'given to the occupant.
