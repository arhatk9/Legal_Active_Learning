 When the deceased declined to marry him the appellant who was her paramour, threatened to kill her in a manner that she would have a lingering death. He carried out the threat by pouring acid over her when she was lying on a cot. The deceased who had sustained extensive acid burns over her body died a few days later. The trial court convicted him under a. 302 I.P.C. and sentenced him to imprisonment for life. The High Court confirmed the conviction and sentence.
 On appeal it was contended that the intention of the appellant was not to kill the deceased but only to disfigure her and, therefore, the offence would fall under s. 304 part I or under a. 326 I.P.C. and that death was due to negligence.
 Dismissing the appeal, HELD: The appellant is guilty of offence punishable under s.
 302 I.P.C. [525B] (1) To bring a case under cl. 3 of s. 300 the prosecution must establish : (i) bodily injury (ii) the nature of the injury (iii) intention to inflict that particular bodily injury and (iv) that it is sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. Once these four elements are established by the prosecution the offence is murder under s. 300 cl. 3 I.P.C.; it does not matter that there was no intention to cause death. It does not matter that there was no intention even to cause an injury of a kind that is sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature.
 [522E-H] In the present case it is established beyond doubt that the accused intended to cause injuries by throwing acid and the injuries were actually caused on the person of the deceased.
 Virsa Singh v. The State of Punjab [1958] INSC 18; [1958] S.C.R. 1495, followed.
 (2) There is no substance in the argument that death was due to negligence. There is no evidence that the deceased died because she did not receive proper treatment. The appellant threatened the deceased that if she did not marry him .she would have a lingering death. The act of the appellant in pouring acid on the body was a pre-planned one and intended to cause the injuries which were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. [525B]
