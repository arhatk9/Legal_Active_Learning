 The appellant challenged the first respondent's election to the Lok Sabha in 1967 mainly on the ground that he had committed the corrupt practice under Section 123(6) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, in that he had incurred or authorised the incurring of expenditure in excess of the limit prescribed under Section 77. It was alleged, interalia, that the first respondent was put up by one of the wealthiest business houses in the country which owned or controlled a large number of companies; during the election campaign vast material and human resources of these companies were drawn upon by the respondent. It was alleged that as against the limit of Rs. 25,000 prescribed for the constituency under s. 77, several lakhs of rupees were spent by him during the election campaign on the printing of posters, pamphlets, etc., entertainment, the use of about 200 jeeps and cars, the engagement of over three thousand employees of the various companies and for their maintenance and travelling expenses, and on campaign meetings, trunk calls, etc. The appellant's election petition was dismissed by the High Court, etc. 'I-he to this Court under Section 116A of the Act, 
HELD : Dismissing the appeal : The appellant had failed to establish that expenditure in excess of the prescribed limit was incurred by the first respondent or with his consent and authority or that of his election agents.
 (i)It is not sufficient for the petitioner to prove me- rely that the expenditure more than the prescribed limit had been incurred in connection with the election. He must further prove that the excess expenditure was incurred with the consent or under the authority of the returned candidate or his election agent. The expenditure incurred by the returned candidate's party or by his friends or supporters, or by the enemies of his rival candidates without his consent or authority cannot be taken into consideration.

 (ii)This Court will not ordinarily go behind the finding of fact reached by the trial judge unless there is something basically wrong in the conclusions reached by him or the procedure adopted by, him. This is not a rule of law but a rule of prudence. [126 B] 119 Amar Nath v. Lachinan Singh & Ors., Civil Appeal No. 717/68 decided on 23-8-1968 and Jagdev Singh v. Pratap Singh, [1964] INSC 33; A.I.R. 1965 S.C. 183; referred to.
 (iii)The burden of proving the commission of a corrupt practice which is pleaded is on the petitioner and he has to discharge that burden satisfactorily. In doing so he cannot depend on preponderance of probabilities. The evidence must be cogent and conclusive. It is true that many times corrupt practices at election may not be established by direct evidence and the commission of those corrupt practices may have to be inferred from the proved facts and circumstances but the circumstances proved must reasonably establish that the alleged corrupt practice was committed by the returned candidate or his election agent. [126 H] Dr. M. Chenna Reddy v. V. Ramchandra Rao and Anr., Civil Appeal No. 1449/68 decided on 17-12-1968, referred to.
 (iv)If the court comes to the conclusion that an item of expenditure has been suppressed in the return of election expenses, the mere fact that there is no sufficient evidence about the amount that must have been spent is no ground for ignoring the matter. It is the duty of the court to assess all expenses as best it can and though the court should not enter into the region of speculation or merely try to guess the amount that must have been spent, it would generally be possible to arrive at an amount of expenditure on a conservative basis and where it is possible to arrive at any such estimate, such estimated amount should be held as not shown by the candidate in his election account. [128 H] Shivram Sawant Bhonsale v. Pratap Rao Deorao Bhonsale, 17 E.L.R. 37. referred to.
 (v)Although the trial court, under Section 119 of the Act is under compulsion to award cost to the successful party, there is no provision in the Act which compels the appellate court to award costs in an election appeal. [135 F]
