 Standing Order No. 12 of 1909 (Part A) provides for two classes of Tahsildar candidates (1) class `A' (or direct) and (2) class`B'. Para 4 (1) of the Standing Order read with the Punjab Tahsildari Rules 1932 provides that candidates are required to undergo training for a period of three years in the case of class `A' direct recruits. In addition to the completion of training a candidate is required to pass a qualifying departmental examination before he is eligible to be appointed to the post of Tahsildar, temporary or permanent.
 Initially, a tahsildar candidate is not enrolled against any post, nor is he appointed against any vacancy but is appointed against vacancies after completing the training and passing the examination held. After appointment to the post of tahsildar, the officer has to be on probation for a period of two years under Rule 10 of the Tahsildari Rules. Rule 11 provides that the seniority of members of the service shall be determined by the date of substantive appointment in the post.
 The Punjab Emergency (Concession) Rules, 1965 provides by sub-rule (ii) of Rule 4 that the period of `military service' shall be taken into consideration for the purpose of determining the seniority of a person who has rendered military service.
 The petitioner in his writ petition contended, that he appeared in the class `A' Tahsildar candidate Haryana Civil Services (Executive Branch) Services Examination 1972-73 and was accepted as `A' Class Tahsildar candidate on September 13, 1974 and joined the civil post with effect from September 26, 1974. After completing the training he was appointed to the post on January 3, 1978. He approached respondent No. 1 under Rule 4(1) and (ii) of the Punjab Emergency (Concession) Rules, 1965 and requested that the military service rendered by him from 1963 to 1974 except for the period from July 2, 1968 to October 13, 1968 be tagged on to his services with effect from September 26, 1974 for the purpose of his seniority, increments, promotion, pensions etc. and that respondent No. 1 did not give this facility though it was accorded to other respondents, and that the promotion of respondents Nos. 3 to 18 who were junior to him had violated Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.
 The first respondent claimed that the petitioner was accepted as class `A' Tahsildar candidate on 13th September, 1974 and that he had qualified himself 56 for the post of Tahsildar after he had completed the prescribed training and successfully qualified in the departmental examination and that he was appointed as Tahsildar by the order dated January 3, 1978. As the petitioner had been in service in the Armed Forces from April 29, 1963 to January 10, 1968 on which day termination of the Emergency was declared, the petitioner was given the benefit of the service and his seniority was fixed as on May 26, 1973 in accordance with the provisions of Rule 4, sub- clause (ii) read with Rule 2 of the Punjab Emergency (Concession) Rules 1965.
 Dismissing the petition, ^ 
 HELD : 1. The petitioner was not appointed to but accepted as a candidate for the post of Tahsildar. [63 D] In the instant case a perusal of the letter of appointment Annexure P-5 alongwith sub-rules 2 and 3 of Rules 5 and 11 of the Tahsildari Rules shows that the petitioner was merely accepted as a candidate for the post of Tahsildar. It is mentioned therein that the terms and conditions of the service namely training, passing of departmental examination, and probation are to be governed by the Tahsildari Rules and Standing Order No. 12 as amended from time to time. A candidate had to fulfil the said terms and conditions mentioned before his appointment to the post of Tahsildar. [62 H-63 D] 
 2. The petitioner's substantive appointment was by order dated January 3, 1978. It is clear from the said order that the substantive appointment of the petitioner cannot be before the said date. [63 E, 64 F] 
 3. The military service of the petitioner from January 11, 1962 to July 1, 1968 and again from October 31, 1968 to September 22, 1974 was not during the operation of emergency. The petitioner's service from October 31, 1969 to September 22, 1974 was not as an "enrolled or commissioned service in any of the three wings of the Indian Armed Forces." During this period the petitioner had been allowed the benefit of service rendered by him in the Army for the period from April 29, 1963 to January 10, 1968 by the order dated December 14, 1978 of the Financial Commissioner. [66 C] 
 4. The petitioner has not been able to point out that any of the respondent Nos. 3 to 18 was given seniority from the date of acceptance. In fact none of them was accepted alongwith him by letter dated September 13, 1974. [67A]
