 On September 12, 1958, the appellant made an application to the State Government under the Miheral Concession Rules, 1960 for the grant of a mining lease.
 Having had no reply from the State Government he filed a revision application on June 21, 1961 before the Central Government which directed the State Government to dispose of the application. Since, there was no reply from the State Government, the appellant filed a second revision application before the Central Government, which by its order dated November, 21, 1964, allowed it. Even so, the State Government refused to implement that order. A third revision application was filed on January 27,1961 before the Central Government which, after obtaining the views of the State Government, rejected it.
 Allowing the appeal against the order of the Central Government, ^ 
 HELD : (1) The State Government being a subordinate authority in the matter of grant of a mining lease, was obliged under the law to carry out the orders of the Central Government. It was not open to the State to decline to carry out the orders of the Central Government particularly because the Central Government was a Tribunal superior to the State Government. In view of Government's order dated November 21, 1964, it was not open to the State Government to reject the application on any ground whatsoever. If the State Government found itself unable to implement the order, a reference could have been made to the Central Government for obtaining necessary directions. If any ground came into existence subsequent to the making of the order of the Central Government, the State Government could have brought it to the notice of the Central Government. In any case, the State Government could not have refused to implement the order of the Central Government unless that Government itself chose to revise it either on a reference or suo moto.
 [57 C-E] (2) Under r. 54 of the Mineral Concessions Rule, 1960 the Central Government acts as a revisional tribunal against any order passed by the State Government. When the State Government refused to carry out the order, the Central Government should have proceeded to set aside the State Government's order and directed it to grant the application.
 The Central Government has not disposed of the revision application in accordance with law. [55 B, 56 F] (3) Assuming that the Central Government could revise its earlier order, that could be done only if some fresh ground came into existence. There was absolutely no legal justification for the Central Government to go back upon its earlier order which stood unvaried and unvacated. [58 A]
