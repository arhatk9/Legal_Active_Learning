 The appellant company advanced a loan to the predecessor-in-title of the respondents against a mortgage of land in 1906. In 1953 the said land vested in the State of Orissa by virtue of a notification under s. 3 of the Orissa Estates Abolition Act 1951. Under s. 18 of the Act the appellant filed a claim in respect of the loan before the Claims Officer. The mortgagor contended that since the appellant had realised more than double the amount of the loan as interest, the debt stood extinguished according to ss. 10 and 11 of the Money Lenders Act 1939. The Claims Officer and the High Court held against the appellant though on different grounds. The appellant came to this Court and contended that the procedure for determining a claim as provided ;in s. 20 of the Abolition Act was exhaustive and recourse to the provisions of the Money Lenders Act was unjustified.
 
HELD: The Claims Officer cannot under s. 20(2) of the Abolition Act determine the principal and interest due under a mortgage without considering the question as to whether the claim is true or whether it is barred by any other law, or whether the claim is still subsisting. These are all matters which properly arise for consideration by the Claims Officer. The expression 'legally and justly due' occurring in s. 20(1) clearly indicates that the first and initial duty of the Claims Officer is to find out whether any principal amount is at all due to the creditor. For this purpose he would be perfectly justified in relying on any provisions of other statutes bearing upon that subject-in this praticular case the provisions of the Money Lenders Act. Taking section 10 and 11 of the latter Act into account it was clear that no amount was due to the appellants as they had already received more than double the amount of the original loan.
