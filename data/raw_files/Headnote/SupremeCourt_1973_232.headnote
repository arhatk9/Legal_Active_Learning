 Dismissing the appeal of the State to this Court 
HELD : (1) The High Court was right in the view that the occurrence took place under darkness and that in the absence of any light none of the prosecution witnesses could have identified the culprits and that the existence of the lantern was open to grave doubt. If the pattern was burning just near the place where the priest was sleeping it is difficult to hold that the murder was committed through an error mistaking him to be the complainant. The accused had no motive to assault the priest and case injury to his mother which tended to show that they had not participated in his murder.
