 Respondent was adopted by a widow after about 63 years of her husband's death. The husband had predeceased his father 'N' leaving behind him the said widow and two sisters K. and S.On N's death K and S inherited in equal shares. On K'sdeath her son succeeded and on his death his two sons the present appellants succeeded to her share.
 The respondent instituted the suit for the recovery of the properties from the appellants, alleging that the immoveable properties formerly belonged to the ownership of and were under the Vahiwat of the joint family of his adoptive father and grandfather respectively. The appellants denied the respondent's right to the properties contending that K their grandmother was the full owner of the properties and thus became a fresh stock of descent and that they, inherited the properties from their father to whom they had been alienated by K their grandmother.
 The High Court held that the alleged alienation by K of her hare to her son was not binding on the. respondent, and further held that tile respondent could divest the appel- lants of the properties which belonged to the respondent's adoptive grandfather.
 The question was whether the respondent on his adoption, could divest the appellants of the properties of his adoptive father and grandfather.
 Held, that when a person is the owner of property possessing a title defeasible all adoption, not only that title but also the title of' all persons claiming under him will be extinguished on the adoption.
 The heir of a collateral succeeding to the sole surviving co-parcener inherits the property absolutely, but subject to defeasance, and the right in the property devolves on his 814 heirs who would take that property absolutely, but still subject to defeasance, as no better title could have been inherited, for the character of the- property does not change from the co-parcenary property to self acquired property, so long as there was the possibility of the defeasance of the absolute title by a widow of the family of the last surviving co-parcener adding a member to the co- parcenary by adopting a son to her deceased husband.
