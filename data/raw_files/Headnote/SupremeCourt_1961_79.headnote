 One 'M' executed a will bequeathing the property in dispute.
 suit was brought for declaration, inter alia, that the will was effective and 'M' had no power to bequeath the land in dispute it was ancestral qua the defendants.
 The question for decision was whether the portion of land high had fallen to the share of 'M' in consolidation proceedings in lieu of his share in land held by him was ancestral or not.
 Held,' that where land had been consolidated and in lieu of ancestral lands and non-ancestral land a consolidated area was given to a proprietor, then such of the portion of the consolidated area which corresponds to the area of land which was ancestral, will be ancestral land.
 Where the possession by the immediate common ancestor is not shown in the revenue records but that of a more remote direct ancestor is shown, and the history of the land gives no indication of its acquisition except by inheritance, the land would be ancestral.
