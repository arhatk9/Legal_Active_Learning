 The appellant, a worker under Respondent No. 1 was occupying one of the jhuggies on the plot adjacent to the, mill of Respondent No. 1. On receipt of a report from the sentry, Dharam Singh, that one Sheo Ram had started making an unauthorised construction on the said plot, Shyam Singh, Assistant Security Officer of Respondent No. 1 who was in- charge of prevention of encroachment and further unauthorised construction, proceeded to the spot accompanied by two members of his staff to investigate into the matter.
 On finding Sheo Singh )constructing a new jhuggi in front of his existing jhuggi Shyam Singh. pleaded with the former and asked him to desist from constructing the new jhuggi. While he was so engaged the appellant made his appearance along- with 8 to 10 jhuggi dwellers, manhandled Shyam Singh, hurled highly provocative invectives at him and his companions, and bade them to quit on pain of dire consequences. Later, the management of respondent 1 detailed two of its officers to enquire into the aforesaid misbehaviour towards and attempt to assault Shyam Singh who was discharging his official duties. The inquiry officers foundthat the acts committed by the appellant were subversive of indiscipline and constituted misconduct, as contemplated by the Standing Order 27(1) as applicable to the appellant. Agreeing with the findings, the General Manager of Respondent No. 1 passed an order on May 2, 1968, dismissing the appellant from service. Since, however, an industrial dispute was pending, the General Manager directed the appellant to take his final dues together with one month,s pay in lieu of notice and made an application on the, same day to the Industrial Tribunal, Delhi, seeking its approval of the order of the appellant's dismissal, as required by s. 33(2)(b) of the Act.
 The Additional Industrial Tribunal, Delhi, refused by its order dt. April 23, 1969 to accord its approval to the appellant's dismissal on the grounds viz., that the disciplinary action taken against the appellant was misconceived; that since there was no rational connection between the employment of the appellant and Shyam Singh in regard to the affairs of the D.C.M. Chemical Works, Standing Order 27(1) was not attracted and that it was really a case of civil dispute between the Company and jhuggi dwellers who were long being pressurised to surrender possession of the area to the Company and the machinery of security staff of D.C.M. was pressed into service for that purpose. Against the said orders, Respondent No. 1 moved the High Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution. The High Court allowed the petition holding that since. there was a clear finding of the Inquiry Officers about the existence of rational connec- tion between the aforesaid incident and the duties of the appellant and Shyam Singh and there was nothing in the order of the Tribunal to show that the Inquiry Officers had arrived at that finding without any evidence, it was not open to the Tribunal to come to a different conclusion on the facts or to hold that the present was a case of victimisation and then to refuse its, approval. The High Court quashed the order and directed the Additional Tribunal to consider the aforesaid-application of Respondent No. 1 in the light of its judgment.
 Dismissing the appeal by special leave, the Court HELD:
 
1. Though it is true that a private quarrel between an employee and a stronger with which the employer is not concerned falls outside the categories of misconduct, acts which are subversive of discipline amongst employees or 83 misconduct or misbehaviour by an employee which is directed against another employee of the concern may in certain circumstances constitute misconduct so as to form the basis of an order of dismissal or discharge.

2. The extent of jurisdiction exercisable by an appropriate authority under s. 33(2)(b) of the Industrial Disputes Act is very limited. In proceedings under s. 33(2)(b) the jurisdiction of the Industrial Tribunal is confined to the inquiry as to : (1) whether a proper domestic enquiry in accordance with the relevant rules/Standing Orders and principles of natural justice has been held; (2) whether a prima facie case for dismissal based on legal evidence adduced before the domestic tribunal is made out; (3) whether the employer had come to a bona fide conclusion that the employee, was guilty and the dismissal did not amount to unfair labour practice and was not intended to victimise the employee regard being had to the position settled by the decision of this Court that though generally speaking the award of punishment for misconduct under the Standing Orders is a matter for the management to decide and the tribunal is not required to consider the propriety or adequacy of the punishment or whether it is excessive or too severe yet an inference of mala fides may in certain cases be drawn from the imposition of unduly harsh, severe, unconscionable or shockingly disproportionate punishment; (4) whether the employer has paid or offered to pay wages for one month to the employee and (5) whether the employer has simultaneously or within such. reasonably short time as to form part of the same transaction applied to the authority before which the main industrial dispute is pending for approval of the action taken by him. If these conditions are satisfied the Industrial Tribunal would grant the approval which would relate back to the date from which the employer had ordered the dismissal. If, however, the domestic enquiry suffers from any defect or infirmity, the labour authority will have to find out on its own assessment of the evidence adduced before it whether there was justification for dismissal and if it so finds it will grant approval of the order of dismissal which would also relate back to the date when the order was passed provided the employer had paid or offered to pay wages for one month to the employee and the employer had within the time indicated above, applied to the authority before which the main industrial dispute is pending for approval of the action taken by him.

 In the instant case; (a) The requisite nexus was there and the Industrial Tribunal unauthorisedly assumed the role of an appellate authority and exceeded the well defined limits of its jurisdiction in refusing to accord its approval of the action taken against the appellant by holding, not on the basis of any legal evidence but purely on the basis of conjectures and surmises that the present was a case of victimisation; and (b) No question of victimisation or management having a bias against the appellant can arise on the facts and circumstances of the case, once it is held that the findings of misconduct alleged against the workmen were properly arrived at and the domestic enquiry or in any other way vitiated. [91 E-F] 
3. Both the victim and the delinquent workman need not necessarily be engaged in the performance of their official duties when the act which is the subject-matter of misconduct is said to have been committed. It is sufficient if the victim and the delinquent workman are both employees of the same con corn and the misconduct is directed against the former, while he is acting in the discharge of the duties imposed on him by virtue of his office. [91H, 92-A] 84 The Jurisdiction of the Industrial Tribunal being a limited one and all the essential requisites Of the proviso to s.
 33(2)(b) of the Act being present in the instant case, the Industrial Tribunal was not justified in withholding its approval. [92A-B]
