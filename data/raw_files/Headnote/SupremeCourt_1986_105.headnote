 The respondent-firm (assessee) had no gratuity scheme for the years preceding the calendar year 1970, but such a scheme was formulated for the first time in the middle of 1970 and put into operation with effect from July 1, 1970.
 The respondent debited to the Profit and Loss Account, a sum of Rs. 2,11,305 as a charge against the profits being the total liability as on December 31, 1970 on account of the gratuity scheme. This amount was provided on the basis of an actuarial report prepared by a Consulting Actuary.
 In assessment proceedings for the assessment year 1971- 72, the Income-Tax Officer was not prepared to allow the entire amount claimed by the respondent as the provision on account of gratuity. The burden of the liability was ascertained as Rs. 1,84,056 on the basis of a certificate obtained by the assessee from the consulting actuary. The Income Tax Officer therefore allowed the liability only to the extent of Rs.27,249 the difference between Rs. 2,11,305 and Rs. 1,84,056.
 On appeal, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner held that the entire amount was allowable and gave a relief of Rs.1,84,056. H 952 The appeal of the Department to the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal having been dismissed, the Department sought for a reference of the question whether the assessee was entitled to deduction of the entire amount.
 On the basis that the Appellant Tribunal and the High Court had rejected the Departments application, the Department came in appeal to this Court under Article 136.
 In the Appeal, it was contented on behalf of the Department that as the provisions of s.40A(7)(b)(ii) of the Income Tax Act 1961 have not been satisfied, the respondent was not entitled to the deduction of the gratuity amount.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: It is necessary that the High Court should examine whether the provisions of s.40A(7)(b)(ii) of the Act have been complied with in the instant case, having regard to what has been laid down in Sh. Sajan Mills Ltd. v.
 Commissioner of Income Tax M.P. and another, [1985] 156 I.T.R. 585. [955 F] There is no dispute between the parties that the first condition in the said provision has been satisfied by the respondent. What remain is to determine whether the second and third conditions are also satisfied. [955 F-G] Judgment under appeal set aside. Case remanded to High Court for fresh consideration. [955 G-H] D.V. Baput I.T.O. Companies Circle Bombay v. Tata Iron Steel Co. Ltd., C.A. No. 1247 of 1980 decided on January 8, 1986 followed.
