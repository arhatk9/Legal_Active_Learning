 One Mohd Yusuf, in execution of a money decree against the appellant, attached the appellant's share in a village along with sir and khudkasht lands appurtenant thereto. Before the sale took place, the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Rights (Estates, Mahals, Alienated Lands) Act, 1950 M. P. 1 of 1951) was made applicable to that area, and the proprietary rights in the village vested in the State.
 On October, 1951, the respondent purchased the sir khudkasht fields in action sale and the appellant's objection therein having been dismissed, the sale was confirmed. On appeal, the Additional District Judge set aside the sale and the property was restored to the appellant. On further appeal, that order was reversed and the auction purchaser was again put in possession of the property. The appellant then applied to the executing Court objecting that there was no jurisdiction to sell the fields. The objection of the appellant was dismissed by the Civil judge and his successive appeals to the District judge and the High Court also failed. On appeal by special leave, the appellant's main contention was that the cultivating rights in the sir lands could not be the subject matter of sale in execution of the decree in view of s. 43 of the Abolition Act.
 Held, that by the operation of the Abolition Act, the proprietor ceases to be the proprietor of the estate or village including the sir lands appurtenant to the proprietorship. But the cultivating rights in the sir lands which were his home. farm are saved to him and under s. 38 of the Abolition Act he becomes a malik makbuza of these fields. The Abolition Act having deprived the proprietors of their property interest gives protection to them in respect of their new rights in the homefarm which has become the malik makbuza of the proprietor.
 The words of s. 43 are quite clear and the cultivating rights in the sir and Khudkash land which became under the 192 Act the home-farm of the proprietor are protected against sale except where those cultivating rights were the subject of a mortgage or a charge created by the proprietor. That condition did not exist in the present case and the sale, therefore, must be declared to be without jurisdiction and ordered to be set aside.
