 The petitioner, along with others, was convicted and sentenced of offences tinder ss. 489-A to 489-D, I.P.C.
 relating to currency notes and bank notes. On the occasion of Gandhi Centenary the State Government granted special remission of sentences to various categories of prisoners who were convicted of offences against laws relating to matters to which the executive power of the State extended.
 The jail authorities released some of the other accused but the petitioner was not released, because, according to the respondent State, the State Government had no power to remit the sentence in respect of offences relating to a matter which was within the sphere of the executive power of the Union and not of the State and that the release of the other accused was a mistake.
 Dismissing the writ petition under Art. 32, 
HELD: (1) Under s. 402 (3), Cr. P.C. the appropriate Government is the Central Government in respect of cases where the sentence is for an offence against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends. Under Art. 161, the Governor's power to give pardon etc., is with respect to an offence against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the State extends. Currency, coinage and legal tender, are matters which are expressly included in Entry 36, List 1, Schedule VII. Entry 93 specifically confers on the Parliament the power to legislate with regard to "offences against laws with respect to any of the matters in the Union List". Read together, these entries put it beyond doubt that currency notes and bank note& are matters which are exclusively within the legislative competence of the Union Legislature. The offences for which the petitioner had been convicted were offences relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends and the appropriate Government competent to remit the sentence would be the Central Government and not the State Government. [855 B-D] (2) Entry no. I of List III would show that the ambit of criminal law was first enlarged by including in it the Penal Code and thereafter excluding all offences against laws with respect to any of the matters specified in List I or List II, The reason for such inclusion and exclusion seems to be that offences against laws with respect to any of the matters specified in List I or List II are given a place in Entry 93, List I and Entry 64, List II. The Penal Code is a compilation of penal laws, providing to the various entries in the different lists of VII Schedule. Many of the offences in the Code relate to matters which are speci- fically covered by the entries in the Union List. This excluding clause in Entry no. I of List III read with Entries 36 and 93 of List I shows beyond all doubt that in respect of offences falling under ss. 489A to 489D only the Central Government is competent to suspend or remit the sentence of a convict. [856 B-C] (3) The Government Order in question could not fall under the head "Criminal Law". It was an act done in the exercise of his executive functions by the Governor under Art. 161 of the Constitution. [857 C] (4) The wrong release of the other accused did not give a right to the petitioner to claim the benefit of the G.O.
