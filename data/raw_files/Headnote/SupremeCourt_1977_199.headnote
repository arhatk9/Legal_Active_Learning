 On a search of the room of the appellant, a foreigner, who arrived at Calcutta by air from Bangkok on June 28, 1975, the Customs Authorities found 1701 U.S. dollars and 4400 Canadian dollars in his possession. For violation of the provisions of s.13(1) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 read with s.135 of the Customs Act, 1962, the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate convicted the appellant and sentenced him to pay a fine of Rs. 2000/- and in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for six months. The Magistrate further ordered that "the goods involved in this case are confiscated to the State if not already confiscated". The Calcutta High Court, in revision, affirmed the conviction but reduced the fine to Rs. 500/- and affirmed the order of confiscation of. the dollars. In appeal by special leave, the appellant contended that the Magistrate had no power of confiscation of the currency and the High Court was in error in affirming that order.
 Allowing the appeal, the Court, HELD : (1) An order for the disposal of any property u/s.
 452(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code is necessary where the property remains to be disposed of by the Court after the inquiry or trial is over. In the present case there was no necessity or occasion for the Court to make an order for disposing of any property since the seized foreign currency was not produced before the Magistrate and was not in the custody or control of the court when the order of confiscation was made. The order of the Magistrate that the goods involved in the case be confiscated "if not already confiscated" clearly shows that he was not aware what had happened to the goods which were in the control of the Customs Authorities. [721 H, 722 A-B] (2)It is true that the foreign currency seized from the appellant's possession was property in respect of which an offence was committed but this fact alone did not call for an order u/s. 452(1) in the circumstances of the case.
 [722 B] [The court left open to the Customs Authorities to take a decision according to law as early as possible regarding the disposal of the seized currency.]
