 By a Court decree, schemes for administration of two estates belonging to a couple were sanctioned. The subject matter of the present appeal is the property comprised in the estate of the wife. The said premises have been used as a marriage hall.
 The predecessor of the appellant made an application to the High Court for permission to incur an expenditure of Rs. 6 lakhs for converting the tiled roof into RCC roof as also for a modernisation plan involving about Rs. 17,500, so that the marriage hall could fetch higher income. The High Court accorded permission for the plan and the expenditure in- volved. Thereafter some correspondence took place with some Architects. But there was no further progress. In the mean time the present appellant took charge of the trust and he wrote to an Architect about the proposal and requested him to inspect and report about its feasibility. The Architect inspected the premises and reported that the building was very old and in a dilapidated condition. He recommended the demolition of the building and putting up of a new construction. The appellant requested the Architect to submit his estimates, plan and other details. Just prior to these developments, the Deputy Official Receiver inspected the premises belonging to both the trusts and submitted a report that the buildings belonging to both the trusts be demolished and reconstruction of the Marriage Hall and construction of a shopping complex be taken up.
 The appellant paid the scrutiny and demolition fee to the Corporation as demanded by it and the building was demolished. The Architect sent his estimate of Rs. 9.60 lakhs for the construction of the Marriage Hall. The appellant riled an application before the High Court for its 381 permission to transfer a sum of Rs. 7 lakhs from the other Trust to enable him to incur a total expenditure of Rs. 10 lakhs and for ratification of the ,action taken by him. The hereditary trustees and the residual beneficiaries intervened and opposed the application. The matter was heard by a Single Judge and he held that the appellant had proceeded to demolish the marriage hall without getting specific orders of the Court and in undue haste, in an irresponsible manner and to the detriment of the trust. The Single Judge rejected the application and directed the appellant to construct the marriage hall within Rs. 6 lakhs sanctioned earlier. He further directed that expenditure in excess of Rs. 6 lakhs should be borne by the appellant himself Being aggrieved by the said order, the appellant- official trustee filed an appeal which was dismissed by the Division Bench. Against this, the official trustee preferred the present appeal by special leave.
 Allowing the appeal, this Court, 
HELD : 1. It is evident from record that out of the three Architects who responded to the invitation of the predecessor of the appellant for replacement of the tiled- roof by R.C.C. slab, one architect did not even care to visit the site and examine whether the old structure could bear the weight of the R.C.C. slab. As regards the second architect, he did not refer to the fact whether the old structure was capable of bearing the weight of the R.C.C.
 slab. He merely stated that he had inspected the premises and then proceeded to indicate his charges for preparing the plan etc. It may, however, be presumed that since he had not referred to the condition of the building, he was of the opinion that the old building could bear the weight of the R.C.C. slab. It is only the third architect, who stated that it was worth demolishing the old building and constructing a new one in its place as per the Development Control Rules of the Madras Municipal Corporation. This was the state of affairs on the files of the Official Trustee when the appellant took charge. In the circumstances, there was nothing unnatural on the part of the appellant to have specifically addressed a letter to one more architect, pointing out to him, that it was proposed to convert the existing tiled-roof into RCC-roof, and requesting him to inspect the premises and submit a report specifically on the point as to whether the existing building could withstand the conversion or whether it had to be demolished and a new building constructed in its place. Anyone in his place acting as a responsible and a reasonable man 382 would have done so. Since the new architect gave his report after inspecting the premises that no matter however much improvement was carried out in the building, the net result would be neither appreciable nor would it yield maximum returns for the investments made as the existing building was very old and in a dilapidated condition, there was nothing wrong if the appellant accepted the said report and proceeded to take immediate steps in the interest of the trust estate. The building was at least 76 years old, If not more, in 1988. Therefore, it is difficult to doubt the bona fides of the recommendations made by one of the three earlier architects or by the new architect. In any case, the bona fides of the appellant could hardly be questioned.
 [389A-H, 390A-E] 
2. The rapid steps taken by the appellant can only be consistent with his intention to act as early as possible in the interest of the trust since by the new construction, the income of the trust was expected to be augmented. Further, the delay in construction was also likely to increase the cost of construction, apart from the loss of income that was to result from such delay. Hence, the so-called haste cannot be looked upon only with suspicion or as contributing only to the mala fide intentions on the part of the appellant. It is also consistent both with a diligent and responsible conduct, on his part and with the best of his intentions to subserve the interests of the trust. [390F-H] 3.1. There is no doubt that the appellant knew that the earlier sanction obtained was only for replacement of the tiled-roof by R.C.C. slab. The sanction %*as also for incurring only an expenditure of Rs. 6 lacks and some other sundry expenses for providing minor facilities. Since the new proposal which he sanctioned consisted of the demolition of the entire building and of constructing a new one in its place which also involved a further expenditure of Rs. 4 lakhs or so, the proposal was completely different and it could not be acted upon on the basis of the old sanction.
 It was, therefore, absolutely necessary for the appellant to approach the Court before he embarked upon the new proposal, even though in doing so he was acting in the interests of the trust and no mala fides could be attributed to him.
 This is the only error committed by the appellant In the present case. However, in the facts and circumstances of the case, the error could not be said to have been actuated by any mala fide intentions on his part The expenses that he had undertaken to Incur were also within reasonable bounds looking at the proposal. His intention in promoting the 383 proposal was in the interest of the Trust. [391A-D] 3.2. To the extent that the appellant did not take permission of the High Court before proceeding to demolish the existing structure and to construct a new one in its place, and before undertaking the expenditure of Rs. 4 lakhs over and above that sanctioned earlier, he did commit a breach of trust. But the appellant could not be made personally liable for the breach of trust committed by him, in view of the provisions of Section 15 of the Official Trustees Act, 1913. [391-H, 392AB]
