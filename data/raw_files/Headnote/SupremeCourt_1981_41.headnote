 
 1. If the certificate granted by the Court under sub- clauses (a) and (c) of clause (1) of Article 133 of the Constitution, as it then stood, did not conform to legal requirements in as much as it did not specify the substantial question of law which, according to High Court, required determination and no reasons in respect of issuance of the certificate appeared therein, the certificate could be revoked. [948 H] Sohan Lal Naraindas v. Laxmidas Raghunath Gadit [1971] 1 S.C.C. 276; Sardar Bahadur S. Indra Singh Trust v.
 Commissioner of Income Tax, Bengal [1971] INSC 217; [1972] 1 S.C.R. 392 followed.
 
 2. In such a situation if it could be made out that a substantial question of law really required determination, this Court could treat the appeal as one by special leave after condoning the delay. In the instant case no such question is involved at all and, therefore, special leave cannot be granted. [949 B-C]
