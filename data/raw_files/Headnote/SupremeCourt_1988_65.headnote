 % Section 14(1)(a) of the Delhi Rent Control Act, ,958 provides for recovery of possession of the demised premises, where the tenant has failed to pay the arrears of rent recoverable from him within two months of the date on which notice of demand had been served on him in the manner provided in s. 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882.
 Under the lease agreement the respondent-tenant was required to pay rent in advance by the 5th of-each calendar month. The appellant-landlords by their notice dated 8th March, 1982 reminded the respondent that the rent for the months of February and March, 1982 was due as per the lease agreement and requested for immediate payment. The appellants again served a notice on the respondent on 19th April,1982 that it had not paid the rent for the months of February, March and April,1982 for the two shops and it having committed violation of the terms of the lease agreement they do not wish to keep it as their tenant any longer and thereby terminated the tenancy requesting the tenant to handover peaceful vacant possession of the premises by 31st May, 1982. The respondent by their letter dated 1st June, 1982 acknowledged the arrears of rent as on that date.
 On a petition filed by the appellants under s. 14(1)(a) of the Act, the Rent Controller passed an order of eviction, which was upheld by the Rent Control Tribunal. The High Court, however, set aside that order on the ground that there was no proper notice of demand to pay arrears of rent in terms of proviso to s. 14(1)(a) of the Act.
 Allowing the appeals, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The High Court was in error in setting aside the judgement of the Rent Control Tribunal. [96F] 89 
 2.1 For obtaining recovery of possession under the Act there must be relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties, the tenant must have been in arrears of legally recoverable rent on the date of the notice of demand, and a notice of demand had been served upon the tenant in the manner provided under s. 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, but the tenant neither pays nor tenders the rent within two months of the notice of demand. [93E-F] 
 2.2 The notice of the landlord stating therein about the arrears of rent must be read in common sense point of view bearing in mind how such notices are understood by ordinary people. [93G] In the instant case if the two notices dated 8th March, 1982 and 19th April, 1982 are read alongwith the letter dated 1st June, 1982 it is clear that the respondent was in arrears of rent for the months mentioned therein and there was a demand to pay rent. There were intimations that in default of payment of rent an eviction petition as consequence thereof would follow. That is how the appellants understood the notices. If that was so, there was clear notice of demand and the relevant requirement of the proviso to s. 14(i)(a) of the Act was fulfilled. [93G; H; 94G] Shri Ram Sarup v. Shri Sultan Singh etc., [1977] All India Rent Control Journal, Vol. II 522, approved.
