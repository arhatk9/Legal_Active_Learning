 Dealings between the family of the appellants (creditors) and the family of the respondents (debtors) commenced in 1934. In September 1938, after the Madras Agriculturists' Relief Act (4 of 1938) came into force in March 1938, a promissory note was executed by the debtors (who are agriculturists) in favour of the creditors for the amount then found due. The debtors also agreed to pay interest at the rate of 93/8 per cent per annum on that amount. In arriving at the amount due to the creditors in 1951, the debtors contended that the debt should be scaled down under s. 9(1) of the Act, whereas the creditors contended, on the basis that it was a debt incurred after the commencement of the Act, that the only relief to which the debtors were entitled, was calculation of interest under s. 13 of the Act.
 
HELD : Though the transaction was entered into after the commencement of the Act, since the original indebtedness arose before the commencement of the Act but after October 1, 1932, s. 9(1) of the Act would be applicable. [210 D] Under s. 7 of the Act every debt payable by an agriculturist at the commencement of the Act shall be scaled down and nothing in excess of the amount scaled down will be recoverable; and this would in effect operate as a discharge of the rest of the liability. Where, therefore, a suit is instituted for recovery of a debt from an agriculturist, the court will have to scale down the debt as provided in s. 8 if the debt was incurred before 1st October, 1932. If the debt was incurred after that date, the Court will have to apply the provisions of a. 9. In such a case, the debt incurred after the commencement of the Act will not cease to be a debt incurred after October 1, 1932, when it is a transaction in renewal of a liability which arose prior to the commencement of the Act. As to future interest, transactions prior to the commencement of the Act covered by ss. 8 and 9, are governed by s. 12, and transactions after the commencement of the Act, by s. 13. The object of the Legislature in enacting s. 13 is only to provide for a maximum rate of interest payable by agriculturists, on debts incurred for the first time after the commencement of the Act.
