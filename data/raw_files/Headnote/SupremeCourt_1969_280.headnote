 The respondent filed a suit against the appellant alleging that the latter had sold the suit property to the respondent's father undertaking to redeem the mortgages and hand over possession of the property. It was averred that the appellant, after redeeming the mortgages wrongfully re- tained possession of the properties contrary to the stipulation and the sale effected in favour of the respondent's father. The appellant contested the suit on the ground that the sale in favour of the respondent's father was void under the then prevailing law in Kolhapur State and that the suit was barred by limitation. The District Court decreed the suit and the High Court confirmed. On the questions (i) whether according to the law in force as could be ascertained from the relevant Wat Hukums and the provisions of the Bombay Hereditary Offices Act (111 of 1874) in so far as it was applicable to the State of Kolhapur, the alienation of Patel-ki-Watan Inam land was void and (ii) whether the suit was barred by limitation, 
HELD : (i) On the construction of the various Wat Hukums the alienation in favour of the respondent's father was invalid. The Bombay Hereditary Offices Act did not apply to the Kolhapur State so as to override the specific directions of the Wat Hukums which had legal and binding force in the State. In this case there was a specific prohibition from alienating Patel-ki-Watan and other similar inams. [794 F, G] Rangappa Venappa Akole v. Laxman Malyappa, 62 Bom. L.R.

 (ii) The suit was not barred by limitation. The suit was against a person who was not entitled to possession. The appellant did not dispossess the respondent and as such Art.
 142 of the Limitation Act was not applicable. [795 B-C]
