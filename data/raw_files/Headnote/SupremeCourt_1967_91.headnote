 The respondent a film producing company was served a notice unders. 46(5A) by the Income-tax Officer on June 18, 1957, asking it to pay to the Income-tax Officer any amount due from the company or held by it for or on account of 'B' an actor. On June 26, 1959 the company replied that it had not engaged 'B' for its current production and there was no contract with him and consequently it could not comply with the notice. On March 28, 1960 the company signed a contract with 'B' agreeing to pay him Rs. 20,000 for a role in its current production. The amount was paid to him in three instalments on March 28, 1960, February 9, 1961 and March 18, 1961. On March 22, 1961 the Income-tax Officer sent to the company another notice under s. 46(5A) to which the company replied that there were no payment due and payable to 'B' on the date of receipt of the notice. The Income-tax Officer held that the payment of Rs. 20,000 to 'B' was in violation, of the notice under S. 46(5A) issued on June 18, 1959 and requested the company to pay the said amount to the Income-tax department. The company filed a writ petition in the High Court which decided in its favour holding that the section required the subsistence of a similar relationship as between a garnishee and the assessee. The department appealed to this Court.
 
HELD : In s. 46(5A) the legislature contemplates a subsisting relationship of which the Income-tax Officer gets information and which can reasonably lead to the recovery of arrears. t429C] The expression "may become due" or "may subsequently hold money" suggest in the context a subsisting relationship between the person served with a notice and the assessee;
 e.g. assessee's employer or banker or debtor, or a person paying an annuity to him; they do not suggest a bank which he has never dealt with, a person he has never lent money to or dealt with, or all persons who may possibly in the future employ an assessee out of job or work. The section cannot apply to all possible employers or traders, [429F] Since there was no subsisting relationship between the company and 'B' at the time when the notice was issued the recovery of Rs. 20,000 from the company was not justified.
