 Facts. Shri 'M', while an Agent of the Supreme Court, filed a criminal appeal and later on became an Advocate on record under the new rules of the Court which came into force on January 26, 1954. He received a sum of Rs. 750 from his client for costs of printing of the Paper Book and deposited the same in the Punjab High Court from whose decision the appeal arose. There was a surplus of Rs. 242-1-9 pies. He withdrew the amount without informing his client, made no demand of any fees as being due to him, did not lodge any bill for taxation and appropriated the sum towards his alleged fees. The client came to know of the withdrawal from the Punjab High Court and when he confronted Shri 'M' with the letter from that court Shri 'M', who had denied the receipt of the surplus amount, could no longer do so and stated that he was entitled to a reasonable fee, had a lion therefor and had appropriated the amount.
 Held, that on the facts found the Advocate was guilty of professional misconduct and must be suspended from practice.
 The high standard of professional conduct contemplated by rule 30 of Order IV of the Supreme Court Rules virtually made an Advocate a trustee for his client in respect of all his moneys which came into his hands except what was specifically ear-marked for fees. Any lien which he might have under the rules would not justify the appropriation of any such money towards his fees without the express or implied consent of the client or an order of Court.
 Nor could an Advocate, in absence of a prior settlement of fees, constitute himself a judge in his own cause and determine what 812 would be reasonable fees payable to him. It might be that in certain circumstances he was entitled to exercise a lien, but he had to give reasonable intimation both of the fact of moneys having come into his hands and of the exercise of his lien over them until his account was settled.
 The principle of trusteeship applied with greater force where the surplus money, as in the instant case, was meant for a specific purpose, it being well settled that in respect of such a money there could be no lien either under the common law or the statute.
 That in a case such as the present, the standard applicable to an Agent under rules 31 and 32 of the old rules would be the same.
 In the matter of Mr. G., a Senior Advocate of the Supreme Court, ([1955] 1 S.C.R. 490), followed.
 Held further, that as the Supreme Court Rules did not specifically prescribe any procedure for cases coming under r. 30 of 0. IV of the Rules, in the instant case the procedure substantially as in a warrant case under s. 251-A (as amended) of the Code of Criminal Procedure should be adopted as far as possible subject to such just and expedient modifications as accorded with the rules of natural justice.
