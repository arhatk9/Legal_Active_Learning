 The petitioner, a journalist, in her letter addressed to this Court stated that Five out of fifteen women prisoners interviewed by her in the Bombay Central Jail alleged that they had been assaulted by the police in the police lock up and two of them in particular alleged that they had been assaulted and tortured in the lock up.
 Treating the letter as a writ petition the Court issued notices to all concerned to show cause why the writ petition should not be allowed In the meanwhile the Director of the College of Social Work, Nirmala Niketan, Bombay was directed to interview the women prisoners without any one else being present and ascertain whether the allegations made to the petitioner were correct. The Director, in her report, stated among other things that there was no adequate arrangement for providing legal assistance to women prisoners and that two prisoners who were foreign nationals complained that a lawyer duped and defrauded them and misappropriated almost half of their belongings and jewellery on the plea that he was retaining them for payment of his fees.
 Disposing of the petition the court gave the following directions: F Legal assistance to a poor or indigent accused, arrested and put in jeopardy of his life or personal liberty, is a constitutional imperative mandated not only by Art. 39A but also by Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.
 It is a Necessary sine qua non of justice and where it is not provided, injustice is likely to result and every act of injustice corrodes the foundations of democracy and rule of law. It is possible that a prisoner lodged in a jail does not know to whom he can turn for help to indicate his innocence or defend his constitutional G or legal rights or to protect himself against torture and ill-treatment, oppression and harassment at the hands of his custodians. It is also possible that he or the members of his family may have other problems where legal assistance is required but by reason of his being incarcerate. it may be difficult if not impossible for him or the members of his family to obtain proper legal advice or aid. It is therefore essential that legal assistance must be made available to prisoners in jails whether they be under-trials or convicted prisoners.
 338 The Inspector General of Prisons in Maharashtra should issue a circular to all Superintendents of Jails in Maharashtra requiring them to send to the Legal Aid Committee of each district in which the jail is situated:
 (i) a list of all under-trial prisoners giving the date of entry, the nature of the offence showing separately male and female prisoners and (ii) a list giving the particulars of persons arrested on suspicion under s. 41 of the Code of Criminal Procedure who have been in jail beyond a period of 15 days. The Circular should also contain directions: (i) to provide facilities to lawyers nominated by the concerned district Legal Aid Committee to enter the jail and to interview the prisoners who have expressed their desire to have their assistance; (ii) to furnish to the lawyers nominated by tho Legal Aid Committee whatever information is required by them in regard to the prisoners in jail; (iii) to put up notices at prominent places in the jail that lawyers nominated by the concerned District Legal Aid Committee would be visiting the jail on particular days arid that prisoners who wanted their assistance could avail of their counselling services; (iv) to allow any prisoner to meet such lawyers. Such interview should be within, sight but out of hearing of any jail official. [343 D-E, G-H, 344 A-D] The Maharashtra State Board of Legal Aid should advise and instruct the District Legal Aid Committees to nominate a few selected lawyers to visit the jail or jails in the district once in a fortnight to ascertain whether the law laid down by this Court and the High Court in this respect is being properly and effectively implemented and to interview the prisoners who express their desire to obtain legal assistance. The State Board should call for periodic reports from the district legal aid committees to ensure that these directions are being properly carried out. [344 E-H] The Court has given the following further directions:
 (i) Four or five police lock ups should be selected in reasonably good localities where only female suspects should be kept and they should be guarded. by female constables.
 Female suspects should not be kept in a police lock up in which male suspects are detained. [345 E-F] (ii) Interrogation of females should be carried out only in the presence of female police officers/constables.
 [345 G] (iii) A person arrested must be immediately informed of the grounds of his arrest. It must immediately be made known to the arrested person that he is entitled to apply for bail. The Maharashtra State Board of Legal Aid and Advice should forthwith get a pamphlets prepared setting out the legal rights of an arrested person. The pamphlets should be in Marathi, Hindi and English. Printed copies of the pamphlets in all these languages should be affixed in each cell in every police lock up. As soon as the arrested person is brought to the police station, the pamphlet should be read out to him in any of the languages which he understands. [345 H, 346 A C] (iv) Whenever a person is arrested by the police and taken to the police lock up, the police should immediately give intimation of the fact of such arrest to the nearest Legal Aid Committee which should take immediate steps to 339 provide legal assistance to him at State cost provided he is willing to accept such A legal assistance. [346 D-E] (v) In the city of Bombay, a City Sessions Judge, nominated by the principal Judge of the City Civil Court, preferably a lady Judge if there is one, shall make surprise visits to police lock ups in the city periodically with a view to providing the arrested persons an opportunity to air their grievances and for ascertaining the conditions in the police lock up, whether the requisite facilities are being provided, whether the provisions of law are being observed and that these directions are being carried out. If it is found that there are any lapses on the part of the police authorities, the City Sessions Judge shall bring them to the notice of the Commissioner of Police and if necessary to the notice of the Home Department. If even this approach fails, then the City Sessions Judge may draw the attention of the Chief Justice of the High Court of Maharashra to such lapses. This direction in regard to police lock up at the district headquarters shall be carried out by the Sessions Judge of the district concerned. [346 F-H, 347 A] (vi) As soon as a person is arrested, the police must immediately obtain from him the name of any relative or friend whom he would like to be informed about his arrest and the police should get in touch with such relative or friend and inform him about the arrest. [347 B-C] (vii) The magistrate before whom an arrested person is produced shall enquire from him whether he has any complaint of torture or maltreatment in police custody and inform him that he has a right under section 54 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 to be medically examined. [347 C-D] The Court made the following observations:
 The profession of law is a noble profession. A lawyer owes a duty to the society to help people in distress more so when those in distress are women 2nd in jail. Lawyers must positively reach up to those sections of humanity who are poor, illiterate and ignorant and who, when they are placed in a crisis such as an accusation of crime or arrest or imprisonment, do not know what to do or where to go or to whom to turn. If lawyers, instead of coming to the rescue of persons in distress, exploit and prey upon them, the legal profession will come into disrepute and The large masses of people in the country would lose faith in lawyers and that would be destructive of democracy and the rule of law.
