 The General Manager, Northern Railway published a panel of 38 enquiry-cum-reservation clerks for selection to the posts of reservation supervisors. This panel was published after considering 152 persons, i.e., four times the number -of existing and anticipated vacancies plus 25% thereof for unforeseen vacancies. The anticipated vacancies included 11 vacancies on account of promotions due to the upgrading of 11 posts in the next higher grade. Representations were made against the constitution of the panel, and the Railway Board decided that the panel should consist of 24 persons only to coy& 18 upgraded vacancies, 1 vacancy on account of retirement and 5 vacancies representing 25% for contingencies and the field of selection should be restricted to 24*4=96 and not 152 persons. So, the panel already published was ordered to be operated only in respect of the first 24 persons and the names of the remaining persons be deleted. Accordingly, the General Manager by an order implemented the decision. The petitioner, whose name was at No. 33 in the panel, published earlier filed a writ petition in this Court, challenging the orders as violating his fundamental rights.
 HELD :-The petition must be dismissed.
 (i) Under the general direction issued by the Railway Board in one of its letters, the General Manager was competent to amend the panel with the approval of the Railway Board [315 F-G] Srivastava v. N.E. Railway, [1966] 3 S.C.R.61, 64, 65, followed.
 (ii) The Railway Board held that until the selection was made, it could not be anticipated that 11 persons would be promoted creating 11 consequential vacancies in that grade due to promotions to the higher grade. Acting upon this view the Railway Board decided that the anticipated vacancies would be less and the panel should be amended accordingly and should be operated in respect of the first 24 persons only. The decision could not be said to be perverse nor it could be quashed or set aside. [315 A-316 B] (iii) All the 24 persons retained in the panel were senior to, the petitioner. All of them would have been selected and included in the panel, even if 96 persons were originally called for selection. There was no fore in the contention that the retention of the first 24 persons in th panel without holding a fresh selection was discriminatory or was violative of Arts. 14 and 16 of the Constitution [316-C] (iv) It is said that panels of Class Ill selection posts of station masters on the Northern, Railway and all class ill selection posts on other Railways had been drawn up on the footing that anticipated vacancies in the selection grade include vacancies on promotion due to upgrading of posts in the next higher grade and that the Railway Board had not 313 issued any direction for amendment of those panels. But those panels relate to separate; classes of employees and have no bearing on the question of equal opportunity in the matter of promotion of enquiry-cum-reservation clerks on the Northern Railway [316 D-F] All Indian Station Masters' and Assistant Station Masters' Association v. General Manager Central Railways, [1959] INSC 138; [1960] 2 S.C.R. 311, 319, followed.
