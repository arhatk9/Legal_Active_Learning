 A dispute between the appellant and the respondent arising out of a contract for the supply of fuel was referred to arbitration. The arbitrators gave an award directing the appellant to pay a certain sum of money to the respondent and filed the award in the court of the Subordinate judge.
 The appellant made an application for setting aside the award but it was rejected. Against this order the appellant preferred an appeal to the High Court under s. 39(1) of the Indian Arbitration Act, 1940, and a Single judge allowed the appeal and set aside the award. Thereupon the respondent filed a Letters Patent appeal against the judgment of the Single judge. This appeal was allowed, the judgment of the Single judge was set aside and the order of the Subordinate judge was restored. The appellant contended that the Letters Patent Appeal was incompetent as s. 39(2) barred a second appeal from an order passed in appeal under s. 39 (1).
 Held, that an appeal against the appellate order of the single Judge was barred by s. 39(2) of the Arbitration Act.
 The expression "second appeal" in s. 39(2) means a further appeal from an order passed in appeal under s. 39(1) and not an appeal under s. 100 of the Civil Procedure Code, and includes an appeal under the Letters Patent. The Letters Patent of the Lahore High Court, which applied, could, by virtue of cl. 37 thereof, be amended or altered by the Legislatures. By enacting clause (2) of s. 39 of the Arbitration Act the Legislature has prohibited an appeal under the Letters Patent against an order passed under s.
 39(1).The provisions of s. 39 apply to appeals to superior courts aswell as to "intra-court appeals".
 Madhavdas v. Fithaldas I. L. R. (1952) Bom, 570and Radha Krishna Murthy v. Ethirajulu, I.L.R. (1945) Mad.564, approved.
 Hanuman Chamber of Commerce Ltd., Delhi v, JassaRam Nand, A.I.R. (1948) Lah. 64, Banwari Lal Ram Dev v. The Board of Trustees Hindu College, I.L.R. (1948) E.P. 159 498 and Mulchand Kewal Chand Daga v. Kishan Das Gridhardas (1961) 74 L.W. 408 F.B., disapproved.
 In considering whether s. 39(2) has taken away the right of appeal under the Letters patent the court must interpret the words of the statute without any predisposition towards the state of the law as it was before the enactment of the Arbitration Act, 1940. In interpreting a statute which codifies the law it is not permissible to start with the assumption that it was not intended to alter the preexisting law.
 Narendra Nath Sircar v. Kamlabasini Dasi, L.R. (1896) 23 I.A. 18, applied.
 Under the Code of Civil Procedure of 1882 there was a conflict of opinion amongst the High Courts on the question whether an appeal lay under the Letters Patent from an appellate order of a Single judge in arbitration matters.
 The Code of 1908 by enacting s. 4 and s. 104(1) preserved the right of appeal under any other law for the time being.
 The Arbitration Act, 1940 removed all the provisions relating to arbitration from the Code and made comprehensive provisions in the Act. Though under the Code of 1908 an appeal did lie under the Letters Patent from an order passed by a Single judge in exercise of appellate jurisdiction that was because the power to hear appeals under a special law was expressly reserved by s. 4 of the Code. There is no provision in the Arbitration Act, 1940, corresponding to s.
 4 of the Code and there is nothing which preserves the jurisdiction of the High Court under the Letters Patent.
 Accordingly, the Letters Patent must be read subject to the provisions of s. 39 of the Arbitration Act.
