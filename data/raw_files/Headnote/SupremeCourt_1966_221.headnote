 The father of the assessee was the proposer, in 1959, of a policy called Children's Deferred Endowment Assurance, the life assured being-that of the assessee, who was a minor.
 Under the contract of insurance, the Life Insurance Corporation of India was liable to pay the sum assured (a) on the stipulated date of maturity, if the life assured was alive on that date, or (b) if the life assured were to die before that date, provided that the death occurred on or after the deferred date specified in the policy. A special clause of the policy provided that at any time after attaining majority and before the deferred date, the life assured may adopt the policy and on such adoption, the policy was to be a contract between the Corporation and the life assured as the absolute owner of the policy from the date of such adoption. In the absence of such adoption it was the proposer who would be entitled to the amounts payable by the Corporation, and not the assessee. Further, if the assessee were to die before the deferred date the policy would stand cancelled and it was the proposer and not the heirs of the assessee who would get back the premiums paid. The premium payable in respect of the policy was, however, paid out of the taxable income of the assessee. In the- course of the assessment for the assessment year 1960- 61 the assessee claimed rebate on the premium paid under the provisions of s. 15(1) of the Income-tax, 1922 The Department, the Appellate Tribunal and the High Court, on reference, held against the assessee.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : In order to get exemption from payment of tax two conditions have to be satisfied under the section, namely, (i) the premium must have been paid by the assessee himself;
 and (ii) the payment must have been made to effect an insurance on the life of the assessee himself. The contract of insurance in the present case, between the assessee's father and the Corporation must be read as a whole and so read, in spite of the clauses referred to, it was in substance a contract of life insurance with regard to the life of the assessee. As the premium was paid by the asses- see out of his taxable income, rebate under s. 15(1) was admissible on the premium, paid. [924 E, H]
