 Respondent 1, a bank, filed a suit against appellants Nos.
 1 to 4, members of a joint family, for the recovery of Rs. 5 lakhs on the basis of a mortgage deed executed in favour of the bank, by securing certain immovable properties without possession. Defendant No. 5 became a guarantor for the amount borrowed and executed a separate guarantee in favour of the Bank. The appellants, who were Jagirdars, had money transactions with the bank prior to the execution of the mortgage on three separate accounts. The accounts were however, closed by payment from the amount of Rs. 5 lakhs advanced to them on the basis of the Mortgage deed. As the defendants failed to pay the amounts which fell due under the terms of the mortgage, a suit was filed against all the defendants. The firm and the 5th defendant remained ex- parte, but defendants Nos. 2-4 defended the suit. The trial court, decreed the suit against the appellants and the High Court also confirmed the judgment and decree of the trial court. In an appeal by certificate, two main points were urged :-(I) that the suit debts were extinguished under S.
 22 of the Hyderabad Jagirdars Debt Settlement Act 1952, inasmuch as no application was presented by the Bank u/s.11 of the Act before the 30th June, 1953 which was the notified date and (2) the civil court had no jurisdiction to try the suit because u/s 25 of the Act, all suits and proceedings for the recovery of a debt from a Jagirdar had to be transferred to the Jagirdars Debt Settlement Board, which alone had jurisdiction to settle it. It was contended on behalf of the appellants that the mortgage executed by the appellants did not create any new debt but merely secured the payment of prior debts which was the balance due to the Bank on the 3 accounts as on the date of the mortgage which debts were pending debts within the meaning of S. 25(1).
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) From the terms of the mortgage deed, it was clear that the debt of Rs. 5 lakhs was a fresh debt created by and secured thereunder with interest that may become due from the date of the mortgage and that there was no question of the mortgage deed having been executed as a settlement of prior debts so as to attract the provisions of Sections 11 and 25 of the Act. [163 A] (ii) The expression 'pending' in Section 25 related to proceedings which were pending on the notified date and could not mean any proceedings which were instituted after such date. In the facts and circumstances of the case the debt created by the mortgage deed is a fresh debt and therefore, the provisions. of S. 1 1 and 25 are, not attracted. [161 E] Joint family of Mukund Dais v. State Bank of Hyderabad [1970] INSC 183; [1971] 2 S.C.R. 136, followed.
 158 (iii) Once the provisions of S. 11 and 25 were shown to be not applicable, the civil court had jurisdiction to try the suit and the decree granted by the Trial Court and confirmed by the Appellate Court did not suffer from any infirmity. [163 H] State of Rajasthan v. Mukund Chand, [1964] INSC 47; [1964] 6 S.C.R. 903, and State Bank of Hyderabad v. Mukunda Raja Bhagwandas & Ors., 1963 (11) Andhra Weekly Reporter 14, referred to.
