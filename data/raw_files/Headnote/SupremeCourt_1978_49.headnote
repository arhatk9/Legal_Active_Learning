 The Allahabad High Court, in exercise of powers conferred upon it by Art. 225 of the Constitution and all other powers enabling it in that behalf has framed Rules, known as the Rules of Court, 1952. Under Rule 1 of Chapter III of the Rules, an Administrative Committee composed of the Chief Justice, the Judge in the Administrative Department and five other judges appointed by the Chief Justice was constituted to act for the Court. Under Rule 7, all matters laid before the Administrative Committee and the manner in which those matters were disposed of are to be circulated in a statement to all the Judges of the Court for their information.
 In one of the meetings of the Administrative Committee of the High Court which was held on January 9, 1974, it was resolved by the Committee that respondent No. 1 should be retired compulsorily from service. The Registrar of the High Court communicated the decision of that Committee to the State Government on January 15, 1974 and thereafter on January 17, 1974 circulated the minutes of the Committees meeting to the other judges of the High Court for "their information". The Governor of U.P. accepted the recommendation of the Administrative Committee and retired respondent 1 compulsorily by an order dated February 27, 1975.
 Respondent 1 assailed the said orders by an application under Art. 226, inter-alia, on the ground that " the order is illegal inasmuch as it was passed on the recommendation of the Administrative Committee, while Art. 233 of the Constitution requires consultation by the Governor with the entire High Court and not with a Committee consisting of a few Judges of the, High Court". This ground found favour with the Division Bench which heard it. But considering that such a view was likely to upset the settled practice of the Court and that it was likely to be in conflict with that Court's decision in Civil Misc. No. 1254 of 68 dt. 23-2-70.
 they directed that the papers of the case be placed before the learned Chief Justice for constituting a Full Bench to consider the question "whether in view of Art. 233 of the Constitution, consultation with the entire High Court is necessary. before making an order of compulsory retirement against the District Judge ?" The Division Bench and initially the Full Bench heard arguments on the supposition that the power to retire a District Judge compulsorily is an incident of the power of appointment contained in Art. 233(1) of the Constitution which provides that appointments of persons to be and the posting and promotion of 132 District Judge in any State shall be made by the Governor of the State in consultation with the High Court exercising jurisdiction in relation to such state. After the Full Bench reserved its judgment this Court held in High Court of Punjab and Haryana v. State of Haryana and Ors., [1975] INSC 15; [1975] 3 S.C.R. 365 that compulsory retirement of a District Judge is not an incident of the power of appointments conferred by Art. 233 of the Constitution but is an incident of the control rested in the High Court by Art. 235. Consequently, the Full Bench reframed the question referred to it as "whether a District Judge can be compulsorily retired from service on the opinion recorded by the Administrative Committee constituted under Rule 1 of Chapter III of the Rules of the Court ? The Full Bench also framed an additional question viz. "Whether circulation of a statement to all the Judges of the Court showing what matters were laid before the Administrative Committee and the manner in which these matters were disposed of amounts to consultation with the Full Court ? Asthana C.J., who presided over the Full Bench answered both the questions in the negative. K. N. Singh and C. S. P.
 Singh JJ. agreed by a separate judgement with the learned Chief Justice. M. N. Shukla and H. N. Seth JJ. took a contrary view and held that a District Judge can be compulsorily retired from service on the opinion recorded by the Administrative Committee. They did not consider it necessary to express any opinion on the second question.
 The Writ Petition was allowed according to the majority view, by the Division Bench. A consequential declaration was granted by the Bench that respondent No. 1 should be treated as continuing in service and was entitled to all the privileges pay and allowances which were permissible and payable to him under the law.
 Allowing the appeal by special leave and affirming the minority judgment of the Full Bench, the Court 
HELD : 1. (a) The minority view of the Full Bench that Rule 1 of Chapter III of the 1952 Rules framed by the Allahabad High Court is within the frame work of Art. 235. The recommendation made by the Administrative Committee that the respondent should be compulsory retired does not suffer from any legal or constitutional infirmity. [145 E] (b) The amplitude of the power conferred by Article 235, the imperative need that the High Courts must be enabled to transact their administrative business more conveniently and an awareness of the realities of the situation, particularly of the practical difficulties involved in a consideration by the whole Court, even by circulation, of every day-to-day matter pertaining to control. over the District and subordinate Courts, lead to the conclusion that by rules framed under Art. 235 of the Constitution, the High Courts ought to be conceded the power to authorise an Administrative Judge or an Administrative Committee of Judges to act on behalf of the Court. [145 D-E] (c) It is wrong to characterize as "delegation" the process whereby the entire High Court authorises a judge or some of the Judges of the Court to act on behalf of the whole Court.
 Such an authorisation effectuates the purpose of art. 235 and indeed without it the control vested in the High Courts over the subordinate Courts will tend gradually to become lax and ineffective. Administrative functions are only a part, though an important part, of the High Court's constitutional functions. Judicial functions ought to occupy and do in fact consume the best part of a Judges time. For balancing these two-fold functions it is inevitable that the administrative duties should be left to be discharged by some on behalf of all the Judges. Judicial functions brooke no such sharing of responsibilities by any instrumentality. [144 D-F] (d) The Administrative Judge or the Administrative Committee is a mere instrumentality through which the entire Court acts for the more convenient transaction of its business, the assumed basis of the arrangement being that such instrumentalities will only act in furtherance of the broad policies evolved from time to time by the High Court as a whole. Each Judge of the High Court is 133 an integral limb of the Court. He is its alterego. It is therefore inappropriate to say that a Judge or a Committee of Judges of the High Court authorised by the Court to art on its behalf is a delegate of the Court. [144 G-H] 
2. (a) The majority view of the High Court Full Bench that by leaving the decision of the question of the respondent's compulsory retirement to the Administrative Committee, the Court hid abdicated its Constitutional function is not correct. [142 G-H] (b) According to the view of the majority the act of the Court in allowing the Administrative Committee to decide that question under Rule 1 of Chapter III of the Administrative Committee to decide that question under Rule 1 of Chapter HI of the 1952 Rules is an act of "self- abnegation" and therefore, void. This approach betrays a misunderstanding of Article 235. [142-H] (c) The ideal which inspired the provision (Art. 235) that the control over District Courts and Courts Subordinate thereto shall vest in the High Court is that those wines of the judiciary should be independent of the executive. It is in order to effectuate that high purpose that Article 235 requires that all matters relating to the subordinate judiciary including compulsory retirement and disciplinary proceedings, but excluding the imposition of punishments failing within the scope of Article 311 and the first appointments and promotions, should be dealt with and decided upon by the High Court.

 (d) There is no parallel between what the High Court did in Shamsher Singh and what has been done in the instant case.
 In Shamsher Singh v. State of Punjab the action of the High Court in asking State Government to depute the Director of Vigilance to, hold in inquiry against a judicial officer was deprecated by this Court as an act of "self-abnegation".
 The High Court bad abdicated therein its control over the subordinate judiciary, which includes the power to hold a disciplinary inquiry against a defaulting judge, by surrendering that power to the executive. That truly was an act of self-abnegation. Here, the decision to compulsorily retire the respondent was taken by the Judges of the High Court itself though not by all. If some but not all judges of the High Court Participate in a decision relating to a matter which falls within the High Courts' controlling jurisdiction over subordinate courts, the High Court does not efface itself by surrendering its power to an extraneous authority. The procedure adopted by the High Court under its Rules is not subversive of the independence of the subordinate judiciary which is what Article 235 recognises and seeks to achieve.

3. Art. 225, it is true, preserves, inter alia the pre- constitution powers of existing High Courts to frame rules and the High Court of Allahabad did not, prior to the enactment of the Constitution, possess the power to frame rules authorising a judge or a Committee of judges of the High Court to act on behalf of the Court. But Article 225 is not the sole repository of the High Court's power to frame rules. [140 E-F] 
4. The High Court has the power under Art. 235 itself to frame rules for regulating the manner in which the control vested in it may be exercised. The relevant part of Art.
 235 of the Constitution provides that the control over Dis- trict Courts and Courts subordinate thereto shall be vested in the High Court. Since Article 216 provides that every High Court shall consist of a Chief Justice and such other judges as the President may from time to time deem it necessary to appoint, Article 235 has to be construed to mean that the control over District Courts and Courts subordinate thereto is vested in the entire body of 134 judges who together constitute the High Court and not in the Chief Justice as representing the High Court or a smaller body of judges acting as an Administrative Committee. [140 G-H] 
5. (a) But, though the control over subordinate Courts is vested institutionally in the High Courts by Article 235, it does not follow that the High Courts have no power to prescribe the manner in which that control may in practice be exercised. In fact, the very circumstance that the power of control, which comprehends matters of a wide-ranging variety, vests in the entire body of Judges makes it imperative that rules must be framed to make the exercise of control feasible, convenient and effective. The seeds of jurisdiction to frame rules regulating the manner in which the control over subordinate Courts is to be exercised are thus to be found in the very nature of the power and in the fact that the power vests in the entire body of Judges.
 [140 H, 141 A-B] (b) The power to do a thing necessarily carries with it the power to regulate the manner in which the thing may be done. It is an incident of the power itself and indeed, without it, the exercise of the power may in practice be fraught with difficulties which will frustrate, rather than further, the object of the power. It is undoubtedly true that the rules framed for prescribing the manner in which a power may be exercised have to be truly regulatory in character. The reason is that under the guise of framing rules, the essence of the power cannot be permitted to be diluted. The abstract power of the High Court to frame the impugned rules cannot be doubted and must be conceded.
 [141 B-E] 
6. The power to compulsorily retire the respondent could be exercised by the Court either under Note 1 of 465A or Note 1 of article 465 of the Civil Service Regulations. [146 C]
