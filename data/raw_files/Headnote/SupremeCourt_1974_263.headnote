 The Ministry of Home Affairs by a memorandum dated 22-6-1949 laid down that the seniority of government servants should be determined by the date of their appointment and not the date of their confirmation. In the seniority list issued in 1958 by the Excise Department the appellant was given his due place. The rule was altered in the Department by office memorandum dated 22-12-1959 by which seniority was determined from the date of confirmation. On 22-7-1972 an office memorandum was issued after the judgment of this Court in Ravi Varma's case. It was alleged that this memorandum was based on a wrong interpretation of the law laid down by this Court because while determining the seniority of the petitioner according to the 1949 rule. it did not award consequential benefits to which he was entitled had the 1949 memorandum been followed.
 Representations to the Government impugning the seniority list having failed the petitioner has filed a petition under article 32 of the Constitution.
 It was contended on behalf of he respondent that the petitions were barred by the principles of laches and acquiescence. and that the assertions in the petitions did not contain necessary averments to establish violations of fundamental rights.
 Dismissing the petitions, 
HELD'. (1) The petitions rest on the assumption that all that need to be asserted was violation of some rule contained in an office memorandum. There is no doubt that the office memorandum dated 22-7-1972 was issued in conse- quence of the decision of this Court in Ravi Varma's case to meet the situation created by it in the context of previous office memorandum on the subject If the 1972 memorandum had been correctly interpreted and applied the law laid down by this Court. had been correctly applied there was no need to proceed further with the consideration of the petitions.
 [965E-F] (2)(a) A mere failure to apply a rule which ought to have been applied may not, by itself, justify an invocation of the powers of this Court under art. 32 of the Constitution.
 In order to succeed in a petition under art. 32 of the Constitution the petitioner has to disclose how his fundamental right has been infringed by a particular rule or decision or its application. The impact of the rule or decision upon the facts of each petitioner's fundamental right has to be clearly brought out. [971 B] (b) Where a petitioner alleges that he had been denied equality of opportunity for service, during the course of hi employment as a government servant, it is incumbent upon him to disclose not only the rule said to be infringed but also how this opportunity was unjustifiably denied on each particular occasion. [971 C] (c) The equality of opportunity in a matter relating to employment implies equal treatment to persons similarly situated or in the same category as the petitioner. It postulates equality of conditions under which a number of persons belonging to the same category compete for the same opportunities and a just and competing claims. It does not exclude justifiable discrimination. [971 D] competing claims. It does not exclude justifiable discrimination.
 [971 D] 961 (d) In so far as memorandum of 1972 does not direct reconsideration of cases of' all those persons who have actually confirmation or who were not considered at all for promotion at the time when they ought to have been considered it fails to give, due and complete effect to what was decided by this Court in Ravi Varma's case. [970 F] (e) As regards the contention of the petitioner that he was not senior a grade, neither the office memorandum of 1949 nor the petitioner save conditions of entry into the senior grade. It was for the petitioner to satisfy the Court that he was not given the senior grade although he satisfied all the required conditions and that others, who were promoted into it, were given unjustifiable preference over him. It is difficult to see how the petitioner was denied equality of opportunity in not being given the senior grade in 1961 but was given only in 1967. [972 F] (3) The inequality in the equitable balance brought into being by a petitioner's own laches and acquiescence cannot be overlooked when considering a claim to enforce the fundamental right to equal treatment. To treat unequals equally would also violate that right. Although it may not be possible for the State or its agents to plead an estoppel against a claim to the fundamental right to equal treatment, yet, if a petitioner has been so remiss or negligent as to approach the Court for relief after an inordinate and unexplained delay, he certainly jeopardises his claims as it may become inequitable, with circumstances altered by lapse of time and other facts, to enforce a fundamental right to the detriment of similar claims of innocent third 'persons.

 (4) Ravi Varma's case was decided on an appeal from a decision of the High Court in Writ Petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution. It was enough, for the purposes of a petition under Art. 226 to show a violation of an applicable rule of seniority laid down in the relevant executive instructions. But in a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution violations of fundamental rights under Art.
 16)1) of the Constitution have to be satisfactorily shown.

 (5) (a) Merely by filing repeated or delayed representations, a petitioner cannot get over the obstacles which, delay in approaching the Court creates, because equitable rights of others may have arisen. When a citizen aggrieved by the action of a government department has approached the Court and obtained a declaration of law in his favour, others, in like circumstances, should be able to rely on the sense of responsibility of the department concerned and to expect that they will be given the benefit of this declaration without the need to take their grievances to Court.

 (6) (a) The 1972 memorandum may fairly be interpreted to mean that (a) the 1949 memorandum will apply to all cases covered by it till the 1959 memorandum came into effect (b) that those who are in good faith and in the regular course, confirmed and/or promoted regularly, though, by an honest misapplication of the 1959 memorandum will not be disturbed even if they be junior to the claimants under the 1949 memorandum; (c) that in future, for vacancies and quotas, those with longer service, as contemplated by the 1949 memorandum, will be considered for confirmation and promotion: and (d) that in the subsequent career of those who stand to benefit by the 1959 memorandum, that factor will be reckoned in their favour when further opportunities for promotion arise, so that they may not suffer for ever from the mis-construction of the memorandum made by the Excise Department. [976 G-H; 977 A] 962 (b) The seniority of all unconfirmed persons is to be determined in accordance with the law as declared by this Court on 4-1-1972, but, as regards persons who had already been bona fide confirmed or promoted before 4-1-1972, 'no undoing of what had already been done in their favour would be possible. Nevertheless, it was laid down there that the cases of those who had failed to be either considered for confirmation or promotion merely because of the failure to apply the length of service 'rule for determining seniority would not suffer but will be reconsidered now subject to existence of vacancies in the grade for confirmation, or 'in the promotion quota. [977 F] In the instant case, the petitioner in writ petition No. 463 of 1971 did not paw the prescribed departmental examination until November, 1954. He was confirmed as soon as he could reasonably be considered on the occurrence of the vacancy after he passed his examination. If the reasons for the earlier confirmation of some persons who obtained earlier promotions in the year 1971, are justiable on grounds other than length of service, it is difficult to see how the petitioner could complain of any unjust treatment violative of Art. 16(1) of the Constitution. A number of promotions having taken place between 1959 and the filing of the petition in 1971; and those who were so promoted and had been satisfactorily discharging, for considerable periods, before the filing of the petition. their duties in a higher grade would acquire new claims and qualification by lapse of time and due discharge of their new functions so that they could not, unless relief has been sought speadily against their allegedly illegal confirmation and promotions be equitably equated with the petitioner.
