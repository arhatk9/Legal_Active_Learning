 A settlor executed a deed of trust in respect of all his properties whereby he made arrangements for the discharge of his 'debts and for the devolution of the property on his sons. The provisions of the deed showed that (1) specified lots of property were allotted to each of his two sons, ( ) the present income was to be applied for the discharge of the debts after payment of specified sums of money therefrom by way of monthly payments to the settlor and his sons and (3) in the event of any of the sons dying before the termination of the trust, his interest in the monthly payments aforesaid was to devolve on his heirs. It was also provided that a house, L, included in the lots allotted to the elder son (appellant) was to be subject to the right of residence of the second son, and his heirs until a suitable house was purchased by the appellant or his heirs and made over to him. Finally it was provided that on the liquidation of the debts and after the death of the settlor the trust was to come to an end and the respective lots of property including the surplus income thereof were to devolve on the appellant and his brother or their heirs.
 Some time after the execution of the deed the settlor died.
 It was contended for the appellant that under the terms of the deed of trust his interest in the properties allotted to him was only contingent on the payment of the debts of the settlor and the discharge of the obligation to provide alternative accommodation to his brother and consequently his interest could not be attached in execution of a decree.
 Held, that the appellant had a vested interest but the enjoyment of the properties was restricted so long as the debts were not discharged, and as regards the house, L, enjoyment was further restricted to the extent that it was subject to the right of residence of his brother and his heirs until the obligation to provide alternative accommodation was discharged by the appellant or his heirs.
 Where a compromise decree provides both for a personal remedy and a charge, the question whether the decree-holder can pursue the personal remedy while reserving the remedy under the charge depends on the intention to be gathered from the terms of the decree.
