 The First Schedule to the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act contains goods in respect of which a single point sales tax only is leviable under sec. 5(2) (a). The Second Schedule contains goods in respect of which a single point purchase tax only is leviable under sec. 5(2)(b). The Third Schedule contains declared goods in respect of which a single point tax only is leviable under see. 6. The Fourth Schedule contains goods exempted from tax under sec. 8. By an amendment made in 1961, there was only one entry, ',Coconuts' in the Third Schedule and the Fourth Schedule contained 'tender coconuts which are useful only for drinking purposes' which were exempted from tax. The explanation to the Third Schedule containing definition of the expression "coconuts" was replaced by another explanation by the Amending Act XVI of 1963. The result was that the Coconuts were divided only into two classes, "coconuts" as defined in the explanation and the 'tender coconuts". After the amendment of 1963 certain dealers questioned their liability to tax on the purchases made by them of watery coconuts. The challenge was upheld by the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Sri Krishna Coconut Co., v.
 Comml. Tax Officer (16. STC 511). Thereafter, by Amending Act 18 of 1966 the explanation in the Third Schedule was replaced by another explanation. At the same time item 10 "watery coconuts" was included in the Second Schedule and to this there was added an explanation containing the definition of the expression "watery coconuts". The result was that for the first time "coconuts" were divided into three classes, tender coconuts, watery coconuts and coconuts.
 After this the question arose whether "watery coconuts" are oilseeds and as such declared goods within the meaning of that term in item 6 of section 14 of the Central Sales Tax Act and the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Tagoob Mohammed v.
 Comml. Tax Officer (28 STC 110) held that "watery coconuts" were oilseeds. It was thereafter that the Andhra Pradesh Legislature passed Amending Act XII of 1971 which came into force on 17-4-1971. By this Act item 10 in Second Schedule relating to "watery coconuts" and the explanation thereto were omitted and this amendment was given effect to from 1-8-1963. Item 5 of the Third Schedule was amended as "coconuts of all varieties" and a new item 5-A @as introduced. The proviso to item 5-A inter alia provided that, where during the periods (1-8-1963 to 31-3-1965, 1-4- 1965 to 22-12-1966 and 23-12-1966 and 16-4-1971), any tax has been levied and collected in respect of watery coconuts and where tax has also been levied and collected in respect of coconuts formed out of such watery coconuts, the tax so levied and collected in respect of such watery coconuts shall alone be refunded. Explanation 1 to Third Schedule was omitted. The Act also introduced two new sections 7 and 
8. Section 7 seeks retrospectively to validate assessments and collections of tax on past transactions from August 1963 to April 1971. Section 8 provides for revision of assessments. The definition of oilseeds in item (vi) to sec. 14 of the Central Sales Tax Act, after Amendment Act LXI of 1972 which came into force on 1-4-1973 read as follows : "(vi) Oilseeds. that is to say,-(8) Coconut (i.e.
 copra excluding tender coconuts (Cocos nucifera)". The writ petitions filed before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh challenging the validity of the new item 5-A and sections 7 and 8 and also the entries relating to watery coconuts in the Third Schedule to the Principal Act on the 441 ground that these provisions offend ss. 14 and 15 of the Central Sales Tax Act, were dismissed by the division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court.
 Rejecting the civil appeals and the petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution.
 
HELD : Act XII of 1971 deals with the period between August 1963 to April 1971 and validates taxes already levied and collected. therefore. the proviso to entry 5-A of Schedule III which provides for refund does not really suffer from the defect pointed out by the Supreme Court in Bhawani Cotton Mills case (20 STC 290) that a provision for taxation which would not be justifiable cannot be upheld merely on the ground that it provides also for a refund. The various periods mentioned in item 5-A are there because of his- torical reasons and they are only reproductions of provisions of earlier law. [446E] Decision in Rattan Lal & Co. v. Assessing Authority (25 STC 136) held to apply to the facts of the present case and not the decision in Bhawani Cotton Mills case.
 There is no possibility of "watery coconuts" suffering tax after they became dried coconuts, if they have already suffered tax as "watery ;Coconuts". Rule 45 of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Rules enabling the dealers in watery coconuts or in dry coconuts to include in their return only goods which are liable to tax and not those which have already suffered tax, provides sufficient safeguards for this purpose. [447E-F] The same commodity at different stages Could be treated and taxed as commercially different articles. [447G] A.Hajee Abdul Shakoor &, Co. v. State of Madras [1964] INSC 155; [1964] 8 SCR 217, Jagannath v. Union of India, [1961] INSC 171; [1962] 2 SCR 118, East India Tobacco Co. v. State of Andhra Pradesh [1962] INSC 127; [1963] 1 SCR 404 and Venkatraman v. Madras [1969] INSC 146; [1970] 1 SCR 615 referred to- Commercially speaking, "watery coconuts" and dried coconuts are two distinct commodities. Watery coconuts are put to a variety of uses e.g., for cooking purposes, for religious and social functions whereas dried coconuts are used mainly for extracting oil. [447F-G] The Amending Act XII of 1971 also does not contravene sec.
 15 of the Central Sales Tax Act because under the Act.
 though watery coconuts and dried coconuts are treated separately there is a provision for refund when the same watery coconuts, which have suffered the tax become dry coconuts latter. [448B] ARGUMENTS For petitioners and appellants Entry 5-A in Sch. III introduced in the Act by Act 12 of 1971 contravenes sec. 15 read with sec. 14 of the Central Sales Tax Act in as much as it subjects coconuts which are declared goods to taxation at two stages; namely. once at the stage of watery coconuts and again at the stage of 'dried coconuts'. The mere possibility of double taxation would render a taxing provision contravene sec. 15 of the Central Act : Bhawani Cotton Mills Case (20 S.T.C. 290).
 But the provision for refund in the impugned Act 12 of 1971 cannot cure the defect. Secondly, the provision for refund is entirely illusory in character and ineffective by reason (a) of inherent difficulty in the situation, in that no dealer can identify that in a given case "watery coconuts" or "coconuts" is sold by him or by a subsequent dealer as "dried coconuts", (b) in that no dealer can have in his possession material necessary for such identification; and (e) Rule 45 of the A.P. General Sales Tax Rules cannot help the dealer to trace the career of the "watery coconuts" and ascertain whether it was sold as "dry coconuts" and if so, by whom and when. It is not open to the State to divide the genus i.e. "coconut", which is an oil seed, into different varieties and tax each variety at a single stage and circumvent the restrictions placed under sec. 15 of the Central Act.
 442 For the Respondent : It can hardly be argued that because the State law imposes a tax on one type of oilseed it cannot tax any other kind of oil-seed. The State Legislature has taken not,., of tile realities of the trade in coconuts while classifying them into three categories viz. "tender coconuts". and "dried coconuts" Commodities belonging to on genus have been treated is separate and distinct entities for purposes of taxation and the courts have recognised such distinction in several cases : [1962] '2' S.C.R. 118; [1962] INSC 127; [1963] 1 S.C.R. 404; [1970] 1 S.C.R. 615; [9641] 8 S.C.R. 217;
 [1972] INSC 245; A.I.R. 1973 S.C. 1034 and 24 S.T.C. 430.
 The scheme of the impugned Act is to tax both "watery coconuts" and "dried coconuts" when they constitute different commodities, but when they constitute one commodity as in cases where "dried coconuts" are formed Out of " waterly coconuts", which have already been Subjected to tax, to tax only "dried coconuts" and refund the tax levied on "watery coconuts". The impugned Act makes the stage at which tax is to be levied amply clear and Rule 45 enables a dealer to ascertain whether the goods had already suffered tax at all earlier stage.
