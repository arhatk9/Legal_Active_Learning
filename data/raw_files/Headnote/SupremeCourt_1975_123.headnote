 The respondents-assessees are dealers in foreign liquor, among other goods. They have been assessed to sales tax as dealers on sales or purchases of other goods under s. 3(1) of the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1959. They filed Writ Petitions in the High Court challenging certain orders (relating to different assessment years, ranging from 1959 to 1964-65) made by the assessing authority under the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1959 proposing to redetermine the taxable turnover of the respondents by including the sale- price of foreign liquor which, it was alleged, had escaped assessment. The High Court directed the sales tax authorities not to include in the assessable turnover the tax paid by the respondents under s. 21-A of the Madras Prohibition Act, 1937. These appeals have been filed on the basis of the certificate of fitness granted by the High Court.
 It was contended for the appellants that the amount collected by the assessees by was of sales tax from the purchasers were part of their total turnover and as much liable to be taxed under s. 3(1) of the Act.
 Rejecting the contention and dismissing the appeals, 
HELD : It is clear from s. 21-A of the Madras Prohibition Act, 1937 that the sales tax which the section requires the seller of Foreign liquor to collect from the purchaser is a tax on the purchaser and not on the seller. It is a tax on the price of the liquor and that tax is to be paid by the purchaser. Section 21-A makes the seller a collector of tax for the Government, and the amount collected by him as tax under this section cannot therefore be a part of his turnover. Under the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1959 the dealer has a statutory duty to collect the sales tax payable by him from big customer, and when the dealer passes on to the customer the amount of tax which the former is liable to pay, the said amount does not cease to be the price for the goods although "the price is expressed as X plus purchase tax". But the amounts collected by the assessees concerned in these appeals under a statutory obligation cannot be a part of their taxable turnover under the Act. [442A-D].
