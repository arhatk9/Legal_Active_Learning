 The first respondent was nominated as a Member of the Wage Board constituted under the provisions of the Wage Board Act. During the time the first respondent was a Member of the Wage Board. he filed his nomination for Contesting election to the Maharashtra State Legislative Assembly. The appellant contended that the membership of the Wage Board is an office of profit under the State Government and that, therefore. the respondent No, 1 was disqualified for election. Respondent No. 1 was entitled to draw travelling allowance and daily allowance at the rate prescribed in Scale 1 of the Bombay Civil Service Rules. He was also entitled to receive Rs. 25/- per day of the meeting of the Wage Board as honorarium.
 
HELD : It was not disputed that the daily allowance and travelling allowance payable to the members would not make the membership of the Wage Board an office of profit. The whole controversy centres round the honorarium payable to the members of the Wage Board. The matter must be considered as a matter of substance rather than of form.
 The daily allowance was Rs. 18 whether the meeting was held at Bombay, Poona. Aurangabad or Kopargaon. The first respondent's evidence was that when he went to Bombay for attending the meetings of the Wage Board he had to spend Rs.
 20/- as Taxi fare, Rs. 25/- for breakfast lunch and dinner,' and Rs. 40/- for lodging. He seems to have been staying in a modest hotel. After an elaborate discussion of the entire evidence the learned High Court Judge accepted the evidence of the first respondent that he had to spend Rs. 20/- for taxi fare and that hotel charges for a common room varied from Rs. 15/- to Rs. 16/- and for a single room from Rs.
 28/- to Rs. 30/- and that the aggregate of the honorarium and the daily allowance payable to the first respondent was hardly sufficient to meet the personal expenditure incurred for the purpose of attending the meeting in Bombay and simply because he was paid both the honorarium and daily allowance it could not be said that he was making any pecuniary gain thereby. The question hag to be looked at in a realistic way. The payments made to first respondent cannot be a source of profit unless he stayed with some friends or relatives or stayed in a Dharamshala. The first respondent, therefore, did not hold an office of profit.
