 Respondents 1 and 2 carried on business under the name and style of M/s.Jogilal Probhu Chand. Under a cash credit agreement in favour of the Bihar Sharif Branch of the Bank and on the strength of a promissory note executed by the firms, the firm drew a cheque on the Bank which was passed for payment. The High Court found that the money was not paid to the firm but was kept in the hands of the Potdar a servant or agent of the Bank for being paid to another firm at Patna. This person accompanied the respondents up to Patna but failed to meet the respondents at the shop of the Patna firm which was the place agreed upon. Before the High Court the counsel for the present appellant conceded that the Potdar had taken the money with him.
 Before this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that no concession was made as stated in the judg- ment of the High Court, to the effect that the Potdar took the money with him. It was further contended that the payment to the Potdar should be deemed to be payment to the firm. Reliance was alsoplaced on ss. 85 and 118 of the Negotiable instruments Act,1881. Finally it was contended that the Bank could not beheld responsible for the money misappropriated by the Potdarbecause his act was a criminal act.
 Held, that where a statement appears in the judgment of a court that a particular thing happened or did not happen before it, it ought not ordinarily to be permitted to be challenged by a party unless both parties to the litigation agree that the statement is erroneous.
 843 The money not having passed into the actual custody of the firm or that of the custody of a person who was servant or agent of the firm, the firm cannot be held liable for it.
 In order to avail of the provisions of s. 85 of the Nego- tiable Instruments Act it has to be established that payment had in fact been made to the firm or to a person on behalf of the firm. Section 118 of the Act was held not to have any bearing upon the case at all.

 Vicarious liability may in appropriate cases, rest on the master with respect to his servant's acts but it cannot possibly rest on a stranger with respect to the criminal acts of a servant of another.
