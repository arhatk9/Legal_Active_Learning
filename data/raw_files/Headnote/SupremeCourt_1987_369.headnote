 % The petitioners, a News Editor and a trainee sub- editor, filed writ petitions in the Supreme Court pointing out features of maladministration within the Central Jail at Tihar relating to juvenile undertrial prisoners and praying for appropriate directions to the respondents. The Court made several orders with reference to juvenile prisoners and undertrials. Under the orders of the Court, the Sessions Judge visited the jail on more than one occasion and made several reports. Pursuant to the Court's directions, certain suggestions were made by the petitioners as well as the respondents.
 Disposing of the writ petitions, ^ 
 HELD: 1.1 Those who are incharge of jail administration from bottom to top must generate the proper approach to deal with prisoners and undertrials. Whatever may have been the philosophy of punishment in the pas', today the prison house is looked upon as a reformatory and the years spent in jail should be with a view to providing rehabilitation to the prisoner after the sentence is over. therefore, the Prison House, in case the true purpose is to be achieved, has to provide the proper atmosphere, leadership, environment, situations and circumstances for the re-generation. Members of the staff of the jail from bottom to top must be made cognizant of 235 this responsibility and that awareness must be reflected in their conduct. Judicial notice can be taken of prevailing conditions in the jails. [240E-H; 241A] 
 1.2 The work load of superintendence should be distributed in a graded way and the officers should have direct charge of such divided responsibilities. It is necessary that a large dose of good living should be introduced in the jail life. The jail administration, and, in particular, the Administrator should take into consideration this aspect and try to generate a sense of humanism in these officers and those in the ranks below them so that the prisoners have direct contact with them and benefit by every contact with those officers in getting round to the right approach in life. [241C-E] 
 1.3 Every magistrate or trial Judge authorised to issue warrants for detention of prisoners should ensure that every warrant authorising detention specified the age of the prisoner to be detained. Judicial mind must be applied in cases where there is doubt about age-not necessarily by a trial-and every warrant must specify the age of the person to be detained. The authorities in the jail throughout India should not accept any warrant of detention as a valid one unless the age of the detenu is shown therein. It shall be open to the jail authorities to refuse to honour a warrant if the age of the person remanded to jail custody is not indicated. It would be lawful for such officers to refer back the warrant to the issuing court for rectifying the defect before it is honoured. [241G-H; 242A] 
 1.4 Due care should be taken to ensure that the juvenile delinquents are not assigned work in the same area where the regular prisoners are made to work. Care should be taken to ensure that there is no scope for their meeting and having contacts.[242D] 
 1.5 Steps should be taken to shift the warders at the end of every three years. This is a principle which has been accepted in the Punjab Jail Manual (Chapter VI, Rule 273).
 [242E] 
 1.6 The Visitors' Board should consist of cross sections of society; people with good background, social activists, people connected with the news media, lady social workers, jurists, retired public officers from the Judiciary as also the Executive. The Sessions Judge should be given an acknowledged position as a visitor and his visits should not be routine ones. Full care should be taken by him to have a 236 real picture of the defects in the Administration qua the resident prisoners and undertrials. [242G-H] Monitoring the affairs of a jail is a difficult for this Court. On account of the fact that the Tihar jail is in the Capital of the country and on account of the advantages of publicity available through the media and otherwise, affairs of the jail have received due publicity over the last four years. If a change has to be brought about it has to start from somewhere and Tihar Jail is most suited for that purpose being under the direct management of the Union of India.[240C; 241B]
