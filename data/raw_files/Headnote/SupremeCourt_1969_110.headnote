 The appellant was the sole proprietor of a concern known as Radha & Co. The respondents Ambal & Co. were a partnership concern. The respondents as also the appellant were manufacturers and dealers in snuff, carrying on business at Madras and having business activities inside and outside the State of Madras. In 1958 the appellant sought registration of a trade mark consisting of a label with a picture of the goddess Sri Andal and the legand 'Sri Andal' in the central panel, and the words 'Sri Andal Madras Snuff' in various languages in the upper and lower panels. The appellant's application was objected to by the respondents on the ground that it was deceptively similar to their registered trade marks. One of these consisted of a label containing a device of goddess Sri Ambal in the centre with the legand 'Sri Ambal parimala snuff' at the top of the label and the name 'Sri Ambal & Co. Madras' at the bottom. The other trade mark consisted of the expression 'Sri Ambal'. The Registrar of Trade Marks held that the sound of 'Ambal' did not so nearly resemble the sound of 'Andal' in spite of certain letters being common to both the marks as to be likely to cause confusion or deception among a substantial number of persons. A Single Judge of the High Court and the Divisional Bench however took the opposite view whereupon the appellant came to this Court. No plea of honest concurrent use -within the meaning of s. 12(2) of the Act could be raised in view of the concurrent finding in this respect by the Registrar as well as the two courts below.
 
HELD : (i) The Registrar had expert knowledge and his decision should not be lightly disturbed. But both the courts had found that he was clearly wrong and that there was deceptive similarity between the two marks. In an appeal under Art. 136 of the Constitution the onus was upon the appellant to show that the concurrent finding of the courts below was erroneous and that the conditions of s.
 12(1) had been satisfied [293 F] (ii) The question in issue was whether if the appellant's mark was used in a normal and fair manner in connection with the snuff and if similarly fair and normal user was assumed of the existing registered marks, will there be such a likelihood of deception that the mark ought not to be allowed to be registered ? The court had to decide the question on a comparison of the competing marks as a whole and their distinctive and essential features. [293 H-294 B] So considered there could be no doubt that the word 'Ambal' was the distinguishing feature of the trade mark of the respondent and the word 'Andal' was the distinguishing feature of the appellant's trade mark. There is a striking similarity and affinity of sound between the words 'Andal' 291 and 'Ambal' Giving due weight to the judgment of the Registrar and bearing in mind the conclusions of the Single Judge and the Divisional Bench it must be held that there was real danger of confusion between the two marks, [294 B- C] (iii) There was no visual resemblance between the two marks but ocular comparison is not always the decisive test.
 The resemblance between the two marks must be considered with reference to the ear as well as the eye. [294 D] (iv) The argument that on account of the different ideas 'conveyed by the words 'Ambal' and 'Andal' the accidental phonetic resemblance' could not lead to confusion was not acceptable because it lost sight of the realities of the case. The Hindus in the South of India may be well aware that the words Ambal and Andal represent the names of two distinct goddesses. But the respondent's customers were not confined to the Hindus of the South of India alone and they were not likely to remember the fine distinctions between a Vaishnavite goddess and a Shivaite deity.
 The appeal, accordingly, must be disallowed.
