Union of India, W.P. (Crl.) No.
 1171/82, made the present applications seeking clarification on the various points " namely (i) whether a scrutinizing agency must be distinct from a placement agency; (ii) what steps must be taken where there is disruption in the family of the petitioner either before or after the adoption; (iii) what is the role which a scrutinising agency is expected to play in the procedure relating to inter-country adoptions;

 Disposing of the applications, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The scrutinizing agency appointed by the Court for the purpose of assisting it in reaching the conclusion whether it would be in the interest of the child to be given in adoption to the foreign parents must not in any manner be involved in placement of children in adoption. The scrutinizing agency must be an expert body having experience in the area of child welfare and it should have nothing to do with placement of children in adoption, for otherwise objective and impartial evaluation may not be possible. [80 H; 81 A-B] 
 2. The social or child welfare agency sponsoring the application must undertake that in case of disruption of the family of the foreigner before adoption can be effected it will take care of the child and find a suitable alternative placement for it with the approval of the concerned social or child welfare agency in India and report such alternative placement to the Court handling the guardians-ship proceedings and such information shall be passed on both by the court as also by the concerned social or child welfare agency in India to the Secretary, Ministry of Social Welfare, Government of India. The social or child welfare agency sponsoring the application should also, in the event of disruption of the family of the foreigner before adoption can be effected, give intimation of this fact to the Indian Embassy or High Commission, as the case may be, and the Indian Embassy or High commission shall also be kept informed about the whereabouts of the child so that they can take the necessary steps for ensuring that the child is properly taken 73 care of and a suitable alternative placement for it is found. If a disruption in the family of the foreigner takes place after the child is adopted, nothing can be done by the social or child welfare agency sponsoring the application, because, on adoption, the child would acquire the nationality of its adoptive parents and would then be entitled to all the rights of a national in that country.
 [81 E-H] 
 3. The scrutinizing agency should not be asked to make any inquiries before a child is offered in adoption to a foreigner or a petition for appointment of a foreigner as guardian is filed in Court. The primary responsibility for ensuring that the child is legally free for adoption must be that of the social or child welfare agency processing the application of the foreigner for guardian-ship of the child.
 Whatever inquiries are necessary for the purpose of satisfying itself that the child has been voluntarily relinquished by its biological parents after understanding all the implications of adoption must be the responsibility of the social or child welfare agency processing the application for guardianship. But so far as the scrutinizing agency is concerned it should not come into the picture at this stage. It has a vital role to play after a foreigner has approved of the child to be taken in adoption and a petition is filed in court for appointment of the foreigner as guardian of the child and it is at that stage that the scrutinising agency is expected to assist the court in coming to the conclusion whether it would be in the interest of the child to be given in adoption to the foreigner. The scrutinising agency should not at that stage try to ascertain who are the biological parents' of the child and whether they are willing to take back the child. That is primarily the responsibility of the social or child welfare agency processing the application. The Court should, in order to make sure that the child is legally free for adoption, require the social or child welfare agency processing the application to place material before the court stating what efforts have been made to trace the biological parents and what are the circumstances in which the child came into the possession of such social or child welfare agency. Where the court feels some doubt as to how the child has been obtained and in what manner, the Court may ask the scrutinising agency to make inquiries with a view to finding out how the social or child welfare agency processing the application has got the child and if the child has been obtained by such social or child welfare agency from another institution or agency, how that institution or agency got the child and from what source and in what manner and the scrutinising agency may then make discreet inquiries for this purpose without disclosing 74 to any one that the child is sought to be given in adoption.
 The Court may also in an appropriate case where it has some doubt ask the scrutinising agency to inquire whether the child has been voluntarily surrendered by the biological parents or whether such relinquishment has been obtained by fraudulent means. But unless the Court so directs, the scrutinising agency should not make any attempt to trace the biological parents of the child or to inquire whether they are willing to take back the child. [ 82B; 83A-D] 
 3. (ii) The social or child welfare agency engaged in the work of placing children in adoption should not readily assume that children including cradle babies who are found abandoned are legally free for adoption. No children who are found abandoned should be deemed to be legally free for adoption until the Juvenile Court or the Social Welfare Department declares them as destitutes or abandoned. It should also be impressed upon the Juvenile Courts that when children are selected for adoption, release orders should be passed by them expediously and without delay and proper vigilance in this behalf must be exercised by the High Courts. [83 E-G] 
 4. (i) There should not be any objection in a child under the care of a social or child welfare agency or hospital or orphanage in one State being taken to another State by a social or child welfare agency for the purpose of being given in adoption because the procedural safeguards laid down in Laxmi Kant Pandey's case would be sufficient to eliminate the possibility of trafficking in children through inter-State transfer of children. [83 H; 84 A-B] (ii) By way of additional safeguard, it is directed that no court in a State will entertain an application for appointment of a foreigner as guardian of a child which has been brought from another State, if there is a social or child welfare agency in that other State which has been recognised by the Government of India for inter-country adoption. The social or child welfare agency processing the application for guardianship should then be directed to send the child to the recognised social or child welfare agency in the other State, so that whatever proceedings are necessary for giving the child in adoption may be instituted by the social or child welfare agency and in such an event, the complete details of the case history and background including the home study report, the child study report, if any, and all other information relating to the child should be made available to the latter social or child welfare agency. If there is no recognised social or child welfare agency in the State where the child is 75 found or obtained, the child shall be transferred to a recognised social or child welfare agency at the nearest place in the immediate neighbouring State. [85 B-D] 
 5. (i) It is necessary that progress reports must be submitted to the Court and to the social or child welfare agency in India quarterly during the first two years and half yearly for the next three years but after adoption had taken place the Courts may not insist on strict observance of this requirement. The order to be made by the Court should also provide that progress reports shall be submitted by the social or child welfare agency sponsoring the application of the foreigner until adoption is effected.
 That would provide greater assurance because it may not be possible to take any action if the foreigner fails to provide progress reports, but if the social or child welfare agency sponsoring the application for guardianship fails to submit progress reports, the Court can in future decline to entertain any application for guardianship where the foreigner seeking appointment as guardian is sponsored by such social or child welfare agency. [85 G-H; 86 A-B] 
 5. (ii) However, if there is a social or child welfare agency owned or operated by the Government in a foreign country, it would not be necessary for a foreigner to route his application through a recognised social or child welfare agency within his country and he can approach a recognised social or child welfare agency in India through such Government agency.
 Where there is Government agency in a foreign country through which applications for taking children in adoption are routed, as in Sweden, it may not be possible to insist that the progress reports in regard to the child should be submitted by the Government agency and in such case it may be enough to provide in the order to be made by the Court that the progress reports shall be submitted by the foreign parents through the Government agency. [87 B-E] 
 6. There is no objection to a foreign social or child welfare agency having a representative in India, but it is necessary to lay down certain parameters within which 8 . h representative can be allowed to operate. In the first place, the representative should be an Indian citizen with a degree or diploma in social work coupled with experience in child welfare. Secondly, the representative should be acting only for one foreign social or child welfare agency and not more nor should he be working on a 76 free lance basis. It would also be desirable to limit the sphere of operation of the representative to a particular geographical area so that he is able to attend to his functions and duties properly and diligently. The representative should have a general power of attorney to act in India on behalf of the foreign social or child welfare agency and he should also have the authority to operate banking accounts in the name of the foreigner social or child welfare agency with the permission of the Reserve Bank of India. In order to prevent taking of children from needy parents by offering them monetary inducement and to eliminate trafficking in children the representative of the foreign social or child welfare agency should not be permitted to go scouting for children, or to receive children directly from parents. He should be allowed to act as representative only if he is recognised as such by the Central Government and such recognition may be given by the Central Government subject to the condition that the various requirements set out above are complied with by such representative. [86 D-H; 87 A] 
 7. There is no need to dispense with the requirement that the certificates, declarations and documents required to be submitted along with the application of the foreigner for taking a child in adoption should be duly notarised by a Notary Public and the signature of the Notary Public should be duly attested either by an officer of the Ministry of External Affairs or Justice or social welfare of the Ministry of External Affairs or Social Welfare of the country of the foreigner or by an officer of the Indian Embassy or High Commission or Consulate in that country. [87 F-G] 
 8. The Court may not ordinarily insist on making of the deposit by the foreigner but in an appropriate case, if it so thinks fit, it may pass such an order. The execution of a bond would ordinarily be sufficient. The bond should be by way of security for repatriation of the child to India in case it becomes necessary to do so as also for ensuring adoption of the child within the period two years. The bond may be executed by the foreigner who is appointed guardian of the child, but there may be difficulty in enforcing such bond, unless the bond is executed in favour of the Indian Diplomatic Mission in the country of the foreigner. It might therefore be safer to take the bond from the representative of the foreign child or social welfare agency in India so that if the condition of the bond is violated, the Court can proceed to enforce the bond against such representative who would be an Indian national. There is also 77 another alternative which may be adopted by the Court. The Court may take the bond from the social or child welfare agency which has processed the application and such social or child welfare agency may in its turn take a corresponding bond from the sponsoring social or child welfare agency in the foreign country. But, though this alternative may, in a given case, be adopted by the court, where the recognised social or child welfare agency processing the application is ready to give the bond, the Court should not insist upon execution of the bond by such social or child welfare agency. It would be sufficient to take the bond from the representative of the foreign social or child welfare agency in India or to insist on the bond being executed by the foreigner in favour of the Indian Diplomatic Mission abroad.
 [88F; 89 A-D] 
 9. Where it is not possible for the foreigner to complete the adoption process within two years, an application should be made to the Court for extension of time for making the adoption D and the Court may grant appropriate extension or time. [89 F] 
 10. The sum of Rs. 60 per day, represents the outside limit of the maintenance expenses which may be recovered from the prospective adoptive parents and it does not represent the rate at which maintenance expenses should be recoverable in every case. When the Court makes an order appointing a foreigner as guardian, the Court should look into this question and sanction the amount to be paid by the foreigner to the social or child welfare agency by way of reimbursement of maintenance expenses and that only such amount as may be sanctioned by the Court shall be recoverable by the social or child welfare agency by way of maintenance expenses from the foreigner who is appointed guardian of the child. So far as surgical or medical expenses incurred on the child are concerned, they should also be recoverable by the social or child welfare agency against production of bills or vouchers. The recognised social or child welfare agency processing the application must also be entitled to recover from the foreigner who is sought to be appointed guardian of the child, costs incurred in preparing and filing the application and prosecuting it in Court. Such expenses may include legal expenses, administrative expenses, preparation of child study report, preparation of medical and I.Q. reports, passport and visa expenses and conveyance expenses and they may be fixed by the Court at such figure not exceeding Rs. 41000 as may be though fit by the Court. [90 D-H; 91 A-C] 
 11. Proceedings for appointment of guardian of the child with a view to its eventual adoption must be disposed of at the 78 earliest and in any event not later than two months from the date of filing of the application. The High Court should call for returns from the district Court within their respective jurisdiction showing every two months as to how many applications for appointment of guardian are pending, when they were filed and if more than two months have passed since the date of their filing why they have not been disposed of up to the date of the return. If any application for guardianship is not disposed of by the district Courts within a period of two months and there is no satisfactory explanation the High courts must take a serious view of the matter. [91 E-G] 
 12. The Court dealing with an application for appointment of foreign parents as guardian need not insist on the foreign parents or even one of them coming down to India for the purpose of approving the child. In case of an older or handicapped child also, it is not necessary to require the foreign parents to come down to India, because a complete dossier of the child consisting of photographs, detailed medical report, child study report and other relevant particulars is always forwarded to the sponsoring social and child welfare agency in the foreign country and it is after careful consideration of this dossier and a full and detailed discussion under the sponsoring social and child welfare agency that the foreign parents decide to accept the child to be taken in adoption and proceed further in the matter through the sponsoring social or child welfare agency. [92 D-G] 
 13. (i) One of the ways in which adoption by an Indian family can be facilitated is to set up a centralised agency in the State or even in a large city where there are several social or child welfare agencies. Each social or child welfare agency must feed information to the centralised agency in regard to the particulars of the children available with it for adoption and a combined list of children available for adoption with various social or child welfare agencies attached or affiliated to the centralised agency, should be circulated to all such social or child welfare agencies, so that if any Indian family comes to a social or child welfare agency for taking a child in adoption, such social or child welfare agency would be able to give full and detailed information to the Indian family as to which children are available for adoption and that with what social or child welfare agency. This procedure has been adopted by social and child welfare agencies in Bombay.
 The Indian Association for Promotion of Adoption, Bombay has set up a Voluntary Co-ordinating agency on an experimental basis. The Supreme Court wholly 79 endorses and recommends setting up of such Voluntary Co- ordinating agency in each State and if circumstances so require there may even be more than one Voluntary Co- ordinating agencies in a State. [93 D-H; 94 B] 
 13. (ii) Where there is a Voluntary Co-ordinating agency or any other Centralised agency which maintains a register of children available for adoption as also a register of Indian adoptive parents, it would be enough to wait for a period of three to four weeks. The Voluntary Co- ordinating or Centralized agency can immediately contact the Indian family which is on its register as prospective adoptive parents and inform them that a particular child is available for adoption. If within a period of three to four weeks, the child is not taken in adoption by an Indian family, it should be regarded as available for inter-country adoption. But even where it is not possible to find and Indian family which is prepared to take a child in adoption and it is cleared for inter-country adoption, the first priority for taking the child in adoption should be given to Indians residing abroad and if no such Indians are available, then to adoptive couples where atleast one parent is of Indian origin.
