 On the question whether the confirmation was made one day after the expiration of the period of 3 months from the date of detention.
 
HELD : The effect of defining a period from such a day until such a day within which an act is to be done is to exclude the first day and to include the last day; and therefore, in the present case, the order of confirmation was made before the expiration of the period of three month& from the date of detention.
