 Prior to July 1, 1942, canteen facilities had been provided to the armed forces of the country by a company known as "Canteen Contractors' Syndicate". On June 13, 1942 the defence department took over the business of the said company and it was run by the Government of India under the title and name "Canteen Stores Department". After partition of the country, the Canteen Stores Department of undivided India was wound up and its terminal profits were distributed between India and Pakistan and India's share formed the working capital for the Canteen Stores Department (India), which was formally inaugurated as a "Government of India Undertaking" for a period of three years in the first instance commencing from January 1, 1948. The recruitment rules for the various categories of services of the Canteen Stores Department (India) were notified by the president by the Ministry of Defence letter dated June 28, 1973. By another letter dated January 28, 1969, Government orders as applicable to defence (Civilians) were made applicable to the Canteen Stores Department (India) employees in toto automatically from the date of their applications to Defence (Civilians). Canteen Stores Department (India) was allowed to tender military credit notes for payment of railway freight by the Government of India (Ministry of Railways) Memorandum dated February 28, 1971 addressed to the Ministry of defence. When the question of applicability of section 32(iv) of the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965 came up before the Division Bench of the High Court of Bombay, the High Court held that the exemption provided in that section is attracted inasmuch as the Canteen Stores Department is an establishment engaged in an industry carried on by or under the authority of a department of a Central Government. Hence the appeal by special leave.
