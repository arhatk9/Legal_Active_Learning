 Clause (4) of the Scheme of gratuitty applicable to the appellant Estate provided that a dispute regarding a claim for payment of gratuity of a workman who had been dismissed for misconduct shall be referred to the Labour Court for decision. One of workmen of the appellant was charge- sheeted in respect of riotous and disorderly behaviour for having assaulted a tea-maker inside the factory of the appellant. A departmental enquiry was held and being found guilty of misconduct he was dismissed. As a dispute arose about the payment of gratuity the matter was referred to the Labour Court. Before the Labour Court it was not disputed that the dismissal of the workman was on account of misconduct consisting of riotous and disorderly behaviour and assaulting a tea-maker. The Labour Court, relying upon the decision of this Court in State of Punjab v. Suraj Prakash Kapur, [1962] 2 S.C.R. 711 decided the question in favour of the workman. Appeal by special leave, was filed in this Court. Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : According to the decision of this Court in the Delhi Cloth Mills case misconduct could be of three kinds, (1) technical misconduct which leaves no trial of indiscipline;
 (2) misconduct resulting in damage to the employer's property which might be compensated by forfeiture of gratuity or a part thereof, and (3) serious misconduct such as acts of violence against the management or other employees or disorderly behaviour in or near the place of the employment, which though not directly causing damage is conducive to grave indiscipline. The first should involve no forfeiture, the second may involve forfeiture of an amount equal to the loss directly suffered by the employer in consequence of the misconduct, and the third will entail forfeiture of the gratuity payable to the workman. In other words, according to this decision, if a workman is guilty of a serious misconduct of the third category, then: his gratuity can be forfeited in its entirety. [764D] The decision in the Delhi Cloth Mills as applicable to the facts of the present case and the appeal must accordingly be allowed.
 State of Punjab v. Suraj Parkash Kapur, etc., [1962] 2.
 S.C.R. 711 applied.
 Delhi Cloth & General Mills Co. Ltd. v. Workmen and Others, etc. [1968] INSC 231; [1969] 2 S.C.R. 307, referred to.
 (ii) The contention that the Labour Court did not apply its mind to the nature and degree of the misconduct committed and therefore the matter should be remitted to that court for decision in accordance with law, could not be accepted because the facts were not in dispute before the Labour Court.
