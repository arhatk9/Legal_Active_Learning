 The respondent-Company was carrying on the business of manufacturing and selling cotton textiles. In 1953-54, because cloth, the company sold (i) old discarded items such as stores, machinery, iron scrap,, cans boxes, cotton ropes, rags etc., (ii) coal; (iii) by-products such as kolsi" or cinders, and waste caustic liquor. In the case of the first item the sales were frequent, the volume was large, and the price realised was credited in the profit and loss account of the Company, thus indirectly reducing the cost of production of the textiles. In the case of coal it was a commodity which the company required for its business and which had been purchased for use in that business. There was, however, ,no evidence as to what was the total quantity of coal purchased by the company and what percentage thereof was sold except that the value of the coal sold exceeded Rs.
 16,000. In the case of the third item though the by- products could not be used by the company, they were goods which were produced continuously and regularly day after day in the Company's manufacturing process, and for which, there was a market. The sales-tax authorities brought the turnover from the sales of all these commodities to tax under the Bombay Sales-tax Act, 1953. The High Court, on a reference, held in favour of the Company.
 in appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) In disposing of miscellaneous old and discarded items, the Company was not carrying on business of selling those items. In order that receipts from the sale of a commodity may be included in the taxable turnover it must be shown that the assessee was carrying on business in that particular commodity,, and to prove that fact it must be established that the assessee had an intention to carry on business in that commodity. The characteristics of volume, frequency, continuity and regularity indicating an intention to continue the activity of carrying on the transactions with a profit motive must exist. But no test is decisive of the intention to carry on the business, and the intention has to be inferred in the light of all the circumstances.
 Where a person comes to own in the course of his business of manufacturing or selling a commodity, some other commodity which is not a. by-product or a subsidiary pro-duct of that business, and he sells that commodity, cogent evidence that he has intention to carry on business of selling that commodity would be -required. In the present case, no presumption can be raised, on the facts, that when the goods were acquired there was an intention to carry on the business in those discarded materials, nor can it be said that the goods became part of or an incident of the main business of -selling textiles., as they were not by-products or subsidiary products arising in the course of manufacturing textiles. [621 E-H; 624 B-C, E] (ii) There were no circumstances existing at the time when the coal was purchased, or which have come into existence late, which establish an intention to carry on a business of selling coal. The burden of proving that the Company was carrying on the, business of selling coal lay 619 upon the Sales-tax Authorities and if they held against the Company merely because of the frequency and the volume of the sales, the inference cannot be sustained. [626 A-C] (iii) The "Kolsi" or cinders and the waste caustic liquor were byproducts or subsidiary products in the course of manufacture of textiles and sale thereof was incidental to the business of the Company. An intention to carry on business in those commodities may be reasonably attributed to the Company and the turnover with respect to those two commodities would be liable to sales-tax. [624 G-H; 625 E-F] Case law referred to.
