 The petitioners who were detained under ss. 3(1)(a) (ii) (iii) and 3(2) of the Preventive Detention Act, 1950, made representations to the State Government against their detentions. The representations were made after their cases were placed before the Advisory Board. The State Government without considering the representations, passed them on to the Advisory Board. The Board considered the case of the petitioners as well as their representations to the Government and confirmed the order of detention. The petitioners filed a writ of habeas, corpus, challenging their detentions on the ground that the State Government had failed to carry out its obligation. under Art. 22(5) of the Constitution to consider the representation. On the questions (i) whether there is on the appropriate Government the obligation to consider the representation made by detenue, and (ii) if there is, whether it makes any difference where such a representation is made after the detenue's case is referred to the Advisory Board.
 
HELD : Setting aside the detenfion, (i) Clause (5) of the Art. 22 not only contains the obligation of the appropriate government to furnish the grounds and to give the earliest opportunity to make a representation but also by necessary implication. the obligation to consider that representation. The expressions "as soon may be" and "the earliest opportunity" in that clause clearly indicate that the grounds are to be served and that the opportunity to make a representation is provided for to enable the detenue to show that hit detention is unwarranted and since no other authority who should consider such representation is mentioned it can only be the detaining authority to whom it is. to be made which has to consider.

 (ii) The Constitution could not have intended that a representation under cl. (5) need not be considered by the appropriate Government where an Advisory Board is constituted. If that was the intention cl. (5) would not have directed the detaining authority to afford the earliest opportunity to the detenue. In imposing the obligation to afford the opportunity to make a representation cl. (5) does not make any distinction between orders of detention for only three months or less, where there is no necessity of having the opinion of an Advisory Board, and those for a longer duration. The clause does not say that the representation is to be considered by the appropriate Government in the former class of cases and by the Board in the latter class of cases. The obligation of the Government to consider the representation is distinct from the obligation to, constitute an Advisory Board. Whereas the Government considers the representation to ascertain whether the order is in conformity with its 544 power under the relevant law, the Board considers such representation from the point of view of also arriving at its opinion whether there is sufficient case for detention.
 [549 B-C, E-H].
 The provisions of the Act also strengthen the conclusion that the Government has to consider the representation. If the representation was for consideration not by the Government but by the Board there was no necessity to provide in s. 7 that it should be addressed to the Government. Further, it could not have been the intention of Parliament that the Government could pass an order under s. 13 revoking or modifying an order of detention without considering the representation which has under s. 7 been addressed to it.
