 The respondent-State authorised its Development Commissioner to exercise powers exercisable by the Government under s. 9(1) of the Gujarat Panchayats Act 1961.
 After making the prescribed inquiry under s. 9(1) of the Act the Development Commissioner issued a notiftation under s.
 9(1) of the Act decal the whole area of the existing limits of the appellant cipality to be a nagar. The appellants field a writ petition for- quashing the notification and declaring s. 9 of the Act as ultra vires and unconstitutional, which the High Court dismissed. In appeal to this Court, the appellants contended that (i) the power to make enquiry under s. 9(1) was not delegated to the Development Commission; (ii) s. 9 of the Act did not apply to a municipal district as it was not a local area or such other administrative unit or part thereof; (iii) the notification was issued 'in mala fide exercise of power as it was imbued after the municipality indicated its unwillingness to accept the of the Government to include within its limits certain vadi areas; and (iv) s. 9 of the Act was ultra vires by reasons of excessive delegation of legis native power in favour of the State Government.
 
HELD:(per Full Court) (i) The power to make the declaration necessarily carries with it the power to make the inquiry preliminary to the declaration. There can be no declaration without an inquiry. The Development Commissioner was sufficiently authorised to issue the declaration after making the prescribed inquiry.- [635 G-H] (ii)Section 307 of the Act shows that a local area co- extensive 'with or included within the limits of a municipal district or a municipal borough ma be declared to be a gram or nagar under s. 9 and on such a declaration the Municipality functioning within the local area or part thereof ceases to exist. On a combined reading of ss. 9 and 307, it would appear that a municipal borough is an administrative unit within the of s. 9(1) and a local area co-extensive with or included in a municipal borough may be declared to be a gram or nagar. [636 B-C] (iii) Therewas no mala fide in the issuance of the notification. Under s. 4(1)(b) of the Gujarat Municipalities Act, 1963, the State Govern has the power to alter the funits of the municipal borough after consulting the municipality. The State Government had duty consulted the municipality. If the Government wanted to exercise its powers under the aforesaid s.- 4(1)(b), it could do so without the consent of the municipality. For the purpose of imposing its opinion, it was not necessary for the government to take recourse to the device of a declaration under s. 9(1) of the Gujarat Pandora Act, 1961. Nor was the surrounding vadi area included in the nagar declared by the notification under s. 9(1). [636 F, G] 6 32 (iv)(Per Wanchoo and Bachawat, JJ.) Section 9(1) does not suffer from the vice of excessive delegation. An essential legislative function consists in the determination of a legislative policy and its formulation as a binding rule of conduct. Having laid down the legislative policy, the legislature may confer discretion on an administrative agency as to the execution of the policy and leave it to the agency to work out the details within the frame work of the policy. [637 B-C] It is the policy of the Act that panchayats should be established within a seasonable time in all local areas with population not exceeding 30,000 and not included in a notified area or a cantonment. This policy guides and controls the discretionary power of the State Government under S. 9(1). Having regard to the policy of the Act, it is plain that the discretionary power under S. 9(2) is vested in the State Government for the purpose of reorganising the local areas into new units of local self- Government. [638 C-D] It is not correct to say that even a municipal borough with a population of over 30,000 is at the mercy of the State Government under s. 9(1). Under S. 9(1) read with s. 307, the government has no power to declare a municipal borough with a population exceeding 30,000 as a gram or nagar. It will be an abuse of the power under s. 9(1) if by declaring small fragments of such municipal borough into separate grams or nagars, the government seeks to achieve indirectly what it cannot do directly. But S. 9(1) at be held unconstitutional because of the possibility that it may be unfaithfully administered by those who are charged with its execution.

 (Per Shelat, J. dissenting) : Section 9 suffers from the vice of excessive delegation.
 Even if a policy is declared by a statute it may be couched in such vague terms that it may not set down a definite standard or criterion for the guidance of the delegate. [644 D-E] In spite of the avowed policy of the Art to set up Panchayat Raj throughout the State the Government, by virtue of the power to declare being discretionary under S. 9(1), may or may not declare a local area to be nagar or a gram. The only fetter is that where it desires to make a declaration in respect of any particular local area it can do so after making an inquiry as prescribed. But neither s. 9 nor any other proviSion in the Act lays down that even if the inquiry ends in a particular conclusion the Government must make the declaration.. What the requisite result of such an inquiry for a declaration should be is also not prescribed ,in the Act and the Government is left to decide its course of action after such an inquiry. [645 D-F] Sub-section 2 confers a discretionary power on the Government to alter by inclusion or exclusion any area or areas from a nagar or a grain panchayat and convert one into the other, the only restriction on such power being the necessity to consult the district, the taluka, and the nagar or the gram panchayat as the case may be. The restriction is consultation but not the consent of the concerned panchayats. Sub-section 2 does not require even an inquiry as sub-s. 1 does at the time of the declara- 633 tion. Nor does it lay down any principle or criterion as to when and in what circumstances the Government can launch upon such alteration of the local limits. Thus the Government can modify at any time the structure and the nature of a panchayat from a nagar to a gram pancbayat and vice versa by simply altering its area after a mere consultation and even if the panchayats concerned are against such alteration. Under this power the Government can also transfer a portion or portions of a nagar or gram panchayat after formally going through the process of consultation and join it-or them with another panchayat even if the people concemed were to be, unwilling to such a transfer.
