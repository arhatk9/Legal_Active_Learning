 A scheme under the East Punjab Holdings (Consolidation and Prevention of Fragmentation Act) for consolidation of an estate was prepared in 1959. The petitioner, who held land within the ceiling limit, challenged it on the ground that in so far as it makes reservation of land for the income of the Panchayat, it was hit by the second proviso to Art.
 31A(1) of the Constitution.
 
 HELD (per Subba Rao C.J., Sikri and Bachawat, JJ.). The essential difference between "acquisition by the State" on the one hand and "modification or extinguishment of rights" on the other, is that in the first case, the beneficiary is the State while in the second, the beneficiary is not the State. As the beneficiary in the instant case was the Panchayat which falls within the definition of the word "State" under Art. 12 of the Constitution, the reservation in the scheme was contrary to the second proviso and must be modified appropriately.
 [144 D-H] The repartition under s. 21 of the Act would not amount to "acquisition" within the second proviso to Art. 31A, because, under ss. 23A and 24 of the Act, till possession has changed, the management and control do not vest in the Panchayat and acquisition would not be complete. Therefore, it could not be said that the acquisition had already taken place before the Seventeenth Amendment, which introduced the second proviso to Art. 31A(1), came into force, and that the scheme was not hit by that proviso. [146 E-H] Ajit Singh v. State of Punjab [1966] INSC 257; [1967] 2 S.C.R. 143, followed.
 Per Hidayatullah and Shelat, JJ : Since the land of the petitioner was reduced to something below the ceiling fixed by law, compensation at a rate which was not lower than the market value must be paid to him. [147 C-F]
