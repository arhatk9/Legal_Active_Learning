 Godavari Sugar Mills - appellant in Civil Appeal No.
 989 of 1972 - was the owner of a distillery plant consisting of the lands, buildings, machinery etc. It entered into a technical collaboration Agreement and obtained a deferred payment guarantee up to the limit of Rs. 65,00,000 from the Punjab National Bank in favour of M/s. Speichim, Paris under an equitable mortgage by deposit of title deeds of its property including the aforesaid lands and buildings.
 Godavari Sugar Mills resolved to sell the lands, buildings and machinery to Somaiya Organics - appellant in Civil Appeal No.988 of 1972 - for a consideration of Rs.36,64,678 and a sale deed was executed on May 20, 1968. The sale deed recited that out of Rs. 36,64,678 Rs. 28,88,678 represented the price payable for the machinery, vehicles, stores, finished goods etc. being all moveable items, the sale and transfer of which had been completed by the parties to the document by manual delivery and the balance of Rs. 7,76,000 represented the price payable in respect of the lands and buildings as described in Schedule 'A' attached to the said document and that the said document was being executed for the purpose of conveying title in respect of the lands and buildings free of all encumbrances. The document further stated that in case the vendee was to pay any amount on account of any charge or encumbrances created by the vendor on the properties sold, the vendee would be entitled to get back the entire sale consideration with interest from the vendor on October 28, 1968 a declaration was signed by each appellant to the effect that the properties which were being transferred under the document dated May 20, 1968 were being sold subject to the equitable mortgage which had been created in favour of the Punjab National Bank Ltd. in connection with the deferred payment guarantee, after the Board of Directors of the two appellants had 787 passed resolutions to that effect. All the three documents, namely, the sale deed dated May 20, 1968 and the two deeds of declarations executed by the appellants acknowledging that the sale was subject to the equitable mortgage were presented for registration. The document dated May 20, 1968 had been written on a stamp paper of Rs. 35,000 treating that the consideration for the sale deed was Rs. 7,76,000.
 The Sub-Registrar was of the view that the properties had been sold subject to two liabilities, one for Rs.1,20,00,000 and another for Rs.65,00,000 and therefore, the total consideration payable for sale was Rs. 1,92,76,000 that there was deficiency of stamp duty of Rs. 8,32,420 and that each of the two supplementary deeds of declarations which had been written on stamp papers of Rs. 3.50 should have been written on stamp papers of Rs.4.50 and one rupee was payable on each of them as deficient duty. The Sub- Registrar accordingly impounded the sale deed and the deeds of the declarations and forwarded them to the Collector for necessary action.
 The Collector referred the matter to the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority - Board of Revenue, under s.56 (2) of the Indian Stamp Act 1899.
 The Board of Revenue made a reference to the High Court under s 57 of the Act for its opinion.
 The High Court held that the two deeds of declarations were supplementary to the sale deed dated May 20, 1968 and all the three should be read together to ascertain the terms of sale settled between the parties, that the intention of the parties was that the immovable property was being transferred subject to the equitable mortgage created in favour of the Punjab National Bank Ltd. for Rs. 65,00,000 that under s.4 of the Act the duty of Rs. 4.50 was payable as against Rs. 3.50 on the two declarations, that the inclusion of Rs. 1,20,00,000 in the consideration for the sale was incorrect because the property sold was not subject to the payment of that loan; that was a loan facility given by the Punjab National Bank to Somaiya Organics and the property given as security therefor was the property of Somaiya Organics and not the property which was being sold and the sale was also not subject to that debt, that Rs.
 28,88,678 which was the price of the moveables i.e. the machinery etc. was not part of the consideration as they did not constitute the subject matter of sale and they had already been sold by manual delivery, 788 that the sum of Rs. 65,00,000 for which the equitable mortgage had been created on the property transferred under the sale was to be treated as part of the consideration for the conveyance in question under s.24 of the Act, that the value on which stamp duty was payable under the Act as per Article 23 in Schedule I-B thereto was Rs. 72,76,000 being the total of Rs. 7,76,000 mentioned in the deed and Rs.
 65,00,000 being the contingent liability under the equitable mortgage and that appropriate stamp duty should be collected on Rs. 72,76,000 in the case of the document dated May 20, 1968 and Rs. 4.50 as against Rs. 3.50 on each of the two declarations.
 Dismissing the Appeals to this Court, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The High Court has rightly taken the view that the amount of Rs.65,00,000 should also be deemed as part of the consideration for the sale and that stamp duty was leviable on Rs.72,76,000 under s.24 of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899. [804 D] 
 2. The object of s.24 of the Act is very clear. That section means that when a purchaser purchases a property for a certain amount subject to the payment of another debt, actual or contingent, he is virtually purchasing the property for the said amount plus the amount of the debt and the aggregate of the two amounts ought to be treated as the true amount for which the property is being sold. Otherwise, there is bound to be a difference between the true consideration and the consideration which is made liable to stamp duty. [803 D-E] 
 3. A contingent liability to the payment of any debt means such outstanding debt or possible adverse verdict which has to be complied with but which is not ascertained on the relevant date. A security for any contingent future payments also falls within the meaning of section 24 of the Act. [797 E-F] In the instant case, though in the first document dated May 20, 1968 it had been recited that the properties mentioned in Schedule 'A' therein were being conveyed free from all encumbrances by the two deeds of declarations dated October 28, 1968 executed by and on behalf of Godavari Sugar Mills and Somaiya Organics it was made very clear that the properties were being conveyed subject to the equitable mortgage upto the limit of Rs. 65,00,000. It may be that on that date no liability as sch had actually arisen. But the terms of the mortgage were such that there was the contingency of the liability up to Rs.65,00,000 materialising. Pursuant to the prior arrangements 789 entered into between Godavari Sugar Mills and Somaiya Organics a letter was addressed to the Punjab National Bank on December 15, 1964 and on the basis of the letter the title deeds in respect of the property now sold had been handed over to the bank creating an equitable mortgage up to Rs. 65,00,000. But the bank had not actually paid any amount under the Deferred Payment Guarantee to M/s Speichim even by April 29, 1969 as is evident from the letter written by the bank to Godavari Sugar Mills. The mortgage which had been created on December 14, 1964 was alive on the date of the transaction and it was in force even on April 29, 1969 though the mortgagors had been substituted by the purchaser of the property i.e. Somaiya Organics. The Deferred Payment Guarantee being in force even on April 29, 1969 the contingent liability under the equitable mortgage was also very much in existence on the date of sale i.e. May 20, 1968 even though no payment had been made by the Bank to N/s Speichim, Paris. If on any future date the Bank was compelled to pay any amount under the guarantee given by it, such amount upto the limit of Rs 65,00,000 could be realised by the Bank by enforcing the mortgage against the property in question. If that was not the position, there would have been no necessity to execute the two deeds of declaration stating that the properties were being sold subject to the mortgage. Had the document of May 20, 1968 been the only document then questions would have arisen whether the recital therein that the consideration for the properties which were considered sufficient by the bank to secure Rs.
 65,00,000 could truly be Rs.7,76,000 and whether the said recital amounted to a fraud on the stamp law or not. The duty to decide the said questions does not arise in view of the deeds of declaration which treated the sale as one subject to the mortgage the maximum liability under which at a future time could be Rs. 65,00,000. If the sale had been free from mortgage then any such contingent future liability would have fallen on the vendor Godavari Sugar Mills. But the parties to the sale took adequate precaution to prevent any such liability being there by making it very clear that the said liability to the Bank would be on the properties sold in the hands of the purchaser, Somaiya Organics and by stating that under the tripartite agreement which was to be executed, the Bank would treat Somaiya Organics as the company responsible for that debt in the place of Godavari Sugar Mills. The Bank had in fact written to the Godavari Sugar Mills on April 29, 1969 that on November 6, 1968 the name of Somaiya Organics had been substituted for the name of the Godavari Sugar Mills in the Deferred Payment Guarantee.
