 The respondent held various offices under the Government of the erstwhile Rewa State. By an Order made on April 3, 1948;, the Ruler allowed him to, retire on a full pension of Rs. 350/- per month as a special case, and the breaks in his service were also condoned. The State of Rewa was later merged with the State of Vindhya Pradesh and the appropriate authority passed orders reducing the respondent's pension.
 Vindhya Pradesh later became a part of the State of Madhya Pradesh. The respondent moved a petition in the High Court of Madhya Pradesh for a writ of certiorari in which he prayed that the orders reducing his pension be quashed. The High Court decided in his favour whereupon the State of Madhya Pradesh appealed- to this Court.
 The questions that fell for determination in the appeal were whether the Order of the Ruler of Rewa amounted to 'law', and whether, if not 'law', it was a grant which the succeeding Government must be deemed to have accepted since it made payments in terms of it for several years.
 
HELD : (i) From the terms of the Order in question it was clear that the Ruler purported to act under the Rewa State Rules. This would appear from the reference to 'full pension', condonation of the 'breaks in service' and 'special case, in the said order. This would also appear from the fact that the Order granted the respondent certain advance increments which could only have been done to justify the full pension of Rs. 350/- per month under the rules. Obviously under the rules the respondent would have been entitled to a smaller pension in view of the breaks and if the increments had not been granted. The Ruler was not'.
 therefore, acting in exercise of his sovereign power and in disregard of the rules; on the contrary he was purporting to act in terms of the rules. That being so it had to be held that the Order in question was not a law but an executive order passed in terms of the rules. It was open to the succeeding Government to set aside that order by another executive order. [54 G-H; 55 B] (ii) what the Ruler did by his Order of April 3, 1948 does not appear to have been to make a grant but to have passed an Order purporting to act under the Rules. If that Order was not justified by the rules it was liable to be set aside by another order duly made under them. Pension is furthermore normally always a matter of grace. It is implicit in the grant of a pension that it may be subsequently reviewed. The succeeding State was hence competent to review the order even if it had paid the pension for sometime in terms of it. [55 D-F]
