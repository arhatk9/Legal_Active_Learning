 The appellants filed a suit for a declaration that the suit land inherited by them was not "shamlat deh" within the meaning of section 2(g) of the Punjab Village Common Land (Regulation) Act, 1961, because it was excluded by virtue of proviso (iv) to the clause. They contended that the revenue records describing the land as "shamlat deh" also stated it to be "in possession of the owners", showing that it was not used as "shamlat deh", and furthermore, that it had been partly purchased and partly received as gift by their ancestor before 26th January, 1950, and thereby came within the scope of s. 2(g) proviso (iv) of the Act. The appellants failed before the Trial Court, Court of first appeal, and the High Court in second appeal.
 Dismissing the appeal by special leave, the Court, 
 HELD: (1) The fact that in 1914-15 it was recorded in the 'jamabandi' as "shamlat deh", shows that that particular character of the land was recognised even so far back, and it could not detract from that nature of the land merely because it was further stated in the 'jamabandi' that it was in the possession of the owners "as per respective shares in khewat". [863 F-G] (2) Proviso (iv) requires that in order to be excluded from the category of "shamlat deh", the land should have been acquired by purchase or in exchange for proprietary land from a co-sharer in the "shamlat deh", which is not so in the case of the appellants.
