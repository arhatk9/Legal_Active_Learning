 Whatever might be the position under the Preventive Detention Act of 1950 before it was amended in 1951, under the Act as amended in 1951, the Government should determine what the period of detention should be only after the Advi- sory Board to which the case is referred reports that the detention is justified. Fixing of the period of detention in the initial order itself is contrary to the scheme of the Act and cannot be supported. It cannot be treated as a mere surplusage as it would tend to prejudice a fair considera- tion of the detenu's case by the Advisory Board, though he would have to be released forthwith if the Advisory Board reports that there is no sufficient cause for detention.
 Before a person is deprived of his personal liberty the procedure established by law must be strictly followed and must not be departed from to the disadvantage of the person affected.
