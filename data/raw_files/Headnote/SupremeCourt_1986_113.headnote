 The petitioner, who had a brilliant record in service, was reverted on Jan. 4, 1985 from the post of Police Inspector to that of Police Sub-Inspector with the endorsement that such reversion would not disqualify him for being considered for promotion to the post of Police Inspector in future. He made a detailed representation contending that his reversion was wholly unjustified. Since he did not receive any redress of his grievance, he moved the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court by a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution challenging the order of reversion as being violative of Art. 311(2) of the Constitution. The High Court dismissed the petition in limine.
 In appeal to the Supreme Court it was contended: (i) that the reversion of the appellant from the post of Officiating Police-Inspector to that of Police Sub-Inspector was by way of punishment and was thus violative of Art.
 311(2) of the Constitution; and (ii) that the High Court was not justified in dismissing the writ petition in limine.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The impugned order passed by the High Court dismissing the writ petition in limine by the use of a laconic word "rejected" cannot be sustained. It does not inspire public confidence in administration of justice if the High Courts were to reject the writ petitions without due application of mind even though substantial questions were raised in the writ petitions. It was not right on the part of the High Court to have declined to entertain and decide the 1102 question as to whether the impugned order of reversion was liable to be struck down as offending against Art.311(2) of the Constitution. The writ petition did raise an arguable question and it deserved hearing upon merits. [1104 G-H;
 1105 A-B] 
 2.1 In a hierarchical system of Courts which exists in our country, all courts and tribunals including the High Court exercising judicial and quasi-judicial functions owe it a duty to pass reasoned orders. Therefore, while dismissing a writ petition summarily, the High Court must record reasons briefly. A brief statement of reasons would greatly assist the Supreme Court in understanding the High Court's thought process which, in turn facilitates a quick and satisfactory disposal of Special Leave Petitions. [1105 B-C; E-G] 
 2.2 The High Courts should understand this Court's difficulty in unravelling the reasons for summary dismissal in the absence of a brief statement of reasons. It would considerably lighten the task of Supreme Court if the High Courts while dismissing a writ petition were to indicate in a few words the contention(s) urged and their views that the contentions cannot prevail. [1105 G; D] In the instant case, the Court directed the High Court to admit the writ petition to its file and dispose it of in accordance with law. [1106 A-B]
