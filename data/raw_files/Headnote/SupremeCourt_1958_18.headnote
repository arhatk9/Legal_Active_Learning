 The accused thrust a spear into the abdomen of ,he deceased.
 This injury caused his death. In the opinion of the doctor the injury was sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. It was found by the Sessions judge that the accused intended to cause grievous hurt only. In his opinion however the third clause Of S. 300 Indian Penal Code applied. He accordingly convicted and sentenced the accused under S. 302 India, Penal Code. The High Court upheld the conviction, It was argued that the third clause Of s. 300 Indian Penal Code did not apply as it was not proved that the accused intended to inflict a 1496 bodily injury that was sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature as s. 300 Indian Penal Code third clause states, " If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death Held, that the prosecution must prove the following before it can bring a case under s. 300 Indian Penal Code third clause.
 (1) It must establish, quite objectively, that a bodily injury is present.
 (2) The nature of the injury must be proved; these are purely objective investigations.
 (3) It must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that particular injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or unintentional, or that some other kind of injury was intended.
 (4) It must be proved that the injury of the type just described made up of the three elements set out above was sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature.
 This part of the enquiry is purely objective and inferential and has nothing to do with the intention of the offender.
 The third clause of S. 300 Indian Penal Code consists of two parts. Under the first part it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict the injury that is found to be present and under the second part it must be proved that the injury was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. The words " and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted " are merely descriptive. All this means is, that it is not enough to prove that the injury found to be present is sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature ; it must in addition be shown that the injury found to be present was the injury intended to be inflicted.
 Whether it was sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature is a matter of inference or deduction from the proved facts about the nature of the injury and has nothing to do with the question of intention.
