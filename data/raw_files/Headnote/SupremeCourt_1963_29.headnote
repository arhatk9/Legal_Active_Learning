 The respondent, wife of the appellant, filed an execution petition for execution of a maintenance decree obtained by her which, in addition to the personal liability, created a charge for past and future maintenance on three lots of properties. After Obtaining the permission of the Court she purchased two items of the properties subject to her maintenance charge. Later she 921 filed another execution petition seeking to bring to sale properties other than those purchased by her in the earlier execution. The appellant made an application under s. 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure to record full satisfaction of the decree on the ground that by purchasing the properties subject to her charge she could not maintain a fresh application for the sale of the other properties. The Subordinate,judge dismissed the execution petition as not maintainable. On appeal by the respondent the High Court reversed the decision of the Subordinate judge and ordered the execution to proceed. On appeal by special leave, this court held :
 Held, that an executory charge-decree for maintenance becomes executable again and again as future sums become due. The executability of the decree keeps the charge alive on the remaining properties originally charged till the future amounts cease. The whole of the charge continues over all the properties jointly and severally and as the charge is different from a mortgage, it is not permissible to seek an analogy from the case of a mortgage.
 Held, further, that between the appellant and the respon- dent the executing court cannot order the respondent to proceed against properties in her possession even though it can make an election on behalf of the appellant and enforce the charge against one item in preference to another belonging to him; but the appellant cannot insist that the respondent should proceed against the properties acquired by her under the first sale.
