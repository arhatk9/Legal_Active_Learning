 Code of Civil Procedure prior to its amendment by Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act 1976, by sub-rules (1) and (3) of Rule 72, Order 21 laid down that no holder of a decree in execution of which property is sold shall, without the express permission of the Court, bid for or purchase the property and that where a decree-holder pruchases, by himself or through another person, without such permission, the court may, if it thinks fit, on the application of the judgment-debtor or any other person whose interests are affected by the sale, by order set aside the sale. In the State of Uttar Pradesh, the High Court of Allahabad, by an amendment made to the aforesaid Rule, deleted sub-rules (1) and (3). The result was that in the case of a decree-holder the need for obtaining the express permission of the executing court before offering the bid for or purchasing the property put up for sale under sub-rule (1) was not there and the power of the court to set aside the sale under sub-rule (3) of Rule 72 in the absence of such permission had also been taken away.
 By the Amending Act, 1976 several amendments were carried out to the Code on the basis of the recommendations of the Indian Law Commission in its 54th Report in 1973.
 Since there were in force in different parts of India several amendments to the code which had been effected by the State Legislatures or by the High Courts, the Law Commission recommended that a new Rule 72-A may be added to Order 21 in which there was reference to sub-rules (2) and (3) of Rule 72 16 in sub-rule (3) of Rule 72-A. Hence, even though Rule 72 was not amended by the Amending Act, its retention in the form in which it was in the code had been recommended by the Law Commission. Section 97(1) of the Amending Act provides that "any amendment made, or any provision inserted in the principal Act by a State Legislature or a High Court before the commencement of this Act shall, except in so far as such amendment or provision is consistent with the provisions of the principal Act as amended by this Act, stand repealed." Respondent No.3 obtained a decree for recovery of money on July 29, 1977 against the appellant. In execution of the said decree, the immoveable property belonging to the appellant was brought to sale by court on August 4, 1978 and at that court sale respondent No.3 was declared as the successful bidder. Before the sale was confirmed, the appellant filed an application for setting aside the sale on the ground that the decree holder had not obtained prior permission of the executing court under Rule 72(1) of Order 21 of the Code. The executing court set aside the sale, since admittedly no such permission had been obtained by the decree-holder.
 The District Judge affirmed the aforesaid order in a revision petition filed by respondent No.3 - Decree-holder on the ground that on the commencement of the Amending Act by virtue of section 97(1) thereof the local amendment made to Rule 72 of Order 21 of the Code prior to that date ceased to operate and the Code as amended by the Amending Act applied to the case. Aggrieved by the decision of the District Judge, respondent No.3 filed a petition under Art.226 before the High Court of Allahabad. The High Court allowed the Writ Petition holding that since the amending Act had not made amendment of any kind in so far as Rule 72 of Order 21 was concerned, the amendment made by the High Court of Allahabad to Rule 72 of Order 21 of the Code prior to the commencement of the Amending Act remained intact.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The High Court was in error in holding that the amended Rule 72 of Order 21 which was in force in the State of Uttar Pradesh prior to February 1, 1977 continued to be in force after that date and that the court sale held in which the decree-holder had purchased the property without the express permission of the executing court was unassailable under sub-rule (3) of Rule 72. Therefore, the order passed by the High Court is set aside and the order passed by the 17 District Judge affirming the order of the executing court is restored. [24 C; 24 F] 
 2.1 The object of section 97 of the Amending Act appears to be that on and after February 1, 1977 throughout India wherever the Code was in force, there should be same procedural law in operation in all the Civil Courts subject, of course, to any future local amendment that may be made either by the State Legislature or by the High Court, as the case may be, in accordance with law. Until such amendment is made the code as amended by the Amending Act alone should govern the procedure in civil courts which are governed by the Code. [19 F-G] 
 2.2 The effect of section 97(1) is that all local amendments made to any of the provisions of the Code either by a State Legislature or by a High Court which were inconsistent with the Code as amended by the Amending Act stood repealed irrespective of the fact whether the corresponding provision in the Code had been amended or modified by the Amending Act and that was subject only to what was found in sub-section (2) of section 97. Moreover, sub-section (3) of section 97 sets at rest doubts, if any, by making the Code as amended by the Amending Act applicable to all proceedings referred to therein subject to sub- section (2) of section 97.
