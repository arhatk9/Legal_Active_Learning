 One M brought a suit in the Munsif's Court against a number of persons including the appellants for a declaration that certain land constituted the bakshat interest of the plaintiff, who had been and continued to be in possession and occupation thereof. In the alternative he prayed for possession if the plaintiff be deemed to have been dispossessed for a proceedings under s. 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure had cast a doubt on his title. This suit followed the proceedings under s. 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which resulted in a decision against the plaintiff. The defendants did not deny the title of the plaintiff but asserted that the plaintiff gave these lands to the defendants to cultivate them on batai over more than 25 years ago, and since then the defendants had been and were in peaceful cultivating possession over the same and had also acquired occupancy rights in them. The Munsif dismissed the suit upholding the pleas of defendants. The plaintiff appealed and succeed before the Appellate Court, which was of the view that the onus was on the defendants to prove that they were rayats of the land and that they had occupancy rights in these lands and that the defendants had not been able to prove their case about settlement and possession. The High Court, on appeal by the defendants, held that having regard to the facts and circumstances of this particular case, the burden was on the defendants to show whether they have been in possession for 12 years or more, and dismissed the appeal. On appeal by special leave, 
HELD : On the facts of the case Art. 144 and not Art. 142 applied.
 If a defendant not only admits title of the plaintiff but also admits that he derived possession from the plaintiff- as a tenant, the case must proceed on the defendant's plea, and for the purpose of deciding whether Art. 142 or Art. 144 applied, it must be assumed that the plaintiff has not been dispossessed or has not discontinued his possession within the meaning of Art. 142, for neither the plaintiff nor the defendant alleges decision or discontinuation of ion.
