 In conciliation proceedings before the Conciliation Officer, D.C.M. (City Shop) Karamchari Union espoused workman Shibban Lal's cause. On June 18, 1965 the Conciliation Officer submitted his failure report to the Government. On June 9, 1965 a settlement had been arrived at between the Union and the management of the D.C. & G. Mills Ltd. The Conciliation Officer was not informed of this settlement before the sub- mission of his report. The settlement dated June 9, 1965 was filed before the Conciliation Officer on June 30, 1965.
 Pursuant to the Conciliation Officer's report the industrial dispute was referred by the Government to the Additional Industrial Tribunal. On October 6, 1965 written statement was filed by the management before the Tribunal. The Kapra Karamchari Sangh also filed a statement of claim on behalf of workman Shibban Lal through its General Secretary along with an application for substituting the Sangh in place of the Union. It was stated in the application that since the Union had entered into a settlement with the management not to contest Shibban Lal's case, 53 out of 88 workers of D.C.M. (City Shop) had requested the Sangh to take up this worker's case and the Sangh had thereupon unanimously decided to take up his cause. The management opposed this application. It was finally decided that the Sangh should represent Shibban Lal workman without its being substituted for the Union. The management then pressed its objection to the validity of the settlement of claim filed by the Sangh.
 The Tribunal held that the claim filed by the Sangh should be deemed to have been filed on behalf of Shibban Lal. On appeal in this Court the correctness of this view was not challenged on behalf of the respondent. The special leave application in this Court was supported by an affidavit sworn by Shibban Lal.
 On a preliminary objection raised on behalf of the respondent to the competency of the appeal presented in this Court by the Sangh on the ground that the Sangh was neither a party to the industrial dispute before the Tribunal nor did it espouse Shibban Lal's cause in the proceedings against him.
 
HELD : (1) On the facts and circumstances of this case the special leave application and the appeal must be held to have been filed in this Court by the Sangh as representing Shibban Lal who had agreed to be represented by the Sangh.
 The appeal filed by the Sangh, therefore, cannot be considered to be unauthorised and legally incompetent on the ground urged. [891 G-H] (2) Rule 58 (4) of the Industrial Disputes (Central) Rules, 1957 made under s. 38 of the Industrial Disputes Act has full force of law of 887 which judicial notice can be taken. This rule must be fully complied with if the settlement is to have a binding effect on all workmen. [896 A] (3) When a dispute is referred to the Conciliation Officer the management and the workers' Union cannot claim absolute freedom of contract to arrive at a settlement in all respects binding on all workmen. An agreement to be valid and binding must comply with the provisions of the Statute and the Rules made thereunder. The settlement in the present case did not comply with r. 58(4) which is mandatory. Therefore, under s. 18(1) of the Act read with the other sub-sections in the light of the definition of "Settlement" contained in s. 2(p) there is no unfettered freedom in the management and the Union to settle the dispute as they please so as to clothe the settlement with a binding effect on all workmen or even on all member-workmen of the Union. [895 B-D] (4) Though the plea of non-compliance with r. 58(4) was not raised by the appellant before the Tribunal if the respondent wanted to show that the reference was invalid because of a lawful settlement then it was incumbent on the party relying on such a settlement to prove that it was lawful and valid, rendering the reference illegal. It was also incumbent on the Tribunal to satisfy itself that the settlement was in accordance with the Act and Statutory Rules. [896 A-B] [The case was accordingly remanded to the Tribunal for adjudication upon the dispute on the merits.]
