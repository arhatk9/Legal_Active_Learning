 The retirement age of teachers in the service of the Andhra Pradesh Government, Zilla Parishads, Panchayat Samitis and Municipalities was fixed at 55 years till 1964 when Government raised the age of superannuation to 58 years. In 1966 the age was raised to 60 years, but, on November 3, 1967, Government issued a G.O. cancelling with effect from November 30, 1967, the two earlier G.0s. extending the age of retirement; and corresponding changes were made in the rules relating to teachers in the service of Zilla Parishads, Panchayat Samitis and Municipalities.
 Some teachers challenged the G.O. dated November 3, 1967 and the 'High Court, holding that the teachers whose term had already been extended had a vested right to continue, directed the State Government not to give effect to the G.
 O. and the consequential rules as against such teachers. In pursuance of the judgment of the High Court Government issued a memorandum dated November 8, 1968, giving effect to the directions of the High Court and also providing that teachers who had attained the age of 55 years after November 30, 1967, should be dealt with under the G.O. dated 3rd November, 1967, and should be retired on attaining the age of 55 years.
 The petitioners challenged the memorandum on the ground that by not extending the benefit of the judgment of the High Court to them, land by fixing November 30, 1967, as the date for determining who should retire, Government acted arbitrarily and violated the equality rule embodied in Arts.
 14 and 16 of the Constitution.
 
HELD:(1) It was open to the Government to reduce the age of retirement without exposing such reduction to any constitutional infirmity. Fixing November 30, 1967, as the date for the classification of teachers who should retire at the age of 55 years could not be considered irrational or unreasonable. The object of raising the retirement age was to solve the problem of the dearth of qualified teachers because of the opening of new schools and the need for maximum utilisation of trained intelligensia. As soon as the dearth of qualified teachers disappeared Government restored the retiring age to 55 years. [748F, 750C] (2)If the Government order dated November 3, 1967, was valid then ,the petitioners had to retire at the age of 55 years notwithstanding the fact that after their initial employment the retirement age was raised first to 58 years and then to 60 years, because, those intermediary orders had been cancelled by the G.O. dated November 3, 1967, before the earlier ,Government orders became operative by actually retaining in service the present petitioners after their superannuation tinder the earlier rule. The 742 other employees were given benefit pursuant to the order of the High Court which had since become final.; Merely because by some subsequent orders the extended date of retirement was accepted in respect of those employees it would not entitle, by itself, the present petitioners to claim similar extension of age of retirement The directions given by the High. Court provide a valid differentia and the petitioners could not claim to be equated with those employees who had been given such benefit. [748G749C] (3)It could not be said that the Government having accepted the judgment of the High Court, the earlier orders increasing the age of compulsory retirement must automatically be held to be revived. The Government only gave the benefit of the decision of the High Court to those employees whose cases were covered by the principle laid down by the High, Court. [749H; 750B] (4)Fundamental rule 56(a) does not govern the teachers employed, by the Municipalities, Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis. [751A] (5)The submission that the rules applicable to the teachers employed' by such bodies were intended to be in conformity with the fundamental rule is of no avail to the petitioners because those rules could not be considered to have been automatically modified as a result of an)( amendment in the fundamental rule 56(a), when there is no consequent modification of the rules governing teachers employed in such bodies.
