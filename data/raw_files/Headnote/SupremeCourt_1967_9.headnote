 The appellant joined the service of the respondent company as Shift Supervisor and was given training in the manufacture of tyre cord yarn. The contract was for five years and it was stipulated that during the said period the appellant would not work in similar capacity in any other concern and would maintain secrecy as to the technical aspects of his work. However, shortly after completing his training the appellant joined a rival concern at higher emoluments. The respondent company thereupon filed a suit for an injunction against the appellant restraining him from working elsewhere as a shift Supervisor in the manufacture of tyre cord yarn or in similar capacity and from divulging the trade secrets of the respondent company. The injunction was granted. His appeal before the High Court having failed, the appellant came to this Court under Art. 136 of the Constitution. It was contended on his behalf that the covenant was against public policy within the meaning of s.
 27 of the Indian Contract Act, that it was unreasonable, and that it was unnecessary for Safeguarding the trade interest of the company.
 HELD: The appeal must fail.
 (i) Negative covenants operative during the period of employment when the employee is bound to serve his employer exclusively are not to be regarded as restraint of trade and therefore do not fall under s. 27 of the Contract Act. A negative covenant that the employee would not engage himself in trade or business or would not get himself employed by any other master for whom he would perform similar or substantially similar duties is not a restraint of trade unless the contract as aforesaid is unconscionable or excessively harsh or unreasonable or one-sided [389 F] Caselaw considered.
 In the present case the injunction issued against the appellant was restricted as to time, the nature of the employment and as to area and could not therefore be said to be too wide or unreasonable or unnecessary for the protection of the interests of the respondent company. [389 G-H] (ii) There is nothing to prevent a court from granting a limited injunction to the extent that is necessary to protect the employers's interests where the negative stipulation is not void. The rule against severance applies only to cases where the covenant is bad in law, and it is only in such cases that the court is precluded from severing the good from the bad [390 D]
