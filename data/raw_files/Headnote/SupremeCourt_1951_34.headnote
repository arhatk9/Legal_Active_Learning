 The context in which the provision for acceptance of rent finds a place in s. 116 of the Transfer of Property Act shows that what is contemplated is that the payment of rent should be made at such time and in such manner as to be equivalent to the landlord assenting to the lessee continu- ing in possession. Where payment is made at a time when there was no question of the lessor assenting to the les- see's continuing in possession and neither party treated the payment as importing such assent the case does not fall within s. 116.
 A lease deed was executed on the 17th February, 1928, in respect of a land for a period of ten years from 24th Febru- ary, 1928, the annual rent of Rs. 6,000 being payable in advance every year. In April, 1937, a cheque for Rs. 6,000, being the rent from 1st April, 1937, to 31st March, 1938, was sent by the lessee and accepted by the lessor: Held, that as the rent was paid before the expiry of the lease and neither party treated the payment of rent as importing assent on the part of the lessor to allow the lessee 561 to continue in possession as a lessee after the period of the lease, no new tenancy was created under s. 116 of the Transfer of Property Act. The utmost that could be said was that by implied consent the period of the lease was extended up to the 31st March, 1938, and even then no notice under s.
 106 of the Transfer of Property Act was necessary for termi- nating the lease.
