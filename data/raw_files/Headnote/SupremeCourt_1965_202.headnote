 Under s. 3 of the Madras Plantations Agricultural Income-tax Act, 1955 (as extended to Kerala State) income-tax was to be assessed in each financial year on the income of an assessee during the previous Year. The first assessment under the Act could be for 1955-56 so, that income of any period before April 1, 1954 could not be taxed under the Act. The respondent company was assessed for the years 1955-56 and 1956-57 on its income of the relevant previous years. The company objected to the inclusion in its income for these years of certain sums on the ground that they represented income of the period before April 1, 1954 to which the Act did not apply. The controversy was in respect of certain sales -of coffee which, according to the company, took place in its accounting years ending March 31, 1953 and March 31, 1954. The sales were to the Coffee Board under s. 25 of the Coffee Act and as the company maintained its accounts on the mercantile system the price was also entered in the accounts at the time of the sale itself although it was received later i.e. in the previous years relevant to the assessment years 1955-56 and 1956-57. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner of Agricultural In-come-tax and the Appellate Tribunal held that the income arose when the price was received and thus upheld the inclusion of the income from the aforesaid sales in the assessment for 1955-56 and 1956- 
57. The company filed writ petitions in the High Court challenging the said assessments. A single judge decided in favour of the company and so did the Division Bench. The State of Kerala appealed by special leave to this Court.
 
HELD : All Coffee which the Coffee Board obtains under the Coffee Act is put in a pool and gets mixed up with other coffee. Coffee in the Pool is disposed of on behalf of the Coffee Board which pays only a proportionate price to the planter. -Even though the planter does not actually sell coffee to the Coffee Board there is in reality a sale by operation of law as a result of which the planter ceases to be the owner of coffee the moment he has handed over his produce to the Coffee Board, The fact that the price is received later does not make it any the less a sale. [99 H;
 1100 A-B] The system of accounting must make a difference as to the time when the income arises. If it were a cash system income would be taxable when actually received but in the mercantile system it would be taxable in the year in which the relevant entry is made about the sale of the coffee to the Coffee Board. [100 C] 93 The appellant company maintained its accounts on the mercantile system. When it handed-over coffee to the Coffee Board it entered the price of coffee according to the valuation of the Coffee Board in its books of. account although it did not receive payment immediately. The payment for coffee handed over before April 1. 1954 was received after that date. No doubt actual payment was received in the previous years relevant to the assessment years 1955-56 and 1956-57 but coffee was handed over to the Coffee Board in the earlier years for which no, tax could be demanded. The High Court therefore rightly held that the income in question was not taxable in the said assessment years. [99 F-G; 101 A] Puthuthototam Estates (1943) Ltd. v.
