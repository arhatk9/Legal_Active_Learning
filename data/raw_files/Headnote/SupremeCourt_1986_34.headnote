 The appellant who is a student of some academic distinction and ability sought admission to the Ist year of MBBS Course under the special category being a son of a freedom fighter or political sufferer within the meaning of clause (iii) of Rule 4 of the Karnataka Medical Colleges (Selection of Candidates for Admission), Rules 1984 who had participated in 1942 Movement and was imprisoned from 10th of September, 1942 to 2nd of October, 1942. Since he was not granted admission under that category, he filed a writ petition before the Karnataka High Court contending that sub-clause (a) of clause (iii) of Rule 4 of the 1984 Rules should be read independently as well as sub-clause (b) not only of each other but also what follows by way of proviso though not so mentioned. Both the Writ Petition and a further appeal to the Division Bench were dismissed.
 However, the High Court granted a certificate under Article 133(1)(b) of the Constitution.
 Dismissing the appeal, the Court, ^ 
 HELD : 1. Under Rule 5A of Order XV of the Supreme Court Rules, 1966 when a party to whom a certificate of fitness to appeal has been granted by the High Court, the Supreme Court 693 may, either dismiss it summarily or direct issue of notice to all necessary parties or may make such orders as the circumstances of the case may require. In this case the question involved is a simple one and the intention and the purpose of Rule 4 of the Karnataka Medical Colleges (Selection of Candidates for Admission) Rules 1984 is manifest and in the language there is no difficulty. The certificate under Article 133(i)(b) of the Constitution to the effect that in the opinion of the Karnataka High Court the question involved needs to be decided by the Supreme Court is unwarranted.

 2.1 A statute cannot be construed merely with reference to grammer. Statute, whenever the language permits, must be construed reasonably and rationally to give effect to the intention and purpose of the legislature. The expression "and" in clause (iii) of Rule 4 has generally cumulative effect requiring the fulfilment of all the conditions that it joins together and it is the antithesis of "or". The expression "and" in the instant case, cannot be read disjunctively. [696 C-D] A.K. Gopalan v. The State of Madras, [1950] INSC 14; [1950] S.C.R. 88 at 126; and Ishwar Singh Bindra & Ors. v. The State of U.P., [1968] INSC 140; [1969] 1 S.C.R. 219 applied.
 
 2.2 It is not possible to hold that sub-clause (a) should be read independently of sub-clause (b). If the expression "and" in clause (a) is read independently then there was no need for him to suffer at all and mere participation would be enough to make him a political sufferer. If it were to be held so it would defeat the rationale the Rule 4 defining a political sufferer or freedom fighter in the Rules. [695 G-H; 696 C]
