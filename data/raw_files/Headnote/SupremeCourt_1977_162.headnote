 Section 66 of the Punjab Municipal Act, 1911 (which is the Act in force in the New Delhi Municipal Area) prescribing the procedure for revision of the valuation and assessment of property provides that "subject to such amendments as may thereafter be duly made the tax so assessed shall be deemed to be the tax for the year commencing on the first day of January or first day of April next ensuing as the Committee may determine." Section 67(1) provides that the Committee may 'at any time' amend the list by altering the assessment on any property which has been erroneously valued or assessed through fraud. accident or mistake whether on the part of the Committee or of the assessee, after following the procedure prescribed therein. Section 68A which deals with power to amend an assessment list in certain cases provides that where the prescribed authority is satisfied that any property has been erroneously valued or assessed through fraud, accident or mistake, whether on the part of the committee or of the assessee, it may pass an order amending the assessment already made and fixing the amount of tax payable for that property and on the issue of such an order the assessment list then in force shall be deemed to have been amended accordingly with effect from first day of January or first day, of April or first day of July or first day of October next following the month in which the order is passed.
 In January, 1968 the appellant Municipal Committee issued a notice to the respondent stating that it had decided to amend the lists of assessment for five years (1963-64, 1964- 65, 1965-66, 1966-67, 1967-68) on the ground that the rent of a portion of the basement of the building had escaped inclusion in the respective lists.
 The respondent's writ petition was allowed by the High Court holding that the assessment lists together with the amendments, if any, could only operate prospectively in and for the financial year next following and not for any previous year.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : The Full Bench of the High Court was wrong in its conclusion that the expression 'at any time' in s. 67 has reference only to the point of time when the list could be amended. [286H] 1(a) That the amended list operates prospectively is correct because the amendment is made to the original list and that list has prospective operation. Each assessment list is effective for the ensuing year, so that the list settled before 31st of March operates for the year commencing with the ensuing 1st of April and ending with the 31st of March following, But the list in force for such an ensuring year can under s. 67 be amended at any time with the result that when a list which was finalised say on March 25, 1970 is amended in August 1973, the amendment becomes effective for the year for which the list itself was effective, that is to say, for the year April 1, 1970 to March 31, 1971. The words "next ensuing" which occur in s. 66 cannot be correlated to the date of the amendment so as to mean "the year next ensuing after the year in which the amendment is made". This reasoning overlooks the true purpose and purport of the Committee's power to amend a list at any time and robs that power of its meaningful content. [286E-G] (b)'The Committee's power to amend an assessment-list is not limited by the consideration that the list has already become final by authentication. It 280 has the power to amend a list even after it is finalised and has already come into force. That is the important effect and implication of the expression 'at any time.' [284A-B] (c)It may be true to say that the power ought to be exercised within a reasonable time since the use of expression of a wide amplitude like 'at any time' does not exclude the concept of reasonableness. Subject to that consideration, the power of amendment can be exercised even after the expiry of the year for which the list is to remain in force. [284D] 2(a) The reason why the Legislature, by s. 67, has conferred on the Municipal Committee the power to amend an assessment list at any time is that the omission, by reason of which a property has escaped assessment, may be discovered a long time after the list had ceased to be operative. The larger interest of the general public requires in such cases that the Municipal Committee must have the power to do what ought to have been done but which, for some reason or the other, had remained to be done. (284-G] In the instant case, a part of the basement was alleged to have escaped assessment and if that be true, the assessee could not in face of s. 67, raise a contention that the assessment lists of past years, though faulty, could not be corrected.
 (b)The expression 'at any time' must be given its full force and effect which requires the recognition of. the Committee's power to amend the assessment list even after the expiry of the year following the one in which the list was finalised by due authentication. [285B] 3.Sections 66 and 67 have to be read as two integral parts of a scheme which the legislature has prescribed for preparation, assessment and amendment of assessment lists.
 The scheme contemplated by s. 66 is subject to an important condition mentioned in the section itself, namely, that the tax assessed under an authenticated list becomes the tax for the particular period, "subject to such amendments as may thereafter be duty made." The word "thereafter" means "after the list is finalised on the completion of revision of valuation and assessment", and "duly made" evidently refers to the exercise of the amending power under s. 67. Thus, the two sections, read together, yield the result that tile list ran be amended at any time after its finalisation, subject to the prescription of reasonableness. [285D-E] Therefore, if the Committee discovered, say in July 1970, that a property had escaped assessment since April 1, 1967 it possesses, under s. 67, the power to make an appropriate amendment. If everyone of the lists which was in force during the relevant year erroneously omitted to include therein a certain property, the amendment made in July 1970, will cure each of the lists from the defect from which it suffered. [285F] 4.A comparison of the provisions of s. 68A with those of s.
 67 shows that the words of limitation contained in the former section as regards the time from which an amendment can come into force are conspicuously absent is. the latter.
 Since the purpose of s. 67 'is to bring to assessment properties which have altogether escaped assessment the legislature evidently thought that amendments made under it should have a wider operation as contrasted with those made under s. 68A. [286D] Punjab National Bank v. New Delhi Municipal Committee, [1973] 3, S.' C.R. 189, 193 and Municipal Corporation of City of Hubli v. Subha Rao Hanumanatha Rao Prayag and Others. [1976] INSC 76; [1976] 3 S.C.R. 883 held inapplicable.
