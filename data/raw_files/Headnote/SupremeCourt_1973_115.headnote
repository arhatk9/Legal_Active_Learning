 By an award dated, September 26, 1958 in I.D. No. 20 of 1957 the respondent workmen received certain benefits apart from the fixing of basic wages for different categories. On March 8, 1968 the workmen submitted a charter of demands relating to categorization and scales of pay and dearness allowance respectively. Later the Union passed a resolution and intimated the management that the workmen will be on strike from April 15, 1968. They actually were on strike from April 15 to 20. 1968. Conciliation proceedings were attempted but failed. The State Government passed an order on July 25, 1968 referring the dispute for adjudication.
 The dispute was dealt with by the Tribunal in I.D. No. 43 of 1968., The appellant company raised a preliminary objection before the Tribunal that as the previous award in I.D. 'No.
 20 of 1968 had not beer. terminated the present reference by the State Government on July 25. 1968, was incompetent. The Tribunal upheld the objection. A Single Judge of the High Court dismissed a writ petition filed by the workmen against the order of the Tribunal. The Division Bench however held that the earlier award had been terminated and the second reference was competent. in coming to this conclusion the Division Bench took into account the following circumstances namely, (a) that the workmen had raised demands which were inconsistent with the earlier award. (b) that the workmen had gone on strike and (c) that the management had participated in the conciliation proceedings.
 Allowing the appeal by the company, 
HELD : Though there is no particular form in which the notice of termination has to be given, still it is absolutely essential that the intention to terminate the award, with reference to a particular date, must be made clear by the parties, who set up a case of termination.
 In the instant case the charter of demands did not give any indication that the previous award had been terminated.
 Even assuming that by the charter of demands on March 8, 1968, the award was terminated, nevertheless, it *HI continue to be in force for a further period of two months from the dale under section 19(6). The fact that the workmen went on strike from April 15, 1968, even before the expiry of this two months period. was an indication that they were dissatisfied with the refusal by the management to accede to their demands. If really they had terminated the award on March 6, 1968, it was unreasonable to hold that the workmen would have gone on an illegal strike before the expiry of two months from the said date. [251E] The fact that the appellant participated in the conciliation proceedings held by the Conciliation Officer. which was also on a subsequent date, was also of so importance. When a strike is on it, is obligatory on the part of the Conciliation Officer to initiate conciliation proceedings and the management had acted property in participating in the conciliation proceedings.
