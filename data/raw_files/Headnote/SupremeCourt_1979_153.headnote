 In the competitive examination for recruitment to Punjab State Judicial Service, conducted in 1950 by the undivided State of Punjab, the petitioner and respondent no.
 3 were placed at s. nos. 4 and 13 in the merit list. On August 7, 1950 the petitioner was appointed as a Sub-Judge against a permanent post while the respondent was appointed as Sub-Judge against a temporary post on November 23. 1950.
 Till the formation of the State of Delhi, judicial officers of Punjab were posted as judicial officers in Delhi. Both the petitioner and the respondent were posted as Sub-Judges in Delhi. Consequent upon the division of the State of Punjab into Punjab and Haryana the petitioner was allotted to Haryana while the respondent was retained in Punjab. But even thereafter they continued as Senior Sub- Judges in Delhi. The Chief Justice of Punjab and Haryana High Court and the Chief Justice of the newly formed Delhi High Court decided that in the judicial service to be constituted for Delhi the petitioner would rank senior to the respondent (the petitioner being placed at the fourth place and the respondent at sixth place in the list of seniority). In May, 1967 the petitioner was appointed as Assistant Sessions Judge, Delhi; the respondent was appointed as Assistant Sessions Judge, Delhi in February, 1968. In the meantime the respondent was given a proforma promotion in the State of Punjab with effect from June 24, 1967 and giving the benefit of "next below rule" the petitioner was promoted as Additional District and Sessions Judge with effect from July 28, 1967. The petitioner was confirmed as District and Sessions Judge in his parent cadre on October 2, 1970, while the respondent was appointed as Additional District and Sessions Judge at Delhi on June 5, 1968 and continued in that post till May, 1971.
 When the Delhi Higher Judicial Service was formed in 1970 the petitioner was placed at s. no. 7 and the respondent at s. no. 8 in the list of judicial officers.
 The respondent's representation claiming seniority over the petitioner was accepted by the Delhi High Court on the ground that in view of Rule 6(3) of the Delhi Higher Judicial Service Rules 1970 as interpreted by this Court in G. R. Luthra v. Lt. Governor, Delhi (AIR 1974 SC 1908) the respondent was senior to the petitioner.
 In a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution the petitioner impugned the order of the Lt. Governor passed on the recommendation of the High Court treating him to be junior to respondent no. 3.
 314 Allowing the petition, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The petitioner was senior to the respondent and was rightly placed above the respondent in the initial constitution of the Delhi Higher Judicial Service in May 1971 and the order of the Lt. Governor was, therefore, erroneous. [322 D-E] 
 2. Rule 6(3) of the Rules provides that the seniority of candidates appointed at the initial constitution shall be in accordance with the length of service rendered by them in the cadres to which they belonged at the time of their initial recruitment to the service provided that the inter se seniority as already fixed in such cadres shall not be altered. The petitioner was throughout treated as senior to the respondent and even in the initial recruitment to the Delhi Higher Judicial Service he was shown as senior to the respondent. Since the inter se seniority had been fixed initially the petitioner was senior to the respondent and this position cannot be altered. [320 B-C] 
 3. Although the respondent was promoted to a higher post before the petitioner was promoted in the respective parent State cadres, since the appointment of the petitioner was made subject to the next below rule, his seniority over the respondent was fully protected. If the respondent was to be given seniority over the petitioner the question of giving benefit of the next below rule to the petitioner would not have arisen. Therefore, merely because the respondent got a proforma promotion and was temporarily promoted six months before the petitioner would not make him senior to the petitioner. [317 E-G] 
 4. Even r. 6(1) (a) envisages that for initial recruitment to the service appointments were to be made from District Judges and Additional District Judges functioning as such in the Union Territory of Delhi on deputation from other States. On the date of formation of the service the respondent was not functioning either as District Judge or as Additional District Judge but was on deputation with the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. [322 A-B] 
 5. The case of G. R. Luthra v. Lt. Governor Delhi, was clearly distinguishable in that the respondent was not a party to that case and his case did not fall for consideration by the Court. It was laid down in that case that length of service rendered by a candidate during the period when he was rendering service either as District Judge or Additional District Judge against a permanent or a temporary post was the criterion for the determination of seniority under the Rules. [320 G] In the instant case although the petitioner and respondent were drawn from different sources and from different States at the time of the initial formation of the cadre the former was shown above the respondent and, therefore, the respondent could not claim seniority over the petitioner. [321 E] G. R. Luthra, Additional District Judge, Delhi v. Lt.
 Governor, Delhi & Ors., [1974] INSC 165; AIR 1974 SC 1908 distinguished.
