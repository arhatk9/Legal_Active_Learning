 The appellant-plaintiff firm had filed a suit through one of its partners, for recovery of Rs. 68,000/- due under a promissory note. After the written statement had been duly filed, an amendment of the plaint was applied for, on the ground that the plaintiff had inadvertently omitted to mention the essential fact that the firm had actually been dissolved before the institution of the suit. The Trial Court, and the High Court, in revision, refused to allow the amendment on the ground that it would amount to the introduction of a new time barred cause of action.
 Allowing the appeal the Court, 
HELD : In a suit instituted by one of the partners of a dissolved firm, the mere specification of the capacity in which the suit was filed could not change the character of the suit or the case. Even where an essential fact is lacking from averments in the plaint, the cause of action will be defective but this does not, by itself, necessarily constitute a new cause of action if the plaint is amended.
 [619] F, 618 A] However negligent or careless may have been the first omission, and however late the proposed amendment, the amendment may be allowed if it can be made without injustice to the other side subject to conditions such as payment of costs.

 Procedural law is intended to facilitate and not to obstruct the course of substantive justice. Provisions relating to pleadings in civil cases are meant to give to each side intimation of the case of the other so that it may be met, to enable Courts to determine what is really at issue between the parties, and to prevent deviation from the course which litigation on particular causes Must take.
