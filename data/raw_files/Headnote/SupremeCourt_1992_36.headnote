 The Government of India, during the 5th and 6th Five Year Plans, formulated various schemes, such as "food for work", "National Rural Employment Programme", "Rural Landless Employment Guarantee Programme" etc., to provide wage employment to agricultural and landless labourers in the country during lean periods. These programmes included plantation of trees under social forestry scheme in the rural areas. The entire work was done by providing daily wage employment to rural workers of local areas without reference to any Employment Exchange.
 In the Union Territory of Delhi, the plantation work was monitored by the District Rural Development Agency (DRDA). Since the work involved knowledge of plantation and agricultural practices, some unemployed Agricultural Graduates/Diploma-holders, including the petitioners, approached the DRDA and were given daily wage employment under the said programme. They were called Supervisors/ Work Assis- 566 tants, and were paid higher daily wages compared to those paid to the unskilled workers. At no stage any regular posts were created under the DRDA either for the Supervisors etc. or for the labourers, since the schemes were financed by the Government of India and the DRDA was only the implementing machinery.
 In 1988-90 the Government of India announced a new scheme, called "Jawahar Lal Nehru Rozgar Yojna", for intensive employment in backward districts where acute poverty and unemployment prevailed. Later on, all the Schemes were merged in one known as "Jawahar Rozgar Yojna".
 Under this programme, the monetary assistance received from the Central Government and the State Government/Union Territories was given directly to the village Panchayats which exclusively made the choice of work and employed the work-force. The DRDA ceased, w.e.f. 31.7.1989, to be the machinery in these respects and was no longer directly concerned with the payment of wages to the workers.
 The petitioners filed the writ petitions before this Court for the difference in wages paid to them and those paid to the regular employees as also for their absorption in the Development Department of the Delhi Administration and for injunction prohibiting the termination of their services. It was contended that they were employed by and were working under the DRDA which was a department either of the Central Government or the Delhi administration and was not an autonomous body, and that the DRDA continues to be the employing agency because the tenure of the Pradhans of Village Panchayats under the Union Territory of Delhi expired and the administration of the Panchayats was carried on by the Block Development Officers.
 Dismissing the writ petitions, this Court, 
 HELD: 1.1. The schemes under which the petitioners were given employment were evolved with the limited resources at the disposal of the State to provide income for those rural poor who were below the poverty line and particularly during the periods when they were without any source of livelihood and, therefore, without any income whatsoever. The object was not to provide the right to work a such even to the rural poor-much less to the unemployed in general. Those employed under the scheme, therefore, could not ask for more than what the scheme intended to give them.
 567 To get an employment under the scheme and claim on the basis of the said employment, a right to regularisation, is to frustrate the scheme itself. No Court can be a party to such exercise. [578H; 579A; E-F] 1.2. It is wrong to approach the problems of those employed under the schemes with a view to providing them with full employment and guaranteeing equal pay for equal work. These concepts in the context of such schemes are both unwarranted and misplaced. They will do more harm than good by depriving the many of the little income that they may get to keep them from starvation. They would benefit a few at the cost of the starving poor for whom the schemes were meant. That would also force the State to wind up the existing schemes and forbid them from introducing the new ones, for want of resources - the Central Government has decided to discontinue Jawahar Rozgar Yojna in the Union Territory of Delhi w.e.f. 1.1.92. This is not to say that the problems of the unemployed deserve no consideration or sympathy, but only to emphasise that even among the unemployed a distinction exists between those who live below and above the poverty line, those in need of partial and those in need of full employment, the educated and uneducated, the rural and urban unemployed etc. [579F-H;
 577H; 578A; 580A] 
 2.1 For regularisation, there must be regular and permanent posts or it must be established that although the work is of regular and permanent nature, the device of appointing and keeping the workers on ad hoc or temporary basis has been resorted to, to deny them the legitimate benefits of permanent employment. [p. 577A-B] Shri Niader & Anr. v. Delhi Administration & Anr., (Writ Petition Nos. 9609-10/83) and Rattan Lal & Ors. etc.
 v. Lt. Governor & Ors. etc. (Writ Petition Nos. 98, 99, 216, 938, 940/88) decided on 29.9.88 & 6.3.1990 respectively.
 2.2. In the instant case, there was no scope for regularisation of workers since there were no sanctioned posts or the sanctioned strength of workers. The Delhi Administration had at no stage engaged any of the petitioners for its work. The DRDA which was an implementing machinery of the Jawahar Rozgar Yojna had engaged the petitioners on daily wage basis. The Yojna has not and cannot have any sanctioned strength of posts or workers. The works by their very nature had to be undertaken on daily wage basis and as soon as the works at particular sites were over, the 568 workers were required to be shifted to other sites. The workers were engaged from the areas concerned and those like the petitioners who were willing to go to the sites where the work was available, were also given the employment under the scheme. In the circumstances, neither the DRDA nor the panchayats could be asked either to ensure work to the petitioners every day or to regularise them. [p. 577B-G] 
 3.1 Broadly interpreted and a necessary logical corollary, right to life would include the right to livelihood and, therefore, right to work.
 [p. 578C] Olga Tellis & Ors. v. Bombay Municipal Corporation & Ors., [1985] INSC 155; AIR 1986 SC 180), referred to.
 
 3.2 The country has so far not found it feasible to incorporate the right to livelihood as a fundamental right in the Constitution. This is because the country has so far not attained the capacity to guarantee it, and not because it considers it any the less fundamental to life. Advisedly, therefore, it has been placed in the Chapter on Directive Principles, Article 41 of which enjoins upon the State to make effective provision for securing the same "within the limits of its economic capacity and development". Thus even while giving the direction to the State to ensure the right to work, the Constitution-makers thought it prudent not to do so without qualifying it. [p. 578E-G] 4.1. The District Rural Development Agency, Delhi is an autonomous body registered as a Society under the Societies Registration Act. It is neither a department of the Delhi Administration nor the Central Government. It only implements policies of the Central Government under the supervision of the Delhi Administration. It has no funds of its own. For the implementation of the programmes of employment, the funds were always placed at its disposal by the Central Government and it had to spend them as per the prescribed guidelines. [p. 572F-H] 4.2. The employment programme under Jawahar Rozgar Yojna has since been transferred to the village Panchayats.
 The Block Development Officers are administering the affairs of the Panchayats till such time as fresh elections are not held. The vesting of administration of the panchayats in the Block Development Officers during the intervening period does not change the fact that it is the village Panchayats, which are 569 allotted the funds for the Rural Employment Programme under the Jawahar Rozgar Yojna and it is they who choose the works to be carried out and the necessary work-force to be employed. Hence they are the implementing agencies. [pp.
 572H; 573G-H; 574A] 
 5. If an order passed by this Court in a writ petition had proceeded on the assumption of wrong facts in the absence of the appearance by the respondent-DRDA and if under the pain of contempt proceedings the workers involved in that petition were employed by the DRDA, the petitioners in the instant petition cannot rely upon their employment in such circumstances to plead discrimination against them.
 [p. 576G-H; 577A] Vijay Pal Sharma & Ors. v. Delhi Administration & Ors.
 (W.P. No. 818/89 decided on 12.3.90) distinguished.
 
 6. The pernicious consequences to which the direction for regularisation of workmen on the only ground that they have put in work for 240 or more days, has been leading to, has also to be taken note of. [p. 580B-C] It has become a common practice to ignore the Employment Exchange and the persons registered therein, and to employ and get employed directly those who are either not registered with the Employment Exchange or who though registered are lower in the long waiting list in the Employment Register. The courts can take judicial notice of the fact that such employment is sought and given directly for various illegal considerations including money. [p. 580 C-D] 
 7. The respondents cannot be directed to regularise petitioners' services. However, the respondent-Delhi Administration shall keep the petitioners on a panel and, if they are registered with the Employment Exchange and are qualified to be appointed on the relevant posts shall give them a preference in employment whenever there occurs a vacancy in the regular posts. [pp. 581A-B]
