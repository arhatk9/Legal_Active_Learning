 Under the terms of a mining lease the lessee worked the mines and won iron ore in a tract of land in a village in Chittor district and bound himself to pay a dead rent if he used the leased land for the extraction of iron ore, to pay a royalty on iron ore if it were used for extraction of iron and in addition to pay a surface rent in respect of the surface area occupied or used. The lessee working the mines extracted ore and marketed it. After separation from Madras in 1953, the District of Chittoor became part of the Andhra State. In 1955 a demand was made for the payment of. land cess under ss. 78 and 79 of the Madras District Boards Act and including in the computation of the ,annual rent value", the amounts payable to Government in each year under the mining lease both as surface rent and royalty. On challenge to the validity of this notice by the lessee, the High Court quashed the notices.

 667 After this decision the lessee died. On March 10, 1955, two notices were issued to the appellant demanding payment of cess for the years 1952-54 and 1955-57 respectively and threatening coercive proceedings, for their recovery in the event of non-compliance. Impugning the validity of the earlier notices of demand, the appellant filed a writ petition in the High Court and a similar petition challenging the validity of the notice of demand for the later period. Pending these petitions a further notice of demand for payment of cess for the years 1958-59 was served on the appellant in August 29, 1960 and to obtain a similar relief in respect of this notice and the proceedings for recovery thereof, the appellant filed a writ petition in this Court and contended: (1) that the expression "royalty" under s. 79(1) does not signify royalty as commonly understood but is confined to the rent payable for the beneficial use of the surface of the land; (2) assuming that royalty in the sense mentioned in point No. 1 is within ss.
 78 and 79, of the Act, the provision imposing the land cess quad royalty under the mining leases must be held to be repealed by the Central Acts of 1948 and 1957; (3) is the land cess demanded by the impugned notices dated March 10, 1958 and August 29, 1960 recoverable as an arrears of land revenue under the law? (4) s. 221 of the Act which made the provision for the recovery of sums due as taxes had, by reason of the changes effected in the rules, ceased to be applicable to the recovery of land cess under s. 78.
 Held:(i) Where the land is held on lease, as in the present case, the lease amount is specifically ref0erred to in s. 79 of the Act as one of the components for the computation of the annual rent value. It is therefore obvious that 'royalty' which follows the expression 'lease amount' is something other than the return to the lessor or licenser for the useof the land surface and represents as it normally connotes the paymentmade for the materials or minerals won from the land.
 (ii) There is no connection between the regulation and development of mines and minerals dealt with in the Central Acts and the levy and collection of land cess under ss. 78 and 79 of the Act. There is therefore, nothing in common between the Act and the Central Acts of 1948 and 1957 so as to require any detailed examination of the enactments for discovering whether there is any overlapping.

 537 and State of Orissa v. M. A. Tullock, A.I.R. 1964 S.C.
 1284, distinguished.
 (iii) In the context of ss. 78 and 79 of the Act and the scheme ofthose provisions it is clear that the land cess is in truth a 'tax on lands' within the entry 49 of the State List.
 Where the land is held under lease it is the lease amount that forms the basis. Where land is held under a mining lease, that which the occupier is willing to pay is accordingly treated as the "annual rent value" of the property; such rent value would, therefore, necessarily 668 include not merely the surface rent but the dead rent, as well as the royalty payable by the licensee, lessee or occupier for the user of the property.
 (iv) The cess under s. 78 would be "a cess lawfully imposed upon land" under s. 52 of the Madras Revenue Recovery Act and would therefore be covered by its terms. The legality of the procedure, which the respondents proposed to adopt for the recovery of the sums could not, therefore, be successfully challenged.
