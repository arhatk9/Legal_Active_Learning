 R dies in 1959 leaving behind him four sons, some grandsons, wife and daughter. These accountable persons furnished an account of the properties passing on the death of R to the Deputy Controller of Estate Duty. The Deputy Controller added to the return made the value of certain properties settled by the deceased on his wife, sons, grandsons and daughter on the ground that the deceased had reserved to himself an interest for life in the properties comprised in the above settlements, within the meaning of s. 12 of the Estate Duty Act 1953. The deed in favour of the sons and the minor grandsons contained a provision to the effect that these would have to pay to the deceased during his lifetime a sum of Rs. 1,000/- a year for his domestic expenses; the deed in favour of the daughter contained a provision that she would have to maintain him and his wife for their lifetime; the deed in favour of the wife expressed a hope that she would support him in his lifetime. In appeal the Central Board of Direct Taxes held that the settlements fell within the scope of s. 12 or at any rate that s. 10 of the Act. The High Court in reference held (1) that s. 12 was wholly inapplicable to the facts of the case; (ii) that even under s. 10, pot the entire value of the property settled on the various beneficiaries but only the value of the interest reserved by the deceased to himself during his life time could be taken into consideration : (iii) that the deed in favour of the wife did not reserve any benefit in favour of the deceased as it expressed only a hope., The Revenue as well as the assessees appealed to this Court.
 Allowing the appeal of the assessees, 
HELD : (i) So far as the stipulation contained in the deed in favour of the wife of the deceased was concerned it was merely a hope and expectation and no enforceable liability as such was created. The High Court was therefore right in holding that no part of the property settled on the wife of the deceased could be taken into consideration in computing the value of the property that passed on the death of the deceased. [751A-B] (ii) The High Court was further right in holding that s. 12 was wholly inapplicable to the facts of the case. It was nobody's case that the beneficiaries became entitled to the properties settled on them after the death of the deceased.
 There was no support for the contention of the Revenue that an interest in the properties settled was reserved to the deceased during his lifetime or for any period after the properties were settled; nor was there any provision in the deeds enabling the deceased to reclaim the property or its possession under any circumstances. None of the conditions laid down in s. 12(1) were attracted to the provisions contained in the deeds of settlement. [751D-F] (iii) The facts of the case also did not come within the scope of s. 10 The provisions for annual payments and maintenance made in the deeds were not charged on the properties settled. Hence the deceased could not be said to have retained any interest in the properties settled.
 Therefore it could not be said that he retained any benefit either in the properties settled or in respect of their possession. [754 A-B] 748 If, as contended by the Revenue, the expression "of any benefit to him by contract or otherwise" in s. 10 mean any benefit under the gift, the legislature should have said so.
 There was no difficulty in saying so. It is a well accepted rule of construction that if a taxing provision is ambiguous and is reasonably capable of more than one interpretation, that interpretation which is beneficial to the subject must be adopted. It is impermissible for the court to read into a taxing provision any words which are not there or exclude words which are there. The words found in the provision must be given their natural meaning. [753F-G] George De Costa v. Controller of Estate Duty Mysore, 51 I.T.R. 497, ,considered and applied.
 Mohammad Bhai and Anr. v. Controller of Estate Duty, Andhra Pradesh, 69 I.T.R. 770, held inapplicable.
