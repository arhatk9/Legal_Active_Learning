 The respondent is a registered dealer with its head office at Madras and branches inside the State of Tamil Nadu and also in certain places in the States of Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. During the years 1960-61 to 1964-65 and 1966-67 it was dealing in various goods including cloth, yarn, etc. and was being assessed to tax under the Act on the turnover of the business. The gross turnover of the respondent included the sales of yarn, by the Madurai Mills Limited to the respondent to its head office in Madras and also to its branches. The method which was followed by the head office of the respondent was that it would place orders from Madras on Madurai Mills Limited pursuant to which supplies would be made by the Madurai Mills either to the respondent's head office or to its branches in accordance with the instructions given by the head-office. Where deliveries were made to the respondent inside the State the seller collected the tax due under Madras General Sales-tax Act, 1959, with reference to item 3 of the second Schedule to the Act. But in respect of deliveries made to the respondent's branches outside the State, the Madurai Mills collected tax under s. 3 of the Central Sales-tax Act. During the year 1965-66 the respondent transferred to the State of Tamil Nadu certain quantities of yarn from the stocks so purchased at its branches in the States of Andhra Pradesh and Kerala and sold the same to local dealers. The appellant thereupon called upon the respondent to produce accounts and certain other documents on the assumption that the sales so effected were chargeable to tax as first sales in the State. The respondent objected to these proceedings on the ground that the sales were second sales not liable to tax and filed writ petitions in the High Court. The writs were allowed by the High Court. Dismissing the appeal 
HELD : When cotton yarn was sold to the respondent in Madras, the goods were in the State of Tamil Nadu when the contract of interstate sale was entered into, it will be a first sale in the State. Once that sale has taken place, and the goods were delivered in the States of Andhra Pradesh and Kerala pursuant to that inter-state sale, there was not further sale to the respondent when it transferred to its branches those goods which have already been subject to tax in the State of Tamil Nadu. They are exempted from being taxed again since they have already been subjected to tax on the first sale inside the State. [14 H] [The Court did not find it necessary to consider the question whether the provisions of section 15 of the Central Sales-tax Act makes an inroad into the texture of the local law so that section 6 of the local Act will have to be read subject to and in conformity with the provisions of Section 15 and the policy underlining that section and whether Section 6 will he inapplicable to sales of declared goods.] [15A] 11
