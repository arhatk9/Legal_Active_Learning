 The appellant, a Pakistani national doing business in Karachi, was convicted of the offence of cheating under s.
 420 Of the Indian Penal Code. The prosecution case was that with a dishonest intention he made false representations to the complainant at Bombay through letters, telegrams and telephone talks, that he had ready stock of rice, that he had reserved shipping space and on receipt of money he would be in a position to ship the rice forthwith, and that the complainant who was anxious to import rice urgently sent the amount to the appellant on the belief of such representations. It was contended for the appellant that the conviction was bad on the grounds inter alia (1) that he was a Pakistani national who, during the entire period of the commission of the offence, never stepped into India and was only at Karachi and that he could not be tried by an Indian Court nor be punishable under the Indian Penal Code, (2) that lie 329 was brought over from England, where he happened to be, by virtue of extradition proceedings in connection with another offence the trial for which was then pending in the Sessions Court at Bombay, and that he could not be validly tried and convicted for a different offence like the present, and (3) that the charge being one under s. 42o read with s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code for alleged conjoint acts of himself along with three others and those three not being before the Court, and himself not having been in Bombay at the time, the conviction was unsustainable.
 Held: (1) that, on the facts, all the ingredients constituting the offence of cheating under S. 420 Of the Indian Penal Code having occurred in Bombay, the offence was committed there and that, though the appellant was not corporeally present in India at the time of the commission of the offence, his conviction under the Indian Penal Code was valid in view of the terms of s. 2 of the Code;
 (2) that, as the appellant was surrendered to the Indian authorities under the Fugitive Offenders Act, 1881, and there was no provision in that Act preventing arrest in India for the purpose of a trial in respect of a fresh offence, his conviction following upon his trial was valid.
 H. N. Rishbud v. The State of Delhi, (1955) 1 S.C. R.
 II50, relied on.
 (3) that the conviction of the appellant of the offence of S. 420 was valid, though the charge was one under S. 420 read with s. 34, as the actual findings in the case could support a conviction under S. 420 itself.
