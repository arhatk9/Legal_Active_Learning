 Writ petitions involving important questions of law came up before a single Judge of the High Court. He was requested by the parties to refer the cases to a Divisional Bench.
 Instead of doing so he disposed them of himself, and suo motu granted a certificate under Art. 132(1) of the constitution for appeal to this court.
 
 HELD : The action of the Judge though technically permissible was improper, because, either the Judge should' have referred the cases to a Bench, or allowed the parties to pursue their right of appeal to a Bench against the decision of the single Judge, without short circuiting the right by passing on the cases to this Court. [779 E-G.]
