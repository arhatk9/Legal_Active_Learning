 The appellant (plaintiff), a private limited company, a labour contractor, entered into a sub-contract with the respondent (defendant), a Yugoslavia based company which in turn had entered into a contract with the State Electricity Board for setting up a power station. The sub-contract dated July 10, 1961 between the appellant and the respondent incorporated an agreement to refer all the disputes arising out of the sub-contract to arbitration by the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris with the application of Yugoslav materials and economical law. In carrying out the work undertaken under the sub-contract,the appellant claimed that it carried out some extra work for which it was entitled to recover extra amounts from the respondent, and as the claims were not satisfied or met with by the respondent, the appellant filed a civil suit on the original side of the High Court for recovery of the amount. On a notice of motion taken out by the appellant, the High Court granted an ad interim exparte injunction restraining the respondent from withdrawing the money due to it from the State Electricity Board.
 Pursuant to service of the aforesaid notice of motion the respondent moved an application under sec. 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, alleging in the petition for stay that the disputes and differences that arose were in respect of and/or relating to the sub-contract dated July 10, 1961 and in view of the subsisting agreement to refer disputes or differences arising under or out of the sub-contract to arbitration, the suit filed by the appellant should be stayed. The appellant filed a counter-affidavit contending that there was no concluded agreement between the parties to refer all the disputes arising out of the subcontract to arbitration and alleged that by letter dated July 10, 1961, the very dated on which the sub-contract was entered into at Belgrade, the Managing 900 Director of the appellant company informed the respondent that he had objected to the arbitration clause in the agreement. It was also averred that a cable was also sent by the Managing Director on reaching Bombay on July 13, 1961 requiring that the clause regarding arbitration be deleted.
 Second contention was that even if it is held that there is a subsisting arbitration agreement, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the discretion should not be exercised in favour of the defendant-respondent.
 The Single Judge granted the petition of the respondent and stayed further proceedings in the suit filed by the appellant, and vacated the ad interim injunction granted in favour of the appellant.
 The appellant preferred two appeals. One against the order of the single Judge granting stay of the suit of the appellant and the other against the order vacating the ad interim injunction. A Division Bench of the High Court dismissed both the appeals by a common judgment holding that there was a valid subsisting arbitration agreement between the parties and that it was binding on both. It also held that the claims made by the appellant in the suit arose out of the sub-contract which included the arbitration agreement and, therefore, the appellant must be bound by the bargain undertaken by him. It negatived the appellant's contention that on the facts and circumstances of the case discretionary relief of grant of stay of suit would cause irreparable hardship and deny justice.
 In appeal to this Court against the order of stay of the suit granted by the High Court, it was contended on behalf of the appellant: (1) there was no concluded arbitration agreement between the parties to refer the disputes arising out of the sub-contract dated July 10, 1961 to arbitration and, therefore, the suit cannot be stayed;
 (2) even if the Court came to the conclusion that there was such a subsisting arbitration agreement between the parties, prayer for stay having been made under section 51 of the Code of Civil Procedure and/or under section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, read with Section 151 CPC, the Court should not enforce it in its discretionary jurisdiction as it would result in miscarriage of justice; (3) in view of the provisions contained in the Arbitration (Protocol and Convention) Act, 1937 the Court could not invoke its inherent jurisdiction under section 151 CPC and the Special Act would not assist the respondent as the case was not covered by its provisions. It was also contended that the undermentioned circumstances when properly evaluated would unmistakably indicate that the instant case is not a fit case in which the Court should decline to adjudicate upon the dispute brought to it by granting stay in favour of the respondent. (1) The work under the special contract Ext. A dated July 10, 1961 was executed and carried out in India and the whole of the evidence both for and against the appellant in India,(2) the amount claimed in the suit is so disproportionately small in relation to the huge cost of arbitration to be held at Paris in France that forcing the appellant to incur the cost to realise such a small sum would be denial of justice, (3) restrictions on availability of foreign exchange is a relevant consideration, a fact of which the Court can take judicial notice, (4) the Court should not render its assistance by granting stay to one who insists on arbitration not as a matter of principle but with a view to thwarting, stiffing or exhausting the other side, and (5) in all cases of arbitration by a foreign arbitral tribunal there is always a rider that in case of hardship or injustice, Courts of the country of the party being forced to go to foreign arbitral tribunal will protect him.
 901 On behalf of the respondent it was contended that (1) even if the court proceeds on the assumption that the letter and the cable were received, it is not open to the Court to look into the contents of the letter and the cable because the contents were not proved, as the Managing Director of the appellant company who was supposed to have signed the letter and the cable had neither entered the witness box nor filed his affidavit proving the contents thereof, (2) that once the sub-contract was admittedly signed and executed by the Managing Director of the appellant company, subsequent attempt on behalf of the appellant to repudiate a part of the contract would be of no avail and the court cannot give effect to it except if the novatio suggested by the appellant was unreservedly accepted and agreed to by the respondent, and (3) when the motion is addressed to the discretion of the court and the court has exercised its discretion, the appellate Court should be slow to interfere with the discretionary order and substitute its own discretion in place of the discretion of the court before which the motion was addressed.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: 1. Both the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court were in error in granting stay of the suit. The stay of the suit granted by the learned Single Judge and affirmed by the Division Bench is vacated. The suit should proceed further from the stage where it was stayed. The trial court would give priority to it and dispose it of as expeditiously as possible. [928G-H] 
 2. The sub-contract marked Ext. A had been signed both by the Managing Director of the appellant company as well as on behalf of the respondent company. The third paragraph of Article 12 of sub-contract Ext. A recites an arbitration agreement. The provision is for a reference of disputes arising out of the sub-contract to foreign arbitral tribunal, namely, the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris. Such a clause spells out an arbitration agreement.
 [908E-F] 
 3. (i) The Appellate Bench of the High Court held that the letter and the cable were not received by the respondent. This conclusion is not only contrary to evidence on record but reached in utter disregard of the admission of the Manager of the respondent. [910A-B] (ii) The letter and the cable would show that the arbitration agreement to refer disputes to a foreign arbitral tribunal in the draft was not acceptable to the appellant though the other terms were acceptable. The appellant repudiated the arbitration agreement soon after the agreement was signed when the Managing Director of the appellant was in Belgrade and took the follow up action by sending a cable reiterating and repeating the objection immediately after his return to India. After this specific objection with regard to arbitration agreement in the sub- contract, the respondent allowed the appellant to proceed further with the implementation and execution of the sub- contract, without controverting what the appellant had stated in the letter and the cable. This unmistakably shows that the respondent accepted the alteration as suggested by the appellant in that the arbitration agreement was deemed to have been deleted from the sub-contract Ext A. [910H;
 911A-D] 
 4. If the truth of the facts stated in a document is in issue, mere proof of the handwriting and execution of the document would not furnish evidence of the truth of the facts or contents of the document. The truth or otherwise 902 of the facts or contents so stated would have to be proved by admissible evidence i.e. by the evidence of those persons who can vouchsafe for the truth of the facts in issue.
 [912B-C] In the instant case the utter failure of the respondent to reply to the letter and the cable controverting the averments made therein unmistakably establish the truth of the averments made in the letter. [912E] 
 5. In the facts of a given case acceptance of a suggestion may be sub silentio reinforced by the subsequent conduct. The general rule is that an offer is not accepted by mere silence on the part of the offeree. There may, however, be further facts which taken together with the offeree's silence constitute an acceptance. One such case is where a part of the offer was disputed at the negotiation stage and the original offeree communicated that fact to the offerer showing that he understood the offer in a particular sense. This communication will probably amount to a counter offer in which case it may be that mere silence of the original offerer will constitute his acceptance. [912G-H] In the instant case, the conclusion is inescapable that there was no concluded arbitration agreement between the parties. [914E] Halsburys Laws of England 4th Edn. vol. 9 para 251, R.
 v. Fulhan, Hammersmith and Kensington Rent Tribunal, ex parte Zerek, [1951] 1 All E. R. 482, Davies v. Sweet (1962) 2 W.L.R. 525, referred to.
 6.(i) The High Court totally overlooked and ignored the admission of receipt of letter and cable in paragraph 6 of the affidavit. The High Court attached importance to the denial of the receipt of the letter and the cable by the employee of the respondent company in the oral evidence and did not attach importance to the subsequent admission that the manager of respondent company must have replied to the letter and the cable. Admission, unless explained, furnishes the best evidence. The High Court overlooked the material evidence, drew impermissible inference and came to the conclusion which on evidence is found utterly unsustainable.
 [914G-H] (ii) A finding of fact recorded by the High Court overlooking the incontrovertible evidence which points to the contrary and, therefore, utterly unsustainable cannot come in the way of this Court reaching a correct conclusion on facts and the examination of the evidence by this Court cannot be impeded by a mere submission that this Court does not interfere with finding of fact. [915A] 
 7. (i) Both the Courts practically overlooked the basic difference in the approach which the Court will have to adopt if the application is to be treated under section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, or one under section 151 C.P.C. In any event, as the motion is at the discretion of the Court and as both the parties have led evidence, the burden of proof would assume secondary importance. [916F] Michael Golodetz & Ors. v. Serajuddin and Co. [1964] 1 S.C.R. 19, referred to.
 (ii) It is well settled that where the trial court has a discretion in the matter, the appellate court would not ordinarily substitute its discretion in place of the discretion exercised by the trial court. It is equally well settled that where the trial court ignoring the relevant evidence, side tracking the 903 approach to be adopted in the matter and overlooking various relevant considerations, has exercised its discretion one way, the appellate court keeping in view the fundamental principle can and ought to interfere because when it is said that a matter is within the discretion of the court it is to be exercised according to well established judicial principles, according to reason and fair play, and not according to whim and caprice. [917B-C] Craies Statute Law 6th Edn. p. 273 R. v. Wilkes (770) 4 Barr 2527, referred to.
 
 8. The Single Judge and the Division Bench completely overlooked the well established principles in granting stay of suit in a case where reliance is placed upon a subsisting arbitration agreement. [917D] 
 9. When parties by contract agree to arrange for settlement of their disputes by a Judge of their choice, by procedure of arbitration voluntarily agreed upon, ordinarily the court must hold the parties to their bargain. As a corollary, if a party to a subsisting arbitration agreement in breach or violation of the agreement to refer dispute to arbitration approaches the Court, the Court would not lend its assistance to such a party and by staying the suit compel the party in breach to abide by its contract. When the parties have agreed to an arbitration by a foreign arbitral tribunal the case for stay would be stronger than if there was a domestic arbitration agreement. However, it is not an absolute rule. Granting or refusing to grant stay is still a matter within the discretion of the court. How discretion would be exercised in a given case would depend upon various circumstances. [918D-F] Bristol Corporation v. John Aird & Co. [1913] A.C. 241 at 257 and Owners of Cargo Ex "Athenee" v. Athenee Llyods' List Law Reports, Easter Sittings 1922, Vol. XI, page 6, referred to.
 In the instant case the entire evidence both of the appellant and the respondent is in this country; the contract as a whole was executed and carried out in this country; the claim as a whole arose in this country; the appellant is a company incorporated in this country; and the respondent is having its office in this country; and that the respondent is not motivated by any principle to have the decision of the foreign arbitral tribunal at Paris but the principal object of respondent is merely to make it more difficult, if not impossible, for the appellant to assert the claim. The other vital considerations are, that the cost of arbitration at Paris will be so disproportionately high to the claim involved in adjudication that one would never think of incurring such a huge cost to realise such a small sum claimed, and the restriction on the availability of foreign exchange. The sum total of all these well established circumstances clearly indicate that the instant suit is one in which when discretion is exercised on well settled judicial considerations no court would grant stay and the stay has to be refused.

 10. Section 3 of the Arbitration (Protocol and Convention) Act, 1937 is in pari materia with section 3 of the Foreign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement) Act, 1961.
 Section 3 of the 1937 Act would only be attracted if there is a submission pursuant to an agreement to that effect.
 [928B-C] 904 In the instant case while there is an agreement as contemplated by First Schedule to the 1937 Act, there is no submission made in pursuance of such agreement and, therefore the application of the respondent could not have been entertained under section 3 of the 1937 Act. [928D]
