 The respondent firm was duly registered under the Income-tax Act, 1922 as well as the Income tax Act, 1961. In the original assessments of the firm for the years 1958-59, 1960-61, 1961-62 and 1962-63 assessments were made on the slab rates prescribed under the respective Finance Acts applicable to registered firms. In the individual assess- ments of the partners, their respective shares in the income of the firm were included and assessed at the maximum rates since their assessment,,; were made in the status of nonresident. On February 1, 1965 the respondent firm was served with notices dated January 29, 1965 by the Income-tax Officer intimating to it that in its assessments for the four years in question there were mistakes apparent from the record inasmuch as the firm had not been charged at the maximum rates of tax under s. 17(1) of the Income tax Act, 1922 and that therefore he proposed to rectify those assessments under s. 154 of the Income tax Act, 1961.
 Thereafter the Income-tax Officer assessed the respondent firm by applying the provisions of s. 17(1) of the 1922 Act.
 The respondent challenged the validity of She said orders in a writ petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution. The High Court held that there was no obvious and patent mistake in the original assessment orders and therefore the Income tax Officer was not competent to pass the impugned orders under s. 154. In appeal by certificate, 
HELD:A mistake apparent on the record must be an obvious and patent mistake and not something which can be established by a long drawn process of reasoning on points on which there may conceivably be two opinions. [34E] The applicability of s. 17(1) to the respondent would depend an the decision of the question whether a firm can be considered as a 'person' within the meaning of that section.
 The term 'person' was defined in the 1922 Act as including a Hindu Undivided Family and a local authority. In the 1961 Act the definition has been expanded and includes firm. It is a matter for consideration whether the new definition contained in s.. 2(31) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 is an amendment of the law or is merely declaratory of the law that was in force earlier. To pronounce upon this question it may be necessary to examine various provisions in the Act as well as its scheme. The Income-tax Officer it) the present case was not justified in thinking that there could be no two 31 opinions about the applicability of s. 17(1) . He was therefore wholly wrong in holding that there was a mistake apparent from the record of the assessments of the respondent. [33F-34D] Satyanarayan Laxminarayan Hegde & Ors. v.
