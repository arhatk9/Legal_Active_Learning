 The assessee-Company was promoted because the Government of India promulgated the Cinematograph Rules, 1948, according to which distributors of films were required to store films in godowns constructed in conformity with the specifications laid down in the Rules. The assesses constructed vaults of special design with special doors and electrical fittings as required and entered into agreements with several distributors who became vault-holders paying certain amounts for the use of the vaults. The key to each vault was retained by the vault-holder, but the key to the entrance which permitted access to the vaults was kept in the exclusive possession of the assessee. The assessee rendered valuable service to the vault-holders by installing a fire alarm, by opening Railway Booking Offices in the premises and by employing a regular staff, and incurred the necessary expenditure. The vaults were used for the specific purpose of storing films and other activities connected with the examination, cleaning, waxing and rewinding of the films.
 On the question whether the assessee was to be assessed to Incometax under s. 9 or s. 10 of the Income-tax Act, 1922, 
HELD : The assessee was carrying on business, that is, carrying on an adventure or concern in the nature of trade in the premises, and was therefore liable to be assessed under s. 10 and not under s. 9 of the Act.
 The Act does not contemplate assessment of property under s.
 9 in respect of the rental income and assessment under s. 10 in respect of the extra income derived from the carrying on of an adventure or concern in the nature of trade if the assessee is in occupation of the premises for the purpose of the business. The scheme of the Act is that the various heads of income, profits and gains enumerated in s. 6 are mutually exclusive, each head being specific to cover the item arising from a particular source, and whether an income falls under one head or another has to be decided according to common notions of practical men. In the present case, the agreements are licences and not leases, the assessee being in occupation of all the premises for purposes of its own concern, namely, the hiring out of specially built vaults and providing services to the vault-holders, who were the licensees. The subject which was hired out was a complex one and the return received by 'the assessee was not income derived from the exercise of property rights, but was derived from carrying on an adventure or concern in the nature of trade.
