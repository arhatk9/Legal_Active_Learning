 The appellant is a private limited company and it carries on the business of printing and publishing newspapers and, periodicals. In 1959 the appellants intimated the closure of its business in respect of its various publication at Madras. On the, same day the appellant's Board of Directors resolved to sell items of printing machinery and equipment to one private limited company and the next day the appellant inserted advertisement in a local newspaper announcing that the premises of the appellant is "To let".
 Thereafter the respondents struck work. The Government at this stage issued two orders. By one of these orders the Government referred the dispute to Industrial Tribunal under s. 10 (1) (d) of the Industrial Disputes Act. The other order which was under s.10 (3) of the Act prohibited the continuance of the strike and lockout in the appellants concern.
 The appellant thereupon filed two writ petitions against the above orders of the Government. Both petitions were heard together by a Single judge who held that since the order under s. 10 (3) was a mere administrative order it was not open to the Court to quash it but since that order was not without jurisdiction the appellant was entitled to ignore it. With regard to the other writ petition he held that the High Court had jurisdiction to entertain it even at an interlocutory stage and on the merits of the case he found that the action of the appellant did not amount to a lockout but a closure and the dispute between the parties was not an industrial dispute. The respondents then preferred two appeals to the Division Bench concerning the order of the Government under S. 10 (3) the provision Bench upheld the decision if the Single Bench and 541 dismissed the appeal. With regard to the other appeal it help that even though the High Court had jurisdiction to entertain the writ petition since the determination of the question whether the reference was valid or not involved many complicated questions of fact the matter must be fully investigated and tried in the first instance by the Tribunal.
 The appellant then appealed to this Court. The main contention raised in the appeal was that since the action of the appellant did not amount to a lockout but a closure there was no industrial dispute. That being the position the reference was invalid and the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to embark on the proposed enquiry. The next contention was that issue No. 1 in the reference which related to transfer of the publication and business of the appellant was on the face of it-bad since the appellant was entitled to make such transfer and the respondents had no right to raise an industrial dispute with regard to such transfer. Thirdly it was urged that the wording of issue No. 2 showed that the Government had already determined the question raised by that issue and there was nothing left to the decision of the Tribunal.
 Held, that if the Industrial Tribunal proceeds to assume jurisdiction over a non-industrial dispute that can be successfully challenged before the High Court by a petition for an appropriate writ. The finding on the preliminary issue whether an action of a party amounts to a lockout or a closure is a finding on a jurisdictional fact. It is only when it is found that the action amounts to a lockout that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to deal with the merits of the dispute. As a general rule it is not proper. or appropriate that the initial jurisdiction of a special tribunal to deal with jurisdictional facts should be circumvented and the decision of such a preliminary issue brought before the High Court on its writ jurisdiction.
 On the facts and circumstances of the case it would be idle to contend that issue No. 1 related to the transfer of business which could not be the subject matter of an industrial dispute.
 Courts should construe an order of reference not too technically or in a pedantic manner but fairly and reasonably. Construed in this manner and having regard to the content of the dispute covered by issue No. 2 that issue was not so worded exclude the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to decide the question whether the appellant's action amounted to a closure or not.
