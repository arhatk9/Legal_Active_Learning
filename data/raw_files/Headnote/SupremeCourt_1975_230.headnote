 The appellants plaintiffs filed a suit against the defendants respondents for recovery of possession of the property leased to them as also rent and mesne profits in March, 1968. It was alleged that the defendants were in arrears of rent from 1st March, 1966 and that the rent was Rs. 385/- a month. On 30th January, 1968, a notice to quit was given to the defendants and the notice was served on 1st February, 1968. On 20th February, 1968 they filed an application under s.11 of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act 1947 for fixation of standard rent. It was thereafter that the suit was filed in March, 1968. On 23rd November. 1968, the suit came up before a Judge of the Small Causes Court and after hearing the parties he made an order requiring the defendants to deposit Rs. 13,000/- as rent due up to the end of December 1968 and interim standard rent of Rs. 308/- per month to be paid beginning from, February 15, 1969. It was further ordered that in default of the defendants depositing the amount the plaintiffs were at liberty to follow the consequential remedy under s.11 (4) of the Act. The defendants did not deposit the amount ordered by the Court and on 24th February 1969 the plaintiffs applied to the Court praying for a notice to be issued to the defendants to show cause why they should not deposit the aggregate amount of' rent and further rent of Rs. 385/- per month from 1st August, 1969 till the disposal of the suit. There was a further prayer that in default of the deposit of the amount the defences of the defendants may be ordered to be struck off. Upon this application a notice was issued to the defendants and on 2nd June, 1969, an order was made requiring the defendants to deposit Rs. 14,007/- within one month and to continue to deposit Rs. 385/- per month in accordance with the earlier order. It was further ordered that in default of the deposit the defences of the defendants there to be struck of and that the suit should be placed for ex parte orders on 15th July 1969. The defendants were absent. On that day and the suit was adjourned to 5th August, 1969. On the 5th August the suit was again adjourned to 6th and on that day an ex- parte decree for possession, recovery of arears of rent and costs was passed. However, on the 5th August he defendants had made an application stating that on proper calculation the amount of arrears of rent would come to Rs. 7065/- and praying for extension of time for deposit of this amount.
 The defendants were allowed to deposit the amount without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the partied and notice was ordered to be issued to the plaintiffs. The defendants deposited the amount but did not take out and serve the notice on the plaintiffs and the notice was ultimately discharged for want of prosecution on 19th September, 1969. An appeal filed before the Appellate Bench of the Small Causes Court against the exparte decree and it was dismissed. The High Court on an application made by the defendants under Art. 227 of the Constitution set aside the decree passed by the Small Causes Court on 6th August, 1969 as also the decree passed by the Appellate Bench and also dismissed the suit.
 The High Court held that the order passed by the Small Causes Court on June 2, 1969 was illegal and without jurisdiction and every step that was taken by the Court subsequently was without jurisdiction and, therefore, was illegal. The High Court further held that as the defendants had deposited 33 all mounts as ordered by the Court previous to the order of June 2, 1969 and also deposited the monthly rent at the rate of Rs. 308/- per month the matter would fall under s.
 12(3)(b) and the suit should be dismissed.
 Allowing the appeal by special leave, ^ 
 HELD:(1) The Judge of. the Small Causes used the words "defences to be struck off" and did not use the words the shall not be entitled to appear in or defend the suit except with the leave of the Court, which leave may be granted subject to such terms and conditions as the Court may specify" The words "striking out the defence are very commonly used by lawyers The use of the words defence struck off does not in any way affect the substance of the order and the High Court was wholly in error in holding that because of the form of the order passed on June 2 1969 the order was illegal and without jurisdiction. The order squarely falls within s.11(4) What the law contemplates is not adoption or use of a formula. it looks at the substance.
 It is not possible to bring the case within the provisions of s. 12(3)(b) of he Act. [35 EF. 36 BC, H].
