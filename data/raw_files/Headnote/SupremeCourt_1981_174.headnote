 Disputes having arisen between the parties to a building contract dated 4th April, 1972, an application for the appointment of an arbitrator in terms of clause 47 of the Arbitration Agreement, numbered as Suit No. 400(A) of 1974 was filed in the Delhi High Court. By its order dated August 14, 1974, the High Court appointed the 2nd Respondent Sri M. C. Nanda, retired Chief Engineer, C.P.W.D. as the sole arbitrator. When the reference was pending, a petition number O.M.P. 133/1969 was moved by the appellant, under sections S and 11 of the Act, for the removal of the arbitrator and appointment of another in his place. The petition was dismissed, but in the appeal by special leave (Civil Appeal No. 17/1977) the Supreme Court made an order dated January S, 1977, wherein by consent of parties 3rd respondent Sri O.P. Mallick, retired Chief Engineer, C.P.W.D., was appointed as the sole arbitrator. Since the 3rd respondent after entering into arbitration directed the parties to file fresh pleadings indicating that he desired to commence the arbitration proceeding afresh, another C.M.P. No. 1088/77 was filed in the Supreme Court whereupon suitable directions were given to proceed from the stage at which Sri Nanda left. A further application No. 526(A)/77 was moved, this time before the High Court for considering the counter claim but it was dismissed as the first respondent who did question the jurisdictional aspect earlier, agreed to the issue being included in the reference. Thereafter, the arbitrator made an Award on November 11, 1977. The 1st respondent by his letter dated November 17, 1977, requested the 3rd respondent arbitrator to file or cause to be filed the award along with pleadings and documents before the Supreme Court.
 The 3rd respondent acting on the advice tendered by an officer of the Supreme Court filed the award in the Delhi High Court and informed the par ties The 1st respondent moved C.M.P. No. 14079 of 1977 in the Supreme Court seeking a declaration that the award has to be filed in the Supreme Court in view of provisions contained in section 14 (2) read with section 31 (4) of the Act and for a direction that the award be collected from Delhi High Court and be filed before the Supreme Court and notice of the filing of the award be issued to the parties.
 843 The appellant filed a counter affidavit and contested the petition inter alia contending that Delhi High Court would be the court within the meaning of section 14 (2) in which award ought to have been and has rightly been filed.
 It was contended that if the Court withdrew the proceedings to itself, the appellant would be denied the valuable right of appeal under the letters patent and a further appeal to the Supreme Court under Article 136 of the Constitution.
 Allowing the C.M.P. No. 14079 of 1977, the Court. B ^ 
 HELD 1. The Supreme Court is the court having exclusive jurisdiction wherein the Award dated November 1], 1977 should be filed. [857 C] 1: 1. On a pure grammatical construction as well as taking harmonious and overall view of the various provisions contained in the Act it is crystal clear that ordinarily that court will have jurisdiction to deal with the questions arising under the Act, except the one in Chapter IV, in which a suit with regard to the dispute involved in the arbitration would be required to be filed under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. However, where an application is made in any reference to a court competent to entertain it, that court alone will have jurisdiction over the arbitration proceedings and all subsequent applications arising out of that reference and the arbitration proceedings shall have to be made in that court alone and in no other court. [852 G-H, 853 A-B] 1: 2. The expression "court" as defined in section 2(c) will have to be adhered to unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context in which it is used. The expression "court" as used in section 21 of the Act includes the "appellate court" because appellate proceedings are generally recognised as continuation of the suit '. The expression "court" used in section 14(2), there- fore, will have to be understood in this background. Incorporating the definition of the expression "court" as set out in section 2(c), in sub-section (1) of section 31 would mean that the award will have to filed in that court in which the suit in respect of the dispute involved in the award would have been required to be filed. The provision contained in sub-section (2) of section 14 will not be rendered otiose. [851 A-B, D- E, 852 F] Ct. A. Ct. Nacchiappa Chettiar & others v. Ct. A. Ct.

 1: 4. The Scheme disclosed in sub-sections (2), (3) and (4) of section 31 clearly indicates that to the exclusion of all other courts only one court will have jurisdiction to deal with the proceedings incidental to the reference and the arbitration. Sub-section (3) clearly points in this direction when it provides that all applications regarding the conduct of arbitration proceedings or otherwise arising out of such proceedings shall be made to the court wherein the award has been or may be filed and to no other court.
 The opening non-obstante clause of sub-section (4) excludes anything anywhere contained in the whole Act or in any other law for the time being in force if it is contrary to or inconsistent with the substantive provision contained in sub-section (4). To that extent it carves out an exception to the general question of jurisdiction of the court in which award may be filed elsewhere provided in the Act in respect of the proceedings referred 844 to in sub-section (4). This provision will have an over- riding effect in relation to the filing of the award if the conditions therein prescribed are satisfied. If those conditions are satisfied the court other than the one envisaged in section 14 (2) or section 31 (1) will be the court in which award will have to be filed. That is the effect of the non-obstante clause in sub-section (4) of section 31. Sub-section (4) thus invests exclusive jurisdiction in the court, to which an application has been made in any reference and which that court is competent to entertain as the court having jurisdiction over the arbitration proceedings and all subsequent applications arising out of reference and the arbitration proceedings shall have to be made in that court and in no other court.
 Thus subsection (4) not only confers exclusive jurisdiction on the court to which an application is made in any reference but simultaneously ousts the jurisdiction of any other court which may as well have jurisdiction in this behalf. [851 E-H, 852 A-C] 
 2. A proceedings earlier to reference in a Court would not clothe that court with such jurisdiction as to render the provision contained in section 31 (4) otiose.
 [858 D-E] Also the subsequent application made by the appellant before the Delhi High Court, which was dismissed after the 1st respondent's challenge to the jurisdiction of the Delhi High Court upon compromise between the parties enlarging the jurisdiction of the arbitrator by consent, cannot give the Delhi High Court any control over the arbitration proceedings. In view of the fact that a reference was made by this Court to the 3rd respondent and that this Court gave further direction about the manner and method of conducting the arbitration proceedings and fixed the time for completion of arbitration proceedings, the Supreme Court alone would have jurisdiction to entertain the award.

 3. If the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to entertain the Award and the Supreme Court in view of section 31 (4) alone has jurisdiction for entertaining the award meaning that the award has to be filed in the Supreme Court alone and no other, the same cannot be defeated by a specious plea that the right of appeal would be denied. In the instant case, the door of the Supreme Court is not being closed. In fact the door is being held wide ajar for him to raise all contentions which one can raise in a proceeding in an originating summons. [858 F-G, 859 A-B] Garikapatti Veeraya v. N.
