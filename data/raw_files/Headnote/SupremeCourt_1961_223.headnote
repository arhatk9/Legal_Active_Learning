 By a Cabinet Resolution of the Holkar State certain Rules known as The Indore Industrial Tax Rules were framed for the purpose of levying industrial tax. After the decision of the Privy Council in cherry Railway Go., Ltd. v.
 Commissioner Income,-tax, (1931) L. R. 58 1. A. 239, disallowing deduction , of Commission paid out of profits to agents from the assessable profits; the Government of Holkar State of which the Maharaja was the Supreme Ruler; issued certain Notifications ordering that the Agents' Commission on profits should not be allowed to be deducted from the assessable profits. The appellants who under an agreement paid commission to their agents out of the company's net profits contended, inter alia, that the Notifications in question did not have the force of law and was not enforceable against the appellants.
 Held, that every general order emanating from the sovereign ruler having its roots in a resolution of the cabinet must be regarded as a law binding on the subject and the Notifications disallowing commission paid to, agents to be deducted from the assessable profits were therefore binding on the appellants, because that was the normal mode by which laws were made in the Holkar State.
