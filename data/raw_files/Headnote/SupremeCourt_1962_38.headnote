 The appellant had committed certain offences in the State of Jhabua in 1948, when the Jhabua State was not a part of Dominion of India. He was tried in 1955 under the Indian Penal Code, for the offences committed in the erstwhile State of Jhabua in 1948. The question was whether the appellant could be tried in 1955 under the Indian Penal Code for offences committed in 1948 in the erstwhile State of Jhabusa.
 The Raja of Jhabua State by a notification had made applicable amongst other laws the Penal Code of India to the State of Jhabua. After Jhabua State became part of the State of Madhya Bharat, the Rajpramukh by Ordinance No. 1 of 1948 continued the laws already in force in State of Jhabua. The Part B States (Laws) Act 1951 (3 of 1951) s. 6 while repealing all the existing laws of the State inter alia saved the laws dealing with any penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of any offence committed against any law repealed.
 ^ Held, in 1948, when the offences were committed the 974 law in the State of Jhabua was the Indian Penal Code and that law continued by the Ordinance 1 of 1948 of the Rajpramukh and the repealing Act, in the Part B States (Laws) Act 1951, and any penalty incurred in respect of any offence committed in 1948 was punishable under the Indian Penal Code as applied to Jhabua State.
