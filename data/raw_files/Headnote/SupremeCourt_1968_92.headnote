 When appellant and his wife's brother-the decreased, were quarrelling about the time of his wife's going with him, the appellant whipped out a knife and gave one blow to the deceased, by which an injury on the right side of the chest penetrating 4" deep into the chest cavity was caused, resulting in death. The appellant was convicted under s.
 302 IPC.
 
HELD : The case fell within the third part of s. 299 IPC and was punishable under the second part of s. 304 IPC as culpable homicide not amounting to murder.
 Though the injury was serious, it did not penetrate the lung. Death was caused mainly because it cut the axiliary artery and veins and caused shock and haemorrhage leading to death. The quarrel was not such as would have prompted the appellant to make a homicidal attack.
 Thirdly of s. 300 requires that the bodily injury must be intended and the bodily injury intended to be caused must be sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. This clause is in two parts; the first part is a subjective one which indicates that the injury must be an intentional one and not an accidental one; the second part is objective in that looking at the injury intended to be caused, the court must be satisfied that it was 'sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. The first part was complied with because the injury which was intended to be caused was the one which was found on the person of the deceased. But the second part was not fulfilled, because but for the fact that the injury caused the severing of artery, death might not have ensued. In other words, looking at the matter objectively, the injury which the appellant intended to cause did not include specifically the cutting of the artery but to wound the deceased in the neighbourhood of the clavicle. Therefore, thirdly of s. 300 did not cover the case. Inasmuch as death had been caused,, the matter came within at least culpable homicide not amounting to murder. There again, s. 299 is in three parts.
 The first part takes in the doing of an act with the intention of causing death. The appellant did not intend causing death and the first part of s. 299 did not apply.
 The second part deals with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death. Here again, the intention must be to cause the precise injury likely to cause death and that also was not the intention of appellant. The matter therefore came within the third part.
 The act was done with the knowledge that the appellant was likely by such act to cause the death of the deceased. [690 E-691 C]
