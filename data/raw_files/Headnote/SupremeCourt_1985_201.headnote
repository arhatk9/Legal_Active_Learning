 The Assessee, a Hindu undivided family, carrying on business was assessed under the Indian Income Tax Act, 1918.
 In the assessment year 1949-50 the assessee contended that there was partial partition of the family on 11th October 1948 and various businesses owned by the family were divided through entries made in the account books. A partnership firm was constituted to carry on those businesses and it succeeded the family. The assessee filed an application before the Income-tax Officer claiming the benefit of s.
 25(4) of the Act, which was rejected.
 On appeal, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner set aside the order and called for a remand report. The remand report set out that the partnership firm succeeded to the business of the family on the 12th October, 1948. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner held that as the succession took place on a day of the previous year relevant to the assessment year 1950-51 the claim could not be considered in respect of the assessment year 1949-50.
 The assessee's appeal to the Tribunal was dismissed.
 The High Court, on the Reference made to it, held that there was a definite finding by the Tribunal that succession took place on 12th October 1948, that the date marked the commencement of the previous year relating to the assessment year 1950-51, that no tax was chargeable for any profits that might have accrued on 12th October, 1948, the date on which the succession took place, and that the Tribunal was right in holding that the assessee was not entitled to the benefits of s. 25(4) in the year 1949-50 but he could avail of that benefit in the year 1950-51.
 880 Allowing the appeal to this Court, ^ HELD: 1. The assessee was entitled to relief under s.
 25(4) of the Income Tax Act, 1922 in the assessment year 1949-50. [897 C] 
 2. Section 25 sub-s. (1) dealt with the case of a business which was discontinued and which had not been subjected to double taxation having paid tax under the provisions of the Indian Income Act, 1918, and that the provisions of sub-s. (1) was that if a business was discontinued in the middle of a year, then the business which was discontinued had to pay tax both with regard to the whole of its previous year and also for the broken period of the year of assessment. The scheme of the section seems to be that instead of the business being assessed again for a broken period, the business should pay tax not only for the previous year which it ordinarily would do, but also for the additional period being the period up to its discontinuance. Sub-s. (4) dealt with a business which had paid tax under the Indian Income Tax Act, 1918, and that the sub-section dealt not so much with the mode of taxing a business which was discontinued as with giving relief to a business from double taxation. It dealt with a situation where one business was succeeded by another, and the first relief to which the business which ceased to continue and which had been succeeded by another, was entitled, was that no tax should be payable by the first mentioned person, that is, the person whose business had come to an end, in respect of the income, profits and gains of the period between the end of the previous year and the date of such succession;
 and the second relief to which such person was entitled was that he might further claim that the income, profits and gains of the previous year should be deemed to have been the income, profits and gains of the said period. Looking at the plain language of the section, it was clear that the first relief had to be claimed by the assessee in the year of assessment in which the said succession took place, and the nature of the relief was that he was not obliged to pay tax on that particular specific period which was made up of the last date of the previous year and the date of succession.
 Therefore, it was necessary to ascertain what was the date of succession, because it was in relation to the date of succession that the relief had to be computed. The period might be anything from one day to 364 days. [886 C-H, 887 A- C] Ambaram Kalidas v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Bombay North, 19 I.T.R. 227, approved.

 3. On which date the succession takes place is a question of fact to be determined on the facts and circumstances available in each case. In this case, there was a disruption of HUF. The entries in the account books indicated that there was a partial partition of HUF and the various businesses owned by the family were divided through entries made in the account books. The partnership account books indicated that and that is what happened on 11th October, 1948. The partnership deed recited to carry on the business with effect from 12th October, 1948. There were in the facts of this case two stages - one partial partition of the assets of HUF business and there was evidence that various businesses owned by the family were divided through entries made in the account books, and next the succession, the partnership firm carried on the said business immediately. No vacuum was intended because the clear expression of intention in the deed of partnership indicated that disruption and succession were intended by the parties to be simultaneous. There was continuity of the disrupted assets, with which the partnership business was carried on as an integrated whole and there was transfer of ownership - these are the two essential conditions required to be fulfilled in order to be entitled to relief under s. 25(4) of the Act. And all were intended to happen on the same day.
 Though the deed stated that partnership would come on 12th October, 1948, the intention to carry on business jointly from the date of the division of assets is writ large - it is clear in this case that succession took place on 11th October, 1948. In these matters one should adopt a pragmatic approach and not get enmeshed in technicalities. [896 A-E] 
 4. In the facts of this case and in view of the entries in the account books, there was succession on 11th October 1948 - succession not only of the assets of the business as co-owners but succession of the business. The succession of the assets with which the business was carried on and the assent of the co-owners to carry on the business in partnership from the very next day is evidenced by the document of partnership. It is to be presumed what was divided was not merely assets but business. The purpose of s. 25(4) contemplates, inter alia, that no tax shall be payable in respect of the income of the period between the end of 882 the previous year the date of succession to the business. If the assets were succeeded to or divided as business assets amongst the erstwhile co-parceners then there was succession within the relevant assessment year 1949-50. [896 F-H, 897 A-B]
