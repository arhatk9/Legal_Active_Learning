 The present Writ petitions, special Leave Petitions and Civil Appeals relate to the right of a student admitted in a medical college not recognised by the Medical Council of India to claim migration/transfer to a medical College recognised by the Medical council of India after Passing the first MBBS Examination. The condition of eligibility for migration/transfer to a recognised medical college has been prescribed by the colleges on the basis of one of the recommendations one of the recommendation on Graduate Medical Education adopted by the Medical Council of India.
 This condition relates to migration medical college to another recognised medical college.
 It was contended on behalf of the aggrieved student that differentiation between student of non- recognised medical colleges and recognised medical colleges for purpose of migration/transfer when the degree of MBBS awarded to students of both the categories of medical colleges stood recognised by the University to which the colleges were affiliated, was discriminatory and arbitrary.
 Disposing of the matters, this court, 
HELD : 1.1. Unless a recognised medical college offers to admit by migration/ transfer some students from another medical college no student can claim as of right admission by migration/transfer to that medical college. A recognised medical college when it decides to admit by migration/transfer some student after passing the first MBBS examination from another medical colleges, can restrict its choice only to students who were admitted to and have passed the first MBBS examination from a recognised medical colleges. Undoubtedly, it is one of the recommendations on Graduated Medical Education adopted by the Medical Council of India which is being acted upon by recognised medical colleges while taking student by migration/transfer. [106-E,F.G] 1.2. The recommendation on Graduate Medical Education are by an expert body of the Medical Council of India which is entrusted with certain statutory functions relating to medical education by the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956.
 The Medical Council of India having chosen to accept these recommendation s, such a condition of eligibility for migration /transfer from one medical college to another adopted by the recognised medical colleges cannot be termed unreasonable or arbitrary. The qualitative difference between the non-recognised medical colleges generally as compared to the medical colleges recognised by the Medical Council of India, the recognition being based on certain objective standards relating to medical education, and the competitive merit forming the basis for admission to a recognised medical college justify as reasonable such a restriction for grant of permission for migration/transfer from one medical college to another. One of the purposes served by such a restriction is to permit this inter-college movement of students after passing the first MBBS examination only between student of recognised medical colleges of students and to prevent indirect entry into recognised medical colleges of students who had failed initially to secure entry into secure entry into recognised medical colleges. Movement of students between recognised medical colleges only is quite often to facilitate the students therefore in certain circumstances without conferring on them any additional benefit after the initial entry to a medical colleges duly recognised.
