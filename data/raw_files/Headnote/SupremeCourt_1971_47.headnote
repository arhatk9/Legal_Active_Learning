 Gaibi Ramdasji was the recipient of certain lands from the the Maharaja of Darbhanga and other zamindars. From out of the income of these lands a temple and certain residential buildings were constructed. The estate came to be known as Kamlabari asthal. Gaibi Ramdasji, was succeeded in the office of Mahant by his chela, and thereafter succession lo the Mahantship was from Guru to Chela. The respondent who was the reigning Mahant at the relevant time resisted the demand of the appellant ,,for the production of accounts and other particulars under the provisions of the Bihar Hindu Religious Trusts Act, 1 of 1951. The Board took out criminal proceedings against the respondent, who thereupon filed a suit in which he claimed the asthal and its properties to be his personal property outside the definition of religious trust in s. 2(1) of the Act. The trial ,court decided in favour of the appellant but the High Court took a contrary view. In appeal to this Court.
 
HELD : (1) Properties of the temple being admittedly in the possession,of the Mahant ever since the time of Gaibi Ramjidas the onus of proof that the respondent mahant held them on trust for public purposes of a religious or charitable character was clearly on the appellant Board who alleged that it was so. The trial Judge was, therefore, clearly in error in holding that the respondent mahant ought to have produced sanads and ,that on his failure to do so in adverse inference could be drawn viz., that had they been produced they would have shown that the grants to Gaibi Ramjidasji were for public purposes of religious or charitable character. [686 F-G] (2)The mere fact that Mahants of a particular order did not marry and properties held by them is descended from Guru to Chela was not ;indicative of and did not raise a presumption of such properties being religious properties.
 If originally the property was acquired by a Mahant the fact of its descent subsequently from guru to chela did not also lead to the conclusion that it had lost its secular character. [687 E] (3)Evidence that Sadhus and other persons visiting the temple were given food and shelter was not by itself indicative of the temple being a public temple or its properties being subject to a public trust. [688 A] (4)The mere fact of the public having been freely admitted to the temple cannot mean that courts should readily infer therefrom dedication to the public. The value of such public user as evidence of dedication ,depends on the circumstances which give strength to the inference that the user was as of right-. No such evidence of any reliable kind was avail-able to the appellant Board in the instant case. [689 D] 681 (5)A religious mutt in northern India is generally known as asthal, a monastic institution founded for the maintenance and spread of a particular sampradaya or cult.
 The distinction between dedication to a temple and a mutt is that in the former case it is to a particular deity, while in the later case it is to a superior or a mahant. But just as in the case of the debutter endowment, there is both private and public endowment, so too there can be the same distinction between a private and public mutt. A mutt can be dedicated for the use of ascetics generally or for the ascetics of a particular section or cult, in which case it would be a public institution. But it is not impossible to have a private mutt where the endowment is not intended to confer benefit upon the public generally or even upon the members of a particular order. Examples do occur where the founder may grant property to his spiritual preceptor and his disciples in succession with a view to maintaining one particular spiritual family and for perpetuation of certain rites and ceremonies which are deemed to be conducive to the spiritual welfare of the founder and his family. In such cases it would be the grantor and his descendents who are the only persons interested in seeing that the institution is kept up for their benefit. Even if a few ascetics are fed and given shelter, such a purpose is not to be deemed an independent charity in which the public or a section of it is interested. Such charities appertain to a private debutter also. [690 D-R] The existence of a private mutt in which the property was given to the head of the mutt for his personal benefit only has in the past been recognised. In such cases there is no- intention on the part of the grantor to fetter the grantee with any obligation in dealing with the property granted.
 In each case the court has to come to its conclusion either from. the grant itself or from the circumstances of the case whether the grant was for the benefit of the public or a section of it i.e. annas curtained class, or for the benefit of the grantee himself or for a class of ascertained individuals. An inference can also be drawn from the usage and custom of the institution or from the mode in which properties had been dealt with as also other established circumstances. [691 B-C] (6)The fact that idols were installed permanently on a pedestal and the temple was constructed on grounds separate from the residential quarters of the mahant could not,lead to inference of dedication to the public. In the first place such factors are also found in private temples and mutts and therefore are not conclusive. In the second place there was the evidence that the mahants residential quarters were in fact, not separate from the temple premises. [691 G- H] (7)The expression 'appertaining to the asthal' in the deeds of gifts made by the reigning mahants in favour of their nominees as successor$ meant things which were appurtenant to and forming part of the principal property which was the subject matter of the instrument. The expression would at best mean that the properties formed part of the asthal and were not the properties of the mahant as distinct from those of the asthal. But unless the asthal itself was a public trust for the religious or charitable purposes, the properties appertaining thereto would not be properties of a public trust for religious or charitable purposes. The use of the expression 'appertaining to the asthal', therefore, could not lead to the conclusion that the property in question was stamped with a trust for public purposes. [692 C] The appeal must accordingly be dismissed.
