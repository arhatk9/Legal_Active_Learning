 The petitioner was involved in two incidents of attempt to murder which created a public order problem. In a third incident the petitioner with his colleagues killed one person. The party, when challenged, hurled bombs and the petitioner fired indiscriminately. This incident seriously disturbed public order. Criminal cases were registered against the petitioner in respect of each of the three incidents, but the evidence against the petitioner was not forthcoming.
 The District Magistrate after considering the relevant circumstances came to the conclusion that the petitioner was likely to be enlarged on bail, and since he was further of the view that if the petitioner was not detained, he would be indulging in activities prejudicial to the maintenance of public order, the District Magistrate made the impugned order of detention under section 3(2) of the National Security Act. 1980.
 The order of detention has been challenged on the following grounds: (1) that only the third incident could be connected with the public order problem and the mention of the first two incidents in the grounds of detention renders the order bad; (2) the order having been passed more than four months after the third incident must be set aside on the ground of undue delay alone; (3) in view of the fact that the petitioner's bail application was not opposed. the District Magistrs had no jurisdiction for detaining the petitioner with a view to frustrate the Court's order enlarging him on bail; (4) the authority had illegally discriminated against the petitioner in detaining him while the others have been left free; (5) the relevant records were not placed before the District Magistrate before PG NO 251 PG NO 252 passing the detention order; (6) the copy of the application filed at the instance of the petitioner by way of counter case was not served on him; and (7) the petitioner's representation was not considered and disposed of by the Central Government at all.
 Dismissing the petition, it was, 
 HELD: (1) The impugned order could not be struck down because the grounds of detention referred to the first two incidents also, specially when the first incident appeared to have created a public order problem. [255B-C] (2) An order of detention has not to be mechanically struck down if passed after some delay. It is necessary to consider the circumstances in each individual case whether the delay has been satisfactorily explained, which, in this case, has been done. [255D] (3) A perusal of the detention order and of the affidavit of the District Magistrate in the instant case makes it abundantly clear that he did not act for defeating the bail order. He was of the view that having regard to the entire circumstances appearing from the records played before him, the petitioner when let out on bail was likely to create public order problem. [256C-D] (4) The roles of the petitioner and that of others were not identical and the reasonable apprehension as to their future conduct must depend on the relevant facts and circumstances which differed from individual to individual.
 It would have been wrong on the part of the detaining authority to take a uniform decision in this regard only on the ground that the persons concerned were all joined together as accused in a criminal case. [256-H] (5) The detajning authority has denied the allegation that relevant material was not placed before it and there is no reason to disbelieve the said authority. [257A-B] (6) It cannot be presumed that the petitioner was prejudiced for non-service of a copy of his own application.
 [257B] (7) The error in the date referred to by the petitioner was clerical in nature, and the Central Government, in fact, rejected the petitioner's representation after duly considering it.
