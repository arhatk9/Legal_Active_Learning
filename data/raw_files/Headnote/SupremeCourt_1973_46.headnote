 The plaintiff after two notices to quit, filed an ejectment application against the defendant under S. 14 (1) (e) of the Delhi Rent Control Act 1958. The possession was sought on the ground of personal requirement. The Additional Rent Controller, dismissed the application on a preliminary ground of invalid notice. During the pendency of an appeal against that decision, the plaintiff died. Appellants 1 to 4 who are widow, son and two married daughters of the deceased, applied for being brought on the record of the appeal as his legal representatives. The defendant opposed that application on the ground, that the son and daughter of a deceased daughter of the plaintiff ought also to have been impleaded to the application, and since that was not done, the- appeal had abated. The Rent Control Tribunal allowed these two, persons also to be impleded as appellants :and remanded the ejectment application for a decision on merits.
 These heirs are now appellants 5 and 6. The second appeal filed by the 'tenant against the order of remand was dismissed by the High Court.
 As the order of remand passed by the Rent Control Tribunal was not stayed during the pendency of the second appeal, the Additional Rent Controller proceeded with the ejectment appli cation and passed an order of eviction against the tenant. The tenant appealed against that decision and contended for the first time that the right to sue did not survive to the heirs of the plaintiff. The Rent Control Tribunal rejected the contention and confirmed the order of eviction on merits. In an appeal, the High Court took the view that the right to sue did not survive to the heirs of the plaintiff and on that ground dismissed the ejectment application. The correctness of that decision is challenged by the plaintiffs heirs before this Court. The question for decision was whether the cause of action could survive to his legal representatives. Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) In some cases Under the rent Acts, the maxim actio personalis moritur cum persona has been attempted to be applied 'On the death of a necessary party to a suit or proceeding. This oft-quoted maxim, however, is generally misunderstood. The plain meaning of that common law maxim is that a personal action dies with the parties to the cause of a ction. In the present case, it is obvious that the death of the plaintiff will not cause the ejectment proceedings to abate if the right to sue survives. That is the formula contained in Order 22, Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure. [681F-G, 682D] However, from the pleadings in the ejectment application, the plaintiff has founded his right to relief on his personal requirement. So, if the appellants were permitted to continue the proceedings, the lis will assume a complexion wholly beyond the compass of the original cause of action, and without a fundamental alteration of the pleadings. the appellants would not be able to continue the proceedings. Therefore, the appeal must fail. [683C] 680 Motilal Pannalal v. Kailash Narain, A.I.R. 1960 M.P. 134;
