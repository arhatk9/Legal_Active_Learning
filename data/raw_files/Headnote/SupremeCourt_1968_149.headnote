 A quantity of coal was booked by a Colliery to the appellant Company carriage to Banjari station on the respondent Railway's line and the freight on the consignment was to be paid by the appellant Company. The Company declined to take delivery of a part of the consignment which reached Banjari on November 12, 1954. After some correspondence between the parties as well as with the Coal Controller, the Railway sold the coal on June 2, 1955, after serving a notice on the appellant. It thereafter filed a suit against the Company claiming demurrage for 202 days during which six wagons in which the coal was loaded were detained and 'sought a decree for Rs. 17,625/14/- after giving credit for the amount realised from the sale of the coal. The trial court granted 'a decree for about Rs. 1,620/- with interest, but in appeal the High Court decreed the Railway's claim in full.
 In the appeal to this Court by certificate, it was contended on behalf of the appellant (i) that the Company being a consignee of the goods booked by the Colliery there was no privity of contract between the Company and the Railway and no claim for demurrage or freight lay at the instance of the Railway against the Company; and (ii) that in any event the Railway ought to be awarded demurrage for only 22 days out of the total period for which the wagons were detained.
 
HELD : (i) At the material time the sale and delivery of coal were controlled under the Colliery Control Order 1945;
 the supply of the coal in the present case was sanctioned by the Deputy Coal Commissioner to be made to the appellant Company and an order was also made by him in favour of the Company for priority supply of wagons to carry the coal to Banjari. In these circumstances it would be reasonable to infer that the Colliery acted as an agent for the Company in entering into the contract of consignment and the liability for payment of freight and of demurrage charges for failure to take delivery of the goods lay upon the Company. [361 E- F, 363 D-E] There was no force in the contention that it is only in those cases where delivery of goods is taken by the consignee that the liability to pay demurrage may be imposed upon him. Even where the consignee does not ultimately take delivery, if the wagon is detained for his benefit, normally the Railway would be entitled to hold him liable for demurrage. [363 G] (ii)The High Court was in error in holding that the Company was liable to pay demurrage for the full period of 202 days.
 As the wagons containing the coal reached Banjari on November 12, 1954 and before that date and thereafter the Company had declined to take delivery of 360 the coal, the Railway could have exercised its power to sell the coal under s, 56 of the Railways Act. The Railway was in the position of a bailee qua the Company and was bound to minimise the loss : it could not unreasonably detain the wagons and claim demurrage. Even assuming that in view of the Colliery Control Order, the Railway could not sell the coal without the Coal Commissioner's sanction, it could have unloaded the coal from the wagons and put the wagons to use.
 After the wagons were unloaded the consignee could be liable only for wharfage. [363 H-364 C] On the facts in the present case the respondent Railway was entitled to demurrage for the detention of wagons for only one month.
