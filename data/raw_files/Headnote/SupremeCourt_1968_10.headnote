 The petitioners challenged an order of the State Government by which rules were promulgated for selection of candidates for admission to a medical course. These rules provided for reservations of seats for various categories of candidates, i.e. for he Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Castes, for 'socially and educationally backward classes', and for women; the remaining seats were placed in the general pool available to all. One rule provided for the appointment of a selection committee of not more than three persons to interview the candidates and another, Rule 8, provided that the, seats reserved in the general pool and for the 'socially and educationally backward classes' would be allocated among the various districts of the State on the basis of the ratio of the population of each District to the total population of the State. It was contended,, inter alia, on behalf of the petitioners that r. 8, in providing for district-wise distribution of the seats, violated Art.
 14 of the Constitution because such allocation of seats might result in candidates of inferior caliber being selected in one District and those of superior calibre not being selected in another District. Furthermore, the provision in the application form for the candidates as to "nativity claimed" was a camouflage for discrimination on the ground of place of birth and therefore violative of Art.
 15(1). It was also claimed that the reservation for 'socially and educationally backward classes' infringed Art.
 15(1) because it was made by reference to a list of such classes specified in another context and that this list was nothing but a list of certain castes; and that there was no objective test laid down in the Rules for interview and the question that were put were unrelated to s. 10(d) which lays down certain criteria for the purpose. On behalf of the respondent State it was contended that there were better educational 'facilities in Madras city as compared to/other districts and therefore if district-wise selection was not made candidates from Madras city would secure many more seats than was justified on the basis of the proportion of the population of Madras city; furthermore, candidates coming from various Distric's would settle down in those Districts and thus medical help would be available in sufficient measure in all the Districts.
 
HELD : Rule 8 providing for district-wise allocation was discriminatory and violative of Art. 14. The State had made out no case for such district-wise allocation and there was no nexus shown between such distribution and the object to be achieved, namely, admission of the best talent among the candidates. [794 E, F] The district-wise distribution on the basis of population was not justified even assuming that candidates from Madras city Would get a larger number 787 of seats in proportion to the population of the State.
 'Mat would happen because a candidate from Madras city was better. Even if the respondent's contentions were to be accepted that would only justify allocation of seats between the city of Madras on one side and the rest of the State on the other and not a district-wise allocation throughout.
 [793 G, H] There were no facts and figures given to suggest that candidates from a particular district would by and large settle down in that district. Furthermore, the provisions as to "nativity claimed" by candidates showed that candidates would have a number of districts to choose from depending upon where they thought that their chances were best and therefore the argument that district-wise allocation was justifiable on this ground had no merit. [794 D] If the reservation in question had been based only on caste and had not taken into account the social and educational backwardness of the caste in question, it would be violative of Art. 15(1). But a caste is also a class of citizens and if the caste as a whole is socially and educationally backward, reservation can be made in favour of such a caste on the ground that it is a socially and educationally backward class of citizens within the meaning of Art. 15(4).

 There was no substance in the argument that there was no test provided for marking. Rule 10(d) indicates what matters have to be taken into consideration for allotting marks provided under that rule. It would be difficult to provide any further guidance in the matter and the rest must be left to the selection committee. It cannot be held that the committee did not follow the criterion indicated in r. 10(d) in allotting the marks provided in that rule. [794 H-795 B]
