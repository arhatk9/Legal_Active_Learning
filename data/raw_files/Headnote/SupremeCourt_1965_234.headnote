 The Income Tax Officer, after deducting depreciation for the year and an amount in respect of losses, assessed the income of the assessee for 1952-53 as nil. He then computed the dividend income at Rs. 2,01,130 and determined the total income at this figure and levied tax on it. The assessee had in its favour unabsorbed depreciation relating to earlier year aggregating to Rs. 76,857 and contended that this amount should be deducted from the dividend income; but the Income Tax Officer rejected this contention and, in appeal, the Appellant Assistant Commissioner as well as the Tribunal upheld his view. The High Court, however, upon a.
 reference, decided the issue in favour of the assessee.
 In the appeal to this Court, it was also contended, inter alia, on behalf of the revenue that depreciation, although a permissible allowance under s. 1(K2) of -the Act, served to compensate an assessee for the capital loss suffered by him by way of depreciation of his assets and is a charge on the profits of a business; and that therefore the expression, "loss of profits and gains" in s. 24(1) did not include any deficiency resulting from depreciation and could not be included in the amount which, could be set off against income profits or gains under other heads such, as income from property or dividends.
 
HELD : The assessee was entitled to have the unabsorbed depreciation of past years set off against income from sources other than the business and therefore against the dividends. [450 B; 456 D] Case law reviewed.
