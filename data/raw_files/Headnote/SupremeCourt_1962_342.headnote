 The appellants' father was adjudicated an insolvent and the Official Receiver put up for sale the property belonging to the undivided family including the two-thirds share of the appellants. On February 1, 1943, the appellants instituted a suit for the partition of the joint family property impleading therein the respondent, the purchaser of the property, and claimed that on their father's adjudication only his share vested in the Official Receiver and that the latter had no right to sell their two-thirds share. The trial court accepted this contention and passed a preliminary decree for partition in favour of the appellants. The decree was confirmed by the High Court of Madras on November 18, 1946. On an application made by the appellants, a final decree was passed ex-parte on August 17, 1946, but it was set aside at the instance of the respondent. In the meantime s. 28A of the Provincial Insolvency Act, 1920, came into force in 1948, under which the disposing power of the father over the interest of his undivided sons also vested in the Official Receiver. By the first proviso to the section it was provided "that nothing in this section shall affect any transfer of the property of the insolvent by...... a Receiver .... made before the Commencement of the Provincial Insolvency (Amendment) Act, 1948, which has been the subject of a final decision by a competent court". The District Munsif held that the Amending Act did not affect the preliminary decree and restored the ex-parte final decree. The question was whether the preliminary decree for partition which was affirmed finally in second appeal by the High Court was a final decision within s. 28A of the Act.
 Held, that a preliminary decree passed, whether it is in a mortgage suit or a partition suit, is not a tentative decree but, 617 must, in so far as the matters dealt with by it are concerned, be regarded as embodying the final decision of the Court passing that decree within the meaning of the first proviso to s. 28A of the Provincial Insolvency Act, 1920.
 A final decision means a decision which would operate as res judicata between the parties if it is not sought to be modified or reversed by preferring an appeal or a revision or a review application as is permitted by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
