 The appellants were held guilty by the Sessions Court under Section 302 read with Section 149 I.P.C. plus some lesser offences; but the High Court softened both the convictions and sentences having regard to all but one.
 Hence the appeals by special leave, limited to sentence.
 Allowing in part, the Court, ^ 
 HELD: 1. Every error does not confer a visa into this Court lest the flood-gates of litigation should flow as an irresistible stream making the Supreme Court a superior High Court of appeal. Doing so, in exercise of this Court's D jurisdiction under Art. 136 of the Constitution, would condemn the court to functional futility and defeat the design of the founding fathers that ordinarily it shall operate as the nation's summit court deliberating and pronouncing upon issues of great moment and constitutional portent. [928 D-E] Constructive liability notwithstanding, the sentencing process will take note of the conspectus of circumstances including the absence of overt act, age and antecedents of the offender. It is wrong on principle to exclude such special circumstances like injuries found on the accused, in apportioning the sentence. [930 A-B] Rehabilitation of young offenders is basic to juvenile justice, which in turn, is a component of social justice.
 The penological purpose being to convert the offender into a non-offender, it will be a frustration of criminal justice, if young lads are walled in and caged in the hope that cruelty will correct. Further it is widely accepted by penologists that the sharp shock of the initial phase of a prison term is what hurts most and therefore, a long term may well be counterproductive and a shorter term sufficiently deterrent. [929 F, 930 B-C] Observation.
 [Unfortunately, despite repeated observations of this Court, the conscience of the State of Bihar has not been quickened into kindness towards children and its legislature has not found the mood or time to pass a Children Act. This is bad omen in the International Year of the Child and it is hoped that amidst the general tumult the children will not suffer from legislative neglect, Had there been a Children Act in the Bihar State like in most other States of the country, a compassionate trial process would have been statutorily mandatory and children could not be marched into regular criminal courts for trial and conviction, nor incarcerated with adult criminals with obvious debasement and subtle torture such as homosexual attacks.] [929 D-F] 928
