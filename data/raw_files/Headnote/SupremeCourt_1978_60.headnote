 Sub section (3) of Section 81 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 requires that every election petition shall be accompanied by as many copies thereof as there are respondents mentioned in the petition, and every such copy shall be attested by the petitioner under his own signature to be a true copy of the 'petition. Where the petition alleges any corrupt practice, the proviso to S. 83(1) of the Act requires that "the petition shall also be accompanied by an affidavit in the prescribed form in support of the allegation of such corrupt practice and the particulars thereof." The appellant, a rival candidate, challenged the election of the respondent to the Lok Sabha in the elections held on 19- 3-1977 from Kozhikode constituency under the Representation of the People Act, 1951 alleging corrupt practice. The election petition was duly signed and verified by the appellant and it was accompanied by the requisite affidavit in support of the allegations of corrupt practice and their particulars. : The election petition and the affidavit were tied together as one document. The signature of the appellant by way tit authentication appeared at the foot of the copy of the affidavit, but there was no such signature separately appended at the foot of the copy of the election petition. The respondent raised a preliminary objection against the maintain. ability of the election petition and contended that since the copy of the election petition was not attested by the appellant under,her own signature to be a true copy, there was non-compliance with section 81, sub section (3) and hence the petitioner was liable to be dismissed vide Section 86, sub section (1). The High Court accepted the contention and dismissed the petition.
 Allowing the appeal under section 116A of the Representation of the People Act. 1951, the Court.
 
HELD : (1) The election petition is in truth and reality one document consisting of two parts, one being the election petition proper and the other being the affidavit referred to in the proviso to section 83, sub-section (1). The context in Which the proviso occurs clearly suggests that the affidavit is intended to be regarded as part of the election petition Otherwise fit need not have been introduced in a section dealing with contents of an election petition nor figured as a proviso to a subsection which lays down what shall be the contents of in election petition.
 The copy of the election petition required to be filed under the first part of sub section (3) of Section 81, would, therefore,, on a fair reading of that provision along with section 83, include a copy of the affidavit [450 H, 451 A, H, 452 Al Sahodrabai Rai v. Ram Singh Aharwar, [1968] INSC 25; [1968] 3 SCR 13, applied.
 (2) The law does not require that the authenticating signature must be made by the petitioner at any particular place in the copy of the election petition. It may be at the top of the copy or in the middle or at the end. The place of signature is immaterial so long as it appears that it is intended to authenticate the copy. When original signature is made by the petitioner on the 447 copy of the election petition, it can safely be presumed that the signature is made by the petitioner by way of authenticating the copy to be a true copy of the election petition. In the instant case the requirement of the last part of sub-section (3) of section 81 was complied with by the appellant in as much as the copy of the election petition was authenticated to be a true copy by the appellant by placing her signature at the foot of the copy of the affidavit which formed part of the copy of the election petition.
