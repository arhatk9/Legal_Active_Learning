 Section 29 of the Madhya Bharat Abolition of Jagirs Act 28 of 1951 provided for appeals against orders of the Jagir Commissioner to the Board of Revenue. The appeal was to be filed within 90 days of the communication of the decision to the party concerned. The Act did not in terms contain any provision for exclusion of time taken in obtaining copies or for condonation of delay in filing the appeal. However under s. 30 of the Act the procedure under the Ryotwari Land Revenue and Tenancy Act, Samwat 2007 was made applicable to the proceedings. Section 34 of the said Ryotwari Act provided for extension and computation of the period of limitation and s. 149(2) theredf was in the following terms : "Excpt where it is otherwise provided" in the general principles of law of Limitation for the time being in force in the United State regarding extension of the principles of limitation shall apply to claims made under this Act before a Revenue officer".
 The appellant was a Sardar and Jagirdar in the erstwhile Gwalior State. His Jagir was resumed by the State on December 4, 1952 under the Madhya Bharat Abolition of Jagirs Act 1951. He received a memorandum from the Jagir Commissioner on February 23, 1958 regarding the compensation payable to him under s. 13 of the Act. On February 24, 1958 he applied to the Jagir Commissioner for a copy of the judgment as the memorandum supplied to him did not show how the compensation had been determined. The application was returned to the appellant on March 11, 1958 with an endorsement that the copy could be had on payment of fees.
 The very next day the appellant complied with the demand and a copy of a judgment was given to him on March 18, 1958.
 Tne appellant preferred his appeal to the Board of Revenue on June 2, 1958 but the Board dismissed it as time barred under s.29 of the Act. The High Court upheld the order of the Board. In appeal to this Court, 
HELD:The High Court was not right in upholding the order of the Board of Revenue which ignored the provisions of ss. 34 and 149(2) of the Ryotwari Act and the relevant provisions of the Limitation Act. [907 B-C] (i)Under s. 34 of the Ryotwari Act the Board must guide itself by the provisions of the Limitation Act in force for extension, and computation of the period of limitation. It would appear that s. 149(2) was aimed at giving a similar guide line to the Revenue Officer. To give the said interpretation to s. 149(2) it is necessary to read "extension of the principles of limitation" occurring therein as "extension of the period of limitation" for otherwise the section would be devoid of any meaning.
 902 The word 'principles' therein was inserted due to inept or careless drafting and what was meant was 'period' and not 'principles'. However, even if the statute is read as it stands the principle of the Limitation Act is not only to dismiss a suit, appeal or application if filed beyond time but also to extend the time for filing an appeal if the delay is explained. That principle was clearly capable of extension in the present case. [905 D; 906 E] (ii)The general principles of limitation are those contained in the Limitation Act of 1908 which was in force at the date when the present appeal was filed before the Board of Revenue. Sections 3, 4, 5 and 29(2) of the Limitation Act 1908 show that unless excluded by the Jagirs Act or Ryotwari Act, s. 12 of the Limitation Act would be applicable to appeals filed before the Board of Revenue under any of those Acts. [905 E; 906 C] (iii)In view of the applicability of ss. 34 and 149(2) of the Ryotwari Act to the case, the time spent in obtaining a copy of the judgment forming the basis or giving the reasons of the decision should have been excluded in computing the period of 90 days under s. 29 of the Jagirs Act. The appellant was not guilty of any laches. If there was any delay in filing the appeal the Board of Revenue 'should have considered whether in the circumstances of the case the same should have been condoned. The Board did not act judicially in throwing out the appeal. [906 F-907 B] Brijrajsingh v. The Board of Revenue and Another, Misc.
 Civil Case No. 22 of 1962 of the Madhya Pradesh High Court decided on 18-3-63, referred to.
