 The petitioner filed the present Habeas Corpus Petition challenging his detention. The petitioner also challenged the provisions of the Punjab Jail Manual which creates artificial discrimination between Indian and European prisoners in the matter of treatment and diet. The respondent contended that since the petitioner has been released the petition has become infructuous. The petitioner cited various authorities of this Court as well as of the Supreme Court of United States that where issues of great moment affecting liberty of the citizen are involved the decision should not be avoided even though the immediate prohibition' which led to the filing of the writ petition has for the time being disappeared.
 HELD : The Court would not decide the issue for two reasons.
 Firstly, the petitioner is no longer in prison, and, secondly, the Leamed Solicitor General assured the Court that he would draw attention of the Punjab Government to the need for revision of the impugned rules from the point of view of racial equality. The court hoped that the State Government would take up the reform of the law, eluminate the vice of inequality and update the regulations to be in keeping with the spirit and letter of the paramount law.
 [583D-E] Petition dismissed.
