 In proceedings under s. 207A(6) of the Code of Criminal Procedure the Magistrate discharged the accused after recording the evidence in the case. The High Court on revision set aside the order and directed the Magistrate to commit the accused to stand trial before the court of session. The Magistrate examined witnesses, held spot inspection. He did not stop to find out if there was evidence which, if believed, would establish, at least, a prima facie case, but went on further to disbelieve that evidence, by an elaborate and painstaking process of examination, in aid of which he brought to bear his own appraisal of inconsistencies, improbabilities etc.
 In short, he tried the whole case from one and to the other and established his point in a fairly elaborate order.
 ^ Held, that the jurisdiction conferred by sub- s. (6) of s. 207A, does not entitle the Magistrate to try the case on his own, and forestall the decision of the court of session. The order of discharge passed by him in the present case, therefore, was in excess of jurisdiction, and must be set aside.
