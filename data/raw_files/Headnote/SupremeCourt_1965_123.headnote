 In a suit for redemption of a mortgage filed by the respondents' predecessors on a_ mortgage executed by them in favour of the appellants' predecessors, a decree was passed directing the respondents' predecessors -to pay a certain sum within a specified time to the appellant's predecessors and recover possession of the mortgage property and in case of failure to pay within the specific time they shall be deemed to have lost the right of redemption for all time.
 According to the respondents the money was not paid; even so, the relationship between the parties continued to be that of the mortgagors and mortgagees. So the respondents filed an application-under the Bombay Agriculturists Debtors Relief Act for justice of the debt., The appellants also filed an application for adjustment of the debt due under the decree; but in doing so, they made it clear that they were making the application as a matter of precaution and without prejudice to their contentions that the equity of redemption had been extinguished and the parties no longer stood in the relationship of creditors and debtors. The trial court rejected the appellants' contention that the mortgage had been extinguished and held that the equity of redemption still vested in the respondents; but as the respondents' application was barred by time, it dismissed the respondents' application. On appeal, the District Court held, inter alia, that the decree was a composite decree and on the respondents' failure to pay the decrement amount within the time specified, their right lo redeem the mortgage was extinguished by virtue of the express terms contained in it, and dismissed the respondents' appeal. On revision under s. 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the High Court construed the decree as a preliminary decree and found that the clause purporting to extinguish the equity of redemption did not effect its essential character as a preliminary decree and did not in law out an end to the relationship of creditor and debtor between the parties. In appeal to this Court, the appellants contended that in reversing the conclusion of the District Court, the High Court exceeded its jurisdiction under s. 115 of the Code.
 HELD : This contention was well founded and must be upheld.
 [106H] While exercising its jurisdiction under s. 115 it is nut competent to the High Court to correct errors of fact however, gross they may be, or even errors of law, unless the said errors have relation to the jurisdiction of the court to try the dispute itself. The tests laid down in Clauses (a) (b) and (c) of s.. 115, before the High Court exercises its revisional jurisdiction, are, does the alleged misconstruction of the statutory provision have relation to the erroneous assumption of the jurisdiction; or the erroneous failure to exercise jurisdiction; or the exercise of jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity by the subordinate; court. It is well-settled that a plea of limitation or plan of 103.
 res judicata is a plea of law which concerns the jurisdiction of the court which tries the proceedings. A distinction must be drawn between errors committed by subordinate courts in deciding questions of law which have relation to, or are concerned with, questions of jurisdiction of the said court, and error of law which have no such relation or connection. It is undesirable and inexpedient to lay down general rule in regard to this position. [107 A-E; 108 D-E] Manindra Land and Building Corporation Ltd. v. Bhutnath Banerjee and Others, [1963] INSC 129; A.I.R. 1964 S.C. 1336 and Vora Abbasbhai Alinahomed V. Haji Gulamnabi Haji Safibhai, A.I.R.

 The construction of a document of title is no doubt a point of law. Even so, it cannot be held to justify the exercise of the High Courts' revisional jurisdiction under s. 115 of the Code because it has no relation to the jurisdiction of the Court. Like other matters which are relevant and material in determining the question of the adjustment of debts, the question about the existence of the debt has been left to the determination of the courts which are authorised to administer the provisions of the Act; and even in dealing with such questions, the trial court or District. Court commits an error of law, it cannot be said that, such an error of law would necessarily involve the question of the said court'-, jurisdiction within the meaning of s. 115 of the Code. [108H-109C] OBITER : When Legislature pass Acts dealing with socio- economic matters, or make provisions for the levy of sales- tax, it is realised that the operative provisions of such legislation present difficult problems of construction; and as sometimes, the Act in question provides for a revisional application to the High Court or authorises a reference to be made to it. In such cases, the High Court will undoubtedly deal with the problems raised by the construction of the relevant provisions in accordance with the extent of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the material provisions contained in the statute itself.
 Sometimes, however, no such specific provision is made, and the question raised in regard to the construction, of the provisions of such a statute reach the High Court under its general revisional jurisdiction under s. 115 of the Code.
 In this class of cases, the revisional jurisdiction of the High Court has to be exercised in accordance with the limits prescribed by the said section. [107 E-H]
