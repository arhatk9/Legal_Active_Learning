 An order for the detention of the petitioner was made under sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971 by the District Magistrate, Burdwan on July 3, 1972. A writ petition against that order was allowed by this Court by judgment dated April 19, 1973. In pursuance of this judgment the petitioner was released on April 28, 1973. Two days before the release of the petitioner the District Magistrate of Burdwan made a fresh detention order under s. 3 of the Act for the detention of the petitioner and based that order on the same grounds upon which the earlier order for the detention of the petitioner had been based.
 Allowing the petition tinder Art. 32 against the fresh order of detention, 
HELD : From the provisions of s. 14(2) of the Act it would follow that if an order for the detention of a person had been made under the Act and that order was either subsequently revoked or the period for which the detention order was made has expired, the said order would not stand in the way of, the making of a fresh order under section 3 of the Act against the same person provided, fresh facts arise after the date of the said revocation or expiry. If no fresh facts come into being after the date of revocation or expiry as may warrant the making of an order of detention. the requisite condition precedent to the making of the subsequent order would be non-existent and it would not be permissible to make a subsequent order of detention under section 3 of the Act.
 In the present case, perusal of the grounds of. detention made it manifest, that they related to incidents which took place at a time prior to the revocation of the earlier detention order dated, July 3. 1972. In fact they related, to incidents which took place prior to the making of that order. As such those incidents could not provide valid grounds for the making of the subsequent detention order dated April 26, 1973. [565 B-F] The impugment order was also violative of s. 13 of the Act which provides that the maximum period for which any person may be retained in pursuance of any detention order. which has been confirmed under s. 12. shall be 12 months from the date of detention. If for the same acts. repeated orders of detention can be made, the effect would he that for the same acts a detenu would be liable to be detained. for a period of more than 12 months. This would run counter to the whole scheme of the Act. [566A] Masood Alain v. Union of India, A.LR. 1973 S.C. 897, applied.
