 The appellants filed a suit for a declaration that the entry in the name of the respondent in the Jamabandi papers of certain villages was incorrect and alleged that they along with their brother, the husband of the respondent, constituted a joint Hindu family, that their brother died as a member of the joint Hindu family and thereafter his widow- the respondent--lived with the appellants who continued to be owners and possessors of the property in suit, the widow being entitled to maintenance only, and that by mistake the respondent's name was entered in village records in place of the deceased husband. The respondent contested the suit alleging, inter alia, that her husband did not constitute a joint Hindu family with the appellants at the time of his death and also that the suit was barred by time as she had become owner and possessor of the land in suit in 1925 on the death of her husband when the entries in her favour were made, and the suit was brought in 1951. The respondent had admitted in certain documents about the existence of the joint Hindu family or a joint Hindu family firm. The trial Court decreed the suit, which on appeal, the High Court set aside. The High Court did not use the admissions of respondent as she, when in the witness box, was riot confronted with those admissions; and as those documents, if read as a whole did not contain any admissions on behalf of the respondent that there was any joint family still in existence. In appeal by certificate to this Court.
 
HELD : (i) There is a strong presumption in favour of Hindu brothers constituting a joint family. It is for the person alleging severance of joint Hindu family to establish it.
 The mere fact of the mutation entry being made in favour of the respondent on the death of her husband was no clear indication that there was no joint Hindu family of the appellant, and the respondent's husband at the time of the latter's death. [610 E. F-G] (ii) Admissions have to be clear if they are to be used against the persons making them. Admissions are substantive evidence by themselves in view of ss. 17 and 21 of the Indian Evidence Act, though they are not conclusive proof of the matter admitted. The admissions duly proved or( admissible evidence irrespective of whether the party making them appear ad in witness box or not and whether that party when appearing as wines was confronted with those statements in case it made a statement contrary to those admissions.
 The purpose of contradicting the witness under s. 145 of the Evidence Act is very much different from the purpose of proving the admission. Admission is substantive evidence of the fact admitted while a previous statement used to contradict a witness does not become substantive evidence and merely serves the purpose of throwing doubt on the veracity of the witness. What weight is to be attached to in admission made by a party is a matter different from its use as admissible evidence.
 607 Therefore, the admissions of the respondent which had been duly proved could be used against her. They were proved long before she entered the witness box and it was for her to offer any explanation for making admissions. Her simple statement that her husband had separated from his brothers even before her marriage was, by itself, neither an adequate explanation of those admission nor a clear cut denial of the facts admitted. [615 F-616 C] (iii) The suit was clearly not barred by limitation.
 Admittedly the dispute between "he par-ties arose sometime in 1944. Prior to that there could be no reason for the respondent acting adversely to the interests of the appellants. It was really in about 1950 that she asserted her title by leasing certain properties and by transferring others, and in 1951 the appellants instituted the suit. [617 C-E]
