 The respondent who was an army officer was alleged to have committed certain offences under the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Corruption Act 1947. The offences were alleged to have been committed in the year 1962. The special judge, Gauhati charged him with these offences in the year 1967. The High Court quashed the charges on the ground inter alia that the procedure in s. 549(1) Cr. P.C.
 and the rules made thereunder had not been 'followed. The appellant in appeal by special leave to this Court contended that since more than three years had elapsed between the commission of the offences and the framing of the charges the court-martial had in view of s. 122(1) of the Army Act ceased to have jurisdiction to try the said offences and therefore s. 549(1) and 'the rules made thereunder were not attracted to the case.
 
HELD, Section 549(1) Cr. P.C. is designed to avoid the conflict of jurisdiction in respect of offences which are triable by both the ordinary criminal court and the court- martial. The clause "for which he is liable to be tried either by the court to which this code applies or by a courtmartial" qualifies the preceding clause "when any person is charged with an offence" in s. 549(1).
 Accordingly the phrase ','is liable to be tried either by a court to which this Code applies or a court-martial" imports. that the offence for which the accused is to be tried should be an offence of which cognizance can be taken by an ordinary criminal court as well as court-martial. The phrase is intended to refer to the initial jurisdiction of the two courts to take cognizance of the case and not to their jurisdiction to decide on merits. It was admitted that both the ordinary criminal court and the court-martial had concurrent jurisdiction with respect to the offences for which the respondent had been charged by the special judge.
 So s. 549 and the rules made thereunder were attracted to the case in hand. [1013H-1014C] Again, sub-section (3) of s.122 of the Army Act provides that while computing the period of three years specified in sub-section (1), any time spent by the accused as a prisoner of war or in enemy territory, or in evading arrest after the commission of the offence, shall be excluded. On a con- joint reading of sub-ss. (1) and (3) of s.122 it is evident that the court-martial and not the ordinary criminal court has got jurisdiction to decide the issue of limitation. If the court-martial finds that it cannot try the offence on account of the expiry of three years from the commission of the offence the Central Government can under s.127 of the Act sanction the trial of the offender by an ordinary criminal court. [1014D-F] 1011 Section 125 of the Army Act provides that when a criminal court and a court-martial have each jurisdiction in respect of an offence, it shall be in the discretion of the commanding officer to decide before which court the proceedings shall be instituted. Section 125 supports the view that the court-martial alone has jurisdiction to decide the issue as to limitation.
 [1014H] The word "jurisdiction" in s.125 really signifies the initial jurisdiction to take congnizance of a case. It refers to the stage at which proceedings are instituted in a court and not to the jurisdiction of the ordinary criminal court and the court-martial to decide the case on merits.
 Section 549(1) should be construed in the light of s.125 of the Army Act. Both the provisions have in mind the object of avoiding a collision between the ordinary criminal court and the court-martial. Both of them should receive the same construction. [1015B] It was an admitted fact that in the present case the procedure specified in rule 3 was not followed by the Special Judge, Gauhati before framing charges against the respondent. Section 549(1) Cr.P.C. and rule 3 are mandatory. Accordingly the charges framed 'by the Special Judge against the respondent could not survive. [1013C]
