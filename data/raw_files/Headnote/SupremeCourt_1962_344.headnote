 The assessee submitted his estimate of income for advance payment of tax under s. 18-A, in which he did not include his dividend income. The Income-tax Officer held that under s. 18-A(2) the assessee was bound to include in his estimate, and to pay advance super-tax, on his dividend income. Since that was not done and the advance tax paid was less than 800% of the tax determined on regular assessment, he levied penal interest under s. 18-A(6) in respect of the super-tax payable on the dividend income.
 The assessee contended (i) that the dividend income was income in respect of which provision was made under s. 18 for "deduction of income-tax at the time of payment" and as such s. 18-A was not applicable to it, and (ii) that since s. 18(5) was applicable to dividend income the penal provisions of s. 18-A(6) were not attracted.
 Held, (per Das, Kapur and Hidayatullah, jj., Sarkar and Dayal,JJ., dissenting) that s. 18(5) read with ss. 16(2) and 49-B provided for the deduction 'of income-tax at the time of payment" in respect of dividend income and therefore s.
 18.A did not apply to such income. A shareholder's right to the dividend arises upon its declaration. Under the leg,-Al fiction 669 introduced by s. 49-B, when dividend is paid to a shareholder 'by a company which is assessed to tax, the income-tax (but not super-tax) in respect of such dividend is deemed to have been paid by the shareholder himself and credit is given therefore to him under s. 18(5). If the shareholder was deemed to have paid the tax himself at the time when the company paid the dividend, the payment was "deduction of income-tax at the time of payment" within the meaning of s. 18-A(1).
 Per Sarkar and Dayal, JJ-The dividend income should have been included in the estimate of income and the penal interest was properly levied on the assessee. Dividend income is not one on which tax was deducted at the time of payment under s. 18. Payment of tax by the assessee, fictional or otherwise, on income received by him was not a deduction of tax under s. 18 by the person who paid the income to the assessee. for purposes of s. 18-A there had to be a deduction under s.18; deduction under other provisions was not relevant. Under s. 18(5) credit for the tax paid by the company was to be given to the shareholder not at the time of payment of the dividend but later at the time of assessment, Further, the provisions of s. 18-A(6 ) were applicable in respect of dividend income. The words "Income to which provisions of s. 18 do not apply" in s. 18,A(6) refer to that type of income in respect of which s. 18 provides for deduction of tax at the source and they do not include dividend income.
