 By incorporating s. 2-A in the All India Services Act, 1961 the Indian Forest Service was constituted as an All India Service. The Government of India made the Indian Forest Service (Cadre) Rules, 1966 and the Indian Forest Service (Recruitment) Rules, 1966. By Rule 3 of the Cadre Rules the Indian Forest Service was constituted for each State and was referred to as the State cadre. After the commencement of the Recruitment Rules the Central Government was enjoined under Rule 4(1) of the Recruitment Rules to recruit to the service any Person from amongst the members of State Forest Service adjudged suitable in accordance with such regulations as the Central Government may make in consultation with the State Government and the Union Public Service Commission. The Indian Forest Service (Fixation of Cadre Strength) Regulations, 1966 came into force with effect from October 1, 1966 and the Indian Forest Service (Initial Recruitment) Regulations, 1966 came into force on July 1, 1966. Regulation 4 of the Initial Recruitment Regulations,deals with conditions of eligibility for recruitment to the service while regulation 5 deals with preparation of lists of suitable officers. In accordance with there rules and regulations the initial constitution of the Service and recruitment thereto was made in July 1967 but this was immediately challenged. In A. K. Kraipak & Ors. etc. v. Union of India and Ors. this Court struck down the notification and the selections made were set aside.
 In a petition under article 32 of the Constitution the petitioner questioned the delegation under rule 4(1) to mike regulations which the Act did not authorise. He contended (1) that the initial recruitment must be made only from amongst those members who are in State Forest Service on the date when the selection was actually made and not on the date of initial constitution of the cadre; (2) that even if the selections were to be made from amongst the persons who were members of the State Forest Service as on the date of the initial recruitment confidential rolls of those persons which have to be considered should be those which have been written up to the time when selections were in fact made;
 (3) that the adjudgment of suitability on the basis of confidential entries and other record is arbitrary and consequently regulation 5 was invalid.
 On behalf of the State it was contended that the rules and regulations should be read as integrated rules regarding recruitment under s. 3 of the Act.
 Dismissing the petition .
 
HELD : There is no justification for the application of articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution to the facts and circumstance of this case. [443 B] (1)The contention is untenable and must be rejected. Rule 4(1) of the Recruitment Rules cannot be read without rule 3(1) be must be read together and the persons who were eligible to recruitment were those. Who on the date of the, constitution of the service were members of the State Forest Service and who conformed to the conditions of eligible set out in regulation 4. Rule 4(2) of the Recruitment Rules further hide it clear that after the recruitment under sub-rule (1) subsequent recruitment to the Service had to follow a different method which was prescribed under clauses (a), (aa) and (b) of that sub-rule. [443 D-E] The reason why October 1, 1955 was taken as the date for the initial constitution of the Indian Forest Service is that because under rule 3(a) of the Recruit- 433 ment Rules recruitment was to be made at the initial constitution of the service. Under regulation 6 of the initial recruitment Regulations the appointments have to be made in the State cadres and since the strength of the cadre in each State, was only fixed by the Fixation of Cadre Strength Regulations which came into force with effect from october 1, 1966, the initial constitution of the Indian Forest Service was as from October 1, 1966. In other words the persons who were to be appointed under regulations 6 of the Initial Recruitment Regulations were from those officers of the State Forest Service who, on the date of the constitution of the Service namely, October 1, 1966 were eligible for being selected. [442 C-D] If instead of considering the persons eligible as on the date of the constitution of the Service on October 1,1966, persons who on the date of their selection were in the State Forest Service alone have to be considered, then, there may be many people who, though not in service on the date of the constitution of service, will become eligible for being considered. The object of the initial recruitment to the Indian Forest Service from amongst those persons in service who on the date of the constitution of the service were members of the State Forest Service was to give advantage of a higher service to the members of the State Forest Service not only in respect of status but in respect of pay, pension, retirement, age and other service benefits which were not available to those under the conditions of service applicable to the State Forest Service. [442 G-H; 443_B] It could not be the purpose of the rules and regulations that initial recruitment not having taken place till after Kraipak's case was-decided any subsequent recruitment to the service under sub-rule (2) of rule 4 could not take place.
 [443 F] (2)There could be no justification to hold that suitability of a person has to be adjudged by reference to the confidentials written up after the initial constitution of the Service on October 1. 1966. If persons who were to be considered for initial recruitment were those who belonged to the service on the date of initial recruitment then the confidentials to be considered were only those pertaining to a period of prior to that date. If this were not so there would be discrimination because while the suitability of those in service on the date of initial recruitment bad to be considered as on the date of the actual selection, the suitability of those who were dead or retired could not be considered by reference to the confidentials of the later period. [444 D; B-C] The selection of persons to be appointed to the service as on the date of the initial constitution of the Service would be from amongst those who were then members of the State Forest Service notwithstanding the fact that due to litigation that selection was long delayed. [444 H] (3)The adjudgment of suitability of officers for selection had to be made according to some norms. In order to achieve this end various methods can be adopted. It is not for this Court to lay down which of the methods had to be adopted for adjudging suitability as long as the norms which had been adopted were correlated and relevant to the adjudgment of suitability of the officers to be recruited to the Service.
 Past performance of an officer being one of the criteria for making selection the only way to adjudge their suitability was by perusal of confidential records. [445 D; F; 446A] Often enough, the entries in confidential records are themselves an insignia of the capacity and capability of the maker as a superior officials as well as a commentary on the quality of the officer against whom that confidential remark is being made. it is not correct to say that the method of selection based on past performance as disclosed by the confidential records was not the proper method for adjudging suitability of the officer concerned. [446 D; E] R. L. Butail v. Union of India & Ors. [ 1 971] 2 S.C.R.
 55, referred to.
 The criteria laid down in the rules and regulations on the question of suitability provide sufficient indication as to the norms applicable for adjudging suitability, namely, the past performance of the officer as could be gleaned from the confidential and other records if they exist in respect of that officer. [417 D] 434 Though the regulations may not be called rule-, and they are purported to be made under rule 4(1) of the Recruitment Rules. in effect they were made under the, power conferred by s. 3 of the Act which uses the words 'regulations' and 'rules' as interchangeable words. "Rules" have been defined in s. 3(51) of the General Clauses Act to include regulations'. Both the rules and regulations were made by the same authority namely, the Central Government. They have also been placed before the Parliament under sub- section (2) of s. 3 of the Act thus fulfilling the condi- tions for the enforcement prescribed therein. [441 E-F] The State of Uttar Pradesh and Ors. V. Babu Ram Upadhya [1960] INSC 229; [1961] 2 S. C. R. 679 and Kailash Nath and Anr. v. State of U. P., A. I. R. 1957 S. C. 790 referred No question of delegation in rule 4 arises nor can the regulation be said to have been made in excess of the powers conferred by s. 3 of the Act, The provision for consultation with the Public Service Commission contained in rule 4(1) of the Recruitment Rules is not beyond the power of the rule making authority in as much as that provision complies with the constitutional requirement for consultation with the Public Service Commission. [441 H & G] Arguments for the Petitioner :
 The adjudgment of suitability made solely on the basis of confidential reports in the circumstances of this case had failed to afford equality of opportunity. The sole basis of adjudging suitability had been the confidential reports which had not been communicated to the officers concerned at the appropriate time as contemplated by the rules and, therefore, were irregular, defective and failed to afford opportunity to improve. The confidential reports are mere expressions and do not relate to particular incidents but adjudgment of suitability based on mere expressions could not be said to be the objective material. The rules did not lay down any criteria for adjudging the suitability. A proper selection presupposes that the criteria of selection were known before hand and were uniform. The absence of any such criteria renders rule 4 and regulation 5 arbitrary and violative of article 14 of the Constitution. Rules refer to the date of the constitution of service, namely, ist July, 1966 for a limited purpose. The purpose of the rule cannot be extended. If the recruitment to the service must be clearly on the basis of adjudging of the suitability for appointment as on the date of selection, then the qualifications and disqualifications must be as on that date. Whenever the selections' were held, there was no reason to exclude the period between 1st July, 1966 and the date of actual selection for considering the merit of the candidate.
 ArgumentS for the Respondent :
 The expression 'rule includes 'regulation' made under an Act by virtue of s. 3(51) of the General Clauses Act. Rules and regulations from one set of integrated 'rules regarding recruitment under s. 3 of the- Act. There was no question of delegation in rule 4. Under regulation 4 the eligibility is "as on the date of the constitution of the service." Under rule 4(1) of the Recruitment Rules the recruitment at the initial constitution had to be made as soon as possible after 1st July, 1966 when the recruitment regulations came into force. Appointments to State cadres had to be made with effect from 1st October, 1966 when the fixation of cadre strength regulations were made, The adjudgment of suitability on the basis of service record is not only a perfectly good test for the adjudgment of suitability for appointments in a service but is a perfectly good test for adjudgment of suitability of State officers for recruitment to Indian Forest Service at its initial constitution. For initial recruitment of the Indian Forest Service from among State Forest Service officers who have put in a number of years of service in the State Forest Service to make them eligible for recruitment at the initial constitution of the Indian Forest Service under regulation 4, service records of these officers regarding the work which they have already done throughout these years would be the only correct method of test for adjudging the suitability for recruitment to the Indian Forest Service at its initial constitution. Past performance is an established procedure for recruitment.
 Under regulation 4 the initial recruitment is to be made from the officers of the existing State Forest Service.
 Even if there was no guide-line regarding suitability laid down in regulation it follows that the suitability of officers would 435 have to be adjudged by their past performance which could be found only from their service record. Regulation 5(2)(a) and (b) clearly indicate that the service records would form the basis of suitability of the existing officers of the State Forest Service for recruitment to Indian Forest Service at its initial constitution. The procedure adopted by the Special Selection Board under regulation was to select officers on merit only as reflected in the overall assessment of the service records of the State Forest Officers.
