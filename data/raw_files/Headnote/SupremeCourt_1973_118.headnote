 (a) With respect to the offence under s. 5(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, the statutory presumption under s. 4(1) of the Act, against the accused, is not available.
 R. C. Mehta v. State of Punjab, A.I.R. 1971 S.C. 1420, referred to.
 (b) Under s. 5(1)(d) read with s. 5(2), the minimum sentence prescribed is one year RI and a sentence for a lesser period can be imposed for special reasons to be recorded in writing by the Court.
 In the present case, the appellant was convicted for offences under Ss. 5 ( 1) (d) and 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act and under s. 161. I.P.C. Sentence of imprisonment and fine were imposed for each of the offences, and the sentences of imprisonment were directed to run concurrently. The High Court in appeal, reduced the sentence to I year R.I. and maintained the line. The High Court and the trial Court relied on the statutory presumption.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) The offence was committed 7 years ago and criminal proceedings lasting for such a long time would by itself mean considerable harassment for an accused person.
 Therefore, it would not be fair or just to further prolong the proceedings by remanding the case to the trial Court, to examine the evidence afresh after ignoring the statutory presumption. [226E-F] (2) This Court also does not examine the evidence for itself in appeals under Art. 136 except when interests of justice so demand. In the instant case, the same facts constitute the offence under s. 161. I.P.C. to which the statutory presumption under s. 4(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act is admittedly applicable. There is thus no question of grave failure of justice or of a guilty person escaping justice, if this Court does not examine the evidence for determining the guilt of the appellant under Ss. 5(1) (d) and 5 (2) of the Act. [226B-C, F-G] (3) The question of sentence is always a difficult question requiring a proper adjustment of the reformatory, deterrent and punitive aspects of punishment. In the instant case, considering the facts that the appellant is going to lose his job and has to earn a living for himself and members of his family. the ends of justice would be met by imposing a fine instead of sending him back to jail (the appellant was on bail) after 7 years of agony and harassment of criminal proceedings.
