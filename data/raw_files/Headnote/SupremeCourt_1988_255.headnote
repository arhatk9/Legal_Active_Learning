 Section 2(h) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 contemplates sale price as the consideration for the sale of any goods, inclusive of any sum charged for anything done by the dealer in respect of the goods at the time of or before the delivery thereof, other than cost of freight or delivery and cash discount.
 The assessee carried on the business of mining and sale of silica sand. The sales tax authorities sought to levy tax on the packing charges that he had received from the purchasers. The Tribunal found that there was an implied agreement for sending silica in gunny bags, that the expenses on packing were incurred in order to put the goods in deliverable state prior to the delivery, that these expenses were rightly included in the sale price and hence exigible to tax.
 The High Court came to the conclusion that since the Tribunal had not recorded the finding that there was implied agreement to sell the gunny bags by the assessee to its customers, the packing charges were mentioned and not cost of gunny bags and since the price of goods and the packing charges were separately charged the said charges could not be included in the sale price paid by the purchasers to the assessee.
 Allowing the appeal by special leave, HELD : The High Court was in error in the view it took.
 [689B] Whether there is an implied agreement to sell packing material along with the product contained therein is a pure question of fact depending upon the circumstances of each case. In the instant case the Tribunal found that the packing in the gunny bags was done by the dealer in respect of the goods at the time of or before the delivery thereof, that it was done at the request of buyers as it was a PG NO 686 convenient mode of delivery and that the buyers had given directions for the quality of packing. In view of these facts found by the Tribunal, which must be taken to be conclusive, it could not be said that the parties did not intend to sell or buy the gunny bags. [687E-G] In view of the definition of s. 2(h) of the Act, anything which was integral part including any sum charged for anything done by the dealer in respect of the goods, may form part but anything supplied separately pursuant to a separate order, directions or specifications to the purchaser could not form part of the sale price. In the instant case the packing was done in order to putting the goods in deliverable state and incidental to the same. Such packing charges, therefore, could be included. The mere fact that price of silica was shown separately and the cost of packing was also shown separately makes no difference to the assessment of sales tax.
