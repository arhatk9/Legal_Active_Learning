 On information received that the house occupied by the appellant, was used as a brothel, the police laid a trap and recovered marked currency notes from the person of the appellant, and the decoy and a girt were found in a dishevelled condition in a room. Thereupon the appellant was charged under s. 3(1) of the Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women and Girls Act and was convicted under s.
 4(1) of the Act. He ,and the State appealed to the High.
 Court. The High Court dismissed the appellant's appeal,, but allowed the State's appeal by altering the conviction under s. 3(1) and enhancing his punishment as he was second offender. In appeal to this Court, the appellant contended that (i) the facts did not make out the offence under s.
 3(1) of the Act, and (ii) his present conviction could not be considered to be a second conviction under s. 3(1) of the Act as his previous conviction was under the Madras Suppression of Immoral Traffic Act, 1930.
 
HELD : (i) The appellant'& conviction under s. 3(1) of the Act was correct. The facts in this case justify the conclusion that the appellant was keeping a brothel at his house. One will be guilty of the offence under s. 3(1) of the Act if he does any of the acts mentioned in that sub- section in relation to a brothel. The girls were offered for the purpose of prostitution. The house was used for such purposes, undoubtedly for the gain of the appellant who pocketed the money for committing prostitution. Of course it can be presumed that the girls who were being offered for the purpose of prostitution, would also obtain monetary gain out of the amount paid. [587 H-588 B] It was not necessary that there should have been evidence of repeated visits by persons to the place for the purpose of prostitution. A single instance coupled with surrounding circumstances was sufficient to establish both that the place was being used as a brothel and that the person alleged was so keeping it. [588 E] (ii) The conviction of the appellant was a second conviction within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act. When the Act came into force in 1956, the corresponding provisions of the Madras Act stood repealed, by virtue of s. 25(1). By virtue of sub-s. (2) the conviction of the appellant under the Madras Act would be deemed to be in force at the time the conviction took place. [589 E]
