 Respondent No. 1, along with two others, was a candidate for one of the Iwo posts of lecturers in the government run medical colleges in the State. One of the important qualifications prescribed for the post was "teaching experience in a teaching institution." The respondent satisfied the other academic qualifications prescribed for the post. The State Government rejected the contention of respondent No. 1 that he had acquired the required teaching experience when he worked ill United Kingdom and was.
 therefore. entitled to be appointed as a lecturer. The High Court, in a writ petition under article 226 of the Constitution by respondent No. 1, quashed the decision of the Government and directed it to reconsider his case. The Government examined the case do novo and again found respondent No. 1 to be ineligible for the post. When the respondent went to the High Court in a second attempt impugning the decisions of the Government the High Court examined the Cabinet papers, and other reports and nothings of the officers, both technical and administrative, and quashed the decision of the Government. The appellant and the respondents appealed to this Court.
 It was contended on behalf of the State that the "teaching experience" in a "teaching institution" visualised by the regulations must be in India and not in a foreign country;
 that even assuming that the British Medical Institutions could come within the purview of the regulations. the post of Registrar held by respondent No. 1 had not been shown to carry 'teaching experience': that the hospitals and the Universities where respondent No. 1 worked were not proved to be teaching institutions and that the testimonials produced by the respondent were not reliable.
 Dismissing the appeals of the State 
HELD : (1)(a) The first respondent's case for the post has not been considered from the legal angle. The orders of appointment of the appellant in C.A. 1431 of 1974 were bad in law. The appellants in C.A. 1430 of 1974 are directed to consider de novo the appointments to the two posts of lecturers. Government will be free to consult technical authorities of its own before reaching a decision. The first respondent is at liberty to adduce materials to satisfy the State Government on his qualifications (or otherwise). [905G-A] (b) While the expressions 'medical institution, and approved institutions' are defined in s-2 of the Medical Council Act 1956, neither 'teaching experience' nor 'teaching institution' has been defined in the Act rules or regulations. It would be natural to expect any authority like the State Government to called upon to construe these words urged in the setting of a medical satute. If in doubt, to consult the Irish professional authority enjoying statutory status. namely, the Medical Council of India. [900E-F] In the instant case the State Government is said to have taken a policy decision not to consult Medical Council of India because on an earlier occasion the Medical Council had given a view once but modified it a little late,. Although there is nothing on the record to prove the allegations of the State, if it were true that national technical bodies were shaky on crucial occasion, they lend themselves to the suspicion that pressure pays. While the appointing authority is the State Government and the responsibility for final choice vests 895 in it, it is reasonable to consult bodies or authorities of high technical level when the points in dispute are of technical nature. [900 G-H] (c) Teaching institutions abroad not being ruled out, it is right to reckon as competent and qualitatively acceptable those institutions which are linked with or are recognised as teaching institutions by the Universities and Organisations in Schedule II and Schedule III and recognised by the Central Government under s.14. Teaching institutions as such may be too wide if extended all over the globe but viewed in the perspective of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 certainly they cover institutions expressly embraced by the provisions of the statute. If those institutions are good enough for the important purposes of ss. 12, 13 and 14 it is reasonable to infer they are good enough for the teaching experience gained therefrom being reckoned as satisfactory. [901 G-H] (d) The first respondent must make out that the institutions in which he worked fall within the species indicated above. Prima facie there is no reason to suspect that the testimonals produced by him are trumped up. Unless proved to the contrary they should be taken by a public authority acting bona fide, at their face value. [902 E] (e) From the certificates issued by Professors it is clear that the first respondent who worked as Registrar for three years did teach. There are six certificates on record which state that the first respondent had taken part in teaching work as Registrar. Unless serious circumstances militating against veracity exist fairminded administrators may, after expert constitutions, rely on them. [902 F-G] (f) While it is difficult to accept the contention that 'assisting' or 'participating' is different from 'actual teaching' it is not for, the Court to finally pronounce on it, the matter being essentially a technical one. These matters have to be decided by the appointing authority.[1903 B] (2) It was the duty of the Government to be satisfied on reasonable materials, that (a) the U.K. hospitals relied on by the 1st respondent are teaching institutions; (b) the posts of Registrar in which he worked for three years involved teaching functions, the question being looked at fairly, not by semantic hair splitting and quibbling on words like 'participating' in teaching; (el the testimonials or written testimony from any British or Indian Orthopedics. Professor will be taken at its face value except where grave Suspicion taints such documents, high placed academic men being assumed to be veracious in the absence of clear Contrary indications; (d) Indian experience. if any, of the 1st respondent will also be attention, provided it satisfied the dual tests contained in the regulations. In the instant case the State has made short shrift of the first respondent by preliminary screening. [904 H: 905 A-B] (3) When a writ of certiorari is moved the Court has the power to call for the record, but in cases where mala fides is not alleged or other special circumstances set out, sensitive materials in the possession of the Government may not routinely be sent for. The power of the Court is wide but will have to be exercised judicially and judiciously having regard to the totality of circumstances, including the impropriety of every disgruntled party getting an opportunity to pry into the file,; of government. Acts of public authorities must ordinarily be amenable to public scrutiny and not be hidden in suspicious secrecy. In this case the High Court need not have looked into the Cabinet papers and back records. [903 D-E] (4) Although the State need not always make a reasoned order of appointment, reasons relevant to the ruLes must animate the order.Moreover. an obligation to consider every qualified candidate is implicit in the'equal opportunity right enshrined in Arts. 14 and 16 of the Constitution.Screening a candidate out of consideration altogether is illegal if the applicant haseligibility under the regulations and for such a drastic step as refusal to evaluate comparatively that is, exclusion from the ring of a competitor manifest ground must appear on the record.
