 The appellant entered into a contract for the purchase of a large quantity of parachutes from the T. Company. The agreed purchase price was over Rs. 93 lacs and the assessee was required to deposit a sum of Rs. 10 lacs by way of earnest money. As he did not have enough funds, he entered into an arrangement with certain other persons whereby the amount of Rs. 10 lacs was to be deposited by therm and they were to receive a "net profit share of 9 annas in a rupee".
 The financiers later withdrew from the arrangement and the benefit of the contract for the purchase of parachutes was transferred to a firm for a sum of Rs. 3 lacs on November 30, 1946. A few days later another partnership took over the contract of purchase. The Income-tax Officer reopened the appellant's assessment for the assessment year 1947-48 on the ground that the income of Rs. 3 lacs had escaped assessment. After the appellant had failed in an appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, the Tribunal found that the appellant had in fact only received a sum of Rs.
 1,87,000/- and rejected his contention that this amount was in the nature of a premium for giving up his right to do business in parachutes and was, therefore in the nature of a capital receipt and not revenue. It held that the assessee had received profit in respect of a venture in the nature of trade. The High Court, upon a reference, upheld the view taken by the Tribunal.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that the agreement which he had entered into with the T. Company was a capital asset or a source of possible income and the transfer which was made, was not of the goods which were to be acquired under the contract but the source itself, namely the appellant's share, right, title and interest was transferred and furthermore the amount in question was received by the appellant for relinquishing his right to participate in the partnership which had been formed and from which he withdrew. It could not, therefore, partake of the character of a revenue receipt.
 
HELD : Dismissing the appeal, The Tribunal had rightly held that the appellant intended "to do and did a venture in the nature of trade". When the appellant agreed to accept a sum of Rs. 1,87,000/- in consideration for transferring the benefits of the contract, he could well be said to have concluded a deal which repre- sented the profit which he anticipated by acquiring the parachutes.
 The High Court had rightly found that the arrangement made by the appellant with certain parties to finance the transaction in return for a share of 9 annas in a 'rupee, was one which had been made between a person in need of money and certain financiers and that no partnership had come into force. Accordingly there could be no question of the appellant having relinquished a share in the partnership. [673 C] L10Sup./69-8 670
