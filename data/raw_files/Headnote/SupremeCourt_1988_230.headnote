 Certain areas in Punjab State were constituted as notified areas. An ares was declared a 'notified area by notification under s. 241 of the Act. The Government nominated members, issued the necessary enabling notifications under s. 242 and appointed a notified area committee consisting of certain persons. Later, the Government issued a notification under s. 244, cancelling the earlier notification under s. 241.
 Writ Petitions were filed in the High Court by the office-bearers of the notified area committees challenging the constitutional validity of s. 244. The challenge was sustained by the High Court; heading to the appeals in this Court.
 Before the High Court, bare proposition of law was urged that s. 244 violated Art. 14 of the Constitution for the reason that it gave an arbitrary and unduided power to the State Government to cancel a notification issued under s.
 241 without specifying/indicating the godliness or the principles on the basis of which such cancellation could be effected.
 Allowing the appeals, the Court, 
 HELD: The preliminary objection raised by the appellants to the locus standi of the members of the notified area committees to pursue the matter was not tenable. As a result of the notification, the rights of the members under the statute had been taken away, and they were entitled to come to the Court impugning the notifications which affected them. Merely because they had ceased to be members of the notified area committees, their locus standi to ventilate their grievance was not affected. [473D, G] PG NO 467 PG NO 468 Section 244, by itself, does not in express words spell out the circumstances in which a notification issued under s. 241 or an order under s. 242 may be cancelled or modified, but s. 244 should not be read or construed in isolation from the rest of the Chapter dealing with this subject-matter. The whole purpose of notifying areas under Chapter XIII of the Act is to grant a degree of self autonomy to an area which is comprised in a village. [477H;
 478A] As and when the economy of a particular area develops, the State Government should see to it that arrangement for its administration also improve and provide for more efficient local administration. [478G-H] The provisions that notified area will exercise only such powers as are entrusted to it by the State Government under s. 242 and that only such provisions of the Act as the State Government considers fit can be applicable to a notified area, show that the principal consideration was the economic and administrative viability of the particular unit to look after its own local affairs. If the area develops further and proves viable and self-sufficient economically and efficient administratively, it may be eventually converted into a municipal area. If the area is not financially solvent or is administratively weak, the status quo ante may have to be restored. [479B-C] Section 244 is intended as a power enabling the Government to go forward or backward in the process of this evolution depending upon the circumstances of each case. It may turn out that a particular area is not economically viable and the notification issued under s. 241 has to be cancelled. [279D] The situations, in which a cancellation or modification of a notification under s. 241 may be called for, will be numerous and impossible to be spelt out in a statutory provision. The power of cancellation or modification is not an arbitrary and unduided one but is one intended to be exercised in the light of the implementation of the notification in a particular local area having regard to the main principle and purpose behind s. 241. [279E-G] There are sufficient guidelines or indications available in the Statute as to the circumstances in which the power can be invoked. It could not be said to be a naked and arbitrary power. Section 244 contains sufficient guidelines to act thereunder and it was not possible to accept the plea that s. 244 itself was ultra vires and should be declared void.The provisions of s. 244 are valid. They could not be PG NO 469 said to be bad being violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. [481F-G] Gram Sabha Begowal v. State of Punjab and another, AIR 1981 P and H 101, approved.
