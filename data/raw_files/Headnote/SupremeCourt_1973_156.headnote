HELD : (1) At this stage, the Court is concerned only with one point, whether on facts alleged in the complaint, it could be said that the acts were done in purported exercise of his duties. Applying the test laid down in the decisions of the Federal Court and Supreme Court to acts complained of, viz., licking the complainant and abusing, cannot be said to have been done in the course of the performance of the duty by the second respondent. [561H] (2) The facts subsequently coming to light during the course of the judicial enquiry or during the course of the prosecution evidence at the trial may establish the necessity for sanction. It may be possible for the second respondent to,place the material on record during the course of the trial for showing what his duty was and also that the acts complained of were so inter-related with his official duty, so as to attract the protection afforded by sec. 197 of the Cr. P.C. Whether sanction is necessary or not may have to depend from stage to stage. [562D] Horiram Singh, [1939] F.C.R. 159, Bhagwan Prasad Srivastava v. N. P.
