 A criminal case registered by the police officer, Police Station Guru Har Sari, on the basis of F.I.R. filed by Avinash Chandra against Mohd. Sadiq and others for having caused the murder of one Balbir Singh was committed to the Court of Sessions. A cross objection was filed before in the court of Judicial Magistrate First Class, Ferozepore on 30th December 1974 by the respondent Kishore Singh, the brother of the deceased Balbir Singh containing a counter version of the occurrence mentioned in the case registered by the police. On receipt of the complaint, the Magistrate ordered the police to investigate the case u/s. 156(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code by his order dated 1-1-1975.
 The police submitted a final report on 8-3-1975 indicating that no case was made out against the accused. The court, after considering the report on 2nd April 1975, ordered that notice may be issued to the complainant to appear before him The statement of the complainant and his witnesses were recorded on 22nd May 1975. On 23rd May 1975, the Magistrate issued process against the accused and summoned them u/ss.
 304/149 and 148 of the Indian Penal Code. The accused- appellants moved the High Court for quashing the order of the Magistrate on the ground that the Magistrate having once ordered investigation u/s. 156(3) of the Code was not competent to revive the complaint and issue process against the accused. The High Court held that no case for quashing the order-of the Magistrate was made out inasmuch as the Magistrate had issued process against the accused after taking due cognizance of the case and applying his mind and recording the statement of the complainant.
 Dismissing the appeal by certificate, the Court, 
HELD : (1) The action taken by the Magistrate was fully supported in law and he did not commit any error in recording the statement of the complainant and the witnesses and thereafter issuing process against the appellants. [623- D] (2) The following legal propositions emerge on a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case :
 (i) That a Magistrate can order investigation u/s. 156(3) only at the pre- cognizance stage, that is to say, before taking cognizance u/s. 190, 200 and 204 and when a Magistrate decides to take cognizance under the provisions of Chapter 14, he is not entitled in law to order any investigation u/s. 156(3) though. in cases not falling within the proviso to s. 204, he can order investigation by the police which would be in the nature of any inquiry as contemplated by s. 202 of the Code.
 (ii) Where a Magistrate chooses to take cognizance, he can adopt any of the following alternatives :
 (a) He can peruse the complaint and if satisfied that there are sufficient grounds for proceeding he can straightaway issue process to the accused but before he does so, he must comply with the requirements of s. 200 and record the evidence of the complainant or his witnesses;
 (b) The Magistrate ran postpone the issue of process and direct an inquiry by himself;
 616 (c) The Magistrate can postpone the issue of process and direct an inquiry by any other person or an investigation by the police, (iii) In case the Magistrate after considering the statement of the complainant and the witnesses as a result of investigation and the inquiry ordered is not satisfied that there are sufficient grounds for proceeding, he can dismiss the complaint.
 (iv) Where a Magistrate orders investigation by the police before taking cognizance u/s.
 156(3) of the Code and receives the report thereupon, he can act on the report and discharge the accused or straightaway issue process against the Accused or apply his mind to the complaint filed before him and take action u/s. 190.
 The present case is clearly covered by proposition No. (iv).
 [623E-H, 624A-C] (3) There is no special charm or any magical formula in the expression "taking cognizance" which merely means judicial application of the mind of the Magistrate to the facts mentioned in the complaint with a view to taking further action. What s. 190 contemplates is that the Magistrate takes cognizance once he makes himself fully conscious and aware of the allegations made in the complaint and decides to examine or test the validity of the said allegations.
 The court prescribes several modes in which a complaint can be disposed of after taking cognizance. While a Magistrate can order the police to investigate the complaint it has no power to compel the police to submit a charge-sheet on a final report being submitted by Magistrate can either order reinvestigation or dispose of the complaint according to law. [619E-F, 620B] Abhinandan Jha & Ors. v. Dinesh Mishra [1967] INSC 110; [1967] 3 SCR 668, reiterated.
 Narayandas Bhagwandas Madhavdas v. The State of West Bengal [1959] INSC 72; [1960] 1 SCR 93 at 106; R. R. Chari V. State of Uttar Pradesh [1951] INSC 21; [1951] SCR 312 and Superintendent and Remembrancer of Legal Affairs, West Bengal v. Abani Kumar Banerjee AIR 1950 Cal. 437, referred to.
 (4) Sections 190 and 156 (3) are mutually exclusive and work in totally different spheres. The position is that even if a Magistrate receives a complaint u/s 190, he can act u/s 156(3) provided that he does not take cognizance Chapter 12 and Chapter 14 of the Criminal Procedure Code subserve two different purposes; one pre-cognizance action and the other post-cognizance action. While Chapter 14 containing s. 190 deals with post-cognizance stage, Chapter 12, so far as Magistrate is concerned, deals with pre- cognizance stage that is to say, once a Magistrate starts acting u/s. 190 and the provisions following, he cannot resort to s. 156(3). [620D-E, 622A] Devarpalli Lakshmnarayanan Reddy & Ors. v. V. Narayana Reddy 
 v. State of Assam & Anr AIR 1961 SC 986 and Jamuna Singh & Ors. v. Bhadai Sah [1964] SCR 37 at 41, referred to.
 (5) The provisions of s. 202 of the Code debar a Magistrate from directing investigation on a complaint where the offence charged is triable exclusively by the Court of Sessions. But the Magistrate's powers u/s. 156(3) of the Code to order investigation by the police have not been touched or affected by s. 202 because these powers are exercised even before cognizance is taken. Section 202 would apply only to cases where the Magistrate has taken cognizance and chooses to inquire into the complaint either himself or through any other agency. But there may be circumstances is in the present case where the Magistrate before taking cognizance of the case must himself chooses to order a pure and simple investigation u/s. 156(3) of the Code. Having done so, the Magistrate can proceed with the complaint according to the provisions of ss. 190, 200 and 204, of the code after receipt of the final report by the Police. There is absolutely no bar to such a course being adopted by the Magistrate. [620H, 621B-C] 617 (6) In the instant case;
 (a) as the allegations made against the accused made out a cub exclusively-triable by the Court of Sessions, the Magistrate was clearly debarred from ordering any investigation but he was not debarred from making any inquiry himself into the truth of the complaint.
 (i)) The Magistrate had not taken cognizance of the case and ordered investigation by the police u/s 156(3) before applying his mind to the complaint. This being the position, it was always open to the Magistrate to take coof the complaint and dispose it of-according to law,to say, according to provisions of ss.
