 The Third Respondent-Principal of the College by a public advertisement invited applications for admission to the Bachelor Degree Engineering Course in the Regional Engineering College in the State. The candidates seeking admission were required to appear at a joint entrance examination, those who qualified had to appear at a viva- voce test, and the selection was to be based on the combined performance in the written and viva-voce examination.
 The petitioners who applied and were admitted to the written test and on being qualified, were called for viva- voce test. In their writ petitions they challenged the manner, the method and the number of marks assigned for the viva-voce test. It was contended that the reservation of 15 marks for the viva-voce test conferred arbitrary, unguided and uncannalised power on those conducting the viva-voce test and that the reservation of 15 marks would have the pernicious tendency of affecting merit disclosed by the marks obtained at the written examination.
 The writ petition was contested on behalf of respondents 1,2 and 3 by submitting that in order to avoid any charge of arbitrariness being levelled against the Selection Committee, 15 marks assigned for viva-voce test were further split-up under four heads, viz. (i) Science-5 marks, (ii) General Knowledge-4 marks, (iii) Curricular Activities-3 marks and (iv) Personality test-3 marks, and that the Selection Committee prepared cards on each of which a question was typed referable to Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and General Knowledge and they were kept in 4 different boxes. When the candidate entered the room for interview, he was required to pick-up at random one card from each of the four boxes, each box containing 150 cards and answer the question. A tape-recorder was kept on the table in front of the members of the Selection Committee and the candidate appearing for the interview, and two-way dialogue was recorded in full. Marks were assigned under each head of viva-voce test depending upon the merit of the answer. Thereafter, the merit list was prepared on the basis of the total marks obtained at 408 he written and viva-voce tests.
 Dismissing the Writ Petitions & Transferred cases, ^ 
 HELD: Merit has been ascertained by the most scientific method that can be applied for selecting candidates on merit leaving no room for any arbitrary choice. The viva-voce test that was conducted was fair, free from the charge of arbitrariness, reasonable and just. [410 F] In the instant case, respondents Nos. 1 to 3 have practically set at naught some of the drawbacks and deficiencies pointed out in Ajay Hasia etc. v. Khalid Mujib Sehravardy & others etc. [1980] INSC 219; [1981] 2 SCR 79 in the manner of holding of oral interview and the marks assigned at it. The respondents in order to avoid any charge of arbitrariness reduced the marks assigned to the viva-voce test, prepared the questions in advance kept them ready in the boxes and the candidate had to pick-up his own question and answer it.
 The record of the answer was maintained in the Candidate's own voice. [410 G-411 E]
