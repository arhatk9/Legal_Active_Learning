 The only question involved in the appeal was whether the so-called Real Estate Division of the Company's textile undertaking Shree Sitaram Mills was a separate and distinct business and therefore the surplus lands did form part of the "assets in relation to the textile undertaking" within the meaning of sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Textile Undertakings (Taking Over of Management) Act, 1983. In dealing with the question, the Court referred to the history of the matter. The mill was established in 1875 under the management of Messrs Shapurji Broacha Mills Limited on a very large tract of land. The only real estate that it required in the later 19th century comprised of 1,05,008 square yards which undoubtedly was an asset of the textile undertaking although the actual mill precincts were spread over 50,749 square yards. Early in the 20th Century, it changed hands a few times and ultimately it was taken over by the Tantias in 1955 as a grey unit. As revealed from the Company's balance-sheets, since more than 7 years before the taking over the networth of the Company had been in the negative. In the early 70s, the Tantias due to spiral rise in land values in the Metropolitan City of Greater Bombay devised a plan to dispose of vacant lands appurtenant to the textile mill. Till the date of taking over, the Board of Directors were engaged in disposing of the Company's surplus lands for purposes of raising finance for the textile business. In the early 1978-79, the networth of the Company was minus Rs. 2.80 crores, in 1979-80 minus 3.54 crores, in 1980-81 minus Rs. 3.91 crores, in 1981-82 minus 6.56 crores and in 1982-83 minus 8.67 crores. Further, as a result of the general strike called on January 18, 1982 the 188 company further suffered financially along with other textile mills in Bombay. The mill not only had the deficit for so many years in the negative but the losses had been increasing at an alarming rate. The liabilities which stood at Rs. 3.08 crores by the end of March 31, 1980 rose to Rs.
 4.70 crores at the end of March, 1981 and to Rs. 8.67 crores by the end of March, 1983. All this showed that the mill stood in need of increasing financial assistance from commercial banks and governmental and public financial institutions on concessional rates for its resuscitation.
 After the textile strike had been called off, it became imperative to consider the overall economic situation of all the textile mills in Greater Bombay and also to consider as to what was the future outlook of such mills, particularly of those which were not in a position to recommence work due to financial constraints. On December 3, 1981, the Central Government appointed an Investigation Committee under section 15(a)(i) of the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951 to find out the cause for the fall in production of the Company's textile undertaking. The Investigation Committee submitted its report in February 11, 1983. In the meanwhile, the State Government of Maharashtra by an order dated March 25, 1982 declared the company's textile undertaking to be a relief undertaking. At a meeting called by the Reserve Bank on October 29, 1982, the textile mills affected by the strike were classified into three categories on a general consensus, namely, Category I: Units which were viable before the strike and continued to be as such; Category II: Units which were viable before the strike but whose viability might have been marginally affected by it; and Category III: Units which were bad/sick and whose position had further deteriorated because of the strike. In November 1982, the respondents' textile undertaking was placed in Category III.
 The Government of India accepted this categorisation.
 It was realised that none of the 13 mills falling under Category III could be expected to survive on a sound basis without financial assistance from the Government, Government controlled institutions and nationalised banks. The amount for rehabilitation of the aforesaid 13 mills was estimated to aggregate to Rs. 194.48 crores. It was expected that the disposal of surplus lands appurtenant to some of these mills 189 such as the respondents' textile undertaking Shree Sitaram Mills would largely help in raising the necessary working capital. The Industrial Development Bank of India expected that with this realisable asset it would be possible to make the respondents' textile undertaking viable over a period of 7 years subject to the condition that the Tantias disassociated themselves from the management. It was therefore clearly understood that the respondents' textile undertaking could be made viable only with the sale of surplus lands and the financial assistance from the Government.
 On September 20, 1983, the Government of India Ministry of Commerce, Department of Textiles constituted a Task Force to look into the affairs of the Category III strike-affected mills, including the respondents' textile undertaking Shree Sitaram Mills. The Task Force submitted its report on October 13, 1983 i.e. just on the eve of the promulgation of the Textile Undertakings (Taking Over of Management) Ordinance, 1983. The Task Force classified the mills falling in Category III into four groups. The respondents' textile undertaking was placed in Group II, namely, mills which were likely to be made viable with the sale of surplus lands with a rider added that a change in the management should also be brought about.
 The Government of India decided, as a matter of policy, that it was desirable to achieve the process of nationalisation in two stages - by first taking over the management of the textile undertakings and thereafter enact suitable legislation to nationalise the same. As the taking over the management was with a view to implement the decision to nationalise the said textile mills, there was no question of holding an inquiry either under the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951 or under the Sick Textile Undertakings (Taking Over of Management) Act, 1972.
 On October 18, 1983, the President of India promulgated the Textile Undertaking (Taking over of Management) Ordinance, 1983 whereby the management of 13 textile undertakings specified in the First Schedule vested in the Central Government under sub-section (1) of section 3. The Textile undertaking of the respondents Shree Sitaram Mills being one of the aforesaid 13 undertakings, also vested in the Central Government together with the surplus lands appurtenant 190 thereto. The Ordinance was later replaced by an Act of Parliament being Textile Undertakings (Taking Over of Management) Act, 1983 which by sub-section (2) of section I was brought into force with retrospective effect from October 18, 1983, the date of promulgation of the Ordinance.
 The object and purpose of the legislation, as reflected in the long title, was to provide for the taking over, in the public interest, of the management of the textile undertakings of the Companies specified in the First Schedule, pending nationalisation of such undertakings and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.
 The respondents' textile company Shree Sitaram Mills owing the textile mill filed a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution challenging the constitutional validity of sub-section (1) of section 3 of the Act as violative of Articles 14, 19(1)(g) and 300A. By the judgment under appeal, a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court upheld the constituional validity of the Act in so far as the taking over of the respondents' textile undertaking by the Central Government under sub-section (1) of section 3 of the Act was concerned, but held that the surplus lands which the respondents called the Real Estate Division was not an "asset in relation to the textile undertaking" within the meaning of sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Act and accordingly directed the restoration of the lands to the respondents.
 In appeal, the appellant contended that the surplus lands appurtenant to the textile undertaking which the respondents called as the Real Estate Division of the Company was not a separate or distinct business and therefore the lands did form part of the assets "in relation to the textile undertaking" within the meaning of sub- section (2) of section 3 of the Act.
 Allowing the appeals by certificate, the Court, ^ 
 HELD : 1.1 The words "assets in relation to the textile undertaking" used in sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Act have a very wide connotation. Function of sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Act is to amplify and define as to what is taken within the sweep of the term "textile undertaking" as defined in section 2(d), which says that the expression 191 "textile undertaking" shall be deemed to include all assets, rights, leaseholds, powers, authorities and privileges of the textile company in relation to the said textile undertaking. It does not stop at that but goes on to say that this would also include lands, buildings, workshops, projects, stores, spares, instruments, machinery, equipment, automobiles and other vehicles, goods under production and in transit, cash balances, reserve funds, investments and booklets and all other rights and interests in and arising out of such property as were before the appointed day, in the ownership, possession, power or control of the textile company whether within or outside India. It further includes all books of accounts, registers and all other documents of whatever nature relating thereto. The conclusion is therefore inescapable that all the assets of the company held in relation to the textile undertaking including the surplus lands appurtenant thereto, vest in the Central Government by reason of sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Act. [227 G-H; 228 A-D] 
 1.2 It is a well known rule of construction that in dealing with a beneficent piece of legislation, the Courts ought to adopt a construction which would subserve and carry out the purpose and object of the Act rather than defeat it.
 In interpreting such a piece of legislation, the Courts cannot adopt a doctrinaire or pedantic approach. In the instance case, the legislation was clearly in furtherance of the Directive principles of State policy in Article 39(b) and (c) of the Constitution. [223 A-C] 
 1.3 The Legislature intended to take over all the assets belonging to the company held in relation to the textile undertaking. The Note attached to the report of the Task Force includes the total lands belonging to the respondent company for the purpose of determining the value of the assets of the company and does not exclude the Real Estate Division. Even for determining the total compensation to be paid on nationalisation, the Task Force takes into account the total surplus lands of the company and does not exclude any land belonging to the socalled Real Estate Division. The viability study of the IDBI also heavily relied on the surplus lands held by the respondents' company. Surplus lands of the textile mills taken over under sub-section (I) of section 3 of the Act are but a vital physical resource capable of generating and 192 sustaining economic growth of the textile mills. There can be no doubt that the legislative intent and object of the impugned Act was to secure the socialisation of such surplus lands with a view to sustain the sick textile undertakings so that they could be properly utilised by the company for social good i.e. in resuscitating the dying textile undertakings. Hence a paradoxical situation should have been avoided by adding a narrow and pedantic construction of a provision like sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Act which provides for the consequences that ensue upon the taking over in public interest of the management of a textile undertaking under sub-section (1) thereof as a step towards nationalisation of such undertakings, which was clearly against the national interest.

 2.1 From the official record it is clear: (i) that there was in reality no such separate business as Real Estate Business carried on by the company. The company was borrowing money all the time and the proceeds of the sale of surplus lands and industrial galas were utilised to improve the liquidity to pay off the creditors; (ii) All the assets including the surplus lands appurtenant to the mill were assets of the company held for the benefit of the textile undertaking; (iii) at no point of time was there a segregation of the assets of the company for form the Real Estate Division, nor were there any bifurcation of the surplus lands and transfer of title to the lands; (iv) the so called Real Estate Division had no capital assets of its own; (v) the company was indebted to the tune of 6.80 crores and the liabilities were being met by the sale and development of lands, construction of industrial galas and the diversion of plot No.5 from the industrial zone to the residential zone. The proceeds were all ploughed back into the textile business to pay off the debts; and (vi) there was no separate account of the Real Estate Division and the respondents have not laid any real foundations on pleadings that the Real Estate business was separate and distinct from the textile business. It was in reality a scheme for conversion of capital. The activity of selling the surplus lands or the industrial galas constructed thereon had a direct nexus with, or clearly related to the carrying on of the textile business. [214 A-D; 218 B-C] 193
