 The appellant, a landlord of a large building, had leased out in separate portions his building to several tenants.
 One of such tenants is the respondent. The former resolved to start a business in automobile spares and claimed eviction of the respondent by Rent Control proceedings, under s. 10(3)(iii)(a) and (b) of the Andhra Pradesh Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act, 1960. The petition was resisted and the Rent Controller dismissed the petition. The appeal by the landlord failed but, in revision, the High Court chose to remand the case to the appellate authority. The appellate authority, after hearing parties, remitted the whole case to the trial Court for fresh disposal in accordance with certaindirections and, after allowing parties to lead evidence. Instead of finishing thecase at the trial Court level, the landlord preferred a revision to the High Courton the ground that a wholesale remittal, as against calling for a finding on a specific point, was illegal. The High Court held that if the fact of the landlordhaving come into possession during the pendency of the proceedings of Shop No. 2 is to be taken into account, then clearly the petition is no longer maintainable under section 10(3)(iii) of the Act. The inevitable sequel was the dismissal, not only of the civil revision, but also of the eviction petition.
 In this appeal by special leave, it was contended for the appellants : (i) It was illegal for the High Court to have taken cognisance of subsequent events; and (ii) Once the High Court held-as it did-that the appellate tribunal acted illegally in remiting the whole case to the Rent Controller, it could not go further to dismiss his whole eviction proceedings.
 Allowing the appeal partially, 
HELD : (i) For making the right or remedy, claimed by the party just and meaningful as also legally and factually in accord with the current realities, the court can, and in many cases must, take cautious cognisance of events Ind de- velopments subsequent to the institution of the proceeding provided the rupees of fairness to both sides are scrupulously obeyed. On both occassions, the High Court, in revision, correctly took this view. The later recovery of another accommodation by the landlord, during the pendency of the case, has as the High Court twice pointed out, a material bearing on the right to evict, in view of the inhibition written into s. 10(3) (iii) itself. The High Court was right in taking into consideration the facts which came into being subsequent to the commencement of the proceedings. [960 G-H] Lachmeshwar Prasad Shukul v. Keshwar Lal Chaudhuri [19401 F.C,R. 85; Patterson V. State of Alabama, [1935] USSC 78; 294 U.S. 600, 607 and Minnesota v. National Co. [1940] USSC 55; 309 U.S. 551, 555, referred to.
 (ii) It is unfair to drive parties to a new litigation of unknown duration and therefore, in the special circumstances of this case, it is directed that : (a) the revision before the High Court shall stand dismissed; (b) the Rent Controller will take note of the subsequent development disabling the landlord from seeking eviction on which there is already an adverse finding by the High Court; (c) the 959 landlord be allowed to amend his petition if he has a case for eviction on any other legally permissible ground; and (d) the parties be given fair and full opportunity to file additional pleadings and lead evidence thereon. But the subsequent event that the petitioner had come by a non- residential accommodation of his own in the same town having been found by the High Court, cannot be canvassed ever again. That finding of legal disability cannot be reopened.
