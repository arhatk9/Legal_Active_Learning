 The appellant is a firm which was doing business in mica. To negotiate for orders and to handle its other affairs the appellant engaged a company in Japan which is admitly a "non-resident" company. By agreement between the 597 two firms, during the years of account the amount of commission payable to the Japanese company was received by the appellant. But this amount could not be sent, due to the exchange control restrictions, to the Japanese company. The amount was kept under the instructions of the Japanese company in a separate account to be held on its behalf to be applied as instructed. Some of the amount was later paid to the Japanese company either directly or through others. Treating the appellant as 'statutory agent' of the Japanese company the Income-tax authorities assessed the appellant on the amount received for the two account years. The appeal to the Commissioner failed. But on further appeal the Tribunal ordered the cancellation of the assessment. The Commissioner of Income-tax obtained a reference to the High Court and the High Court answered the question "whether the aforesaid sum of Rs. 26,255- 0-0 and Rs. 11,272-0-0 being selling commission credited to the aforesaid non-resident company's account in the books of the assessee are chargeable in the hands of the assessee under s.
 4(1) (a) for the assessment years 1949-50 and 1950-51 ?" in favour of the Department. The assessee thereupon filed an appeal before the Supreme Court on a certificate granted by the High Court.
 The two main questions before the Supreme Court were whether the appellant was a 'statutory agent' for purposes of s. 43 and whether the income was received by Japanese company in 'the taxable territory'.
 ^ Held, that there was a business connection between the assessee and the Japanese company sufficient in law for treating the assessee as an agent for purposes of s. 43, and the appellant was rightly treated as a 'statutory agent'. Before the money was entered into the account in the name of the Japanese company and held on its behalf there might be a relation of debtor and creditor between the assessee and the Japanese Company; but after the money was credited in the books of account in the name of the Japanese company it belonged to it because it was held for and on behalf of that company and was at its disposal. Therefore the income was received in the taxable territory within the meaning of s. 4(1) (a) of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922.
 Held, further, that cls. (a) and (c) of s.
 4(1) can be read disjunctively and that it is not necessary that the income must not only be received in the taxable territories but also must accrue or arise in the taxable territories.
