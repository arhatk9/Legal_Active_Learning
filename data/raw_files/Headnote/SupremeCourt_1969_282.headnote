 The appellant was manufacturing cotton yarn of varying counts ranging from 20 to 32. In June, 1962 the government issued a notification which exempted from payment of excise duty cotton yarn of 17 counts or more but less than 35 counts, if cleared out of the factory in 'hanks'. In view of the notification the appellant objected to the demand of excise duty in respect of the single yarn produced by it and cleared out of the factory in coils during the period August 1962 to November 1962. During the pendency of the proceedings, in February 1963, by another notification an explanation was added to the effect that the term 'hank' meant 'hank' "which does not contain more than 768 metres of yarn in plain (straight) reel". The notification was given retrospective effect. After unsuccessfully contesting the demand in departmental proceedings the appellant moved the High Court to quash the demand. The High Court accepted the contention of the department that the word 'hank' has been used in the relevant notifications to convey a special meaning i.e. a circular loop or coil of cotton yarn 840 yards (768 metres) in length and held that the appellant was not entitled to the exemption granted under those notifications because, the, length of the cotton yarn in the 'hanks' cleared out of the appellant's factory was admittedly Much more than 850 yards. Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The explanation given in the notification dated February 1963 does not accord with the meaning given to the word 'hank' in commercial circles. Any coil of cotton yarn less than 768 metres in length according to that notification has also to be considered as a 'hank'. But according to the technical meaning acquired by the word 'hank' in commercial circles. the length of' the cotton yarn in the reel should be neither more nor less than 768 metres (840 yards). This notification makes it clear that when the government issued the notification dated June, 1962 it in- tended to give the word 'hank' the meaning 'a coil of yarn' and nothing more. Further, if the word 'hank' had been used in the way it was understood in commercial circles there was no point in giving retrospective effect to the explanation added by notification dated February 1963. [833 F-H ] (ii) The rule-making authority had not been vested with the power under the Central Excise and Salt Act to make rules with retrospective effect. Therefore, the retrospective effect purported to be given to the explanation was beyond the powers of the rule making authority. [834 D]
