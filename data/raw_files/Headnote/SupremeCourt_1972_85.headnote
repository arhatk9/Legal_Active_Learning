 The respondent, a member of the Indian Police Service, was borne oil the Jammu and Kashmir Cadre. The Commission set up under the Jammu and Kashmir Government Servants Prevention of Corruption (Commission) Act 1962, directed investigation into a complaint received by the Commission against the respondent. He challenged the jurisdiction of the Commission, and the High Court allowed the petition, holding tint the members of an All India Service, serving in a State, are governed by the All India Services Act, 1951 and the Rules made thereunder, and the Commission Act was not applicable to them.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, HELL) : Assuming that the Commission Act is, in pith and substance, a law with respect to corruption of Government servants, it is repugnant to the provisions of the All India Services Act and the All India Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1955, and hence, under Art. 254 as it existed when the Commission Act came into force (July, 16, 1962), the Commission Act must give way to the All India Services Act and the Rules made thereunder. [883 C.D. 887 B-C; 997 F] (a) The position when the Commission Act came into force was that Parliament could legislate on item 70, List I, dealing with 'Union Public Services ' All India Services and Union Public Service Commission, and )Vt. 254, as applicable to Jammu and Kashmir at that time provided that, if any Provision of a law made by the Legislature of a State is repugnant to any provision of a law made by Parliament which Parliament is competent to enact the law made by Parliament, whether passed before or after the law made by the Legislature of the State, shall prevail and the law made by the Legislature of the State shall, to ,the extent of repugnancy, be void. It therefore follows that if provision of the Commission Act is repugnant to a provision of the Discipline and Appeal Rules, 1955, then the law made by the State of Jammu and Kashmir must give way.

The State of Jammu and Kashmir,, [1959] supp. 2 S.C.R. 270, explained.
 (b) Repugnancy arises when (i) there is inconsistency in the actual terms of the Act enacted by Parliament and the impugned State Act, 882 or (ii) the law enacted by Parliament was intended to be a complete and exhaustive code, (or) (iii) the law enacted by Parliament was intended expressly or impliedly to cover the whole field.

 (c) It could be said a law enacted by Parliament was intended to cover the whole field, where by reason of the subject matter dealt with, and the method of dealing with it, and the nature and multiplicity of the regulations prescribed, Parliament had adopted a plan or scheme which would be hindered and obstructed if any additional regulations whatever ate prescribed upon the subject by any other authority, that is, if the subject is either touched or trenched upon by the State authority.

 (d) From the perusal of the provisions of the two statutory laws, namely, the All India Services (Discipline and Appeal Rules, 1955, and the Jammu and Kashmir Government Servants Prevention of Corruption (Commission) Act, 1962 it is impossible to escape the conclusion that the two cannot go together. The impugned Act provides for additional punishments not provided for in the Discipline and Appeal Rules; and in so far as the Commission Act deals with the infliction of disciplinary punishment it is repugnant to the Discipline and Appeal Rules. Parliament had occupied the field and given clear indication that the only manner in which any disciplinary action could been taken against the members of the All India Service, was under the All India Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules. [897 B-D] In so far as the Commission Act deals. with a preliminary enquiry for the purposes of enabling any prosecution to be launched it may be within the legislative competence of the Jammu and Kashmir State and not repugnant to the provisions of the Discipline and Appeal Rules. But as the provisions dealing with investigation for possible criminal prosecution are inextricably interwined with the provisions dealing with infliction of disciplinary punishment the whole Act must be read so as to leave the members of the All India Services outside its purview.
