 19 persons contested biennial elections to the Bihar Legislative Council for filling 11 vacancies. The appellant and respondents No. 1 to 10 were declared as the successful candidates. Election was held by the system of proportional representation by a single transferable vote. The votes were counted in accordance with the procedure prescribed in para 7 of the Conduct of Election Rules 1961, read with the relevant provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. The Returning Officer rejected 9 ballot papers and accepted 306. The Returning Officer by application of rule 6 fixed the minimum quota of votes sufficient to secure the return of a candidate at 2551. In first three rounds respondents 1 to 7 were declared elected. None of the candidates could be declared successful in the fourth round.
 In the fifth and 6th rounds respondents 8 and 9 were declared elected. In the seventh round, respondent No. 18 (Election Petitioner) was eliminated and in the last round, i.e. the 8th round, the appellant and respondent No. 10 were declared as the successful candidates.
 Respondent No. 18 filed an Election Petition in the High Court challenging the election of the successful candidates on the ground that the rejection of 3 ballot papers having first preference votes in its favour, the rejection of 2 ballot papers having first preference votes in favour of respondent No. 9 the illegal acceptance of one ballot paper having first preference vote in favour of respondent No. 8 and wrong counting of votes in the fourth round of counting had materially affected the result of the election. The Returning Officer had rejected one ballot paper on the ground that it contained merely a horizontal line, another on the ground that it had a faint mark and the third on the ground that the voter had scored through the fourth preference vote in favour of one candidate and had assigned it to another. Respondent No. 8 and some other respondents did not enter appearance in the High Court.
 Respondent No. 9 filed a written statement as well as recriminatory petition. He contended that the Returning Officer had wrongly rejected 2 ballot papers which contained first preference votes in his favour and one other ballot paper having a second preference vote in his favour. The appellant who was respondent No. 10 in the High Court contested the petition. The High Court with the consent of parties decided as preliminary issue whether the election petition was maintainable and whether the Returning Officer wrongly and illegally rejected the ballot papers and, if so, whether the result of the election had been materially affected. The High Court also held that the three disputed ballot papers did not contain any identification marks within the meaning of rule 73(2) (d) of Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 and, therefore, the Returning officer was in error in rejecting those ballot papers as invalid. It was not disputed before the High Court that if the 3 ballot papers that were wrongly rejected were not eliminated respondent No. 18 would have been declared elected.
 Consequently, the High Court recorded the finding that the election of the Election Petitioner was materially affected by the rejection of the ballot papers. The High Court also held that as a result of the illegal rejection of the three votes respondent No. 9 was required to trial behind until the sixth round and that but for the wrongful rejection respondent No. 9 would have been declared elected in the very first round. Special leave Petition filed by the Election Petition field by the Election Petitioner in this Court against the findings of the High Court on issues No.
 1, 2 and 3 was dismissed.
 92 Thereafter, the High Court proceeded with the election petition and tried the remaining issues. The votes were recounted by an Officer appointed by the court in the presence of parties and their counsel. A fair copy of the result sheet was thereafter prepared signed by all concerned in token of its correctness. The High Court consequently allowed the election petition, declared the election petitioner as elected and set aside the election of the appellant who had secured the smallest number of votes on recounting.
 It was contended by the appellants before this Court;
 Since respondent No. 8 had not filed the recriminatory petition he had disentided himself from claiming any benefit under the ballot papers which were initially rejected by the Returning Officer but which were accepted by the High Court as valid.
 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: Section 97 of the Representation of People Act, 1951 provides that when in election petition a declaration is sought that any candidate other than the returned candidate has been duly elected the returned candidate or any other party may give evidence to prove that the election of such candidate would have been void if he had been the returned candidate and a petition had been presented calling in question his election. The proviso to the said section provides that the returned candidate or such other party shall not be entitled to give such evidence unless he has within 40 days from the date of commencement of the trial given notice to the High Court of his intention to do so.
 Section 97 applies if a composite claim challenging the election of the returned candidate and for a declaration that some other candidate should be declared elected is made. The returned candidate in that case recriminates against the person in whose favour the declaration is claimed. The recriminatory plea of defence in one's own election is in truth and substance not so much a plea though that be its ultimate purpose and effect, as a plea of attack by which a successful candidate assumes the role of counter- petitioner and contends that the election of the candidate in whose favour the declaration is claimed would have been void if he had been the returned candidate and a petition had been presented calling his election in question. Since the election petitioner had asked for a composite relief the conditions necessary for attracting section 97 were undoubtedly present. The contention of the appellant was, however, altogether of a different kind. It was argued that respondent No. 8 cannot take advantage of the first preference votes cast in his favour without a recriminatory petition. This contention is outside the scope of s. 97, because in claiming the first preference vote respondent No.
 8 is not in any manner challenging the validity of any of the votes cast and counted in favour of the election petitioner or any step taken by or on behalf of the election petitioner in furtherance of his election. Respondent No. 8 made no contention and wanted to make none in regard to the claim of the election petitioner that he should be declared elected. There was no conflict of interest between the election petitioner and respondent No. 8 on the question whether the particular vote should be counted in favour of the latter. If the 3 ballot papers in question were valid they must be treated as valid for all purposes and, therefore, votes cast in favour of respondent No. 8 under those ballot papers must be counted in his favour.
