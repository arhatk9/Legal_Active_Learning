 It was contended on behalf of the Ex-Mysore Primary and Secondary School teachers that they had their age of retirement at 58 years and they were protected under the proviso to sub-section (7) of section 115 of the States Reorganisation Act. It was contended on behalf of the teachers of Ex-Municipal High Schools that their age of retirement which was applicable to the Municipal Blight School Teachers before the (late of take over N@@is 58 years, and therefore, they were protected Linder the agreements dated 30th April, 1971. The contention on behalf of the teachers of elementary ,schools which were under the management of local bodies and which were 329 taken over by the State Government that their age of retirement was 58 years before the schools were taken over by the State Government under the provisions of Karnataka Compulsory Primary Education (Amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1969 and their conditions would continue until other condition was made. The principal contention of the teachers of the Municipal and Taluk Development Board High Schools which were taken over by the State Government under written agreements made by the relevant local body was that the condition which was offered by the Government and accepted by these teachers "shall not be altered to their disadvantage" by' virtue of section 14(b) of the Mysore Compulsory Primary Education Act, 1969. One of their conditions of service before the schools were taken over by the State Government was the age of retirement of teachers at 58 years.
 Rejecting the contentions and dismissing the appeals 
HELD : (i) This Court has held that prescribing an age of superannuation does not amount to an action under Article 311 of the Constitution. Article 309 confers legislative power to provide conditions of service. The legislature can regulate conditions of service by law which can impair conditions or terms of service. It, therefore, follows that teachers who exercised the form of option were subject to change in the conditions of service under Rules framed under Article 309. There is no constitutional limitation to reduce the age of retirement. A Government servant enjoys the status of a Government servant. He cannot be removed and his services cannot be terminated except in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. Fixing ,in age of retirement does not amount to removal of termination.

Teachers of those schools became employees of the State Government. The provision contained in section 14(b) of the 1969 Act is a temporary and transitional provision which continues until other provision is made.
 The Legislature does not say until other provision is made because the legislature is always free to legislate. The words "until other provision is made" mean provision which can be made by the legislature or by the Governor or the executive. The words "until other provision is made" do not exclusively limit to legislate. If the legislature has occupied the field the Governor has co-equal power. The power of the Governor is co-extensive with the legislative power. [335 BCDH] B. S. Vadera v. Union of India & Ors. [1968] INSC 84; [1968] 3 S.C.R. 575, referred to.
 Section 14(b) of the 1969 Act is not a law regulating recruitment and conditions of service under Article 309.
 Assuming it is, Article 309 does not preclude the legislature from making provision prescribing conditions or recruitment and conditions of service by Rules. It is equally open to the legislature to provide that in certain conditions the Governor acting under the proviso may make appropriate rules. The power under the proviso is co- extensive with the power under the main part. [335F-H]
