 A general notice was issued on April 13, 1955 under s..
 19(1) 0 the Assam Agricultural Income Tax Act, 1939, for submission of the return for the assessment year 1955-56 for the purpose of agriculture income tax. The respondents filed a return on May 31, 1958 and April 7, 1959, the Agricultural Income-tax Officer made an assessment under s.
 20(1) of the Act and a notice of demand was issued under s.
 32 on April 13, 1959. The respondents thereafter filed writ petitions under Arts. 226 and 227 challenging the assessments for that year and the subsequent year primarily on the ground that no individual notice had been served on them under s. 19(2) and therefore there was no jurisdiction in the Agricultural Income-tax Officer to pass an order of assessment' under s. 20(1) of the Act; and furthermore an assessment under s. relating to escaped income was barred by limitation. The High Court allowed the petitions holding, inter alia, that as the income received in the year 1954-55 had not been assessed in the financial year 1955-56, it had escaped assessment and could be assessed to tax only under s. 30; and the assessment in the present case was invalid as it was made beyond three years from the expiry of the financial year in which the income was received.
 On appeal to this Court HELDE: On the admitted fact that a general notice under s.
 19(1) was published and that a return was filed by the respondents in respect 0 the assessment years in question, s. 30 did not become applicable at all Sub-section (3) of 's. 19 states in categorical terms that if any person has no furnished a return within the time allowed by or under subs. (1) subs. (2), he may furnish a return at any time before the assessment made and any return so made shall be deemed to be made in due time under the section. Where a voluntary return has been filed pursuant to general notice even after the expiry of the period mentioned in that notice the Income-tax Officer must proceed to assess the income by taking up that return. He cannot ignore that return and serve on the assessee notice under the provisions relating to escaped income such as s. 30 in the present case or s. 34 in the Income-tax Act. [701 G-H;
 70:2 E-F] The words "at any time" in subsection 3 of s. 19 of the Act be interpreted to mean that they are limited to the year of assessment. Section 19 is in pari materia with s. 22 of the Income-tax Act and the law which has been laid down by this Court while interpreting the provisions of that section must govern the construction of the provisions of s. 19 well.
