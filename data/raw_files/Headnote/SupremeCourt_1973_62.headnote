 The appellant company was a unit of the Engineering Industry in West Bengal having three factories in various parts of Calcutta. It was solely engaged in the production of brakes and signalling equipment for the railways. The Government of West Bengal declared the appellant to be a public utility service in exercise of power conferred by s. 2(c)(vi) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, and also an 'essential service' under the Defence of India Rules.. At the instance of the appellant company the Government of West Bengal referred to the Industrial Tribunal the question whether the nine unpaid festival holidays allowed by the company to its workmen in addition to paid festival and other holidays should be continued. The Tribunal, impressed by the fact that unpaid festival holidays had been enjoyed by the workmen for a long time gave its award in favour of the workmen.
 Allowing the company's appeal, 
HELD : The Tribunal was wholly oblivious of the present day conditions and the necessity for increased production, particularly, in the matter of utility companies and the companies that are producing goods for essential services like those carried on by the Indian Railways. This Court has observed on more than one occasion that it is generally accepted that there are too many public holidays in our country, and that when the need for industrial production is urgent and paramount, it may be advisable to reduce the number of such holidays in industrial concerns Indeed it cannot be disputed that a necessary step in the direction of increasing the country's productivity is the reduction of number of holidays.
 There was accordingly no reason or justification for unpaid holidays not being curtailed in the present case. All the conditions which were necessary had been satisfied and the appellant was carrying on the kind of work which requires efficiency and increased production [833E, 834A]
