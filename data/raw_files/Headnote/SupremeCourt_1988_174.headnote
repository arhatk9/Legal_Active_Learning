 The Central Government issued a Notification dated January 29, 1970 under the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957 authorising the levy and collection of royalty on limestone at Rs.1.25 per tonne. The Respondents filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging the Notification.
 The High Court struck down the impugned notification on the ground that the Central Govt. had enhanced the rate of royalty by virtue of the said notification in disregard of the statutory embargo embodied in clause (b) of the proviso to section 9(3) of the Act which prohibits enhancement more than once during any period of four years.
 The State of Rajasthan which was recovering royalty at the enhanced rates has filed these two appeals by special leave.
 Allowing the appeals partly, this Court, ^ 
 HELD:1.1 The only vice in the impugned Notification is that the enhancement was authorised nearly four months too soon in advance i.e. On January 29, 1970. The enhancement could have been made with impunity without violating proviso (b) to sub-section(3) of section 9 about four months later.
 The enhancement was therefore unenforceable only during this period of four months. The enhancement could have been lawfully made without any impediment on June 1, 1970. During this interregnum the Notification would have remained dormant. Under the circumstances the just and fair course to adopt is to issue a Writ restraining the State of Rajasthan from enforcing the enhance- 462 ment for the interregnum of about four months expiring on 31st May, 1970 instead of striking down the Notification in absolute terms for all times as has been done by the High Court. [469B-E] 
 1.2 The enhancement was merely premature and not void in the sense that the enhancement could have been lawfully enforced with effect from June 1, 1970 and could not have been made enforceable on the date of the issuance of the Notification on 29th January, 1970. Such a Notification in the eye of law, must be treated as dormant for the interregnum of about four months till it becomes enforceable on June 1, 1970 upon the commencement of the next four-year block. The enhancement was authorised by the Legislature.
 However, there was an embargo making it enforceable only once during the course of the four-year block. It would be taking a super-technical view to hold that a fresh Notification could have been issued on June 1, 1970 and that Notification issued on 29th January, 1970 should be quashed.

 2. The High Court was exercising high prerogative jurisdiction under Article 226 and could have moulded the relief in a just and fair manner as required by the demands of the situation. The High Court could well have proceeded on the premise that the enhancement made pursuant to the Notification dated January 29, 1970 was unenforceable for the four months preceding June 1, 1970 on which date the enhancement could have been lawfully enforced pursuant to the Notification. [467F-G] 
 3. The order of the High Court quashing the impugned Notification dated January 29, 1970 is set aside. In place thereof the State of Rajasthan is restrained from enforcing the impugned Notification till 31st May, 1970 with the clarification that the enhancement as per the said Notification authorising collection of levy at Rs.1.25 per tonne would be enforceable with effect from June 1, 1970 onwards. [469G-H] [This Court observed that such amount as remains to be recovered in the light of the present Judgment will have to be paid 463 by the Respondents on or before September 30, 1989, failing which the appellant will be entitled to recover the same from the Respondents.] [469G-H]
