 The first respondent entered into possession of the two disputed shops on 19th September 1966 with the express consent of the landlord and made an application to the Rent Control Officer for allotment of the shops to him. On 15th November 1966, the landlord, however, revoked his consent and informed the Rent Control Officer that the previous tenant had not vacated them. On 20th December 1966 the landlord intimated the Rent Control Officer that the two shops had fallen vacant. The appellant's application dated 21st January 1967 to the Rent Control Officer for allotment of the shops to him was granted. The first respondent applied for cancellation of the allotment order but that was rejected. Proceedings were taken under s. 7A of the U.P.
 Act (3 of 1947) to eject, the first respondent, who then instituted a suit for declaration that the order of allotment in favour of the appellant was illegal and ultra vires. The Addl. Munsif held that the order of allotment was illegal. On appeal the Small Cause Court held that in view of the intimation of the landlord under s. 7 (1) (a) of the Act the Rent Control Officer was obliged to )ass an order in favour of nominee of the landlord under rule 4 and as he did not pass the order within 30 days of intimation, the order of allotment in favour of the appellant was valid.
 On further appeal the High Court held that since the landlord did not intimate in writing to the Rent Control Officer about the vacancy within seven days after the accommodation became vacant the Rent Control Officer was not entitled to act under rule 4 of the Rules and, therefore, he committed an error of jurisdiction in making the order of allotment to the appellant. The suit was held to be maintainable.
 Under s. 7 (1) (a) the landlord is required to give notice in writing to the District Magistrate of the vacancy within seven days after the accommodation became vacant. Rule 4 states that if the landlord receives no notice from the Dis- trict Magistrate he may nominate a tenant and the District Magistrate shall allot the same to his nominee.
 Allowing the appeal in part and remitting the case to the Rent Control Officer, 
HELD : The High Court was right in holding that the order was ultra vires the power of Rent Control Officer and that the proceedings to evict the first respondent under s. 7 A were incompetent. Notice in writing within the time speci- fied in s. 7(1) (a) is a condition precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction under rule 4. The landlord could not, without complying with the provisions of s. 7(1)(a), claim that the Rent Control Officer shall allot the premises to his nominee. it is clear that the Rent Control Officer was wrong in thinking that rule 4 obliged him to allot the premises to the nominee of the landlord as he did not make the allotment within 30 days of the receipt of the notice.
 [61H; F-G] In the instant case the landlord did not give notice in writing about the vacancy within seven days after the accommodation became vacant.
