 The appellant, a teacher in a school in Bihar, was dismissed from service by the Managing Committee of the school on a charge of misappropriation of school fund. On appeal by him, the President of the Board of Secondary Education, set aside the order of dismissal and directed his reinstatement.
 The Managing Committee reinstated the appellant, but requested the President of the Board of Secondary Education to review the whole matter especially with regard to the payment for the period of suspension. The President, after reviewing the matter, modified his earlier order. The appellant, however, was not given any hearing before the review order.
 The appellant thereupon filed an application under Art. 226 and 227 of the Constitution in the High Court where it was contended that the President of the Board of Secondary Education, could not modify the earlier order without giving the petitioner an adequate opportunity of being heard. The High Court following an earlier Bench decision, in Liladhar Jha v. Board of Secondary Education, Patna, (1963) B.L.R.
 880, held the order of the President of the Board of Secondary Education directing payment of full salary etc., to be invalid. Having so held, the High Court proceeded to observe that the petitioner would gain nothing if it was further held that the subsequent review by the President was equally invalid on the ground that no opportunity was given to the appellant.
 On appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (i) On the facts and circumstances of this case, it was incumbent on the High Court to declare as invalid the review order of the President of the Board of Secondary Education without affording to the appellant any opportunity of being heard and also his order dated January 18, 1964.
 The impugned order of the High Court as also the order made by the President of the Board of Secondary Education dated February 25, 1961, along with his subsequent order dated January 18, 1964, should be set aside. [ 1047 F] (ii) -After setting aside these orders, the parties are relegated to the stage immediately prior to the order dated February 25, 1961, with the result that the President of the Board of Secondary Education, would now dispose of, in accordance with law, the request of the Managing Committee, to reconsider the order of April 22, 1960. If the Board deems it proper to reconsider that order, then, the appellant must be afforded a reasonable opportunity of hearing and of adequately representing big case.
