 The respondent is an Engineering concern owning sixty factories spread throughout India. In Bombay, it has a factory at Wadala and head office at Ballard Estate. There were four Industrial Disputes Awards in this company pertaining to the pay-scales and dearness allowance of the workmen. By the Award passed in reference No. IT 82 of 1950 pay-scales and fixed dearness allowance were introduced with effect from 1.7.50 with the consumer price index in Bombay at 312 points in 1950. In 1957 the index rose by 55 points and stood at 367 points as a consequence of which by an Award passed in reference IT No. 77 of 1958 dated 21st May, 1959 the slab system of dearness allowance was introduced with effect from 1.2.58. This Award was not challenged by the company at any time. By Award published on 30.12.65 in reference IT No.47 of 1964 at the instance of the labour marginal increase in the basic pay scales was provided mainly on the ground that the slab system was working satisfactorily. By an Award published on 7.7.77 in reference No. IT 42 of 1973 the clerical and subordinate staff in the head office were also given the slab system of D.A. It was categorically observed in this Award that there should not 485 be any disparity in the D.A. between the monthly rated factory staff and the head office staff.
 While the wage structure stood thus, the company gave notice of change for doing away with the slab system on 15.7.75 of D.A. in respect of head office staff and the monthly rated factory staff. The notice of change in respect of head office staff was not pressed since a Settlement was reached between the parties, in July 1976 whereunder the D.A. at consumer price index 1380 points was merged in the revised consolidated pay scale of different categories with effect from 1.9.75. Although in September, 1975, the consumer price index figure was 1270 points, it was taken notionally as 1380 for the purpose of merger, providing for review of consolidated pay scales if the consumer price index moved high. The notice of change in respect of monthly rated factory staff was, however, referred to adjudication.
 The Industrial Tribunal gave its Award on 27th October, 1980, holding that the employer was justified in seeking abolition of the slab system of D.A. and substituting it with the textile scale of D.A. affording 115 per cent neutralisation. The Tribunal held that the workmen should be paid D.A. at 115% of the revised textile rate in the same manner in which the daily rated workmen are paid their D.A.
 at the prevalent cost of living index in the month of November, 1980 or if such index number is not available at that time then at the index No. 1771-1780. While making this Award the Tribunal was conscious of the fact that the workmen were likely to lose quite a substantial amount of the D.A. but it was stated that it was inevitable when attempt was made to bring about uniformity and parity among the workmen of the same company working at the same place doing similar work. The Tribunal felt that if the parity scheme was to come into force either from the date of the demand or from the date of reference, another unfortunate happening would take place in that the workmen would be liable to refund a lot of amount excessively recovered by them as and by way of D.A. on account of slab system. The Tribunal therefore felt that it would be too harsh and unkind to such workmen and held that the Award would come into force prospectively with effect from 1.11.80 and observed that the reduction in the monthly emoluments of the workmen should be a gradual process so that they are able to bear the burden and can learn to adjust themselves with little less income month to month. It therefore, directed the reduction to be spread 486 over equally for a period of six months from 1.11.80. Hence the appeal by special leave.
 Allowing the appeal, the Court, ^ 
 HELD : 1. In a reference arising out of the notice of change given by a company under section 9A of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 the company should make available all evidence necessary to justify its stand for a change from the existing system. In the instant case, overlooking the circumstances under which reference was made such a burden was wrongly cast on the workmen to prove that a change in the system was not necessary. [496 B-C] 
 2.1 Normally it would be inadvisable for Tribunals and Courts to revise the wage structure of workmen to their prejudice when a dispute arises. However, Tribunals and Courts can take judicial notice of one fact; and that is that the wages of workmen, except in exceptionally rare cases, fall within the category of mere "subsisting wages", and as such tinkering with the wage structure of workmen cannot be permitted except under compelling circumstances.
 Employers have seldom displayed a cooperative attitude where wage structures of workmen are devised. They have never showed a willingness for the involvement of the labour with the capital so as to engender a participative labour capital relationship. Reckoning with this reality, the Courts and Tribunals have necessarily to keep their hands off from upsetting a wage structure that has satisfactorily worked for a long time. The sweat of the labour is never reflected in any balance sheet, although the latent force behind every successful industry is this sweat. With their present wage structure, the labour just exist. No one should try to deny them even this bare source of existence. [503 G-H; 504 A-C] Crown Aluminimum Works v. Their Workmen, [1958] S.C.R.

 2.2 The Supreme Court often times emphasised the need for a living wage to workmen instead of a subsisting wage.
 It is indeed a matter of concern and mortification that even today the aspirations of a living wage for workmen remain a mirage and a distant dream. Nothing short of a living wage can 487 be a fair wage. It should be the combined effort of all concerned including the Courts to extend to workmen a helping hand so that they get a living wage which would keep them to some extent at least free from want. Viewed against this background no case has been made out by the respondent in the instant case, for a change of the slab system of dearness allowance to the revised Textile rate of dearness allowance. [503 D-F] The slab system which has been approved by Tribunals and by Courts was available at the head office and for the daily rated workmen at Wadala upto the year 1976 and worked satisfactorily for over 17 years. In the absense of any demand from any region for the slab system, the applicability of well-settled principle of industry-cum- region, and the sound financial position of the company it cannot be said that if the slab system was introduced in all the factories it would result in the closing of the whole company itself. The question that it would work against the principle of parity and uniformity and that there would be a change of the subordinate staff getting more emoluments than their officers who might be recently employed does not arise. [496 C-E] 
 2.3 The theory of ceiling on the quantum of dearness allowance cannot be accepted since under the prevailing conditions there is no control over the prices of essential commodities and as such a ceiling would not give sufficient cushion when prices of essential commodities continuously rise.
