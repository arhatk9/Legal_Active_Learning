 The appellant filed a suit for breach of contract against the respondents on the Original Side of the Calcutta High Court. The first respondent was the United Arab Republic while the second respondent was one of its departments. The suit was filed without obtaining the consent of the Central Government under s. 86(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure, but the High Court granted leave to the appellant under cl.
 12 of the Letters Patent. The respondents entered appearance but claimed that leave under cl. 12 of the Letters Patent be cancelled and the plaint be rejected.
 Their contention was that the suit was incompetent inasmuch as the suit was in substance against the Ruler of the United Arab Republic and consent of the Central Government under s.
 86(1) was necessary before it was filed. They also urged that respondent no. 1 was a sovereign State and as such it enjoyed absolute immunity from being sued under the Rules of International Law adopted and applied by the municipal law of India. The trial court did not accept either of these contentions and passed a decree in favour of the appellant.
 The respondents appealed under the Letters Patent to the Division Bench of the High Court. The Division Bench agreed with the trial court that s. 86(1) wag not applicable to the appellant's suit because the said section referred to the Ruler of a foreign State and not to a foreign State as such.
 In This connection the High Court observed that only in the case of a monarchical State could the Ruler be taken to be identical with the State. However, on the alternative plea of the respondent based on immunity under International Law, the Division Bench differed from the trial court and decided in favour of the respondents. Consequently the appellant's plaint stood rejected. With certificate from 'the High Court the appellant came to this Court.
 
HELD : (i) As a matter of procedure it would not be permissible to draw a sharp distinction between the Ruler of a foreign State and a foreign State of which he is the Ruler. This is apparent from the fact that s. 87 provides that even when a Ruler of a State sues or is sued, the suit must be in the name of the State. It is also remarkable that though the heading of ss. 84-87B does not in terms refer to foreign States at all, s. 84 in terms empowers a foreign State to bring a suit in a competent court;
 obviously the Legislature did not think that the case of a foreign State would not be included under 'he heading of this group of sections. [328 A-D] (ii)Section 86 is a counterpart to s. 84. Whereas s. 84 confers a right on a foreign State to sue, s. 86(1) in substance imposes a liability on foreign States to be sued.
 The foreign State can sue, as laid down in the proviso to s.
 84 to enforce a private right vested in the Ruler of such State 320 or in any officer of such State in his public capacity. By 'private right' in this context is meant rights which can be enforced in the municipal courts of a foreign State as distinguished from a political or territorial rights which must be settled under International Law by agreement between States. As a counterpart, s. 86(1) proceeds to prescribe a limited liability against foreign States. The first limitation is that such a suit cannot be instituted except with the consent of the Central Government. The second limitation is that the Central Government shall not give consent unless it appears that the case falls under one or the other cls. (a) to (d) of s. 86(2). Having provided for this limited liability to be sued the Legislature has taken care to save Ruler of a foreign State from arrest, except with the consent of the Central Government and has directed that no decree shall be executed against the property of any such Ruler; that is the effect of s. 86(3). What is exempted here is the separate property of the Ruler himself and not the property of the Ruler as head of the State. [332 B-H] HajonManick v. Bur Sing, II Cal. 17, referred to.
 (iii)When s. 86(i) refers to a Ruler of a foreign State, it refers to the Rulerin relation to the said State, and means the person who is for the time being recognised by the Central Government to be the head of that State. In view of the definition of 'Ruler' in s. 87 (1) (b) it is difficult to accept the argument that the expression 'the Ruler of a foreign State under s. 86(1) can take in cases only of Rulers of foreign States which are governed by a monarchical form of Government. In view of the definition, when s. 86(1) refers to Rulers of foreign State, it refers to Rulers of all foreign States whatever be their form of Government whether monarchical or republican. [330 H-331 A] Besides, on principle, there is no reason why it should be assumed that the Code of Civil Procedure always made a distinction between Rulers of foreign States governed by monarchical form of Government and those which were governed by Republican form of Government. The Legislature which framed the relevant provisions of the Code was aware that there were several States in which the monarchical form of Government did not prevail. It could not have been the intention of the framers of the Code of Civil Procedure that monarchical States should be liable to be sued under s.
 86(1) subject to the consent of the Central Government in the municipal courts of India, whereas foreign States not so governed should fall outside s. 86(1) and thus be able to claim immunity under International Law. When s. 87(1) (b) was introduced in 1951 it must have been intended that the definition of 'Ruler' therein should include all heads of foreign States whatever their form of Government. [331 E-F] (iv)The effect of the provisions of s. 86(1) appears to be that it makes astatutory provision covering a field which would otherwise be coveredby the doctrine of immunity under International Law. Every sovereign State is competent to make its own laws in relation to the rights and liabilities of a foreign State to be sued within its own municipal courts. Just as an independent sovereign State may statutorily provide for its own rights and liabilities to sue and be sued, so can it provide for the rights and liabilities of foreign States to sue and be sued in its municipal courts. That being so it would be legitimate to hold that the effect of s. 86(1) is to modify to a certain extent the doctrine of immunity recognised by International Law. This section provides that foreign States can be sued within the municipal courts of India with the consent of the Central Government and when such consent is granted as required by s. 86(1), it would not be open to a foreign State to rely on the doctrine of immunity under International Law because the municipal courts in India would be 321 bound by the statutory provisions, such as those contained in the Code of Civil Procedure. [333 B-E] Chandulal Khushalji v. Awad Bin Umar Sultan Nawaz Jung Bahadur, I.L.R. 21 Dom. 351 referred to.
 (v)Section 86(1) thus applies to cases where suits are brought against Rulers of foreign States and foreign States fall within its scope whatever be their form of Government.
 The Section applied to the present suit, and the consent of the Central Government not having been obtained before it was filed, the suit was barred. [334 B-C] [in view of the decision that s. 86(1) barred the suit, the Court did not find it necessary to deal with the question whether the respondents were justified in claiming absolute immunity under International Law.] [334 C]
