 Under the Bihar and Orissa Mining Settlement Act, 1920 a Board called the Mines Board of Health may be established to provide for the control and sanitation of any area. The Board consists of members who are elected by mine owners, non-officials selected by the State Government and persons nominated by Government. The Chairman of the Board is appointed by the State Government from among the members of the Board. The Board is a body corporate. A fund called "The Mining Settlement Fund" is created consisting of sums charged by the Board under the Act from land-owners as also sums allotted from the State revenues as well as sums borrowed by the Board under the Local Authorities Loans Act, grants received from local Authorities, associations and private persons. The respondent was appointed by the Government as Chairman of the Jharia Mines Board of Health.
 The respondent was elected as a member of the State Assembly in the general elections. The election petition of the appellant (the unsuccessful candidate) against the respondent was dismissed by the High Court.
 On appeal to this Court it was argued that the respondent was disqualified,from standing for the election as he held an office of profit under the State Government.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) The mere fact that the respondent was appointed as Chairman of the Board by the Government Would not make him a person holding an office under the State Government.
 The fact that the Government and other local authorities might make grants to the Board did not mean that all the funds of the Board were Government funds or Government property. The provisions ' of the Act are enough to establish that the Board is a 'local authority' within the meaning of that expression as defined in cl. (31) of s. 3 of the General Clauses Act, 1897. [911 C; B] (2) In determining whether a person is holding an office of profit under the Government the tests laid down by this Court were (1) Whether the Government makes the appointment;
 (2) Whether the Government has the right to remove or dismiss the holder; (3) Whether the Government pays the remuneration; (4) What are the functions of the holder? Does he perform them for the Government, and (5) Does the Government exercise control over the performance of those functions? [911 G] In the instant case the Government did not pay remuneration to therespondent nor did he perform his functions for the Government. The office held by him was held under a local authority. The holding of an office of profit in it did not bring about a disqualification, even if the local authority be, under the control of the Government. The control exercised by the Government did not make the Board an organ of the Government nor did it make the respondent a person holding an office under the Government.

 (3) An allegation of corrupt practice being a serious one, leading not merely to the consequence of the election of the successful candidate being set aside, but also of his being disqualified to stand for election for a certain period, should be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Such proof is lacking in this case. [913 C]
