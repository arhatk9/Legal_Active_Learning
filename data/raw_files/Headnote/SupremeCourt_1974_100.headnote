 The accused was convicted for the offences of murder and attempt to commit rape. The evidence against him was purely circumstantial consisting of, (a) recovery of some petty ornaments belonging to the victim. (b) an extra judicial confession made by him to one of the prosecution witnesses.
 (c) his presence near the place of occurrence on the day of occurrence, and (d) injuries on the person of the accused.
 Allowing the appeal and acquitting the accused.
 HELD This Court does not normally in an appeal under Art.
 136 reappraise the evidence, but there are glaring infirmities in the prosecution evidence in the case.
 Circumstantial evidence in order to warrant conviction, should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused and when there is reasonable. doubt the accused is entitled to its benefit. [172 C; 171F] (a)No reliance could be placed upon the evidence that the deceased was wearing. the ornaments on the day of the occurrence and that those ornaments were removed from the person of the deceased by the accused because, (i) No mention of the ornaments not being found upon the body of the deceased was mentioned in the F.I.R. by her father and other witnesses who discovered her body. (ii) No mention was made in the inquest report prepared in broad daylight even though there is a specific column in the report relating to ornaments and clothes of the deceased, (iii) The nature of the crime shows that the crime is one of sex and not one for pecuniary gain, and (iv) It is extremely unlikely that the accused, who was a landowner, would carry way such petty ornaments to his house and keep them in his shirt pocket, and thus provide evidence of his complicity in the crime.
 [169G-H; 170A-D] (b)There is absolutely no reason why the accused, instead of surrendering himself to the, police, should go to the house of a prosecution witness, blurt out a confession before him, and ask him to take him to the police. Since the evidence as to whether the accused at all made a confession is unreliable and lacking in probability the question as to what value would have been attached to the confession if the evidence had been found to be reliable and trustworthy, need not be considered. The attempt by the investigating agency to introduce a false story regarding the removal of the ornaments and their recovery from the accused also affects the credibility of the evidence regarding the extra-judicial confession. Also, though the dead body was discovered according to prosecution at 11.30 p.m. even before, by 8.00 p.m., the father of the victim and the sarpanch were declaring that it was the accused who had committed the murder. It shows that body must have been recovered even by 8.00 p.m. [170E-G] (c)The fact that the accused was in his field at 1.00 p.m.
 and was walking away at a fast pace at sun set time would not necessarily point to the guilt of the accused especially when there is no evidence. (i) that no other persons were present in the field, and (ii) regarding the time at which the offence was committed. [171D] (d)Assuming that the explanation of the accused that the injuries on his person were caused by the police is not trustworthy. that circumstance though suspicious, would not be sufficient to warrant his conviction of a serious offence entailing death penalty. [171E-F] (e)The mere fact that the accused cut an indecent joke with sister-in-law of the victim 20 days before the occurrence could hardly be a valid basis for 166 suspicion, or in any case for a positive assertion. that it was the accused who had murdered the deceased.
