 In proceedings under s. 19(1) of the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Rights (Estates, Mahals, Alienated Lands) Act, 1950, on the application of the appellant, it was held by the Claims Officer that the debt due to P, the first respondent, was a secured debt despite the fact that a decree had been passed in respect of the debt. The Claims Officer asked P to file a statement of claim under s. 22 of the Act. Although the Board of Revenue held that the Claims Officer had no Jurisdiction to determine the nature of debt, P, by way of caution, filed a statement of claim under r.
 
22. The Claims Officer held it to be out of time and discharged the debt. On appeal by P the Commissioner held that although the Claims Officer had jurisdiction to decide on the nature of the debt, the debt was wrongly discharged by him as action under s. 22(1) had not been taken. The appellant thereupon filed a petition under Arts. 226 and 227 on the ground inter alia that the Commissioner had no jurisdiction to entertain and decide the appeal. The High Court summarily dismissed the petition. The appellants next applied for a certificate of fitness which was refused. The appellants came to this Court by special leave! and con- tended that the High Court had wrongly refused the certificate. The questions that came up for consideration were : (i) Whether the petition under Art. 226 in the High Court was a 'civil proceeding', (2) whether an appeal under Art. 133 lay only in a proceeding in the exercise of the appellate or ordinary civil jurisdiction of the High Court, and not the extraordinary original civil jurisdiction under Art. 226 and (3) whether the order of the High Court summarily dismissing the writ petition of the appellants was a final order.
 
HELD : (i) A proceeding under Art. 226 for a writ to bring up a proceeding for consideration is a 'civil proceeding' if the original proceeding concerned civil rights. [203 G] The dichotomy between civil and criminal proceedings made by the civil law jurists is apparently followed in Arts. 133 and 134 and any proceeding affecting civil i.e. private rights, which is not criminal in nature, is civil. [203 E] S. A,. L. Narayan Row & Anr. v. Ishwarlal Bhagwandas & Anr., [1965] INSC 137; A.I.R. 1965 S.C. 1818, [1966] 1 S.C.R. 190, relied on.
 In the present case the Claims Officer purported to exercise a jurisdiction under which he could order the discharge of a debt which means that the order affected the civil rights of the parties. The Commissioner's order reversing the order of the Claims Officer also affected the same civil rights. The proceedings before the revenue authorities were therefore 199 civil proceedings and those in the High Court must also be regarded as, of the same nature. [203 C-E] (ii) It is not permissible by reference to the history of appeals to the Privy Council under ss. 109 and 110 of the Civil Procedure Code to exclude from the scope of Art. 133 matters heard by the High Court in the exercise of extraordinary original civil jurisdiction. Article 133 Uses the widest possible language. The intention is not only to include all judgments, decrees and orders passed in the exercise of appellate and ordinary civil jurisdiction but other jurisdictions as well in which civil rights would come up before the High Court for decision. The drafters of the Constitution were aware that a new jurisdiction was being conferred on the High Courts under Art. 226 and that the new jurisdiction would often result. in decision affecting civil i.e. private rights, and the need to provide, for appeals to this Court against such decisions must have been obvious.
 The right of appeal is thus stated in general words in Arts.
 132 and 133 and no exception not mentioned in the articles can be implied. [204 D-G] (iii) A petition to the High Court invoking jurisdiction under Art. 226 is a proceeding quite independent of the original controversy. A decision in the exercise of this jurisdiction whether interfering with the proceedings impugned or declining to do so is a final decision in so far as the High Court is concerned if the effect is to terminate the controversy before it. [206 C-D] In the present case the High Court by summarily dismissing the appellants' writ petition upheld the jurisdiction of the Commissioner to make the order he did and the fact that the High Court's order was not a speaking order made no difference. The High Court's order had the affect of once again reviving the debt in question. The order must be regarded as final for the purpose of appeal to this Court.
