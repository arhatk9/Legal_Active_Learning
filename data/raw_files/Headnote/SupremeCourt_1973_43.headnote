 The assessee was registered as a dealer under the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, at Ghaziabad. For the relevant assessment years, be was assessed by the Tax Officer at Ghaziabad. The Sales Tax Officer, Ghaziabad, subsequently came to know that the assessee had misused some of the 'C' Forms and, therefore, issued a penalty notice u/s 10-A of the Act on January 8, 1960. During the pendency of the penalty proceedings, the assessee transferred his registration to Lucknow.The Sales Tax Officer, Ghaziabad imposed the penalty on the assessee for the misuse of Form 'C'. At the instance of the assessee, the Revisional Authority under the Statute referred three questions of law to High Court under section 11(1) of the U.P. Sales Tax Act, the principal question being whether the Sales Tax Officer, Ghaziabad, had jurisdiction to impose penalty when the registration was transferred to Lucknow. The High Court answered the question against the State.
 On appeals by special leave, allowing the appeals, 
HELD,: Prima facie, the Sales Tax Officer, Ghaziabad was competent to levy the penalty on the assessee. Section 10-A definitely says that the authority who granted the certificate of registration to an assessee is one of the authorities competent to levy penalty. Undoubtedly the Sales Tax Officer, Ghaziabad, was the authority who granted the certificate of 'registration to the assessee and that certificate was in force during the relevant assessment years. Even though after 28-3-1960, the date of ,transfer of registration, he ceased to be the authority competent to grant certificate of registration to the assesses he still had the competence to levy penalty on the assessee in view of the fact, that it was he who had granted certificate of registration to the assessee. The levy of penalty is One of levying tax. If the Sales-tax Officer was competent to levy sales-tax on the assessee in respect of the relevant assessment years, he was equally competent to levy penalty on the assessee in respect of the offences committed during these years.
