 In proceedings pursuant to a notice under s. 34 of the Income-tax Act 1922 , the Additional Income-tax Officer passed an order to the effect that the income should be taken in the assessment on a second return for the same year pending before the Principal Income-tax Officer, for which there was another file and that the case was, therefore, "filed".
 The Principal Officer, after issuing a notice under s. 34, passed an assessment order, but in an appeal against that order, he himself pointed out that he had no jurisdiction to make the order. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner therefore set aside the assessment order. The Commissioner thereafter transferred the case from the Additional Officer to the Principal Officer. The latter then issued another notice to the under s. 34 and in pursuance of that notice passed an assessment order.
 The assessee appealed against this order to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner on the grounds, that (i) the notice under S. 34 of the Principal Officer was invalid because the proceedings instituted on the first notice by the Additional Officer were still pending; and (ii) if the first notice of the Additional Officer was still effective, the assessment made was barred by time. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner accepted these contentions and allowed the appeal but the Tribunal reversed this decision. The High Court, on a 'reference held in favour of the assessee.
 On appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (i) In the circumstances of the case the word "filed" in the order of the Additional Officer was equivalent to "disposed of", so that after that order no proceedings on the basis of his notice remained pending. What the Additional Officer intended and did, in effect, was to terminate the proceedings before him without making any order of assessment on the ground that the order of assessment in respect of the income in question would be made by the Principal Officer in the proceedings before him.

 Even if the order of the Additional Officer were to be regarded as invalid, its effect could not be that the proceedings before him must be held to have continued after that order was made by him. Even an invalid order terminating proceedings has the effect of terminating them;
 and in such a case the appropriate method for correcting the illegality committed is to have that order vacated by appellate or other higher authorities having jurisdiction to intervene. [692 E-F] The High Court erred in holding that the proceedings on the notice issued by the Additional Officer were pending on the view that unless there was a case pending, there could be no transfer of a case under s. 5(7A). The word "case" in s.
 5(7A) is used in a comprehensive sense including both pending proceedings as well as proceedings to be instituted in future. [693 B-D] (ii)The order of assessment was not barred by time. The notice having been validly issued by the Principal Officer within the period of eight years prescribed by s. 34(3), the actual order of assessment could be made validly before the expiry of one year from the date of the notice.
