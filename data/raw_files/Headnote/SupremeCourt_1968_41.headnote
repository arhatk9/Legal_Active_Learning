 The appellants were transport operators plying a 'stake carriage on an inter-State route 28 miles long of which a portion of 5 miles is situated in the State of Andhra Pradesh and the rest in the State of Mysore. A draft scheme was prepared and published by the second respondent Mysore State Road Transport Corporation under s. 68-C of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, proposing to take over the Stage Carriage Services on the route to the complete exclusion of other operators. After objections against the scheme had been heard by the Chief Minister of the State of Mysore under s. 68-B of the Act, the draft scheme was approved by his order dated March 7, 1964 with two modifications whereby, firstly, it specified the minimum number of vehicles and daily services and, secondly, it restricted the exclusion of other operators only to that part of the route which was in the State of Mysore. The approval of the Central Government was accorded to the scheme under the proviso to s. 68-D(3) of the Motor Vehicles Act and the final scheme was published by the Mysore Government in its Gazette dated July 16, 1964.
 The appellants challenged the notification of the Mysore Government approving the final scheme by a writ petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution but the petition was dismissed by the High Court.
 It was contended on behalf of the appellants (i) that the provisions of s. 20 of the Road Transport Corporations Act, 1950, were not complied with and the final scheme published by the first respondent was ultra vires; (ii) that whereas in the draft scheme the maximum number of vehicles and daily services were specified and not the minimum number, the final scheme provided the maximum number of vehicles as 18 and the minimum as one, and the maximum number of daily services as 10 and the minimum as 3; it was contended that by permitting such a great disparity between the maximum and minimum number of vehicles and daily services there was a virtual modification of the draft scheme and therefore, the procedure prescribed by s. 68-E of the Motor Vehicles Act should have been followed; and (iii) that the approved scheme violated Art. 14 of the Constitution as there was a complete exclusion of the private operators on the portion of the route located in the Mysore State while permitting those who were plying their vehicles on the portion of the route lying in the State of Andhra Pradesh.
 
HELD : dismissing the appeal 199 (i) Even assuming that the requirements of s. 20 of the Road Transport Corporations Act should also be followed in a case where the Central Government has given its sanction under s.
 68-D of the Motor Vehicles Act, it must be held that there had been sufficient compliance with the requirements of the Road Transport Corporations Act in the present case. It was not disputed that the concurrence of the Stale of Andhra Pradesh was secured for the final scheme and the Government of the State of Mysore had also accorded its approval to it.
 In these circumstances the omission of the first respondent to make the scheme in the precise manner in which s. 20 of the Road Transport Corporation Act directs the preparation of the scheme was a mere irregularity which could not lead to the nullification of the final scheme. [203 H-204 B] (ii) In the present case the distance of the rout in question was a short distance of 28 miles, and the order of the Chief Minister shows that there was seasonal variation of traffic density and during marriage and other seasons it was necessary to operate extra services. There was also variation on account of auspicious and inauspicious days.
 It was felt by the Chief Minister that the scheme would have to be sufficiently flexible to enable adjustment of services and vehicles to cater for the actual traffic needs. In the context of the particular facts of the case the gap between the minimum and maximum number of vehicles and services was not so great as to amount to a fraud on s. 68-C and 68-E of the Motor Vehicles Act.

 (iii) It is manifest that operators plying in the State of Mysore and those plying in the State of Andhra Pradesh constitute two different classes of persons and therefore no question of discrimination can arise if there is complete exclusion of the operators within the State of Mysore and if there is relaxation with regard to those operating in the State of Andhra Pradesh.
