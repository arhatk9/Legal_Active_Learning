 The representation of the appellant, detenu through his counsel who is a member of Parliament was not considered by the Advisory Board constituted under the COFEPOSA, 1974.
 The High Court of Delhi refused to quash the detention and dismissed the writ petition.
 Allowing the appeal by special leave, the court.
 
HELD : In matters where the liberty of the subject is concerned and a highly cherished right is involved, the representations made by the detenu should be construed liberally and not technically so as to frustrate or defeat the concept of liberty which is engrained in article 21 of the Constitution. [401 H, 402 A] In the instant case : (i) as the representation has not been considered at all by the government which it was duty bound to consider, that by itself vitiates the order of detention.
 (ii) The representation clearly recites that Mr. Jethmalani acted not as a member of the Parliament but on instructions from his client, namely the detenu. The counsel had no personal matter and be was only advocating the cause of his client. The High Court was in error in construing the representation made by the petitioner as having been made not by him but by his counsel. [401 G-H, 402 A]
