 Nine persons including the two appellants were tried for the murder of Gas well as attempting to murder P.W. 9. Four of the nine accused were acquitted by the trial court and the others were convicted under several provisions of the Indian Penal Code. In appeal the High Court disbelieved the witnesses speaking to the attack on G and acquitted all the appellants before it in respect of the murder of G. It also came to the conclusion that it was not proved that there was any unlawful assembly. Even in the matter of the attack on P.W. 9 the High Court came to the conclusion that as there was no proof of previous concert on the part of the assailants no aid could be taken from s. 34. Therefore it commuted the conviction of appellant No. 1 for causing injury to P.W. 9 from one under s. 307 read with s. 34 I.P.C. to one under s. 326 I.P.C. The conviction of appellant No. 2 was converted from s. 307 I.P.C. read with s 311 I.P.C. to one under s. 324 I.P.C. Against this decision the present appeal was brought by special leave. The question for consideration was whether the conviction of the appellant on the sole testimony of P.W. 9 was justifiedfled when even the two witnesses who tried to corroborate P.W. 9 were disbelieved by the High Court.
 
HELD:(i) This Court ordinarily does not reappreciate the evidence unless it is satisfied that exceptional and special circumstances exist for doing so. The Court must be satisfied that as a result of serious misappreciation of the evidence by the trial court and the High Court substantial and grave injustice has been done. Even it the final hearing only those points can be urged which are fit to be urged at the preliminary stage when the leave to appeal is asked for. [794F-H] Hem Raj v. State of Ajmer, [1964] S.C.R. 1133, relied on.
 (ii)It was fully established that P.W. 9 was injured at about the time and the place mentioned in the charge. The incident had taken place when there was still day light.
 The appellants were well known to the injured so that there could be no difficulty in identifying them. P.W. 9 was not shown to have had any motive to falsely implicate the appellants. He had mentioned the names of the appellants- as the assailants at the earliest opportunity. His version was corroborated by medical evidence and was a probable one.
 The fact that the High Court had disbelieved the two wit- nesses who sought to corroborate P.W. 9 or that there were certain minor contradictions and embellishments in his statement could not detract from the value of his testimony.
 Both the trial court and the High Court had accepted his testimony. There was no reason for this Court to differ from them. The appeal must accordingly fail. [795A-B] 793
