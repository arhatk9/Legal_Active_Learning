 Plaintiff (Respondent No. 1 herein) filed a suit seeking ejectment from his house of his tenant C on the ground of personal need. Defendant C contended that the landlord did not require the premise, bonafide. The Munsif, Ajmer, decreed the suit. In appeal the District Judge held that the landlord did not require the premises reasonably and bonafide and allowing the appeal, dismissed the suit. The landlord filed an appeal in the Rajasthan High Court.
 During the pendency of the appeal C died and thereafter the appeal was contested by his heirs. The High Court in second appeal held (i) that it was not necessary to go into the question of bonafide and reasonable necessity of' the landlord as that was only a protection provided to the statutory tenant personally under s. 13 of the Rajasthan Premises (Control and Eviction) Act, 1950; (ii) that the tenancy of C having been duly terminated by notice there was no bar to the passing of the decree. In appeal by C's legal representatives, to this Court, the questions that fell for consideration were : (i) whether the High Court should have remanded the case for determination of the question whether the contractual tenancy had been terminated; (ii) whether the protection afforded by the 1950 Act to the statutory tenant was personal to such tenant or was also available to heirs and legal representatives, (iii) whether the heirs of the tenant were tenants within the definition of that term in s. 3 (vii) of the Act.
 Dismissing the appeal.
 
HELD : (i) The landlord had alleged in the suit that by a notice dated 26-6-1972 served upon the tenant, the tenancy had been duly terminated. This was not denied in the written statement nor was an issue demanded at the time of the trial. The High Court had after hearing both sides come to the conclusion that the contractual tenancy had been duly terminated by a notice. In these circumstances there was no substance in the submission that the High Court should have remanded the case.[852H] (ii) It is now settled that after the termination of the contractual tenancy the statutory tenant has only a personal right to continue in Po&session till evicted in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The contention based on the ground of bonafide requirement by the landlord was personal to the statutory tenant and on his death the same is not open to legal representatives unless there is anything in the provision of the Act which makes the legal representatives statutory tenants to the same extent as the deceased. it was not the case of the appellants in the present case that there was anything in the provisions of the Act which gives protection to the legal representative of the deceased statutory tenant.[853H; 855F] Annidlyas (Private) Ltd. v. Anandji Kalyanji Pedhi & Or.
 [1963] INSC 189; [1964] 4 S.C.R, 892. 908 applied.
 851 (iii) The contention that since the rent in the present case was payable by the heirs and it was in fact paid during the pendency of the proceedings they were tenants within the definition could not be accepted. Rent was however not payable by the legal representatives, and if the rent was paid by them during the course of the proceedings it was not because they were recognised as tenants by the landlord but because the amount was received by him, without prejudice to his rights under the orders of the court. Therefore the heirs and legal representatives of the deceased C could not in their own right claim' to be a 'tenant' within the meaning of the Act. The only contentions which they could put forward were the contentions appropriate to their representative character and not one which was personal to the deceased. [855B-E]
