 The appellant was an electricity supply company. The dispute between the appellant and its workmen relating to the bonus payable for the year 1960-61 was referred to the Industrial Tribunal. The case ,of the appellant was that after allowing for prior charges no available surplus was left for the payment of bonus. The Tribunal however, computed the available surplus at Rs. 1,29,248 and out of this awarded three months' bonus amounting to Rs. 730,00 to the workmen. In appeal to this court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that the Tribunal was in error in disallowing (a) depreciation on account of double shift, (b) income-tax, (c) return on working capital, (c) amounts required for rehabilitation, (e) contingency reserve and (f)development reserve, the latter two of which were statutory reserves which the undertaking had to provide under the schedule to the Electricity Supply Act 1948. Inter alia the appellant contended that since the Evidence Act as a whole was not applicable to industrial proceedings certain documents such as balance sheet should have been accepted by the Tribunal without formal proof.
 
HELD: (i) In earlier cases decided by this Court in which the Full Bench formula of the Labour Appellate Tribunal had been considered by this Court with reference to Electricity Undertakings and other wise, the following principles were laid down for the purpose of working out the available surplus: (1) first gross profits have to be ascertained and for that purpose balance-sheet and the profit and losses count as required under the Companies Act have to be looked into. If the entries are contested they have to be proved like any other contested fact; (2) The relevant year for which bonus is claimed is a self sufficient unit and the appropriate accounts have to be made on the notional basis in respect of the said year; (3) The ascertainment of depreciation is according to the Income-tax Act and what is allowed as a prior charge is the annual notional normal depreciation and not the actual depreciation which is in fact allowed. Apart from the notional normal depreciation the depreciation allowable under Income-tax Act for multiple shift is also allowable; (4) In calculating the income-tax for deduction as a prior charge it is not the notional normal depreciation alone that has to be deducted but the statutory -depreciation namely the concessions given under the Income-tax Act to the employers which would include the depreciation for multiple shifts, if -any, and thereafter the income-tax 242 will have to be calculated; (5) Return on paid up capital allowable for deduction from the gross profits is 6%; a slightly higher percentage may be allowed in risk undertakings like plantations; (b) In regard to return on working capital, if it is, shown that the reserves were available and were actually used as working capital, whether the reserves utilised were depreciation reserves or any other, a return from 2% to 4% is allowable according to the industry, taking into consideration any special circumstances which may justify a claim for a higher interest; (7) Rehabilitation reserve has to be provided for in order to keep the original capital of the business intact. It is necessary in the interest of labour as well as capital to Provide for depreciation of the assets yearly and also to provide for rise of prices. For the determination of this receive it is suggested that the undertaking be first divided into blocks such as 'plant and machinery' on the one band and other assets like Road, Buildings, Railways, sidings etc. on the other. Then the cost of these separate blocks has to be ascertained and their probable future life has to be estimated. Once this estimate is made it becomes possible to anticipate approximately the year when the plant or machinery will require replacement; and it is the probable price of such replacement on a future date that decides the amount to which the employer is entitled by way of replacement cost.
 The claim for rehabilitation includes the claim for replacements and modernization. The probable cost is reached by adopting a multiplier based on the ratio, between the cost price of the plant and machinery and the probable price which may have to be paid for its rehabilitation, replacement or modernization. After ascertaining the multiplier, a divisor has to be adopted in respect of each block in order to ascertain the annual requirement of the employer in that behalf year after year; (8) In Mathura Parshad Srivastava's case the claim for contingency reserve and development which have to be provided under the Electricity (Supply) Act was upheld though these do not constitute prior charges like items (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) above. The Tribunal cannot fix such a high figure of bonus as to leave insufficient funds in the bands of the company and make it difficult to provide for these two statutory reserves. Various factors including the financial capacity of the undertaking to pay, have to be taken into account in fixing bonus. [251 C.-254 G] Mill Owners Association, Bombay v.

 (ii) Even if all the technicalities of the Evidence Act are not strictly applicable except so far as Section It of the Industrial Disputes Act 1947 and the rules prescribed therein permit it, it is inconceivable that 243 the Tribunal can act on what is not evidence such as hearsay, nor can it justify the Tribunal in basing its award on copies of documents when the originals which are in existence are not produced and proved by one of the methods either by affidavit or by witnesses who have executed them, if they are alive and can be produced. Again if a party wants an inspection it is incumbent on the Tribunal to give inspection in so far as that is relevant to the enquiry.
 [259-D F] The application of the principle of natural justice does not imply that what is not evidence can be acted upon. On the other hand what it means is that no materials can be relied.
 upon to establish a contested fact which are not spoken to by persons who are competent to speak about them and are subjected to cross-examination by the party against whom they are sought to be used. [258 H] When the appellant in the present case produced the balance sheet and profit and loss account of the company, it did not by its mere production amount to proof of it or of the truth of the entries therein. If these entries are challenged the appellant must, prove each of such entries by producing the books and speaking from the entries made therein. If a letter or other document is produced to establish some fact which is relevant to the enquiry the writer must be produced or his affidavit in respect thereof be filed and opportunity given to the opposite party who challenges this fact.

 (iii) In view of the unsatisfactory oral and documentary evidence the Tribunal was justified in rejecting the claim for depreciation on the basis of double shift. It could not be assumed that in an Electric Undertaking the boilers and turbines must be working throughout, at any rate more that 8 hours. In view of disallowance the amount to be, allowed as prior charge towards depreciation will have to be computed after allowing for the notional depreciation. [260 F, 261B] (iv) The computation of income-tax by the Tribunal after deducting the statutory depreciation was in accordance with the decisions of this Court and could not be assailed. [262 C-D] Burm and Co. Ltd., v. Its Workmen, [1954] 5 S.C.R. 82 referred to.
 (v) In considering a claim for return on working capital two questions must be kept in view; whether the reserve were available and if they were, whether they were used as working capital and if so, what is the amount. These are questions of fact and if the employer fails to establish by satisfactory evidence the claim will have to be rejected.
 244 In this case there was no proof that any of the reserves had been utilised. The claim in this respect was therefore rightly rejected by the Tribunal.
 [263 D-E] (vi) The letters filed by the appellant in support of the replacement cost had not been proved by any of the persons who wrote them or any of the representatives of the firms whose letters they were. There was no oral evidence of the precise requirement for rehabilitation. The Tribunal was justified in holding that the appellant had failed to prove the original cost of the machines, plant and machinery, its age, the probable requirement for replacement, the multiplier and the divisor. In these circumstances this claim also had been properly disallowed.
 [264 C-G] (vii) The provision for contingency reserve and development reserve has been made under the Electricity (Supply) Act for a special purpose, namely to work out the charges to be recovered from the consumers for the supply of Electricity but that does not mean that these are not to be taken into consideration in declaring bonus though they have not been treated as prior charges. In these circumstances the amount of Rs. 55,233 had to be provided for. Except for this amount the computation made by the Tribunal for ascertaining the available surplus was justified. [265C-D] (viii) The available surplus found by the Tribunal was Rs. 1,29,248.. If Rs. 55,233 is to be provided for contain- envy reserve and development reserve there will be available surplus of Rs. 74,015. The Tribunal awarded three months bonus amount to Rs. 73,000 which works to Rs. 24,333 per month. Having regard to the financial capacity of this Undertaking one month's bonus which will leave a surplus for the working of the Undertakings will meet the ends of justice. [265 E-F]
