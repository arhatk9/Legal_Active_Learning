 The respondents entered into a contract with the appellants by longdistance telephone. The offer was spoken by the respondent at Ahmedabad and the acceptance was spoken by the appellants at Khamgaon. Alleging breach of the said contract the respondents Mod a suit at Ahmedabad. On the issue of jurisdiction raised by the appellants, the trial court found that the Ahmedabad Court had jurisdiction to try the suit. The High Court rejected the appellant's revision petition in limine whereupon by special leave, he came to this Court.
 
HELD : (i) Making of an offer at a place which has been accepted elsewhere does not form part of the cause of action in a suit for damage-, for breach of contract. Ordinarily it is the acceptance of offer and intimation of that acceptance which result in a contract. The intimation must be by same external manifestation which the law regards as sufficient.

 (ii) On the general rule that a contract is concluded when an offer is accepted and acceptance is intimated to the offerer, is engrafted an exception based on grounds of convenience which has the merit not of logic or principle in support, but of long acceptance by judicial decision. The exception may be summarised as follows : When by agreement, course of contract or usage of trade, acceptance by post or telegram is authorised, the bargain is struck and the contract is complete when the acceptance is put into a course of transmission the offeree by posting a letter or dispatching a telegram. [662 G-H] (iii) The rule that applies to acceptance by post of telegram does not however apply to contracts made by telephone. The rule which applies to contracts by telephone is the ordinary rule which regards a contract as complete only when acceptance is intimated to the purchaser. In the case of a telephonic conversation in a sense the parties are in the presence of each other, each party is able to hear the voice of the other. 'Mere is an instantaneous communication of speech intimating offer and -acceptance, rejection and counter-offer. Intervention of an electrical impulse which results in the instantaneous communication of messages from a distance does not alter the nature of the conversation so as to make it analogous to that of an offer and acceptance through post or by Telegram. [664 A-B] It is true that the Posts and Telegraphs Department has general control over communication by telephone and especially over long distance Telephones, but that is not a ground for assuming that the analogy of a 657 contract made by post will govern this mode of making contracts. In the case of correspondence by post or telegraphic communication, a third agency intervenes and without the effective intervention of that third agency, letters or messages cannot be transmitted. In the case of a conversation by telephone, once connection is established there is in the normal course no further intervention of another agency. Parties holding conversation on the telephone are unable to see each other; they are also physically separated in space, but they are in the hearing of each other by the aid of a mechanical contrivance which makes the voice of one heard by the other instantaneously and communication does not depend on external agency.

 (iv) In the administration of the law of contracts the courts in India have generally been guided by the rules of English common law applicable to contracts, when no statutory provision to the contrary is in force. The courts in the former Presidency towns by the terms of their respec- tive letters patents, and the courts outside the Presidency towns by Bengal Regulation III of 1793, Madras Regulation 11 of 1802 and Bombay Regulation IV of 1837, and by diverse Civil Courts Acts were enjoined in cases where no specific rule existed to act according to 'law and equity' in the case of chartered High Courts and elsewhere according to 'justice, equity and good conscience' which expressions have been consistently interpreted to mean the rules of English common law, so far as they are applicable to the Indian Society and circumstances. [664 G-H] (v) The draftsmen of the Indian Contract Act did not envisage use of the telephone as a means of conversation between parties separated in space and could not have intended to make any rule in that behalf. The trial Court wag right in the view which it took that a part of the cause of action arose within the jurisdiction of the City Civil Court Ahmedabad, where acceptance was communicated by telephone to the plaintiffs. [666 D-F] Per Hidayatullah, J. (dissenting) (i) In the Entores case Lord Denning no doubt held that acceptance given by telephone was governed by the principles applicable to oral acceptance where the parties were in the presence of each other and that the analogy of letters sent by post could not be applied. But the Court of Appeal was not called upon to construe a written law which brings in the inflexibility of its own language. It was not required to construe the words found in s. 4 of the Indian Contract Act, namely, "The communication of an acceptance is complete as against the proposer when it is put in a course of transmission to him, so as to be out of the power of the acceptor."

 (ii) The law under consideration was framed at a time when telephone, wireless, Telstar and Early Bird were not contemplated. If time has marched and inventions have made it easy to communicate instantaneously over long distance and the language of our law does not fit the new conditions it can be modified to reject the old principles. But it is not possible to go against the language by accepting an interpretation given without considering the language of our Act. [681 H] (iii) The language of s. 4 of the Indian Contract Act, covers a case of communication over the telephone. Our Act does not provide separately for post, telegraph, telephone, or wireless. Some of these were unknown in 1872 and no attempt has been made to modify the law. it may be presumed that the language has been considered adequate to, 658 cover cases of these new inventions. It is possible today not only to speak on the telephone but to record the spoken words on a tape and it is easy to prove that a particular conversation took place. Telephones now have television added to them. The rule about lost letters of acceptance was made out of expediency 'because it was easier in com- mercial circles to prove the dispatch of letters but very difficult to disprove a statement that the letter was not received. If the rule suggested on behalf of the plaintiffs is accepted it would put a very powerful defence in the hands of the proposer if his denial that he heard the speech could take awry the implications of our law that acceptance is complete -as soon as it is put in course of transmission to the proposer. [681 D-G] (iv) Where the acceptance on telephone is not heard on account of mechanical defects there may be difficulty in determining whether at all a contract results. But where the speech is fully heard and understood there is It bindin contract, and in such a case the only question is -.is to the place where the contract can be said to have taken peace. [678 G-H] (v) In the present case both sides admitted that the acceptance was clearly heard -,it Ahmedabad. The acceptor was in a position to say that the communication of the acceptance in so far as he was concerned was complete when he (the acceptor) put his acceptance in transmission to him (the proposer) as to be out of his (the acceptor'.,,,) power of recall in terms of s. 4 of the Contract Act. It was obvious that the word of acceptance was spoken at Khamgaon and the moment the acceptor spoke his acceptance he put it in course of transmission lo the proposer beyond his recall.
 He could not revoke acceptance thereafter. It may be that the gap of time was so short that one can say that the speech was heard instantaneously, but if we are to put new inventions into the frame of our statutory law we are bound to say that the acceptor by speaking into the telephone put his acceptance in the resource of transmission to the proposer. [680 E-H] The contract was therefore made at Khamaon and not Ahmedabad, Case-law considered.
