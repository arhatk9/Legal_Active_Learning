 The petitioners who belonged to the General Reserve Engineering Force (GREF) were charged under s. 63 of the Army Act, 1950 on allegations inter alia that they had assembled in front of the Chief Engineer and shouted slogans demanding release of personnel placed under arrest, participated in a black flag demonstration and associated themselves with an illegal association. They were tried by Court Martial in accordance with the prescribed procedure and, on being convicted, were dismissed from service.
 The petitioners submitted that their convictions by Court Martial were illegal and raised the following contentions in support of their plea: that the GREF was a civilian construction agency and not a 'force' raised and maintained under the authority of the Central Government and consequently, the members of GREF were not "members of Armed Forces or the Forces charged with the maintenance of public order" within the meaning of Art. 33 of the Constitution and therefore the application of s. 21 of the Army Act read with rs. 19 to 21 or the Army Rules to them was unconstitutional since it restricted their fundamental rights in a manner not permitted by the Constitution; that S.R. Os 329 and 330 which were notifications having the effect of applying the provisions of the Army Act and the Army Rules to the members of the GREF were ultra vires the powers of the Central Government under sub-ss. (1) and (4) of s. 4 of the Army Act; that s. 21 of the Army Act was unconstitutional as it 61 was not justified by the terms of Art. 33 since under that Article it was Parliament alone which was entrusted with the power to determine to what extent any of the fundamental rights shall, in application to the members of the Armed Forces or Forces charged with the maintenance of public order, be restricted or abrogated and Parliament could not have left it to the Central Government to determine the extent of such restriction or abrogation as was sought to be done under s. 21; that the petitioners were entitled to exercise their fundamental rights under cls. (a), (b) and (c) of Art. 19 (1) without any of the restrictions imposed by rs. 19 to 21 of the Army Rules and therefore they could not be charged under s. 63 of the Army Act on the facts alleged against them; that their trial was not in accordance with law; and that the application of the provisions of the Army Act and the Army Rules to the members of GREF for purposes of discipline was discriminatory and violative of Art. 14 inasmuch as the members of the GREF were governed both by the Central Civil Services (Classification Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965 and the provisions of the Army Act and the Army Rules in matters of discipline.
 Dismissing the petitions, ^ 
 HELD 1. (a) The functions and duties of GREF are integrally connected with the operational plans and requirements of the Armed Forces. There can be no doubt that without the efficient and disciplined operational role of GREF the military operations in border areas during peace as also in times of war will be seriously hampered and a highly disciplined and efficient GREF is absolutely essential for supporting the operational plans and meeting the operational requirements of the Armed Forces. The members of the GREF answer the description of "members of the Armed Forces" within the meaning of Art. 33 and consequently the application of s. 21 of the Army Act to the members of GREF is protected by that Article and the fundamental rights of the members of GREF must be held to be validly restricted by s. 21 read with rs. 19 to 21 of Army Rules. The petitioners were therefore liable to be charged under s. 63 of the Army Act for the alleged violations of rs. 19 to 21 and their convictions and subsequent dismissals must be held to be valid. [88 F-89 B] (b) The fact that the members of the GREF are described as civilian employees and they have their own special rules of recruitment and are governed by the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965 is not determinative of the question whether they are members of the Armed Forces. The question whether the members of GREF can be said to be members of the Armed Forces for the purpose of attracting the applicability of Art. 33 must depend essentially on the character of GREF, its organisational set up, its functions, the role it is called upon to play in relation to the Armed Forces and the depth and intimacy of its connection and the extent of its integration with the Armed Forces. The history, composition, administration, organisation and role of GREF clearly show that GREF is an integral part of the Armed Forces and that the members of GREF can legitimately be said to be members of the Armed Forces within the meaning of Art. 33. It is undoubtedly a departmental construction agency as contended on behalf of the petitioners but it is distinct from other 62 construction agencies such as the Central Public Works Department in that it is a force intended primarily to support the Army in its operational requirement. [87 D-H, 83 G] Ous Kutilingal Achudan Nair and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors., [1975] INSC 284; [1976] 2 S.C.R. 769, referred to.
 (c) The Central Government is empowered under sub-s.
 (1) of s. 4 of the Army Act to apply any of the provisions of that Act to any force raised or maintained in India under the authority of that Government. When the provisions of the Army Act are applied to any force under sub-s. (1) of s. 4, the Central Government can, by notification issued under sub-s. (4) thereof, direct by what authority, the jurisdiction, powers and duties incident to the operation of those provisions shall be exercised or performed in respect of that force. The word 'force' is not defined any where in the Army Act but sub-s. (2) of s. 4 clearly contemplates that 'force' referred to in sub-s. (1) of s. 4 must be a force organised on similar lines as the army with rank structure. There can be no doubt that GREF is a force organised on army pattern with units and sub-units and rank structure. It is clear from the letter dated June 16, 1960 addressed by the Secretary, Border Roads Development Board to the Director General Border Roads that GREF is a force raised and maintained under the authority of the Central Government. The Central Government therefore had the power under sub-ss. (1) and (4) of s. 4 to issue notifications S.R.O. 329 and S.R.O. 330 applying some of the Army Act and the Army Rules to the GREF. [82 B-H] (d) There is no substance in the contention that applying the provisions of the Army Act and the Army Rules to the members of GREF for purpose of discipline is discriminatory and violative of Art. 14. The nature of the proceedings which may be taken under the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules against an erring employee is different from the nature of the proceedings which may be taken against him under the provisions of the Army Act read with Army Rules, the former being disciplinary in character while the latter being clearly penal. There is no overlapping between the two because ss. 20 and 71 of the Army Act which deal with dismissal, removal or reduction in rank have not been made applicable to the members of GREF by S.R.O. 329. The respondents have positively stated in their affidavit that clear and detailed administrative guidelines have been laid down for the purpose of guiding the disciplinary authority in exercising its discretion whether to take action against an employee of GREF under Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules or the Army Rules and therefore it is not possible to say that the discretion vested in the authorities is unguided or uncanalised.
 Moreover, the decision in Northern India Caterers v. Punjab on which this contention is based has been overruled in Maganlal Chhaganlal v. Municipal Corporation, Greater Bombay. In any event, the provisions of the Army Act and the Army Rules as applied to the members of GREF are protected by Art. 33 against invalidation on the ground of violation of Art. 14. [90 G-92 B] 63 Northern India Caterers v. Punjab, [1976] 3 S.C.R. 399;
 and Maganlal Chhaganlal v. Municipal Corporation, Greater Bombay, [1974] INSC 91; [1974] 2 S.C.C. 402, referred to.
 (e) The contention that the trial of the petitioners was not in accordance with law was strongly resisted by the respondents and having regard to the averments made by them on this point it is not possible to hold that the convictions of the petitioners by the Court Martial were not in accordance with law. In any event, the allegation of the petitioners in this behalf raised disputed questions of fact which it is not possible to try in a writ petition. [90 A-F] (f) The alleged disparity between the Army personnel posted in GREF units and officers and men of GREF in so far as the terms and conditions of service such as salary, allowances and rations has no real bearing on the question whether the members of GREF can be said to be members of Armed Forces. Since the members of GREF are drawn from different sources it is possible that the terms and conditions of service of the personnel coming from the two sources may be different. In case it is found that there is any disparity the Central Government may consider the advisability of taking steps for its removal. [89 C-H] 
 2. Section 21 of the Army Act empowers the Central Government to make rules restricting "to such extent and in such manner as may be necessary" three categories of rights of any person subject to the Army Act. These rights are part of the fundamental rights under cls. (a), (b) and (c) of Art. 19(1) and under the constitutional scheme, they cannot be restricted by executive action unsupported by law. But s.
 21 is saved by Art. 33 which carves out an exception in so far as the applicability of fundamental rights to members of the Armed Forces and the Forces charged with the maintenance of public order is concerned. On a plain grammatical construction of its language, Art. 33 does not require that Parliament itself must by law restrict or abrogate any of the fundamental rights in order to attract the applicability of that Article. What it says is only this and no more, namely that Parliament may by law determine the permissible extent to which any of the fundamental rights may be restricted or abrogated in their application to the members of the Armed Forces and the Forces charged with the maintenance of public order. Parliament itself can by enacting a law restrict or abrogate any of the fundamental rights in their application to the members of these forces as in fact it has done by enacting the Army Act But having regard to the varying requirement of army discipline and the need for flexibility in this sensitive area it would be inexpedient to insist that Parliament itself should determine what particular restrictions should be imposed and on which fundamental rights in the interest of proper discharge of duties by the members of these Forces and maintenance of discipline among them The extent of such restrictions would necessarily depend upon the prevailing situation at a given point of time and it would be inadvisable to encase it in a rigid statutory formula. The Constitution makers were obviously anxious that no more restrictions should be placed on the fundamental rights of the members of these Forces than are absolutely necessary for ensuring proper discharge of 64 their duties and the maintenance of discipline among them.
 They therefore, decided to introduce a certain amount of flexibility in the imposition of such restrictions and, by Art. 33, empowered Parliament to determine the permissible extent to which any of the fundamental rights in their application to the members of these Forces may be restricted or abrogated so that, within such permissible extent determined by Parliament, any appropriate authority authorised by Parliament may restrict or abrogate any such fundamental rights. Parliament was therefore, within its power under Art. 33 to enact s.21. The extent to which restrictions may be imposed on the fundamental rights under cls. (a), (b) and (c) of Art. 19(1) is clearly indicated in cls. (a), (b) and (c) of s. 21 and the Central Government is authorised to impose restrictions on these fundamental rights only to the extent of the rights set out in cls. (a), (b) and (c) of s. 21 and no more. The guidelines for determining as to which restrictions should be considered necessary by the Central Government within the permissible extent determined by Parliament is provided in Art. 33 itself, namely, that the restrictions should be such as are necessary for ensuring the proper discharge of their duties by the members of the Armed Forces and the maintenance of discipline among them The Central Government has to keep this guideline before it in exercising the power of imposing restrictions under s. 21. Once the Central Government has imposed restrictions in exercise of this power, the Court will not ordinarily interfere with the decision of the Central Government that such restrictions are necessary because that is a matter left by Parliament exclusively to the Central Government which is best in a position to know what the situation demands. Section 21 must, in the circumstances, be held to be constitutionally valid as being within the power conferred under Art. 33. [83 B-D, 78 -81 C] Ram Swarup v. Union of India, [1963] INSC 249; [1964] 5 S.C.R. 931, referred to.
