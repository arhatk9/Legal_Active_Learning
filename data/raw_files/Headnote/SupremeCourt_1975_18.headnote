 The order of detention was passed against the petitioner on 13-6-1972. On 15th June the District Magistrate reported the fact of making the order to the State Government. State Government approved the order on 21st June.
 It was contended by the appellant-.
 (1) That the District Magistrate did not report the making of the order "forthwith" as required by section 3(3) and that the detention was, therefore, liable to be set aside.
 (2) Since the State Government rejected the representation on the very next day, it must be held. that it did not apply its mind to the representation.
 (3) The petitioner could have been prosecuted for the acts attributed to him and therefore could not be detained.
 Dismissing the petition, 
HELD : Laws of Preventive Detention by which subjects are deprived of their personal liberty without the safeguards available in a judicial trial ought to be construed with the greatest strictness. The delay on the part of the District Magistrate in reporting to the State Government the fact of making the detention order would inevitably curtail the period available to the State Government for approving the detention order. Such a delay may conceivably lead to a hurried and cursory consideration of the propriety or justification of the order and thereby impair a valuable safeguard available to the detenu. Therefore, the word 'forthwith' cannot be construed so as to permit indolence or laxity on the part of the officer charged with the duty of reporting the detention. However, reasonable allowance has to be made for unavoidable delays, always remembering that the detaining authority must explain any long delay by pointing out circumstances due to which the report to the State Government could not be made with the greatest promptitude. The report was made to the State Government on 15th June which still left to it a margin of 10 days to consider the merits of the order. It cannot be said that the delay in making the report left to the State Government insufficient time to consider whether the order of detention should be approved. The order was, in fact, approved on 21st June much before the expiry of the statutory period.
 The order is dated 13th. The explanation ,of the Department that report could not be made on 14th due to administrative difficulties is acceptable. [395 G; 396 F-G; 397 B-C] The contention of the petitioner that since the State Government the representation the very next day it must be held that it did not mind to the representation was negatived. The length of time which a takes does not necessarily reffects the care of openness brought to bear [399 A] The contention of the petitioner that he could have been prosecuted for the acts attributed to him was negatived on the ground that availability of an alternate remedy is not by itself an effective answer to the validity of the detention.
