 The three appellants with five others were tried for offences under s. 4 of the United State of Gwalior, Indore and Malwa (Madhya Bharat) Gambling Act and sentenced to imprisonment. The Sessions judge rejected their appeals.
 The High 766 Court rejected their revision petititions. They came to this Court by Special Leave. The only point urged before this Court was that ss. 6 and 8 of the Gambling Act were ultra wires the Constitution and against the principles of natural justice and fundamentals of criminal jurisprudence.
 Held, that ss. 6 and 8 of the Act were not ultra vires the Constitution. The Act is not unreasonable in its restrictions upon the fundamental rights of the people.
 There is nothing in the definition of gambling' to make it unreasonable or to offend against any of the guaranteed rights. The definition of a 'gaming house' is no doubt wide and there is not only a long list of places which come within the expression gaming house' but the term includes any place which answers the rest of the description. In spite of this, there is nothing unreasonable or which does not subserve the central purpose. The Act provides safeguards against victimization of innocent persons by putting certain checks when it provides for the detection and prosecution of offenders against the Act. The power to enter and authorise the police to enter and search places believed, to be gamin houses is given to superior officers who are expected' to act reasonably and after due satisfaction. Moreover,the officer who enters the building and seizes the articles ha-,'to satisfy the Court that his suspicions were based on reasonable grounds and it is only then that the burden is shifted to the accused to prove his innocence. Though , the word used in s. 6 is "suspecting", in actual proof this suspicion must be dermonstrated to be reasonably based. Considering the fact that gambling is an evil which is rampant and gaming houses flourish as a profitable business and detection of gambling is extremely difficult, the law to root out gambling cannot but be in the public interest. Such a law must of necessity provide for a special procedure. So long as it is not arbitrary and contains adequate safeguards, it cannot be successfully assailed. The Act contains sufficient safeguards, to ensure that there is no danger to any one except to those who are proved to the satisfaction of the Court to keep a gaming house or who can be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, to be there for the purpose of gaming.
