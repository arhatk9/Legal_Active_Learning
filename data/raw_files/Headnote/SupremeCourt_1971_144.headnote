 The appellants were legal representatives of the owner of a village. In January, 1947, the previous owner called for tenders for taking the property on lease for a period of three years. The respondents' tender was accepted and they deposited along with the tender earnest money and security for the payment of rent. The terms of the tender required that the lease deed should be got registered by the lessee and that the lessee alone would be personally responsible for taking possession of the lands.
 As a result of the partition of India the village became a part of Pakistan. Even before actual partition, because of serious communal troubles, it was not possible for the respondents to go to the village either to cultivate the lands or to collect the rent from those who were cultivating. No lease deed- was executed or registered.
 Under those circumstances the respondents filed a suit claiming a decree for the refund of the amounts deposited and damages. The lower courts held that the contract had become impossible of performance and decreed the suit in part.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD:(1) The law of frustration as embodied in s. 56 of the Contract Act applies only to a contract that is, an agreement to lease, and does not apply to leases. [674A;
 675A-B] Raj Dhruv Dev Chand. v. Harmohinder Singh, [1968] 3 S.C.R.
 339, referred to.
 (2)But in this case there was no lease. Since lease was to be for a period of three years it could have been validly made only under a registered instrument, and therefore, there was only an agreement to lease and not a lease. Such an agreement comes within the scope of s. 56 of the Contract Act. [675D-E] (3)The impossibility contemplated by s. 56 is not confined to something which is not humanly possible. If the performance of a contract becomes impracticable or useless having regard to the object and purpose of the parties then it must be held that the performance of the contract became impossible. But the supervening events should take away the very basis of the contract and it should be of such a character that it strikes at the root of the contract.
 [676C-D] In the present case, the respondents sought to take on lease the properties with a view to enjoy the properties either by personally cultivating them or by sub-leasing them to others. That object became impossible because of supervening events. Under the terms of the agreement the 672 lessor was not expected to deliver the actual possession of the properties but because of the prevailing circumstances it was impossible for the respondents to either take possession of the properties or even to collect rent from the cultivators. Therefore, the contract had become impossible of performance. [676D-F] Satyabrata Ghose v. Mugneeram Bangur and Co., [1954] S.C.R.
 310, referred to.
