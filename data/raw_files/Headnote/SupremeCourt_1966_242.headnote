 The assessee was holding 'as an investment 710 shares in a company. She became entitled to receive 710 new shares issued by the company, with an option to renounce them. She renounced her right to receive the new shares by, sale in the open market and realised a sum of Rs.
 45,262.50.Income-Tax officer sought to tax the entire amount as a capital gain. Immediatelybefore the renouncement, the old share, were valued at Rs. 253.00 per share. After renouncement the price of the old shares fell to Rs. 198.75as a result of which, the assessee suffered a capital loss of about Rs. 38,000. 'Me assessee claimed a set off of this loss against the capital gain of Rs.
 45,262.50. The plea was rejected by the Income-tax Authorities, the Appellate Tribunal and the High Court.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The claim of the assessee that her net capital gain was not represented by Rs. 45,262.50 was correct. The net capital gain could only be properly computed after deducting the sum which approximately represented the loss incurred simultaneously, by the assessee, in her original asset of 710 old shares as a result of the depreciation in their value.
 [4 E, H] In working out capital gain or loss, the principles that have to be applied are those which an ordinary man of business will resort to when making computation for his business purposes, or which are a part of the commercial practice. [5 G] Immediately before the assessee, renounced her right to take the new shares, the capital asset she possessed consisted of her old 710 shares valued at Rs. 253.00 per share plus the right to take the new 710 shares. After renouncement her capital assets were 710 old shares valued at Rs. 198,75 per share together with the sum of Rs. 45,262.50. Therefore., the value of the capital asset after renouncement would be Rs. 710 x 198.75 plus Rs. 45,262.50 while the value of the asset, immediately before renouncement, would be Rs. 710 x 253.00, there being no cash value, at the time of the right to receive the new shares, to be taken into account; and, the net capital gain of the assessee would be the difference between the two. [4 C-G] Alternatively, at the time of the issue of new shares the assesee possessed 710 shares and the right to obtain the new shares allotted. When she sold that right and realised Rs.
 45,262.50, she capitalized that right and converted it into money. A concomitant of the acquisition of the, right was the depreciation in the value of the old shares, and the depreciation, is, in a commercial sense, the value of the right which she subsequently transferred. The net capital gain by her would, therefore, be resented, only by the difference between the money realised on transfer the right, and the amount which she lost in the form of depreciation of her original shares in order to acquire that right.
