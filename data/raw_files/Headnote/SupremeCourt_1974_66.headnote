 The appellant was convicted under s. 292 I.P.C. and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment and fine for selling a packet of playing cards portraying on the reverse luridly obscene naked pictures of men and women in pornographic sexual postures. The conviction and sentence was affirmed by the High Court.
 It was contended that the sentence was very severe on the ground that only one single offence had been established and secondly that he might be released Linder the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD :-(i) The appellant cannot be dealt with leniently in this case. The amendment of section 292 I.P.C. by Act XXXVI of 1969, apart from enlarging the scope of the exceptions.
 enhanced the penalty. By the amendment the dichotomy of penal treatment was introduced for dealing with the first offenders and the subsequent offenders. Even in the case of first conviction the accused shall be punished with imprisonment. The intention of the legislature was, therefore, made clear by the amendment of 1969 in dealing with this type of offenders which corrupt the minds of people to whom these objectionable things can easily reach.
 The corrupting influence of these pictures is more likely to be upon the younger generation who has got to be protected from being an easy prey to these libidinous appeals upon which this illicit trade is based. [724A-B] (ii) The appellant cannot be released under s. 4 of the Probation of Offenders Act having regard to the nature of the offence and the potential danger of the appellant's activity in the nefarious trade affecting the morals of society, particularly the young. These offences have got to be treated on the same footing ,is the cases of food adulterators. [724-G]
