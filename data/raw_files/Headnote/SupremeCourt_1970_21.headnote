 The first respondent studied for his intermediate examination in two ,colleges one after the other, but never sat for the examination. He entered government service as a clerk. Some time after 1943 he resigned from service and joined the military contract business which was being carried on by his brothers. In 1952, though he was a member of the Congress party, he, stood for election against the Congress candidate after ,promising not to do so.
 Thereafter, he became Chairman of a Municipality and during his tenure as such, several thousand rupees were taken away from the Treasury on signatures resembling the first respondent's signature, and some persons were prosecuted.
 Also, while he was Chairman, he issued an order to the effect that salaries of sweepers were to be paid by the head clerk. In November 1964, the first respondent resigned his chairmanship. The -head clerk, instead of paying the sweepers, in December, misappropriated the money. When the misappropriation was discovered by the, Vice-Chairman, the head clerk committed suicide in December 1964. In the 1967 election, the first respondent again stood for election to the State Legislature against the Congress candidate, once again breaking his written promise not to do so. However, the appellant was declared elected. The first respondent challenged the election of the appellant. One of the grounds in the election petition was that the following false statements as to the personal character of the first respondent, reasonably calculated to prejudice his prospects of election, had been published in a leaflet with the consent of the appellant (1) That the first respondent 'after rolling from several colleges failed to pass the intermediate examination;' (2) that during the first respondent's tenure as Chairman there were instances of corruption and chaos: and that the criminal case in connection with the taking of money from the treasury was pending hearing at the -time of the publication of the leaflet;
 (3) that 'at that time' the head clerk committed suicide; and (4) that by taking military contracts he helped the British Government in India during the 1942-movement and by his standing for election against ,Congress candidates he was guilty of 'treachery' Desadrohita) and 'breach of faith' (Vishwasghatakta).
 On the question whether statements constituted corrupt practice under s.123(4) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, 
HELD : (1) In an election it is open to a candidate to show that his rival candidate is lacking in knowledge and education and that he is not capable of managing the affairs in -a public body. The statement in the leaflet only stated that he failed to pass the examination -and not that he 663 failed at the examination. There was a slight exaggeration when the leaflet referred to several colleges, but it could not be held to be -a false statement affecting the personal character, or conduct of the first respondent. [668 B-E] (2)The imputation was as to the mismanagement of the affairs of the Municipality by the first respondent, indicating that he was not a good administrator and not, that he was; himself corrupt. That part of the statement that the. criminal case was then pending, though incorrect, did not cast any as person on the conduct or character of the first respondent. [669 H; 670 A-B] (3)The expression 'at that time' interpreted literally would mean that the suicide was committed while the first respondent was the Chairman, which was not true, because, he had resigned earlier. But since the opportunity for the head clerk to misappropriate the money occurred while the first respondent was the Chairman, it must be held that the allegation made. in the clause is also substantially correct. Further, there was no suggestion in the statement that the first respondent himself was corrupt or that the suicide was the result of his personal corruptions [672 F-H] (4)The vernacular words used for 'treachery' and 'breach of faith' though harsh, were not such -as to lead the voters to think that the first respondent had a low moral character. The leaflet was published in reply to the first respondent's leaflet as to why he left the Congress, giving reasons as to why he was expelled from the Congress.
 Care was taken to give the facts from which inferences were being drawn and the voters could very well perceive for themselves whether the inference, which was drawn and expressed in strong terms, was justified or not. The treachery or breach of faith towards the country refers to the first respondent's help to the British by taking military contracts at about the time of the 1942-movement, and his treachery or breach of faith towards the Congress has reference to his standing for election as against the Congress nominee. Therefore, since the facts were given and only inferences were drawn, the words used at the time of putting down the inferences must be held to be only expressions of opinion, on the first respondent's political position and do not themselves connote any statement of facts involving moral depravity. Hence, the publication of the leaflet, cannot be held to constitute corrupt practice under s. 123(4) of the Act.
