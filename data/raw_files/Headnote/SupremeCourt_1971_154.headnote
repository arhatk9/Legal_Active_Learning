 The appellant filed a suit against the first respondent for partition of their deceased father's properties. The suit was partly decreed by the High Court in appeal. Both parties appealed to this Court. The first respondent contended inter alia that: (1) the appellant had separated himself from the family as far back as 1936 and therefore was not entitled to any share; and (2) the amounts of the fixed deposits in a Bank and a Company had been gifted away to him by the father since the father, a few days before his death, instructed the Bank and the Company to transfer the fixed deposit amounts from his single name to the joint names of himself and the first respondent.
 
HELD:(1) The law presumes that the members of a Hindu family are joint, a presumption which is stronger in the case of a father and his sons, and it is for the party who pleads that a member of the family had separated himself to prove it satisfactorily. For the existence of a joint family, the family as such need not possess any property since it is not property, but relationship, that knits the members of a family together.
 In the present case, the appellant, the first respondent, and their father were members of a joint family, though the family possessed no property, all the properties being the self-acquired properties of the father. There was a great deal of disagreement between the appellant and his father, the former expressing now and then that he was not, interested in his father's estate, and the latter threatening to disinherit the appellant. But apart from such mere emotional outbursts there was no evidence at all to show that he had at any time made any unequivocal declaration that the appellant had separated himself from his family nor had he communicated any such intention to separate himself either to the karta or to any of the members of the family. [804E-G] (2) (a) There was no evidence to show the genuineness of the letters allegedto have been written by the father requesting the Bank and the Companyto transfer the deposits in his name to the joint names of himself and the first respondent.
 (b) But even if such letters were in fact written by the father, there was no evidence of the general intention on the part of the father to give those amounts exclusively to the first respondent. In fact about two months before his death the father executed a will disinheriting the appellant but revoked it very soon thereafter. Therefore a mere direction to the bank to put the amounts in the joint names to himself and the 797 first respondent given by the father when he was seriously ill might be only a prudent step for facilitating collection, and does not show an intention to make over the amounts to the first respondent. Since the father continued to be the owner till his death and there was nothing to show that the father intended that the amounts should go to the first respondent exclusively and in pursuance of such an intention transferred the deposits to the joint names of himself and the first respondent, there was neither a gift nor an advancement.
