 The Respondent No. 1, who was a Civil Judge in former Madhya Bharat, was, on absorption into Madhya Pradesh Judicial Service, treated as Civil Judge, Class--II. The relevant Service Rules applicable to the Civil Judges recognised Civil Judges as only one Class but the M.P. Civil Courts Act, 1958, mentioned two classes of Civil Judges namely, Civil Judges Class I and Civil Judges Class II. From the time when the Madhya Pradesh Civil Courts Act, 1958 came into force it was always considered by the High Court that for promotion to the post of Addl. District and Sessions Judge, it was a necessary qualification that the Civil Judge must have some experience of working as Civil Judge, Class- I. Under the Act, the pecuniary jurisdiction of the Civil Judge, Class I was Rs. 10,000/- while that of Civil Judge Class 11 was Rs. 5,000/-. In May 1968, the High Court passed as Resolution laying down that the selection of a Civil Judge, Class-II, as a Civil Judge Class I shall be deemed as promotion and that being so, only the cases of Civil Judges, Class-I, shall be considered for promotion as Addl. District and Sessions Judges in order of their seniority. The respondent was not found fit for promotion to the post of Civil Judge, Class-I in the successive selections. He was finally found fit in 1968. In a writ petition before the M.P. High Court, the Respondent No. 1 contended that the date of the seniority should count from the date of appointment to the post of Civil Judge Class-11 and not from the date of promotion to the post of Civil Judge, Class-1. He also contended that the High Court resolution of May 3, 1968, was illegal as there was no provision in the Service Rules for classifying Civil Judges as Class I or Class II and the power to create various classes of services was vested in the Government, and not in the High Court. The M.P. High Court allowed the Writ Petition.
 Allowing the State's appeal by certificate, 
HELD : (1) On perusal of the High Court file regarding the selection of Class 11 Civil Judges as Class I Civil Judges, it is clear that the decisions were bona fide and on merits.
 The Respondent No, 1 had no claim to Class I post before 1968, when for the first time he was found fit. Once it is found that experience as Civil Judge Class I is a necessary qualification, the seniority in Class II service is of no consequcnce.
 (2) While it is true that the Service Rules do not provide for any distinction within Civil Judges, the difference in the pecuniary jurisdiction cannot be ignored. The Resolution of the High Court of May 1968 should not be interpreted literally. The resolution does not create a new class of Civil Judges called Class I Civil Judges but merely lays down the qualification or standard of fitness for higher promotion. There is 879 Do justification for re-opening cases closed for more than ten years at the instance of an officer whose record of service was not a shining one compared to those who were selected earlier.
