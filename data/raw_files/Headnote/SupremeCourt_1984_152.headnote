 The management of a coal mine owned by Respondent No.
 1, a partnership firm, was taken over by the Central Government with effect from October 17, 1971 under the Coking Coal Mines (Emergency Provisions) Ordnance of 1971 which was later replaced by a statue. On the passing of the Coking Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act, 1971 ( Nationalisation Act' for short) the right, title and interest of the owner in the mine extinguished and became vested in the Central Government with effect from May 1,1972. Section 21 (2) of the Nationlisation Act provided that in addition to the sum referred to in sub-s. (1), the Central Government shall pay such amount as may become due to the owner of a coking coal mine--in relation to the period during which the management of the coking coal mine- remained vested in the Central Government. In a writ petition filed before the High Court it was claimed by the owner that while determining the amount payable to it or recoverable from it in respect of the period when the mine was under the management of the Custodian, credit for the value of the stock of coking coal on April 30, 1972 shown in the account books should have been given to it. The High Court accepted the claim of the owner. The appellants (The Government Companies) obtained special leave to appeal against the decision of the High Court.
 Dismissing the appeals, ^ 
 HELD: The stock of coal had to be taken into account for balancing the position.[624H] The Nationalisation Act which contemplated the books of account for the period from October 17, 1971 to April 30, 1972 to be closed and a statement of account as on April 30, 1972 to be prepared with a view to find out whether the Government Company which was in management for the relevant period on behalf of the owner was to pay anything to the owner or the Government 619 Company having spent for the owner was entitled to recover any sum from the owner, also contemplated preparation of a balance-sheet on that date. In the absence of any particular prescribed mode in the Act or the Coking Coal Mines (Statement of Account) Rules, 1972 made thereunder, the accounts and the balance-sheet had to be prepared according to the normal commercial practice, which necessarily required stock-in-trade to be reflected. [624D-E] Under the Income-tax Act profits have to be ascertained for the purposes of computing tax liability. For computing true profits the value of the stock-in trade must be taken into account. [624D] Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras v. A. Krishnaswami Mudaliar & Ors. 53 I.T.R. 122 at 130, referred to.
 In the instant case, the appellants accepted the position that if the extracted coal had been sold before the appointed day, the owner would have been entitled to the price. The mere fact that the extracted coal remained in stock at the commencement of the appointed date can make no difference to the position. [624F-G] Statement 8 in the prescribed statutory form clearly indicates that the stock as on April 30, 1972, had to be taken into amount.
