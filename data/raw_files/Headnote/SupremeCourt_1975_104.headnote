 The respondent had a licence for sale of foreign liquor issued under the Foreign Liquor Rules made under the Madhya Pradesh Excise Act, 1915. On the date of the expiry of the licence (March 31, 1964), he had a large quantity of unsold foreign liquor, which had to be surrendered by him to the authorities. As the Government was contemplating enhancing the licence fee. he gave an undertaking to pay the difference and he was allowed to keep the excess stock. He also obtained a fresh licence for one year commencing on April 1, 1964.
 On April 25, 1964, the Foreign Liquor Rules were amended.
 The scale of licence fees was enhanced with retrospective effect from April 1, 1964; and r. IV was amended providing that the licensee shall be liable to pay the difference in the event of the enhancement of the scale of fees on the balance of stocks during the currency or on the expiry of the licence.
 But the State's demand for the difference was successfully challenged by the respondent, in the High Court, on the ground that the balance of stocks on March 31, 1964, was covered by the licence fee already paid and could not be subjected to enhanced levy.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) Subordinate legislation made by a delegate cannot have retrospective effect unless the rule-making power in the concerned statute expressly or by necessary implication confers power in this behalf. But s. 63 of the Act does contemplate not merely the power to make rules but to bring them into force from any previous date. It states that all rules made under the Act shall have effect from the date of publication in the official gazette or from inch other date as may be specified in that behalf. Therefore, the enhanced levy of licence fees operates from April 1, 1964. [236F, H 237A] (2)Rule XXVI of the General Licence Conditions provides that if there is enhancement of duty, the licensee shall pay the difference of duty on the 'balance of stocks' as on the date preceding the expiry of the licence. The rule also provides for refund by the State if there is a reduction of duty. Reading this rule with the amended r. IV of the Foreign Liquor Rules, the 'balance of stocks' is the surplus stock held by the licensee immediately before the expiry of his licence. Therefore the quantity held over on March 31, 1964, became liable to the enhanced licence fee on April 1, 1964. [238E-F] (3)(a) If the respondent's contention is accepted persons who have huge stocks left over will not have to pay the enhanced licence fee while fresh licensees would be so liable ; and [238-G] (b)If the respondent had surrendered his stock as he should have but for his undertaking he would have had to pay the enhanced rate for such left-over stock.
