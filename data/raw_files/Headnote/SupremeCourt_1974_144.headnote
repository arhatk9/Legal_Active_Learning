 The respondents let out the premises to the appellants in the year 1951 in a place governed by the Saurashtra Rent Control Act, 1951 which prohibited a tenant from subletting the premises. The appellant sublet the premises in violation of the Saurashtra Act at a time when Saurashtra Act was in force. In 1963, the Saurashtra Act was repealed and the Bombay Rent Act was made applicable to the area in question. Under the Bombay Act there is no prohibition against subletting by the tenant unless the contract of tenancy prohibited it. The respondent terminated the tenancy of the appellant after the Saurashtra Act was repealed and, thereafter, a suit was filed for recovery of possession on the ground of subletting. The High 'Court held that the suit to recover possession was competent under Saurashtra Act after its repeal as the respondent had an accrued right within the meaning of section 51 of the Bombay Rent Act. The High Court assumed that the notice under the Transfer of Property act was necessary to terminate the tenancy.
 
HELD : (1) The High Court was not right in its assumption that the notice under the Transfer of Property Act was necessary to terminate the tenancy on the ground that the appellants had sublet the premises. Under the Transfer of Property Act a mere subletting by a tenant unless the contract of tenancy so provides is no ground for terminating the tenancy. The respondent could not have issued a notice under the Transfer of Property Act to determine the tenancy as the contract of tenancy did not prohibit subletting by the tenant. The Saurashtra Act unconditionally prohibited a tenant from subletting and it was under that Act that the landlord was entitled to recover possession of the premises on the basis that the tenant had sublet the premises. A right accrued to the landlord to recover possession under the Saurashtra Act when the tenant sublet the premises and the right survived the repeal of that Act under section 51 of the Bombay Rent Act. Therefore, the suit for recovery of possession of the premises was maintainable after the repeal of the Saurashtra Act. [726-727D] (2) The right of a landlord to recover possession is not an accrued right it before the issue of a notice if under any law it was necessary for the landlord to issue tile notice to determine the tenancy. Privilege and inability are correlatives. Where there is a privilege there must be inability. Privilege is a' legal freedom on the part of one person as against another to do a given act or a legal freedom not to do a ,certain act. [724B,-725H; 726A-B]
