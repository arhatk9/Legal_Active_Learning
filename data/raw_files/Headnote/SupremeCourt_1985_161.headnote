 The wife of the detenu in her petition under Article 32 contended that the detention of the detenu in preventive custody in Bharatpur in the State of Rajasthan may be located in the State of Punjab or at a place not far off, that the detenu should be provided with appropriate amenities and facilities, that he should not be kept in solitary confinement, and should be allowed interviews with his relatives, friends and legal adviser from time to time.
 On the question whether the detenu should be detained in the State of Punjab, his home State, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The place of detention is a matter for the administrative choice of the detaining authority, and a Court would be justified in interfering with that decision only if it was in violation of any specific provision of the law or was vitiated by arbitrary considerations and malafides. In the instant case, no such material has been placed before the Court. On the contrary, the counter- affidavits indicate that on the facts and circumstances of the case it was necessary to effect the detention at Bharatpur. The city of Bharatpur although situated in the State of Rajasthan, is not very distant from the State of Punjab and Haryana. The reasons for detaining the detenu at Bharatpur do not, therefore, permit interference in the matter of place of detention. [327 D-F] 
 2. While ordinarily a detenu should be detained in an environment natural to him in point of climate, language, food 326 and other incidents of living, in the actual decision concerning the place of detention these considerations must yield to factors related to, and necessitated by, the need for placing him in preventive detention.[327 B-C] 
 3. While the conditions imposed upon a detenu held in preventive detention must not be punitive, they must nevertheless be such as to secure the effectiveness of his incarceration. [327 C-D] 
 4. The Jail authorities will continue to ensure that the detenu is supplied with all such facilities and amenities as are reasonably and necessarily required by him, consistently of course with the need to maintain the security of his detention. [328 C-D] 
 5. Condition No. 4 (ii) of the National Security (Rajasthan Conditions of Detention) Order, 1984 empowers the authorities to keep the detenu separate from ordinary prisoners. The nature of the detenu's detention does not call for interference. [328 G-H]
