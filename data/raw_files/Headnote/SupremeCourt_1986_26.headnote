 The princely State of Pudukottai got merged with the Indian Union with effect from March 3, 1948 as a result of which it became part of the Madras Province. Pursuant to the report of the Prakasam Committee constituted in 1937 to look into the question of agrarian reform in Madras Province, the Madras Estates (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1948 (Madras Act 26 of 1948) was passed by the Madras Legislature. The said Act applied to all estates, namely, zamindaries, under tenures and inam estates as defined in section 3, clause (2) of the Madras Estates Land Act, 1908;
 except inam villages which became "estate" by virtue of the Madras Estates Land (Third Amendment) Act 1936. me said Act was intended to provide for the repeal of the permanent settlement, the acquisition of the rights of the land holders in permanently settled and certain other estates in the Province of Madras and the introduction of the ryotwari settlements in such estates. Thereafter for the purpose of completing the process of agrarian reform, the Tamil Nadu Inam Estates (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1963 (Act 26 of 1963) was passed. Act 26 of 1963 provided for the acquisition of all rights of the land holders in inam estates in the State of Tamil Nadu and the introduction of the ryotwari settlements in such estates. The estates to which this Act was applicable were of two kinds; (i) existing inam estates; and (ii) new inam estates. The existing inam estates were inam villages which became estates by virtue of the Madras Estates Land ( Third Amendment) Act, 1936. They were whole villages. me new inam estate which was a new 422 nomenclature evolved for the purpose of Act 26 of 1963, meant a part village inam estate or a Pudukottai inam Estate as defined in section 2(14) of that Act. Then came the Tamil Nadu Minor Inams (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1963 (Act 30 of 1963) which provided for the acquisition of minor inams in the State and introduction of the Ryotwari settlements in such inams. This was followed by the Tamil Nadu Inams (Supplementary) Act, 1963 (Act 31 of 1963) providing the machinery for the determination of the questions whether a non-ryotwari area in the State of Tamil Nadu was or was not an existing inam estate, apart village in an estate, a minor inam, or whole inam village in Pudukottai.
 The appellants and other persons who were similarly situated made applications for the grant or ryotwari pattas in respect of such lands which they claimed to be in their possession on the basis that their lands were covered by Act 30 of 1963. In some cases ryotwari pattas were issued and in some cases the proceedings were still pending. At that time, the Government of Tamil Nadu on the representation made by the ryots of Pudukottai area appointed a special officer for the purpose of investigating into the character of the lands held as inams in Pudukottai area, who on an examination recommended that 116 part inam villages should be brought within the purview of Act 26 of 1963. Accepting the said recommendations, the Tamil Nadu Government passed the Tamil Nadu In m Estates (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Amendment Act, 1969 (Act 23 of 1969). In the added Schedule 1A to Act 26 of 1963, by the 1969 Act, the two appellants' lands were shown at serial Nos. 2 and 110. The effect of the Act on the rights of the appellants was (i) that their lands came within the scope of Act 26 of 1963 with retrospective effect i.e.. 15.2.65; and (11) that their lands were not covered by Acts 30 ant 31 of 1963 and as such any amount paid under Act 30 of 1963 was recoverable with interest thereon at the rate of 3 per cent per annum as if it were an arrears of land revenue ant all pending proceedings under the said two Acts abated. The appellants therefore filet writ petitions before the Madras High Court challenging the said Act of 1969. The High Court, came to the conclusion that Act 26 of 1969 was an integral part of the legislation mate in the State of Tamil Nadu in order to bring about agrarian reform ant therefore all the contentions based on Articles 14, 19 ant 31 of the Constitution were untenable ant dismissed the writ petitions.
 423 Dismissing the appeals by certificates under Article 133(1) (c) of the Constitution, the Court, ^ 
 HELD 1. A reading of the provisions of the Madras Act 26 of 1963 clearly establishes that it was intended to bring about agrarian reform in the State of Tamil Nadu in respect of the estates which were included in Schedule 1A which included the lands of the appellants also. Therefore the lands of the appellants which have been included in Schedule IA to Madras Act 26 of 1963 by the Madras Act 23 of 1969 are liable to be dealt with under Act 26 of 1963. [436 D-E; 439 B-C] 
 2.1 After the Seventeenth Amendment of the Constitution the expression "estate" for purposes of Article 31A included within its scope (i) any Jagir, inam or muafi or other similar grant ant in the State of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, any janam right; (ii) any land held under ryotwari settlement;
 and (iii) any land held or let for purposes of agriculture or for purposes ancillary thereto, including waste land forest land, land for pasture or sites of buildings and other structures occupied by cultivators of land, agricultural labourers ant village artisans ant the expression rights in relation to an estate, included any rights vesting in a proprietor, sub-proprietor, under- proprietor, tenure-holder, raiyat, under raiyat or other intermediary ant any rights or privileges in respect of land revenue. Therefore, even granting that the lands in question were ryotwari lands they would still come within the definition of the expression "estate" given in clause (2) of Article 31A of the Constitution. Further their lands could be brought within Act 26 of 1963 for purposes of Act 26 of 1963 with retrospective effect from a date prior to the cooing into force of Act 26 of 1963. Any declaration that the lands were not inam estates would have been of no use.
 It mag be that the inclusion of the lands of the appellants was violative of Article 14 but still the law is protected by Article 31A of the Constitution. It is no longer open to the appellants to question about the applicability of Article 31A of the Constitution to Act 26 of 1963. [436 E-H;
 438 B-C; G-H; 439 A-B] Khajamian Wakf Estates etc. v. State of Madras & Anr., [1970] INSC 237; [1971] 2 S.C.R. 790 followed.
 
 2.2 The contention that since appellants had only a right to get the patta in respect of the lands on the date on 424 which the impugned Ace was passed in the year 1969 the subject matter of the legislation was not agricultural lands and therefore Article 31A of the Constitution was not applicable is untenable. Clause (a) of Article 31A(1) which refers to the acquisition by the State of any estate or of any rights or extinguishment or modification of any such rights would be applicable even to a right to get a patta in respect of an agricultural land and any law which affects such right also would be protected by Article 31A. No such law can be questioned on the ground that it violates Article 14, Article 19 and Article 31. [438 B-R] 
 2.3 The plea that the Madras Act 23 of 1969 encroached upon the judicial power of courts when it declared that the lands mentioned in Schedule 1A which was added by the said Act were also inam estates is equally untenable. It is true that under Act 31 of 1963 it was open to the parties to seek a declaration before the Settlement Officer, the Tribunal, and the High Court regarding the nature of the tenure of the lands in question but by the impugned Act the State Legislature declared that Act 26 of 1963 was applicable to the lands included in Schedule lA. That became possible in the case of ryotwari lands after the Seventeenth Amendment of the Constitution on June 20, 1964 with retrospective effect. [438 E-G]
