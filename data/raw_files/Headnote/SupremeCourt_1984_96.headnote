 On being discovered that beef tallow imported from abroad was either being sold as vanaspati or used in its manufacture by certain unscrupulous persons, general public feeling was roused and there was public agitation and demands were made that severe action be taken against those responsible. As a result of the discoveries the Central Government thought that drastic action was called for. So, a notification was issued under s. 3(3) of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, 1947 totally banning the import of beef, buffalo and pig tallow into India w.e.f. August 24, 1983. And, on different dates in November 677 and December 1983, five circulars, styled 'abeyance' circulars and marked 'secret' were issued by the Deputy Chief Controller of Imports and Exports, in respect of as many as 192 concerns directing licensing authorities to keep in abeyance for a period of six months from the respective dates of the circulars, any application received from any of them for the grant of import licence or customs clearance permits and allotment of imported goods through agencies like the States Trading Corporation of India Limited or any other similar agency. Though the circulars did not themselves cite any statutory authority, they were, as claimed and as agreed to by the parties, presumed to be statutory orders made in exercise of the power conferred by cl. 8B of the Import (Control) Order, 1955. Several persons against whom 'abeyance' orders had been made filed writ petitions in different High Courts challenging those orders.
 Liberty oil Mills was one of those who filed such a writ petition in the Bombay High Court. The case was withdrawn to the Supreme Court under Art. 139A of the Constitution.
 Liberty oil Mills contended: (1) that the requisite satisfaction of the appropriate authority which was necessary for issuing an order under cl. 8B was not only not recorded in the circular but there was no material whatsoever upon which such satisfaction could have been arrived at; (2) that the circular was not confined to the banned item of animal tallow or to items which could be said to have some connection with the banned item, but extended to all item for which applications for the grant of licences or for allotment had been made by Liberty oil Mills; (3) that general nature of the order disclosed a total non application of the mind; (4) that several firms were clubbed together and dealt with by a single circular and there was no indication whatsoever that the facts relating to each of the firms had been considered separately; (5) that the 'abeyance circulars' far from advancing the public interest would, on the other hand, prejudicially affect the public interest by bringing to a halt several industries and throwing hosts of workers out of employment; (6) that there was no substance in the allegation that Liberty oil Mills were not actual users' of beef tallow but they had misused the import licences of other licensees by obtaining letters of authorisation for import of beef tallow as if they were actual users; and (7) that the circumstance that there was public agitation about the import of beef tallow was a total irrelevant circumstance for making an order under cl. 8B.
 The interveners contended: (1) that cl. 8B should be construed as providing for an opportunity to be heard and since the abeyance orders made no provision for hearing, they should be struck down as opposed to the principles of natural justice, and therefore arbitrary and violative of Article 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution; (2) that secret orders affecting rights of parties could not lawfully be made since secrecy would militrate against natural justice and against the right of appeal provided by s. 4M of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, and (3) that an order under cl. 8B could only be made after the investigation under cl 8 had commenced, that is after a show cause notice had been issued under cl.8, Dismissing the writ petitions.

 HELD: It is not permissible to interpret any statutory instrument so as to exclude natural justice, unless the language of the instrument leaves no option to the Court.
 Procedural fairness embodying natural justice is to be implied when ever action is taken affecting the rights of parties. It may be that the opportunity to be heard may not be pre-decisional; it may necessarily have to be post- 678 decisional where the danger to be averted or the act to be prevented is imminent or where the action to be taken can brook ne delay. It may not oven be necessary in some situations to give pre-decisional opportunity of making a representation but it would be sufficient but obligatory to consider any representation that may be made by the aggrieved person and that would satisfy the requirements of procedural fairness and natural justice. There can be no tape-measure of the extent of natural justice. It may and indeed it must vary from statute to statute, situation to situation and case to case. Pre-decisional natural justice is not usually contemplated when the decisions taken are of an interim nature pending investigation or enquiry. Ad- interim orders may always be made ex-parte and such orders may themselves provide for an opportunity to the aggrieved party to be heard at a later stage. Even if the interim orders do not make provision for such an opportunity, an aggrieved party has, nevertheless, always the right to make an appropriate representation seeking a review of the order and asking the authority to rescind or modify the order. The principles of natural justice would be satisfied if the aggrieved party is given an opportunity at his request.
 There is no violation of a principle of natural justice if an ex-parte ad-interim order is made unless of course, the statute itself provides for a hearing before the order is made. Natural justice will be violated if the authority refuses to consider the request of the aggrieved party for an opportunity to make his representation against the ex- parte ad-interim orders. (700H ; 701A-F) There is no rule of justice of fair play which requires the authority to seek the comments of the person concerned before embarking upon an investigation. Investigation commences as soon as the authority concerned to take the first step whether by way of seeking evidence or by way of seeking an explanation from the person concerned. (699F) In some cases, ex-parte interim orders may be made pending a final adjudication. But that does not mean that natural justice is not attracted when orders of suspension or like orders of an interim nature are made. Some orders of that nature, intended to prevent further mischief of one kind. may themselves be productive of greater mischief of another kind. An interim order of stay or suspension which has the effect of preventing a person, however, temporarily, say, from pursuing his profession or line of business, may have substantial, serious and even disastrous consequences to him and may expose him to grave risk and hazard.
 Therefore, there must be observed some modicum of residual, core natural justice, sufficient to enable the affected person to make an adequate representation. These considerations may not, however, apply to cases of liquor licensing which involve the grant of a privilege and are not a matter of right. That may be and in some cases it can only be after an initial ex-parte interim order is made. (705B-D) Queen v. Randolph et al. 56 D.L R.

 Clause 8 of the imports (Control) order, 1955 empowers the Central 679 Government or the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports to debar person from importing goods or from receiving licences or allotment of imported goods for a specified period if such person if guilty of any of the acts or commission or omission enumerated in the Clause. Clause 8A empowers the Central Government or the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports to suspend the importation of goods by any person or grant of licences or allotment of imported goods pending investigation into one or more of the allegations mentioned in cl. 8 without prejudice to any other action that may be taken against him in that behalf. Clause 8B empowers the Central Government or the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports to keep in abeyance applications for licences or allotment of imported goods where any investigation is pending into any of the allegations mentioned in cl.8 against a licences importer or any other person subject to fulfilment of the requirement of the satisfaction of the appropriate authority regarding the public interest. Both clauses 8A and 8B, which were inserted in the Import (Control) order, 1955 later by way of amendment, contemplate action of an interim nature pending investigation into allegations under cl. 8. Ordinarily in the absence of anything more, it would not be necessary to give an opportunity to the person concerned before proceeding to take action under cl. 8A or cl. 8B. But while cl. 8B deals with the right to obtain licences and the rights to obtain allotments, cl. 8A deals with rights which have flowered into licences and allotments A person to whom licences have been granted or allotments made may have arranged his affairs on that basis and entered into transactions with others, and, to him the consequences of action under cl. 8A may be truly disastrous whereas the consequences of action under cl. 8B may not be so imminently harmful. It is presumably because of this lively difference between cl. 8A and 8B that cl.10 provides for a pre-decisional opportunity in the case of action under cl. 8A and does not so provide in the case of action under cl. 8B. Again, it is presumably because, of this difference that cl. 10 while providing for an appeal against a decision under cl. 8A does not provide for an appeal against a decision under cl. 8B. But that does not mean that the requirements of natural justice are not to be meant at all in the case of action under cl. 8B. The requirements of natural justice will be met in the case of action under cl. 8B by considering, bona fide, any representation that may be made in that behalf by the person aggrieved. Clause 8B itself gives an indication that such a post-decisional opportunity on the request of the person concerned is contemplated. The action under cl. 8B is to be taken if the authority is satisfied in the public interest that such action may be taken without ascertaining further details in regard to the allegations. It clearly. implies that when further facts are ascertained by the authority or brought to the notice of the authority, such action may be reviewed. Therefore, in the case of action under cl. 8B it is not necessary to give a pre-decisional opportunity but a post-decisional opportunity must be given if so requested by the persons affected. [698G; 696D-E; G; 705F-H; 706A-E] The decision to keep in `abeyance' should be communicated to the person concerned otherwise the rules of natural justice will not be satisfied. It would be most arbitrary and quit clearly violative of Articles 14 and 19 (i) (g) of the Constitution if cl. 8B is to be interpreted as excluding 680 communication of the decision taken. There is nothing in cl.
 8B to suggest that the decision is not to be communicated.
 On the other hand, the expression "without assigning any reason" implies that the decision has to be communicated, but reasons for the decision have not to be stated. Reasons of course, must exist for the decision since the decision may only be taken if the authority is satisfied that the grant of licence or allotment of imported goods will not be in the public interest. The expression without assigning reasons' only means that there is no obligation to formulate reasons and nothing more. Formal reasons may lead to complications when the matter is still under investigation.
 So the authority may not give formal reasons, but the skeletal allegations must be mentioned in order to provide an opportunity to the person affected to make his representation. [706H; 707A-C] On what should the satisfaction be based ? The action under cl. 8B is really in aid of the ultimate order under cl. 8. Therefore, in order to invite the satisfaction contemplated by cl. 8B there must be present some strong suspicion of one or other or more of the grounds mentioned in cl. 8. Since the action which is of a drastic nature is to be taken ex-parte, it must necessarily be animated by a sence of urgency. The sense of urgency may be infused by a host of circumstances such as the trafficking and unscrupulous peddling in licences, large scale misuse of imported goods, attempts to monopolise or corner the market, wholesale prevalence of improper practices among classes of importers, public sentiment etc. etc. It is true that public administration is not to be run on public sentiment and statutory action may only be taken on grounds permitted by the statute. Public sentiment is not in some cases the ground for the action but it is what clothes the ground with that sense of urgency which makes it imperative that swift action be taken. [707D-H] Public interest must nolens volens be the paramount consideration. If the threatened public mischief is such as to outweigh the likely injury to the party, the authority may take action under cl. 8B. If the threatened public injury is very slight compared to the harm which may be done to the party, the authority may not take action under cl.
 8B. Which element of the public interest should be given greater weight and which grounds should weigh at all are matters for the authority taking action under cl. 8B. Courts do not concern themselves with the sufficiency of the grounds on which action is taken or with the balancing of competing considerations, in favour of and against the action. [708A-D].
 An `abeyance' order under cl. 8B is directed not against any particular type of goods but against an importer, licensee or other person against whom an investigation into allegations under cl. 8 is pending.
 Therefore the question is whether it is not in the public interest that a particular person should be prevented from obtaining import licences or imported goods any description pending investigation into the allegations under cl. 8B.
 That would depend on the nature of the allegations, the extent of involvement of the person concerned and, most important, the element of the public interest which are for the consideration of the authority. making the order under cl. 8B and not for the Court. [708E-G] 681 Action under cl. 8B is of an interim nature and it may be ex-parte, in which case the. affected party may make a suitable representation bringing out all the outweighing circumstances in his favour. That is the real remedy of the party. Courts do not enter the picture at that stage unless the action is mala fide or patently without jurisdiction.
 The action will be patently without jurisdiction if it is not based on any relevant material whatsoever. If the authority declines to consider the representation, or if the authority after consideration or from oblique motive, or the decision is such as no reasonable man properly directed on the law would arrive at on the material facts, it will be open to the party to seek the intervention of the court at that stage. [709E-G] Barium Chemicals v. Company Law Board [1966] Supp. SCR 311 Rohtas Industries v. S. D. Agarwal, [1959] 3 S.C.R. 108, M. A. Rasheed v. State of Kerala, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 93, Shalini Soni v. Union of India, [1981] 1 SCR 952 and Commissioner of Income Tax v. Mahindra and Mahindra, [1983] 4 S.C.C. 392, referred to.
 The Court cannot consider the question whether there is sufficient relevant material in support of the allegations made against the petitioners. The Court may properly consider the question of mala fide or patent lack of jurisdiction. Therefore in the instant case the Court cannot consider the question whether the material available justifies a prima facie conclusion that the petitioners have made illegal imports of beef tallow. [711A-B] The submission that since the abeyance order was never formally communicated to the petitioners, it must be treated as non est has no substance. The abeyance order was undoubtedly communicated to the concerned authorities, Despite the attempt at secrecy made by the concerned authority and the failure to formally communicate the decision to the party, the abeyance circular was very soon public knowledge and the petitioners did come to know of the orders. [710B; E-F] The argument that cl.11 (4) excludes the application of cl. 8B to goods covered by Open General Licence has no substance. Clause 8B expressly provides that action under the Clause may be taken "not withes standing anything contained in this order". In view of this non-obstante clause there is no doubt that cl. 8B applies. equally to goods covered by open General Licence. [698B-C] The argument that the order as embodied in the abeyance circular did not fulfil the conditions precedent prescribed by the statute has. some substance. The Circular did not contain a recital of the allegations constituting the basis of the satisfaction contemplated by cl. 8B for action under that provision, and without a recital of the allegations it was impossible to say that the action was not based on irrelevant material. It did not even recite that which was the foundation of any action under cl. 8B, namely, the satisfaction of the authority that the action was in the public interest. Again a large number of concerns were lumped together and purported to 682 be dealt with by a single abeyance circular. There was ex- facie nothing in the circular which could point to the authority having applied its mind and considered the case of his concerned separately. It is true that the abeyance circular suffers from everyone of these informities. But the Court's attention was invited to the statements made in the counter-affidavit by the Deputy Chief Controller of Imports and Export the author of the abeyance circular and the relevant files placed before the Court for perusal which shows that the principal allegations against the petitioners were that they had prima facie indulged in illegal importation of beef tallow and had also misutilised the beef tallow. Why the authority took this prima facie view has been explained in the counter-affidavit. From a perusal of the files it is found that the cases of Liberty Oil Mills as well as other concerns were separately and individually considered. Thus it does not make any difference on the peculiar facts of this case that a single circular was issued covering a large number of concerns.[712A-B; D.G] It is impressed upon the authorities that those entrusted by statute with the task of taking prejudicial action on the basis of their subjective satisfaction should, first bestow careful attention to the allegations forming the basis of the proposed action and the probable consequence which may ensue such action and, next, take the trouble of reciting in the order issued by them the satisfaction forming the basis of the action and a concise Statement of the allegations forming the basis of the satisfaction. If the necessary recitals are not found, there may be serious sequels. [713B-D] In the instant case, the real remedy of the party to make a representation to the concerned authority which is directed to consider such representation if made. [713F]
