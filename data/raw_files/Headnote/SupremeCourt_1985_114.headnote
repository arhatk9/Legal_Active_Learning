 Under the Tamil Nadu Estates' (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1948, estates of several Zamindars including the Sivaganga Estates and Ramnad Zamindari estates were abolished and vested with the Government. In Civil Appeal No. 474, of 1971, the respondent religious Math, in respect of the land admeasuring 3.55 acres being a portion of survey No. 114 obtained from the erstwhile Zamindar of Sivaganga under an (Order of Assignment (Ex. A-1) dated 29.1.1938 Kudi right (i.e. Right to cultivate), subject to the payment of a nominal nuzzur of Re. 1 per acre and an annual rent of Re. 1 per acre beside cesses and a Teervapat Cowle Patta issued in favour of its trustee Sutha Chaitnya Swamigal. After the abolition of the Zamindari estates, the religious Math applied on 25.11.53 for Ryotwari Patta in respect of the said land to the Assistant Settlement Officer, who, without reference to the respondent passed an order (Ex. B-4) on 25.6.54 that Survey No. 114 was not a ryoti land on the notified date but had been registered as Proromboke (village communal land) and, therefore, no one was entitled to Ryotwari Patta in respect of it. Aggrieved by the order, the respondent filed a Civil Suit O.S. No. 184 of 1959 in the Court of District Munsiff at Manamadurai for declaration of its title on the basis of its long and uninterrupted possession prior to 1938 as also under Ex. A-1 issued to it by the Zamindar and right to continue in possession and enjoyment of the suit land, subject to payment of Ryotwari or other cess to be imposed by Government without any interference from the Government. The appellant State resisted the suit on merits by contending that the suit land was communal land and that the assignment or grant by the Zamindar in favour of plaintiff-Madam was invalid as well as by raising a technical plea that the decision of the Additional Settlement Officer that the suit land was poromboke and not ryoti land was final and the Civil Court's jurisdiction to decide that question was barred under section 64-C of the Act.
 The Trial Court as well as the Sub Judge in appeal accepted the respondent's case on merits by holding that the suit land was a ryoti land and that the assignment of Kudi right therein by the Zamindar in respondent's 64 favour was valid and negativing the technical plea of want of jurisdiction decreed the suit by granting the necessary declaration and injunction protecting respondent's possession and enjoyment of the suit land. In second appeal preferred by the State of Tamil Nadu to the High Court the plea of lack of jurisdiction in the light of section 64-C of the Act was referred to a Division Bench who negatived the contention and dismissed the appeal. The Division Bench took the view that there was no provision under section 11 read with proviso to cl. (d) of section 3 of the Act for the ascertainment of the character of the land (whether it was ryoti land or communal land) and that the decision of the Settlement Officer whether the land is ryoti or not is an incidental one merely for the purpose of granting the Ryotwari Patta and Civil Court's jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the nature of the land when that aspect is specifically put in issue, is not taken away under section 64-C of the Act and that the respondent's suit was not for obtaining a ryotwari patta in its favour (which matter lay within the powers and jurisdiction of the Settlement Officer) but the suit was for injunction restraining the appellant from disturbing respondent's possession and enjoyment of the suit land on the basis of its title and long and uninterrupted possession and such relief the Civil Court could obviously grant.
 In Civil Appeal No. 1633 of 1971 after an adverse order had been passed by the Settlement Officer to the effect that the land in question was neither a ryoti land in Ramnad Zamindari nor the private property of erstwhile Zamindar, the respondent filed a suit for declaration of their title to the suit land (based on a registered sale deed) and for injunction restraining the appellants from interfering with their possession. In that suit one of the issues raised pertained to the nature or character of the suit land, whether it was a ryoti land in the erstwhile Ramnad Zamindari which had been taken over under the Act or a Poromboke (communal property) and the plea was that the Civil Court had no jurisdiction to decide this question in view of section 64-C. The Trial Court held that the suit property was Poromboke property and dismissed the suit but in appeal preferred by the respondents the sub-Judge held that it was ryoti land and respondents' title and possession thereto had been proved but the suit was barred under section 64-C of the Act and on this basis he confirmed the dismissal of the suit. The High Court in second appeal accepted the findings of the 1st Appellate Court on merits of the respondents' claims and on the question of Civil Court's jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the real nature or character of the suit land following its Division Bench decision held that the Civil Court had jurisdiction to decide that question and allowed the appeal.
 Dismissing the appeals, the Court ^ 
 HELD: 1. Whether a Civil Court's jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the nature and character of the land in question has been excluded or ousted under section 64-C of the Tamil Nadu Estates (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1948 will have to be decided by reference to the principles laid down by the Supreme Court, as to when the exclusion of the Civil Court's jurisdiction can be inferred and in particular two out of seven propositions culled out in Dhulabhai v. State of Madhya Pradesh, [1968] INSC 93; [1968] 3 SCR 662. [737-H] 65 
 2.1 It is true that section 64-C of the Act gives finality to the orders passed by the Government or other authorities in respect of the matters to be determined by them under the Act and sub-section (2) thereof provides that no such orders shall be called in question in any court of law. Even so, such a provision by itself is not, having regard to the two propositions stated in Dhulabhai's case decisive on the point of ouster of the Civil Court's jurisdiction and several other aspects such as the scheme of the Act, adequacy and sufficiency of remedies provided by it etc., will have to be considered to ascertain the precise intendment of the Legislature. In between the two sets of provisions dealing with grant of Ryotwari Patta to a Ryot (section II) and the grant thereof to a land-holder (Section 12-15) there is a difference of vital significance, with the result that different considerations may arise while deciding the issue of the ouster of Civil Court's jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the true nature or character of the concerned land. Approaching the question from this angle it will be seen in the first place that section 64-C itself in terms provides that the finality to the orders passed by the authorities in respect of the matters to be determined by them under the Act is "for the purposes of this Act" and not generally nor for any other purpose. [77 E-H] 
 2.2 The main object and purpose of the Act is to abolish all the estates of the intermediaries like Zamindars, Inamdars, Jagirdars or under-tenure holders etc.
 and to convert all land-holdings in such estates into ryotwari settlements which operation in revenue parlance means conversion of alienated lands into non-alienated lands, that is to say, to deprive the intermediaries of their right to collect all the revenues in respect of such lands and vesting the same back in the Government. The enactment and its several provisions are thus intended to serve the revenue purpose of the Government, by way of securing to the Government its sovereign right to collect all the revenues from all the lands and to facilitate the recovery thereof by the Government and in that process, if necessary, to deal with claims of occupants of lands, nature of the lands, etc. only incidentally in a summary manner and that too for identifying and registering persons in the revenue records from whom such recovery of revenue is to be made. The object of granting a ryotwari patta is also to enable holder thereof to cultivate the land specified therein directly under the Government on payment to it of such assessment or cess that may be imposed on the land under section 16. [78A-D] 
 2.3 The expression "for the purposes of this Act" has been designedly used in the section which cannot be ignored but must be given cogent meaning and on a plain reading of the section which uses such expression it is clear that any order passed by the Settlement Officer either granting or refusing to grant a ryotwari patta to a ryot under section 11 of the Act must be regarded as having been passed to achieve the purposes of the Act, namely, revenue purposes, that is to say for fastening the liability on him to pay the assessment or other dues and to facilitate the recovery of such revenue from him by the Government; and therefore any decision impliedly rendered on the aspect of nature or character of the land on that occasion will have to be regarded as incidental to and merely for the purpose of passing the order of granting or refusing to grant the patta and for no other purpose. [78 E-G] 66 
 2.3 Secondly, the principle indicated in the second proposition enunciated in Dhulabhai's case requires that the statute: when it creates a special right or liability and provides for its determination, should also lay down that all questions about the said right or liability shall be determined by the Tribunal or authority constituted by it, suggesting thereby that if there is no such provision it will be difficult to infer ouster of the Civil Court's jurisdiction to adjudicate all other questions pertaining to such right or liability. Since from the notified date all the estate vests in the Government free from encumbrances all the lands lying in such estate including private land of land-holder and ryoti land cultivated by a ryot would vest in the Government and the Act could be said to be creating a new right in favour of a land-holder (re: his private lands) and a ryot (re: ryoti land) by granting a ryotwari patta to them under sections 12 to 15 and section 11 respectively, and the Act provides for determination of such right by the Settlement Officer. [78 H; 79 A-B] 
 2.5 However, it cannot be said that the Act also provides for determination of all questions about such right by the Settlement Officer. Unlike in the case of an application for a ryotwari patta by a land-holder under section 12, 13 or 14 where an inquiry into the nature or character of the land and the history thereof is expressly directed to be undertaken by virtue of section 15 in the case of an application for a ryotwari patta by a ryot under section 11 there is no express provision for any inquiry into the nature or character of the land before granting or refusing to grant such patta to the applicant. It is true that some inquiry is contemplated if section 11 is read with proviso to cl. (d) of section 3 but even then there is no provision directing inquiry for the ascertainment of the nature of the land, namely, whether it is a ryoti land or communal land but it is obvious that impliedly a decision on this aspect of the matter must be arrived at by the Settlement Officer before he passes his order on either granting or refusing to grant such patta. Obviously such decision rendered impliedly on this aspect of the matter will be an incidental one and arrived at in the summary manner only for the purpose of granting or refusing to grant the patta. A summary decision of this type in an inquiry conducted for revenue purposes cannot be regarded as final or conclusive so as to constitute a bar to a Civil Court's jurisdiction adjudicating upon the same issue arising in a suit for injunction filed by a ryot on the basis of title and or long an uninterrupted possession. Since a fullfedged inquiry on the nature or character of land is provided for under section 15 in the case of an application by a land- holder the character of the Settlement Officer's decision on such issue may be different. [79 C-G] 
 2.6 Thirdly, having regard to the principle stated by the Supreme Court while enunciating the first proposition in Dhulabhai's case it is clear that even where the statute has given finality to the orders of the special tribunal the civil Court's jurisdiction can be regarded as having been excluded if there is adequate remedy to do what the Civil Court would normally do in a suit. In other words, even where finality is accorded to the orders passed by the special tribunal one will have to see whether such special tribunal has powers to grant reliefs which Civil Court would normally grant in a suit and if the answer is in the negative it would be difficult to imply or infer exclusion of Civil Court's jurisdiction. Since under the Tamil Nadu Estates (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1948, the Settlement Officer has no power, 67 beyond the power to grant or refuse to grant the patta under section 11 read with section 3(d) of the Act on the materials placed before him, to do what Civil Court would normally do in a suit (like granting of injunction), ouster of Civil Court's jurisdiction cannot be implied simply because finality has been accorded to the Settlement Officer's order under section 64-C of the Act.
