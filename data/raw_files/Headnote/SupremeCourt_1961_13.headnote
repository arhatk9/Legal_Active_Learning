 Section 3 of the U. P. (Temporary) Control of Rent and Eviction Act, 1947, enabled a landlord to file a suit for eviction of the tenant with the permission of the District Magistrate. Section 2(d) of the Act defined District Magistrate as including an officer authorised by the District Magistrate to perform any of his functions under the Act. By a notification issued under s. 10(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure the U. P. Government appointed Mr. Seth to be an Additional District Magistrate " with all the powers of a District Magistrate under the said Code and under any other law for the time being in force." The respondent applied to the District Magistrate for permission to file a suit for ejectment against the appellant. The District Magistrate transferred the application to Mr. Seth the Additional District Magistrate who granted the permission. The appellants contended that the permission granted was invalid as the District Magistrate mentioned in s. 3 of the Act was a persona designata and the permission could have been granted only by him or by an officer authorised by him to perform his functions and not by the Additional District Magistrate.
 Held, that the permission granted by the Additional District Magistrate was valid. The notification issued by the Government invested Mr. Seth with all the powers of the District Magistrate under the Code as well as under any other law including the Eviction Act and he was competent to grant the permission under s. 3. The District Magistrate mentioned in S. 3 was not a persona designata. A Persona designata is a person selected as an individual in his private capacity, and not in his capacity as filling a particular character or office, Kedar Nath v.
