 On the question whether it is open to the State Government to appoint teachers on an ad-hoc basis at the commencement of an academic year and terminate their services before the commencement of the next summer vacation, or earlier, to appoint them again on an ad-hoc basis at the commencement of next academic year and to terminate their services before the commencement of the succeeding summer vacation or earlier and to continue to do 80 year after year.
 ^ 
 HELD: 1. The policy of "ad-hocism" followed by the State Government in the appointment of teachers for quite a long period has led to the breach of Articles 14 ant 16 of the Constitution. Such a situation cannot be permitted to last any longer. The State Government is expected to function as a motel employer. [571 E] In the instant case the State Government is directed to take immediate steps to fill up in accordance with the relevant rules the vacancies in which those who are appointed on an at-hoc basis are now working ant to allow all those who are now holding these posts on an at-hoc basis to remain in those posts till the vacancies are duly fillet up. These at-hoc teachers shall be paid salary ant allowances for the period of summer vacation as long as they held office. Those who are entitled to maternity or medical leave, shall also be granted such leave in accordance with the rules.[571 F, 572 A-B] 
 2. The State Government has a duty to appoint teachers in existing vacancies in accordance with the rules. The State Government has failed to discharge that duty. A substantial number of ad-hoc appointments are mate in the existing vacancies which have remained unfilled for three to four years. In some cases the appointments are made for a period of six months only and they are renewed after a break of a few days. [571 A-Bl 570 The number of teachers in the State who are appointed on such ad-hoc basis is very large indeed. If the teachers had been appointed regularly, they would have been entitled to the benefits of summer vacation along with the salary and allowances payable in respect of that period and to all other privileges such as casual leave medical leave, maternity leave etc. available to all the Government servants. These benefits are denied to these ad-hoc teachers unreasonably on account of this pernicious system of appointment adopted by the State Government. [571 B-C] 
 3. These teachers who constitute the bulk of the educated unemployed are compelled to accept these jobs on an ad-hoc basis with miserable conditions of service. The Government appears to be exploiting this situation. This is not a sound personnel policy. It is bound to have serious repercussions on the educational Institutions and the children studying there. [571 D]
