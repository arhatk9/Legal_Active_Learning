 A complaint petition was filed before the Magistrate by the Appellant that she was ill-treated and subjected to cruelty by husband the accused respondent. and her in-laws, and that during the subsistence of their marriage he married again and got a second, wife.
 The High Court on an application filed by the accused respondent under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.quashed the Criminal Proceedings, holding that it was time barred since after three years cognizance cannot be taken of an offence under Section 498 A of the Penal Code, 2188 in view of the Section 468 of the Criminal procedure Code.
 Allowing the Appeal, the Court, 
HELD 1.In view of the allegation that complainant was as being subjected to cruelty by the respondent the High Court should have held that it was in the Interest of justice to take cognizance even of he offence under Section 498A of the penal Code ignoring the bar of section 468 of the Cr.P.C.
 (295-C) 2.In view of the allegation of Second marriage during the continuance of the first marriage, prime-facie an offence under section 494 of the penal Code which is punishable by imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years and then the some was disclosed in the complaint before the Magistrate, there was no question of Section 468 of the Penal Code being applicable since the imprisonment prescribed there is only upto three years. (291-F) 3.In view of Section473 of the Cr.P.C.a court can take cognizance of an offence even after the period prescribed under Section 468. if the court is satisfied on the facts and circumstances of the case. that it is necessary so to do in the interest of justice. Section 473 has a non-obstante clause which means that said section has an over riding effect on Section 468. if the court is satisfied on facts and in the circumstances of a particular case. that either the delay has been properly explained or that It is necessary to do so in the interest of justice (292-E-F) 4.It is only as a last resort that a wife openly comes before a court to unfold and relate the day-to-day torture and cruelty faced by her inside the house, which many, of such victims do not like to he made public. As such courts while considering the question of limitation for an offence under Section 498 A i.e. subjecting a women to cruelty by her husband or the relative of her husband, should judge that question in the light of Section 473 (if the Cr.1l.C.which requires the Court, not only to examine as to whether the delay has been property explained, but as to whether "it is necessary to do so in the interest of Justice" (293-H, 294-A) 289 5.Many courts are treating provisions of Sections 468 and 473 of the code as provisions parallel to the period of limitation provided under the limitation Act and power of condonation of delay under Section 5 of the Limitation Act.
 But there is a basic difference between Section 5 of Limitation Act and Section 473 of the Code. For exercise of powers under Section 5 of the Limitation Act, the onus is on the applicant to satisfy the court that there was sufficient cause for condonation of the delay, whereas Section 473 en joins a duty on the court to examine not only. whether such delay has, been explained but as to whether it is the requirement of justice to condone or Ignore such delay. As such, wherever the bar of section 468 is applicable,the court has to apply its mind on the question, whether it is necessary to condone such delay in the interest of.justice.

 6.The general rule of Limitation is based on the maxim vigilantibus, et non dormientibus, jura subveniunt (the vigilant and not the sleepy, are assisted by the laws). But this maxim cannot be applied In connection with offence relating to cruelty against women. (293-1)) 7.The object of the bar of limitation under Section 468 has been explained in the statement and object for introducing a period of limitation and also by this court but the same consideration cannot he extended to matrimonial offences, where the allegations are of cruelty, torture and assault by the husband or other members of the family to the complainant.
