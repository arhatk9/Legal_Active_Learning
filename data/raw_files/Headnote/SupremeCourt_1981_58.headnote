 Out of twelve persons, charged with the offences under section 302 read with section 149 I.P.C. and various other charges, eight were convicted. Two of them, C and R were sentenced to death while the others were sentenced to imprisonment for life. The High Court upheld the death sentence of two accused, acquitted one and confirmed the conviction of others.
 The case of the prosecution was that on the day of the occurrence at about sun-set C shot dead two of the deceased while two others were shot by R. The prosecution relied on the dying declaration of one of the deceased and examined four eye witnesses.
 In appeals to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellants that the fact that the trial court did not find it safe to accept the prosecution evidence and acquitted five out of twelve persons mentioned in the F.I.R.
 at one stage or the other should be sufficient to discard the prosecution case in respect of the other accused as well.
 Allowing the appeals in part, ^ 
 HELD: 1(i). It is difficult to hold that the witnesses had made out an entirely false or concocted story against the appellants. The circumstance that three of the four prosecution witnesses had been injured during the course of the incident affords a strong guarantee of their presence at the scene of the occurrence. There is also no reason why the four eye witnesses should falsely implicate persons against whom they had no grouse. [197 F-G] (ii). The reason why the trial court and the High Court acquitted some of the accused was that in the case of some of them there was a possibility of mistaken identity while, in regard to some others, the evidence was not of such a nature or character as to justify the acceptance of their complexity beyond a reasonable doubt. [197 H] 
 2. One of the accused J must be acquitted for the reason that though his name was mentioned alongwith the names of eleven others at the outset of the First Information Report, the text of that report does not attribute any part to him at all. His name had been included in an omnibus manner, by saying that he along with others wielded his lathi. [198 C-D] 196 
 3. It is unsafe to sentence C and R to death. One of the deceased implicated R in his dying declaration as the person, who shot at him but as pointed out by the Trial Court itself, the dying declaration suffers from several infirmities and, it cannot therefore, be relied upon for the purposes of holding that it was this accused, who shot the deceased. Secondly, the occurrence took place an hour after sun-set and it is hardly likely that if a large group of ten or twelve persons had formed an unlawful assembly, the witnesses would be in a position to identify minute details of the incident. The prosecution version in regard to specific overt acts that C and R fired shots resulting in the fatal injuries to the two deceased seems exaggerated. No distinction can be made in the case of the other accused, who have been sentenced to life imprisonment and the case of these two accused. The sentence of death imposed on them is, therefore, set aside. They are sentenced to imprisonment for life. [198 E-G, 199 B-D] 
 4. The conviction and sentence of the remaining appellants are confirmed. [199 E]
