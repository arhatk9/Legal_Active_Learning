 The appellant was running machines with the aid of power in a locality which was admittedly within the jalalabad Town Area. He did not take out a licence for running the machines as required by the Muzaffarnagar Factories Bye-laws framed by the respondent, the District Board Muzaffarnagar, under s. 174(1)(k) read with s. 106 of the U. P. District Boards Act, and was prosecuted by the respondent. The appellant contended that the bye-laws did not apply to the town area and it was not necessary for him to take out a licence. Section 174(1)(k) of the District Boards Act and s. 26(a) of the Town Areas Act both provided for the regulation of offensive trades and admittedly the trade carried on by the appellant was an offensive trade. The District Boards had the power under s. 174(1)(k) to frame bye-laws for rural areas which included town areas. But s.
 93(3) of the District Boards Act took away the power of the District 716 Boards to exercise within the limits of a town area any authority which was vested in a 'Town Panchayat'. Though the words 'Town Panchayat' were replaced by the words " Town Area Committee " in the Town Areas Act by an amendment in 1934 there was no corresponding amendment in s. 93(3) Of the District Boards Act. The respondent contended that as there were no Town Panchayats as such now, s. 93(3) did not bar the District Board from framing bye-laws for town areas.
 Held, that the respondent had no power to frame bye-laws for the town area and, consequently, the prosecution of the appellant was bad. As the word 'committee' was merely a translation of the word 'panchayat', the -substitution of the word 'committee' for the word 'Panchayat' in the Town Areas Act did not make any substantial change and consequently the restriction under s. 93(3) Of the District Boards Act continued in full force.
 When there is a body dealing with a larger area and from that area is carved out a smaller area which is entrused to another body, the law giving power to the body governing the smaller area must prevail over the law giving power to the body governing the larger area. If the Act of 1934 amending the Town Areas Act brought into existence a new body, the Town Area Committee, then it means that a smaller area was carved out from a larger area in 1934 and the powers given to the new statutory body would prevail.
 Where two statutes give authority to two bodies to exercise powers which cannot co-exist, the earlier is repealed by the later statute. On this principle also the power of the Town Area Committee, if it be deemed to be a new body coming into existence in 1934, must prevail over that of the District Board.

 The power to regulate a trade includes the power to frame bye-laws requiring the taking out of a licence.
