 The appellant and the respondent were candidates for the Amethi Parliamentary Constituency at the last general election. The respondent was declared elected. The appellant by a petition filed before the High Court assailed the election of the respondent contending:
 (1) that he was disqualified under Art. 102(1)(d) of the Constitution to be a candidate, because he had ceased to be an Indian citizen under s. 9 of the Citizenship Act for by virtue of his marriage to an Italian lady and acquisition of property in Italy he must be deemed to have voluntarily acquired the citizenship of that country, (2) that by reason of his being a Member of Parliament and drawing salary, he was disqualified for being chosen as a Member of Parliament since he was holding an office of profit within the meaning of Art. 102(1)(a) of the Constitution at the time of the election, and (3) that since the Chief Election Commissioner could not be removed from his office except in like manner and on the like grounds as a Judge of the Supreme Court, as provided in Art. 324(5) of the Constitution, no person who was not eligible to be appointed as a Judge of the Supreme Court could be appointed as the 824 Chief Election Commissioner, and consequently the Chief Election Commissioner, who was functioning, being not qualified to hold the post, the elections held throughout the country, including that of the respondent, were void.
 The High Court took the view that notwithstanding the statutory bar contained in s. 9(2) of the Citizenship Act, 1955 it had jurisdiction to decide the question whether a candidate had ceased to be an Indian citizen, since by virtue of Art. 329 of the Constitution all questions arising in an election petition filed under the Representation of the People Act were exclusively triable in an election petition. It, however, dismissed the election petition holding that it did not disclose any cause of action for setting aside the election of the returned candidate.
 Dismissing the appeal, the Court ^ 
 HELD: 1.(i) Whatever may be the proceeding in which the question of loss of citizenship of a person arises for consideration, the decision in that proceeding on the said question should depend upon the decision of the authority constituted for determining that question under s. 9(2) of the Citizenship Act, 1955. [836 C-D] (ii) By virtue of r. 30 of the Citizenship Rules, 1956 which have been framed under the Act, the Central Government has been appointed as the authority to decide the question of voluntary acquisition of citizenship of a foreign country arising under s.9(2). No other court or authority has, therefore, the power to decide the question as to whether, when or how an Indian citizen has acquired the citizenship of another country. [832 C-E] (iii) Even where the question whether a person is qualified to be chosen as a Member of the Lok Sabha arises in an election petition the High Court cannot proceed to decide the question of loss of citizenship of the candidate concerned notwithstanding the mandate of Art. 329 of the Constitution that no election to either House of Parliament or to the House of the Legislature of a State shall be called in question except by an election petition. [832 E ] 825 (iv) When once a person is admitted or held to be a citizen of India, unless there is a decision of the Central Government under s. 9(2) of the Citizenship Act that he has acquired the citizenship of a foreign country, he should be presumed to be an Indian citizen. Sub-section (2) of s. 9 purports to lay down that the right of citizenship of the person who is admittedly an Indian citizen should not be exposed to attack in all forums in the country, but should be decided by one authority, and that every other court or authority would have to act only on the basis of the decision of the prescribed authority in that behalf and on no other basis. That being the mandate of law, even the High Court trying an election petition can declare an Indian citizen as having acquired the citizenship of a foreign State only on the basis of a declaration made by the Central Government. If such a declaration is produced before a High Court it has to give effect to it but in case it is not forthcoming, the High Court should proceed on the ground that the candidate concerned has not ceased to be an Indian citizen. It cannot independently hold an enquiry into that question on its own. [834 G-H; 835 C-F] In the instant case, the respondent was a citizen of India by virtue of Art. 5 of the Constitution. No decision had been given by the competent authority under the citizenship Act on the question whether he had ceased to be a citizen of India, nor was there any adjudication declaring that he had acquired the citizenship of a foreign country.
 There is no provision in our law which provides that a person would automatically lose his Indian citizenship on his marriage with a person who is a citizen of a foreign country.

 2. (i) The membership of Parliament is not an office under the Government. The fact that the Lok Sabha had not been dissolved on the date on which the election was held, would not, therefore, amount to a disqualification in the case of a Member of the Lok Sabha for being a candidate at the next general election. [837 F-G] (ii) The dissolution of the existing Lok Sabha is not a condition precedent for holding a general election to it.
 The proviso to s. 14(2) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 authorises the issue of a notification for the general election before the expiry of the duration of the existing Lok Sabha. Section 73 of the Representation of the People Act authorises the publication of results of a general election to the Lok Sabha before the expiry of the duration of the existing Lok Sabha, but by the proviso to that section it is provided that the issue of such a notification shall not be deemed to affect the duration of the Lok Sabha if any, functioning immediately before the issue of the said notification. [836 G-H; 837 A-B] (iii) When clause (a) of Art. 102(1) and Art. 106 of the Constitution are construed in a harmonious way, it cannot be said that by receiving the salary and allowances payable to a Member of Parliament, such a member would be disqualified for being chosen as a member of either House of Parliament or for continuing as a member of either house of Parliament.[837 E-F] 3. It does not follow from the first proviso to Art.
 324 (5) of the Constitution that because the Chief Election Commissioner could be removed only in accordance with the procedure prescribed for the removal of a Judge of the Supreme Court, a person to be appointed to that post should satisfy the qualifications prescribed for a Judge of the Supreme Court. [837 H; 838 A-B] 
 4. In election petitions pleadings have to be precise, specific and unambiguous and if the election petition does not disclose a cause of action it is liable to be rejected in limine. [829 G-H] In the instant case, the allegations in the election petition, even if they are taken as true, do not disclose any 827 cause of action for setting aside the election of the returned candidate. They are frivolous and vexatious. [838 C-D] Charanlal Sahu & Ors. v. Giani Zail Singh & Anr., [1983] INSC 199; [1984] 2 S.C.R. 6, referred to.
