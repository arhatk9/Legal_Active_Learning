 The appellant filed complaints before the Chief Presidency Magistrate alleging that the officers of the respondent had committed an offence under the Companies Act, 1956. They were acquitted on April 4, 1968. On July 1, 1968, appeals were filed in the High Court by the appellant (cornplainant) but the High Court held that they were barred by art. 114 of the Limitation Act, 1963. In appeal to this Court, it was contended that the appeals were filed not under s. 417 Cr.P.C, but under s. 624B of the Companies Act.
 
HELD:(1) Section 404, Cr.P.C., provides that no appeal shall lie from any order of a criminal court except as provided by the Code or by any other law for the time being in force. But s. 624B does not confer any right of appeal from an order of acquittal passed by a criminal court in respect of an offence under the Companies Act. It only em- powersthe Central Government to present appeals through persons mentioned in that section. [1861 E-G] (2) Section 417, Cr.P.C.. provides right of appeal in cases of acquittal and if the order of acquittal is passed in a case instituted upon complaint, an application for special leave to appeal from such order should be filed within 60 days from the date of the order of acquittal, and under art.
 114 of the Limitation Act, 1963, the appeal should be filed within 30 days from the date of the grant of special leave.
 The appeals were not rightly entertained in the present case, because (a) there was no application for grant of special leave under s. 417(3), Cr.P.C., (b) the appeals were incompetent without grant of special leave; and (c) they were barred by limitation. [860 G-H; 861 H; 862 A-D]
