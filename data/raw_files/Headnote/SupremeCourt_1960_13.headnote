 The services of respondents 2 and 3, engaged as ward servants in the J. J. Group Of Hospital, Bombay, under State control and management were retrenched without payment of compensation as required by S. 25F(b) of the Industrial Disputes 867 Act, 1947. The respondents applied to the High Court for a writ of mandamus under Art. 226 of the Constitution. The single judge who heard the matter held that non-payment of retrenchment compensation did not render the retrenchment orders invalid as S. 25I of the Act provided a specific remedy for its recovery and dismissed the application. The Division Bench on appeal reversed the decision of the single judge upholding the respondents' contention that the said hospitals were an industry as defined by S. 2(i) of the Act and non-payment of retrenchment compensation rendered the retrenchment bad in law. On appeal by the State of Bombay.
 Held, that the decision of the Division Bench was right and must be affirmed.
 The mandatory language of S. 25F(b) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, plain and unambiguous in effect, leaves no manner of doubt that the payment of compensation as required by it is a condition precedent to retrenchment and that S. 25I Of the Act is intended to provide for the recovery of other monies that became due to the employees under Ch. V of the Act.
 The object and the scope of the Act, as apparent from its various provisions, made it amply clear that the Legislature in defining the word 'industry' in s. 2(j) of the Act was deliberately using term of wide import in its first clause and referring to several other industries in the second in an inclusive way obviously denoting extention. In construing the definition, therefore, it is inappropriate to apply the maxim noscitur a sociis so as to restrict its meaning. The maxim is a rule of construction and can apply only where the intention of the Legislature in associating terms of wider import with those or narrower import or the meaning of the wider terms used is in doubt.
 The corporation of Glasgow v. Glasgow Tramway and Omnibus Co. Ltd., 1898 A. C. 631, referred to.
 Nor can undue importance be attached to the conventional meaning attributed to trade or business in construing the wide words of the definition since it has lost some of its force and can no longer be wholly valid for the purpose of industrial adjudication in a modern welfare state. It is clear that the presence of a profit motive or the investment of capital, traditionally associated with notion of trade and business, can be no indispensable requisite for an industry under S. 2(j) of the Act.
 Such activities of the Government as can properly be decribed as regal or sovereign activities easily fall outside the scope of the definition. But the field of such activities cannot be extended to cover other activities which are undertaken by the State in implementation of the Directive Principles of State Policy and the ideal of a welfare State.
 Coomber v. Justices of Berks, 9 A. C. 61, referred to.
 Although it 'may not be possible to enumerate all possible attributes that can make an activity an undertaking under S.
 2(j) as being analogous to trade or business, the working principle should be that any activity systematically and habitually under- 868 taken for the production or distribution of goods or for the rendering of material services to the community or a part of it with the help of employees organised or arranged in the manner of a trade or business in such an undertaking.
 No question of the application of the doctrine of quid pro quo can arise in deciding such a matter, for that would only be raising the question of profit motive in another form.
 So judged there could be no doubt that the State in running the hospitals in question was carrying on an industry within the meaning of the Act.
