 The Chief Justice of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh wanted the High Court staff, to be paid at the scales of pay of equivalent posts in the Secretariat staff of the Government of Andhra Pradesh. The Government did not agree to do so. The respondents who are members of the High Court service belongin, to the categories of Bench Clerks, Lower Division Clerks, Typists and certain other categories filed a writ petition in the High Court for a writ of mandamus against the appellants directing them to implement the recommendations of the Chief Justice of the High Court made to the Government from time to time to fix the pay scales of the various categories to which the respondents belong in accordance with the scales of pay as revised by the State Government in case of corresponding categories detailed in Annexure III of the Andhra Pradesh Secretariat service. The High Court allowed the writ petition and directed the Government to give effect to the recommendations of the Chief Justice embodied in the letters of the Registrar of the High Court dated 31-3-1969 and 1-7-1969 with such allowances and such benefits as are admissible to the members of the Secretariat service in the Secretariat. The High Court took the view that for the purposes of appointments of officers and servants of the High Court and laying down the conditions of their service the Chief Justice is the highest authority. The requirement of the approval of the Governor of the State under the proviso to clause (2) of Article 229 is a requirement of a mere formal approval. The Government could not refuse to accord their approval when the recommendation of the Chief Justice was merely for equation of pay scales of the High Court staff with those of the Secretariat's. The High Court did not rest its judgment on Rule 19 of the Andhra Pradesh High Court Service Rules, 1959. This appeal has been preferred on the basis of the certificate granted by the High Court.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD : (1) It is not correct to say that the approval of the Governor under the proviso to clause (2) of Article 229 is a mere formality and in no case it is open to the Government to refuse to accord their approval. Merely because the Government is not right in accepting the Chief Justice's view and refusing to accord approval is no ground for holding that by a writ of mandamus the Government may be directed to accord the approval.
