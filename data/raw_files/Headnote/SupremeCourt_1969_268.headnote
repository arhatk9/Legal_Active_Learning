 The respondents were inducted as sub-lessees in contravention of 'S. 73 of the Revenue Administration and Ryotwari Land Revenue and Tenancy Act, 1950. On the question whether they acquired rights as occupancy tenants under s. 185 (1) (ii) (b) of the Madhya Pradesh Land Revenue Code. 1959.
 
HELD : A person inducted as a sub-lessee, but who by express provision contained in s. 73 read with s. 78 of Act 66 of 1950 is declared a trespasser, does not acquire the States of an occupancy tenant under s. 185(1)(ii)(b) of the Madhya Pradesh Land Revenue Code. Act 29 of 1955 conferred protection only upon a ryatwari sub-lessee, and a ryotwari sub-lessee was defined in that Act as meaning a person in whose favour the land was settled. A Person, the lease in whose favour was declared void by virtue of Act 66 of 1950, could not claim the status of a. sub-lessee. That is so enacted in s. 3 which excludes from the protection granted by Act 29 of 1955, amongst others, a sub-lessee deemed to be a trespasser under s. 78 of Act 66 of 1950. A person inducted as a sub-lessee contrary to the provisions of s. 73 of Act 66 of 1950 did not, therefore, acquire any right under a contract of sub--letting, and his possession was not protected under Act 29 of 1955. Such a person is not a ryotwari sub-lessee defined in the Madhya Bharat Ryotwari Sub-lesse protection Act 29 of 1955, and it is only on 'Ryotwari sub-lessee' as defined in that Act that the right of occupancy tenants conferred by s. 185(1)(ii)(b) of the Madhya Pradesh Land Revenue Code. [646 E] The observation contra in Rao Nihalkaran v. Ramchandra [1963] M.P.L.J. 314, disapproved.
