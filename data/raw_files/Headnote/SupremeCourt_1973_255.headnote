 The appellants who were charged with the offence of murder were acquitted by the Additional Sessions Judge but the order of acquittal was set aside in appeal by the High Court. The High Court convicted them under various sections of the Penal Code and sentenced them to life imprisonment for the offence of murder and to shorter terms for the other offences. The prosecution case was that when the deceased, along with three other persons, was returning from temple, he was attacked at about 4 P. M. on the day of the occurrence by the appellants. The deceased , who was mortally injured, was carried in a bullock cart to a nearby police station. On the way he succumbed to his injuries.
 The first information report was lodged in the police station at 12.30 that night.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : This Court in an appeal under Art. 136 will examine the evidence only if the High Court while setting aside the order of acquittal by the trial court has failed to apply correctly the principles governing appeals against acquittals.
 In Sheo Swarup & Ors v. The King Emperor, 61 I.A. 398, Surajpal Singh v. The state [1952] S.C.R.193 and Sanwat Singh v. State Of Rajasthan [1960] INSC 283; [1961] 3 S.C.R. 120, the principles governing appeals against acquittal are firmly established. The Code of Criminal Procedure made no distinction between the powers of the appellate court in regard to the two categories of appeals and, therefore, the High Court has powers as full and wide in appeals against acquittal as in appeals against conviction. Whether the High Court is dealing with one class of appeals of criminal jurisprudence that unless the, statute provides to the contrary there is a presumption of innocence in favour of the accused and secondly that the accused is entitled to the benefit of reasonable doubt. Due regard to the views of the trial court as to the credibility of witnesses in matters resting on pure appreciation of evidence and the studied slowness of the appellate court in disturbing a finding of fact arrived at by a judge who had the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses, where such seeing and hearing can be useful aids to the assessment of evidence are well known principles which generally inform the administration of justice and govern the exercise of all appellate jurisdiction. They are self-imposed limitations on a power otherwise plenary and like all voluntary restraints, they constitute valuable guidelines. Such regard and slowness must find their reflection in the appellate judgment, which can only be if the appellate court deals with the principal reasons that influenced the order of acquittal and after examining the evidence with care gives its own reasons justifying a contrary view of the evidence. It is implicit in this judicial process that if two views of the evidence are reasonably possible, the finding of acquittal ought not to be disturbed.
 If after applying these principles, not by their mechanical recitation in the judgment, the High Court has reached the conclusion the order of acquittal ought to be reversed, this court will not reappraise evidence in appeals brought before it under art. 136of the Constitution. In such appeals, only such examination of the evidence would ordinarily be necessary as is required to see whether the high court has appliedthe principles correctly. The High Court is the final court of facts and the reserve jurisdiction of this Court under Art. 136, though couched in wide terms,is by long practice exercised in exceptional cases where the High Court has disregarded the guidelines set by this Court for deciding appeals against acquittal or by disregard to the forms of legal process or some violation of the principles of natural justice or otherwise, substantial and grave injustice has been done', or where the finding is such that it shakes theconscience of the court.
 [15B-G] 10 The High Court in the instant case was evidently aware of these principles but it failed to apply then to the case on hand. The High Court was not correct in characterising of the findings recorded by the trial court as "perverse".
 (i) The High Court was not right in rejecting the view of the Sessions Judge that there was undue delay in lodging the report and that the delay was not satisfactorily explained.
 Whether the delay was so long as to throw a cloud of suspicion on the case of the prosecution must depend upon a variety of factors which would vary from case to case.
 (ii) In the instant case the defence of the appellants that the occurrence must have taken place under cover of darkness, that is, long after the time at which it was alleged to have taken place is well founded and the High Court was clearly in error in discarding it.
 (iii) If the principal witness had no compunction in creating an eyewitness his evidence had to be approached with great caution. The High Court was not justified in holding that the only impact of the false discovery of an eye witness on the prosecution case was that the evidence of the principal witness had to be rejected in part.
 (iv) Yet another witness had made conflicting statements on oath before two courts on an important aspect and the question which the High Court should have asked itself was whether the view taken by the Sessions Court in regard to this witness was a reasonable one. The High Court was not right in saying that there was no reason to discard the testimony of the other eye witnesses even if his evidence was left out.
 (v) The motive was said to be illicit intimacy between the deceased and daught of one of the assailants. But one of the witnesses deposed that the assailants were dacoits and that they searched his pocket as well as the pockets of his companions. The first information report made no mention of any one of the accused referring to the illicit intimacy before, during or after the attack. The endeavour at the trial was to show that the incident was connected with the illicit affair. if that be the true motive, it is hardly likely that the assailants would search the pockets of the deceased and his companions. The Sessions Judge was justified in attaching due importance to this aspect of the matter and the High Court was not right in saying that unnecessary emphasis was laid on a minor matter.
