 The owner of a property executed three mortgages in favour of three persons on three different dates. The first mortgagee filed a suit to which he made the two puisne mortgagees also parties. A decree was passed against the mortgagor in Form 9, Appendix 'D', Civil Procedure Code, 1908. As the mortgagor did not pay the amount, a final decree for sale of the mortgaged property was passed. The mortgagor, however, paid off the decretal amount due to the first mortgagee and the property was not brought to sale.
 Thereafter, the second puisne mortgagee brought a suit on his mortgage and prayed for a mortgage decree in Form 5-A.
 It was contended on behalf of the mortgagor, that the pusine mortgagee was not entitled to file the suit and the only course open to him was to apply for a decree for sale and realise his dues from the surplus sale proceeds of the mortgaged property. The suit was decreed by the trial judge and in appeal, the Appellate Bench of the High Court varied the decree by reducing the amount declared due. The decree however granted interest at the contractual rate of 12% per annum with monthly rests even after the date of suit.
 In appeal to this Court, On the questions (1) whether, in the circumstances, the puisne mortgagee was entitled to institute a separate suit in respect of his mortgage; and (2) whether interest on the amount adjudged should be at the contractual rate even after the date of suit.
 HELD : (1) Under the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, and 0.
 34 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, a puisne mortgagee is made a party to the suit by the first mortgagee in order that the puisne mortgagee might have an opportunity of redeeming if he wished, and in order that he might receive his mortgage money, or part of it, out of the surplus sale- proceeds after satisfaction of the first mortgage. But the decree is not really in his favour and he cannot insist upon a sale nor get a personal decree in his favour if the first mortgagee is satisfied by the mortgagor before the sale.
 Therefore, the puisne mortgagee was entitled to file the suit on his mortgage. [37 D-E] Chandra Roy Chowdhry v. M. M. Nahapiet, I.L.R. 37 Cal. 907, Vedavyasa Ayyar v. The Madura Hindu Labha Nidhi Co, Ltd.

It Civil Procedure Code, 1908, (inserted by Act 21 of 1928), the Court may order payment of interest to the mortgagee upto the date fixed for payment at the rate payable on the principal. Hence, the Court has discretion not to decree the contractual rate so far as interest pendente lite and subsequent interest up to date of redemp- tion is concerned, even if the rate was not penal, excessive or substantially unfair within the meaning of the Usurious Loans Act, 1918. In the circumstances of the present case simple interest at 6%'per annum on the principal sum adjudged from date of suit-till date of redemption is appropriate. [39 C-F] Jaigobind Singh v.
