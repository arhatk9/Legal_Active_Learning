 In the final decree for sale in a mortgage suit and in the sale certificate the number of the property in dispute was given as No. 160 instead of No. 1060 which was the real number although it was otherwise fully described so that its identity could be clearly established. The appellants contended that a decree could not be granted with respect to this plot. The High Court found that No. 160 in the final decree and the sale certificate was a mistake for No. IC60 and that there was no plot No. 160, in the particular khata.
 The High Court further held that this was a case of misdescription and not a case of disputed identity. With regard to another plot in dispute subrogation was claimed on behalf of the second mortgagees alleging that the first mortgage was redeemed by the second mortgagees although their mortgage deed did not mention anything about the earlier mortgage nor was any money left to redeem it.
 Held. (i) that the High Court was right in holding that this was a case of misdescription and that as the identity of the property was well established the contention of the appellants must fail.
