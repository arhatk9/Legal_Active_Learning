 On the questions: (1) Whether s. 144 and, (2) Ch. VIII of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898, violated Art. 19(a), (b), (c) and (d) of the Constitution, 
HELD (By Full Court) : 1(a) Article 19(2) of the Constitution, which was substituted with retrospective effect by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, must be held to have been in force from 26th January 1950. [719 B] (b) The fiction in the amendment is to make the Constitution be read with the new clause and no other, and a law restricting the freedom in the interests of public order (among others , or in the interest of the general public, must be held to be saved, not as the result of the amendment but because of these available restrictions operating from the inception of the Constitution, that is, from January 26, 1950. Whatever may be said of a law declared unconstitutional before the first Amendment, cannot be said of a law which is being considered today after the First Amendment.[718 G-H; 719 A] (c) In this Court the doctrine of 'preferred position' for fundamental rights has never found ground. All existing laws are continued till this 'Court declares them to be in conflict with a fundamental right and, the burden is on the person who contends that a particular law has become void after the coming into force of the Constitution by reason of Art. 13(1) read with any of the guaranteed freedoms. The burden is not on the State to prove the reasonableness of the restriction. [721 C-G] (d) The expression 'in the interest of public order, in Art. 19(2) of the Constitution is wider than 'maintenance of public order', because, a law may not have been designed to directly maintain public order and yet it may have been enacted in the interest of, public order; and 'public order, is capable of taking within itself not only the absence of those acts which disturb the security of the State or the absence of insurrection, riot, turbulence or crimes of violence, but also absence of certain acts, which disturb public tranquility or are breaches of peace. it will not however take in any of the acts which disturb only the seniority of others.

 (e) The area of detention by a Magistrate under the Code of Criminal Procedure and the area under the laws relating to preventive detention are entirely different. In the case of prevention detention of persons without 712 trial on the subjective determination of the executive this Court has confined the meaning of the expression 'maintenance of public order' to graver ,episodes. But that consideration need not always apply because local dis- turbances of the even tempo of life also affect 'public order' in the sense of a state of law abidingness vis-a-vis the safety of others.
 [725 E-G; 726 A-B] (f) The gist of action under s. 144 is the urgency of the situation and its efficacy in the likelihood of being able to prevent some harmful consequences. It is not an ordinary power. flowing from administration but a power used in a judicial manner and which can stand 'further judicial scrutiny. As it is possible to act under the section absolutely and even ex-parte the emergency must be sudden, and the consequences sufficiently grave. Therefore, the matter falls within the restrictions which the Constitution itself visualises as permissible in the interest of public order or in the interest of general public. [727 D-F; 728 A- B] (g) Ordinarily the order would 'be directed against a person found acting or likely to act in a particular, way.
 But the effect of the order being in the interest of public order and in the interests of general public, occasions may arise when it is not possible to distinguish between those whose conduct must be controlled and those whose conduct is clear. A general order may be necessary when the number of persons is so large that the distinction between them and the general public cannot be made. A general order is thus justified, but if the action is too general, the order may be questioned by appropriate reinedies for which there is ample provision in law. A person affected by the order can ask the order to be vacated as against him, he can file a revision and even a petition for issue of a writ. The restraint is temporary, the power is exercised by senior Magistrates who have to make a judicial enquiry and give reasons for the order with an opportunity to an aggrieved person to have it rescinded either by the Magistrate or by superior courts. Therefore, the section is not unconstitutional if properly applied and the fact it may be abused is no ground for striking it down. If it is abused, the remedy is to question the exercise of the power as being outside the grant of law.

 2(a) (Per Hidayatullah, C.J., Shelat, Mitter, Vaidialingam, Ray and Dua, JJ.) Both ss. 106 and 107 in Ch. VIII of the Code, are counter parts of the same policy, the first applying when by 'reason of the conviction of the person, his past conduct leads to an apprehension for the future and the second applying where the Magistrate, on information, is of the opinion that unless prevented from so acting, a person is likely to act to the detriment of public peace and public tranquility. Section 107 enables certain specified class es of Magistrates to make an order calling upon a person to show cause why he should not be ordered to execute a bond with or without sureties for keeping the peace for such period not exceeding one year as the Magistrate thinks fit to fix. The condition for taking action is that the Magistrate is informed and he is of the opinion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding that a person is likely to commit a breach of peace or disturb the public tranquillity or to do any wrongful act that may probably occasion a breach of peace or disturb the public tranquillity. The section is aimed at persons who cause a reasonable apprehension of conduct likely to lead to a breach of the peace or disturbance to the public tranquillity. [729 H; 730 A-B, F-G] The procedure for taking action is set out in the remaining sections of the Chapter. The gist of the Chapter is the prevention of crimes and ,disturbances of public tranquillity and breaches of the peace. The action 713 being preventive is not based on overt acts but on the potential danger to be averted. But the provision is not a law for detention contemplated by Art. 22. Primarily, the provisions enable the Magistrate to require the execution of a bond and not to detain a person. Detention results only on default of the execution of a bond. The person sought to be bound over has rights which the trial of a summons case confers on an accused. The law requires the Magistrate to state his reasons and the order is capable of being questioned in superior courts.- These provisions are thus essentially conceived in the interest of public order and in the interest of the general public. If the prevention of crimes and breach of peace and disturbance of public tranquillity are directed to the maintenance of the even tempo of community life they are in the interest of public order, and there is nothing contrary to Art. 19(1), (a), (b), (c) and (d), because, the limits of the restrictions are well within cls. (2), (3), (4) and (5) of the Article.
 Therefore, the Chapter is constitutionally valid.
 [729 G; 734 D-H; 735 H; 736 A-C] (b) Section 117(3) enables the Magistraite to ask for an interim bond pending the completion of inquiry by him.
 Section 117(1) and (2) require the Magistrate to inquire into the truth of the information that the person brought before him is likely to commit a breach of the peace or disturb the tranquillity. Hence, the Magistrate must proceed to inquire into the truth of the information and it is only after Prima facie satisfying himself about the truth of the information and after recording his reasons in writing can the interim bond be asked for. Therefore, it is not open to a Magistrate to adjourn the case without' entering upon an enquiry and in the interval send the person to jail if he fails to furnish a bond.
 [732 H; 734 r)-F] As the liberty of a person is involved and that person is being proceeded against on information and suspicion, it is necessary to put a strict construction upon the powers of the Magistrate. It would make the Magistrates action administrative if he were to pass an order for an interim bond without entering upon the inquiry and at least prima facie enquiry into the truth of the information on which the order calling upon the person to show cause is based.

 (d) Bail is only for continued appearance of a person and not to prevent him from committing certain acts. To release a person being proceeded against under ss. 107/112 of the Code is to frustrate the very purpose of the proceedings unless his good behavior is ensured by taking a bond in that behalf. [736 F-G] 714 Per Bhargava, J. : (a) Under s. 107 the Magistrate takes action when he is informed that any person is likely to commit a breach of peace or disturb the public tranquillity only after forming an opinion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against him. He cannot start proceed- ings merely on information. The Magistrate can form his opinion on the basis of the information supplied to him if he finds that the information given is in sufficient detail and reliable enough. If the information is, not sufficient, it will be his duty to hold further inquiry and satisfy himself that it is a fit case where action should be taken because sufficient grounds exist. It is after the Magistrate has taken these steps that he can proceed to make the order under s. 112. When making that order he has to record in it in writing the substance of the information received which necessarily means the part of the information which was the basis.of his opinion that sufficient grounds exist for initiating the proceedings. It is at this preliminary stage that the Magistrate is thus required to ensure that a prima facie case does exist for the purpose of initiating proceedings against the person who is to be called upon to furnish security for keeping the peace. [737 C-H] After the order under s. 112 has been issued the procedure under ss. 113 and 114 has to be followed. The proceedings to be taken thereafter are laid down in s. 117(1) which requires that as soon as the order under s. 112 has been read or explained to the person in court under s. 113 or to the person who is brought before the Magistrate under s.
 114, the Magistrate has to proceed to inquire into the truth of the information upon which the action has been taken and to take further evidence as may be necessary. This inquiry has to be held in the manner prescribed for trial of summons cases. Thus, s. 117(1) contains a mandatory direction to the Magistrate to start proceedings of inquiry as soon as the person in respect of whom the order under s. 112 has been made appears before him. This provision cannot, however, be interpreted as requiring that the inquiry must begin immediately when the person appears in court, because, it is impracticable to do so. It is uncertain as to when a person will appear in court and the Legislature could not have contemplated that in such contingencies witnesses must be kept in readiness in the court awaiting the appearance of the person concerned. Further, since the result of the inquiry may be that the person concerned has to execute a bond, with the risk of losing his liberty if he defaults, he is entitled to be represented by a lawyer and be can legitimately ask for a reasonable adjournment to enable him to engage a lawyer. Therefore, the proper interpretation of s. 117(1) is that the inquiry must begin as soon as it is practicable, and the Magistrate would be committing breach of the direction contained in this sub-section if he postpones the inquiry without sufficient reasons. In such a situation, the Magistrate can direct the person in respect of whom the order under s. 112 has been made to execute a bond pending completion of the inquiry under s. 117(1). [738 A-B, C-D, E-H; 738 A-C] (b) This power under s. 117(3) is usually invoked in emergent cases where the Magistrate has at an earlier stage, issued the warrant under s. 144, where breach of peace cannot be prevented otherwise than by immediate arrest. The Legislature, having empowered a Magistrate to issue a warrant of arrest, naturally proceeded further to give him power in such cases to direct that bond for keeping peace be furnished pending completion of the inquiry. The expression 'completion of the inquiry must be interpreted as the period covered from the beginning of the inquiry until its conclusion. Such a power is obviously necessary where there, is immediate danger of breach of the peace and immediate measures are necessary for its prevention. When the inquiry is held the correctness of the information and the tentative opinion formed ex parte under s. 107 will be 715 properly tested after going through the judicial procedure prescribed, and, if it is found that there was no justification, the order would be revoked. Therefore, the grant of the power to the Magistrate is a reasonable restriction on the personal liberty of a citizen. It is needed for prevention of crimes and it can only be effective if its exercise is permitted on the basis of opinion formed by a competent authority that immediate measures are required. [739 G-H; 740 A-D] (c) A person may be detained in jail even prior to a court arriving at a judicial finding, but such a procedure is not only reasonable but essential. The power is similar to that given to a Magistrate to order the detention, as an undertrial prisoner, of a person accused of a cognizable offence even though, in law, he is deemed to be innocent.
 [740 E-F] (d) Further, the validity of the provision should not be judged from the likelihood of the abuse of the power by the Magistrate. If the hearing is unnecessarily delayed while keeping the person in detention, the proceedings are liable to be quashed on the ground that the Magistrate has not complied with the requirements of s. 117(1). [741 A-C] Therefore, the power under s. 117(3) can be exercised without the Magistrate recording evidence and finding a prima facie case after starting the inquiry under s. 117(1).
 But, even on this interpretation s. 117(3) is valid and is a reasonable restriction under Art. 19(2), (3), (4) and (5).
