 The assessee, a trustee of the house property, claimed deduction of compound interest in terms of a consent decree passed in April 19, 1928, in a title suit in respect of the property. 'Under the terms of that decree, the property was held to belong to the first defendant who, however, was to make a payment of Rs. 8,61,000/to the plaintiff therein.
 There was stipulation for the payment of compound interest on the unpaid amount @ 6 3/4 with yearly rests. It was further provided therein that Rs. 4,25,000,/- was to be paid on the execution of the terms of the settlement and therefore monthly instalment of Rs. 35,000/- for seventeen months and the balance in the 18th month. The terms of the compromise were not adhered to inasmuch as there were defaults in payment of interest. After making the payment on February 19, 1945, there still remained outstanding Rs.
 2,70,535/-- The interest on this amount @ 6 3/4 for a year worked out to Rs. 18,000/-. The assessee, however, calculated the total interest payable at Rs. 38,221/- for the assessment year 1956-57, relying on the clause in the agreement providing for payment of compound interest. The Income Tax Officer gave a deduction of Rs. 18,000/only, on the basis of simple interest at the rate of Rs. 6 3/4'% per annum. The assessee's appeal against this order was dismissed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and later on by the Tribunal. On reference of the question and other similar questions 'in respect of the assessment years 1956- 57 to 1958-59, the High Court held that only simple interest was allowable to the assessee.
 On appeals by certificate to this Court, dismissing the appeals;
 
HELD : (1) What the law permits is the deduction of the "amount of any interest on such mortgage or charge." Under the terms of the contract, when. the interest payable is not paid, the same became a Part of the principal and thereafter, interest has to be paid not only on the original principal but also on that part of the 'interest which had became a part of the principal. The interest which became part of the principal cannot be considered as the capital charge. What the assessee is entitled to deduct 'is the interest payable by him on the capital charge and not the additional interest which 'because of his failure to pay the interest on the due date had been considered as a part of the loan. The real capital charge is that which was originally due. The other portion is merely an interest on which the assessee has agreed to pay :interest. Hence the interest paid on interest is not an interest paid on the capital charge. [570 B] 568 (2)Any interest' paid on capital borrowed or charged does not include compound interest. The compound interest is payable riot on the capital charge but on that part of the interest on which he has agreed to pay interest. That is not the capital taken not of by s. 9(1) (iv). If the contention that "any interest" included compound interest is accepted as correct, then the door will be open for evasin of tax. Such an interpretation is impermissible.
