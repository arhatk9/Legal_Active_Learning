 The appellant was the tenant of premises owned by respondent. He was ordered to be ejected from the premises on the ground that he was in arrears of rent for more than three months and did not tender them even at the first hearing by the Rent Controller of the application for ejectment presented by the landlord under s. 13 of the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act III of 1949. The District Judge dismissed the tenant's appeal. In revision the High Court of Punjab and Haryana proceeded on the basis that on the date of application which was made on 22nd September, 1964, the total arrears due from the tenant including interest and electricity charges amounted to Rs. 497.33 P.
 The High Court was of the view that electricity charges would form part of the rent. The amount in deposit according to the tenant, came to Rs. 469. As this amount did not cover the entire arrears of rent due the tenant was held liable to ejectment by the High Court. The present appeal was filed by special leave.
 
HELD : In the application filed by the landlord it was nowhere stated that the arrears of electricity charges formed part of the rent. Consequently no issue was framed by the trial court whether the electricity charges formed part of the rent. On the face of it, there was no justi- fication for accepting this new point when it was not pleaded at all in the original application. [857 D] Read correctly even the rent note made it clear that the electricity charges could not possibly form part of the rent. Further the amount due for consumption of electricity each month could only be known at the end of that month, while, under the agreement the rent had to be paid in advance. The charges were variable and would depend on the amount of electricity consumed. If the electric charges were held to be. part of the rent it would lead to the inference that even the rent of the building was variable and was different each month. In view of these circumstances it was clear that the District Judge and the High Court went wrong in proceeding on the basis that the electric charge formed part of the rent and that non-payment of electric charges due amounted to non-payment of arrears of rent.

 The High Court had accepted that the amount in deposit was enough to cover arrears of rent, in case the electric charges were not treated as part of the rent. On this finding, the decision of the High Court upholding the order of eviction could not be justified. Further, according to the District Judge there was no deposit or tender even of the amount of Rs. 469 as claimed by the tenant. In the revision before the High 85 6 Court this finding of the District Judge was assailed by the tenant. High Court did not examine the propriety or correctness of this finding, The case, therefore, must be remanded to the High Court for determined of the question whether the tenant had made a proper depot., c r tender of sum of Rs. 469. In case he had done so he was not in areas of rent and was not liable to ejectment. [858E-H]
