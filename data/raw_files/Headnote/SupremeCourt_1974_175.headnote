 The petitioner was detained under s. 3, Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971, on the sole ground that on 16-2-1973 at about 10 p.m. he, along with his associates, being armed with guns and other weapons, committed dacoity in a third class compartment of a running train. In a petition challenging the detention order the District Magistrate stated in his counter affidavit that he based his subjective satisfaction only on the ground mentioned in the detention order although other materials were placed before him. The Court therefore. examined the record and the history sheet of the detenu and held, dismissing the petition, that.
 (1) The ground on which the detention order had been made would reasonably give rise to a bona fide satisfaction in the mind of the detaining authority that such incidents were likely to be repeated in the same manner and that those who were alleged to have taken part in even a single incident of such magnitude had to _be detained in order that the tempo of peace in public life was not jeopardised. A careful examination of the record and the history sheet showed, having regard to the grave nature of the act committed by the detenu, that the District Magistrate was bonafide satisfied that the said Act was sufficient for making the detention order. [58F-G; 60A-B] (2) It could not be contended unless the facts stated in the grounds are proved to the satisfaction of the Court, no action can be taken under the Act. It is because that the act complained of cannot be satisfactorily proved in a Court of law or that the witnesses are unwilling to come forward being already terrified by the enormity of the act perpetrated that action has to be taken under the Act to prevent further commission of offenses of similar nature.
 [58G-H] Besides, the scope of inquiry in a case of this nature is very limited. The Court has to assume the grounds to be true and it is not its function to examine the truth or otherwise of the allegations mentioned in the grounds.
 [58H], (3) It could not also be contended that the matter merely affects law and order but not public order. When an armed robbery or dacoity is alleged to have been committed by the petitioner armed with guns and with his associates similarly armed, in a running train, it no longer remains a matter of simple law and order as the peaceful tempo of life of the community at large is also affected thereby. It not only puts the passengers from various Places and walks of life in the particular third class compartment in fear, but puts the passengers of the entire train and even of other running trains in panic. Public order and life of the community is thereby clearly disturbed and that amounts to public disorder which had to be prevented by action under the Act.
