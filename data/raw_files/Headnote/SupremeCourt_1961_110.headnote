 A Muslim died leaving some property and several heirs. Some of the heirs became evacuees and their 4/7th share in the property was declared under s. 7 of the Administration of Evacuee Property Act, 1950, to be evacuee property. There- after, proceedings were taken for the separation of the interest of the evacuees, but as none of the claimants appeared, the Competent Officer passed an order under s. II of the Evacuee Interest (Separation) Act, 1951, vesting the entire property in the Custodian.
 Held, that the order vesting the entire property in the Cus- todian was illegal. The share of the evacuees had been determined as 4/ 7ths and the Competent Officer was only required to separate it. Section II could not vest in the Custodian any property which was not evacuee property. This section deals only with cases where the whole property has been declared to be evacuee property and the claim is as mortgagor or mortgagee or to an undivided share in the property. In such cases in the absence of a claim having been filed or having been filed and found unsustainable, s.II vests the whole property in the Custodian.
