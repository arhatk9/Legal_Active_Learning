 The subject-matterof the assessee's appeal before the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal was the question as to what should be the proper written down value of its buildings, machinery etc., for calculating the depreciation allowance under s. 10(2)(vi) of the Income-tax Act.' 1922. The Department sought to support the orders of the Income-tax Officer and the Appellate Assistant Commissioner on the new ground that paragraph 2 of the Taxation Laws (Part B States) (Removal of Difficulties) Order, 1950, was applicable, and that certain amounts of depreciation which were allowed under the Industrial Tax Rules had to be deducted in arriving at the written down value. The Tribunal permitted the contenation to be raised and remanded the matter to the Income-tax Officer for considering the question whether the Industrial Tax Rules related to income-tax or super-tax or any law relating to tax on profits of business, for ascertaining whether any depreciation was allowed under those Rules, and whether such depreciation should be taken into account for the purpose of co putting the written down value. In this Court, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal-to entertain and go into the question raised by the Department for the first time before it and to remand the case in the manner it has done-was questioned.
 
HELD: Under s. 33(4) of the Act the Tribunal has got power to entertain the argument of the Department, to remand, and to give the directions to the Income-tax 'Officer.
 The Appellate. Tribunal Rules, 1946, made under s. 5A(8) of the Act, are merely procedural in character and do not, in any way,, circumscribe or control the power of the Tribunal under s. 33(4). [468 B-C]
