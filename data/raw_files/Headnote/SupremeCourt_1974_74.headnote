 The petitioner was detained by an order of the District Magistrate, Varanasi, U.P. under Sec. 3 (1) (a) (iii) of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971, with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community.
 On the questions, whether, when some of the grounds furnished by the detaining authority form the subject-matter of trial in criminal cases which are still sub-judice, the detention would be valid, and whether the detenu can be said to be reasonably able to make an effective representation against those grounds :
 
HELD : (a) In the case of preventive detention the grounds must be clear and definite to enable the detenu to make a real and effective representation to the Government to establish his innocence. [818 C] (b) Being faced with a criminal prosecution in a trial which is pending against him, although, the detenu has not got a proper and reasonable opportunity in accordance with law to make an effective representation against the impugned order of detention covered by the said proceeding, because, by disclosing his defence and certain facts lie would be handicapped in defending himself in the criminal court.
 [818 B-D] (c) On the question whether it is open to the detaining authority to choose two parallel proceedings against the detenu held that the fact that the ground of detention could be a subject matter of criminal prosecution is I not enough to vitiate a detention order if the detaining authority does not choose to prosecute him but only passes an order of detention in accordance with law. The choice of the authority concerned for the mode of tackling the illegal activity cannot per se be illegal and the order of detention is to be judged on its merits. The position however will be entirely different if the authority concerned makes an order of detention tinder the Act and also prosecutes him in a criminal case on the self-same facts. The detaining authority cannot take recourse to two parallel and simultaneous proceeding nor can take recourse to a ground which is the subject matter of a criminal trial. [818 D-G] (d) Under the Act. the decision of the authorities is subjective one and if one of the grounds is non-existent or irrelevant or is not available under the law the entire detention order will fall since it is not possible to predicate as to whether the detaining authority would have made an order of detention even in the absence of the non- existent or irrelevant ground [819 C-E] (e) Although the aim and object of the order of detention would be laudable and the antecedents of a detenu be extremely reproachable, yet, it is essential that if it is desired to detain a person without trial, the authorities concerned should conform to the requirements of the law.
 The shady antecedents of the detenu cannot provide a Justification for noncompliance with the mandatory provisions. The scope of the inquiry in the case of preventive detention based upon subjective satisfaction being necessarily narrow and limited, the scrutiny of the count has to be even stricter than in a normal case of punitive trial. [819E-F] In the present case, if the District Magistrate had not at all taken recourse to the facts of the criminal cases pending against the detenu in Bihar in coming to a conclusion about his reasonable satisfaction for making the order of detention the matter would have been different.
 But it is clear that the District Magistrate has been influenced by the existence of the criminal prosecutions in Bihar and he has chosen those grounds to furnish as aids to his satisfaction in order to make 814 an order of detention. The grounds with reference to the pending criminal prosecutions in Bihar could not provide a valid basis for making the order of detention particularly because those cases are pending trial in Bihar and in view of the decision of the Patna High Court in connection with one of them. Hence the detention order is invalid. [819 A- C] Mohd. Salim Khan v. Shri C. C. Bose, Deputy Secretary to the Government of West Bengal and another, A.I.R. 1972 S.C.
