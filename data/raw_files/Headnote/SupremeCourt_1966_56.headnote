 The appellant claimed refund of a specific amount as excess amount of excise duty recovered from it by assessing it under a wrong item, but the excise authorities rejected the claim and the appellant's revision application to the respondent was also dismissed. In its application for leave to appeal to this Court under Art. 136, the appellant challenged the order of the respondent on the assumption that the order under appeal had been passed by the respondent acting as a Tribunal, and reiterated its claim for the specified amount. The appellant contended that only fixed court fee of Rs. 250 was payable because it was not possible to estimate at a money value the subject matter in dispute and not fee on an ad valorem basis at the rate prescribed in Entry 2 in Schedule 111, Part 11 of the Supreme Court Rules.
 
HELD : The claim made by the appellant was for a definite, ascertained amount and therefore it is not a case where it is not possible to estimate at a money value the subject matter in dispute. Nor can it be said that if the appeal before this Court succeeds, it would still be necessary for the appellant to take any further steps to recover the amount of refund, because, this Court can direct the appropriate authorities to grant the refund. Therefore, the appellant should pay court fee as prescribed by Entry 2 in Part 11 of Schedule III of the Supreme Court Rules, on an ad valorem basis.
