 The respondent-landlord instituted a suit under the Bombay Rent Act for possession against the appellant-tenant on two grounds, namely, arrears in payment of rent and bona fide requirement of the premises for personal use and occupation.
 A compromise decree was passed. When the appellant applied for execution of the decree, the appellant contended inter alia that the compromise decree had been passed by the Rent Court without satisfying itself as to the existence of grounds of eviction under the Act and hence, being a nullity, was not executable. The Executing Court accepted the contention. In appeal, the appellate Court set aside the dismissal and remanded the matter holding that there were admissions in the compromise itself from which the Court could be satisfied about the existence of both the statutory grounds for eviction alleged in the plaint. A revision to the High Court was dismissed.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) The public policy permeating this Act is the protection of tenants against unreasonable eviction.
 Construing the provisions of s.12,13 and 28 of the Act in the light of this policy, it should be held that the Rent Court under the Act is not competent to pass a decree for possession either in invitum or with the consent of the parties on a ground which is decors the Act or ultra vires the Act. The existence of one of the statutory grounds mentioned in s. 12 and 13 is a sine qua non to the. exercise of jurisdiction by the Rent Court. Parties, by their consent cannot confer jurisdiction on the Rent Court to do something which, according to the legislative mandate, it could not do. [550C-E] Shah Rasiklal Chunilal v. Sindhi Shyamlal Mulchand, 12 Guj.
 Law Reporter 1012, approved.
 Barton v. Fiacham, [1921] 2 K. B. 291 at 299, applied.
 (2) The fact that 0. 23 r. 3, C.P.C., is applicable to the proceedings does not remove. that fetter or empower the Rent Court to make a decree for eviction dehors the statute.
 Even under that provision the Court, before ordering that the compromise be recorded, is required to satisfy itself about the lawfulness of the agreement. Such lawfulness or otherwise of the agreement is to be judged also on the ground whether terms of the compromise are consistent with the provisions of the Rent Act. [551 A-C] (3) But, if at the time of the passing of the decree there was some material be- fore the Court on the basis of which the Court could prima facie be satisfied about the existence of a statutory ground for eviction, it win be presumed that the court was so satisfied and the decree for eviction, though passed on the basis of the compromise would be valid.
 Such material may be in form of evidence recorded or produced or it may be partly or wholly be in the shape of express or implied admissions made in the compromise agreement. Admissions if true and clear are by far the best proof of the facts admitted especially when they are judicial admissions admissible under s. 58, Evidence Act.
 [552F-H] In the present case, because of the admission to pay the arrears of rent and mesne profits at the contractual rate and the withdrawing of his application for fixation of standard rent, there was no dispute with regard to the amount of standard rent, and there was an admission that the rent was in arrears. The admission of these material facts constitute a ground for eviction under s. 12 (3)(a). [553B- D] Bahadur Singh v. Muni Subrat Dass, [1969] 2 S.C.R. 432, Kaushalya Devi v. Shri K. L. Bansal, [1968] INSC 307; [1969] 2 S.C.R. 1048, and Ferozi Lal Jain v. Man Mal, [1970]. 3 S.C.C. 181, held inapplicable.

 (4) Further the Executing Court is not competent to go behind the decree if the decree on the face of it discloses some material on the basis of which the rent court could be satisfied with regard to the existence of a statutory ground for eviction. If on the face of it the decree does not show the existence of such material or jurisdictional fact, the Executing Court may look to the original record of the trial court to ascertain whether there was any material furnishing a foundation for the trial court's jurisdiction to pass the decree. The moment it finds that prima facie such material existed its task is complete, and it was not competent to go behind the decree and question its validity. [553G-554B]
