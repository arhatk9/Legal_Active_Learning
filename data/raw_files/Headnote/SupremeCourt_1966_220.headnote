 The respondent bank had its head office at Mangalore. It also opened a branch at Karachi in 1946. After the partition of India in 1947 the currencies of the two countries continued to be at par until there was a devaluation of the Indian Rupee in 1949. The new exchange ratio between the two countries was not determined until February 27, 1951. On this date it was agreed that a hundred Pakistani Rupees were equivalent to a hundred and forty-four Indian Rupees. On the date of the devaluation of the Indian Rupee the Karachi Branch of the Bank bad with it a sum of Rs. 3,97,221 belonging to its head office. Owing to the difficulties of the currency situation it was impossible to remit the amount to the head office for quite a long time. On July 1, 1953, the State Bank of Pakistan permitted its remittance to India. In terms of Indian currency the said amount became equivalent to Rs. 5,71,038.
 The appreciation in the value of the money was claimed by the bank to be only a capital gain but the Income-tax Officer disallowed the claim holding that the appreciation had resulted in a revenue receipt. Appeals before the Assistant Commissioner and the Appellate Tribunal were rejected. A reference was then made to the High Court.
 According to the agreed statement of case the amount of Rs.
 3,97,221 was 'blocked' and 'sterilised' for the period from the devaluation of the Indian Rupee up to the time of its remittance to India. The High Court took the view that the appreciation of the value of the money did not arise in the course of the trading operation of the Bank and was not therefore taxable as a revenue receipt. The Commissioner of Income-tax appealed to this Court.
 
HELD: The money in question changed its character of stock-in-trade' when it was 'blocked' and 'sterilised'.
 According to the finding of Tribunal it was not utilised for any internal banking operations in Pakistan. The increment in the value of the money owing to the exchange fluctuation was therefore rightly treated by the High Court to be a capital receipt. [862 E] Case law referred to.
