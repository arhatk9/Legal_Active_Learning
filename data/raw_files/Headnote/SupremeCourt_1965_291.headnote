 The Regional Transport Authority South Arcot granted a stage carriage permit on the route Kumbakonam to Neiveli to the first respondent out of a large number of applicants. This led to seven appeals against the grant of the permit before the State Transport Appellate Tribunal. They were heard together and the Tribunal set aside the order of the Transport Authority granting the permit to the first respondent and instead granted the permit to the appellant.
 Thereupon the first respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court at Madras challenging the order of the Appellate Tribunal. A single Judge of the High Court relying on this court's decision in D. Rajagoapala Naidu v. State Transport Appellate Tribunal and Ors. allowed the writ petitions. In B. Rajagopala Naidu's cam this Court had held that Government Order No. 1298 issued by the Government of Madras under s. 43A as introduced by the Madras Amending Act No. 20 of 1948 in Motor Vehicles Act No. 4 of 1939, could not be issued under that section inasmuch as it purported to give in respect of matters which had been entrusted to Tribunals constituted under the Act and which had to be dealt with by them in a quasi-judicial manner. Against the order of the single Judge letters patent appeal was filed by the present appellant. The Division Bench the appeal, but remanded the case to the Appellate Tribunal for reconsidering the matter in the light of the decision in B. Rajagopala Naidu's case.
 In the peculiar circumstances of the case the High Court directed that all the seven appeals which had been disposed of by the Appellate Tribunal by a single order should be reconsidered as the taint affected the entire appellate order which was one. The appellant came to this Court by special leave.
 the material questions that came up for consideration were whether the High Court was right in remanding the case to the Appellate Tribunal and not to the Transport Authority, and whether the High Court was right in asking the Appellate Tribunal to revive and re-hear all the appeals even of those parties which had not gone to the High Court.
 
HELD : (i) The Appeal Court rightly pointed out that there might be public inconvenience specially in the matter of new routes if the order of the Transport Authority is also set aside with the result that such new routes would be without any transport facility. It is therefore always a question to be decided in each case whether the remand should be to the Appellant Tribunal or the Transport Authority. In most cases it would be proper if the remand is made to the Appellate Tribunal. [11 P. G] 8 (ii) Even though all the appeals with respect to one route may have been disposed of by a single appellate order in form, in reality the appellate order consists of as many orders as there are appeals disposed of thereby. In the present case if none of the parties concerned in the seven appeals had come to- the High Court in writ proceedings within reasonable time, the order of the Appellate Tribunal would have become final, even though it might have been influenced by the Government Order in question. The High Court had no jurisdiction to interfere with the orders of the Appellate Tribunal either in favour or against the parties which had not come to it. The remand was therefore to be confined only to those parties which came to the High Court. [12 C-G]
