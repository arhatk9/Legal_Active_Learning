 The petitioner, a public limited company manufacturing various steel and iron products, requested the respondent Madras Government for an exemption from tax under s. 12 of the Madras Electricity Act No. IV of 1962 which provided that where energy of a specified type was consumed in the process of manufacture or production in an industrial undertaking licensed under the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act 65 of 1951, no electricity tax shall be payable on the energy so consumed for a period of three years from the date of the commencement of production. The petitioner's case was that though it did not require a licence under s. 11 of the later Act in view of the notification issued by the Central Govt. under s. 29-B by which industrial undertakings having fixed assets not exceeding Rs. 10 lakhs were not required to obtain a licence, it was still governed by Act 65 of 1951 for the purposes of s. 12 of Madras Act No. IV of 1962. The respondent Government rejected the claim on the ground that no exemption could be granted under s. 12 of the Madras Act to undertakings which were not licensed under the Central Act.
 Thereupon the petitioner filed a writ petition in the High Court attacking s. 12 of the Madras Act under Art. 14 of the Constitution and contending that it should also have been granted the exemption claimed. The petition was dismissed by a Single Judge without issue of notice by a short order to the effect that the petitioner was not entitled to the benefit of s. 12 of the Madras Act and the validity of the Section could not be attacked as the exemption provided was based on sohnd principles. An appeal to a Division Bench was also dismissed. The petitioner did not file an appeal from the order of the Division Bench but chose to file the present petition under Art. 32 claiming the same reliefs as in his earlier petition to the High Court. The respondent raised a preliminary objection that the petition was not maintainable in view of the petitioners failure to file an appeal from the order of the Division Bench. It was also contended on the merits that s. 12 of the Madras Act was not hit by Art. 14.
 HELD : dismissing the petition :
 (i) The preliminary objection must be upheld.
 The petitioner did not appeal from the order of the Division Bench. The High Court made a speaking order dealing with the merits of the case and the fact that no notice was issued to the other side before such an order was passed was immaterial in the circumstances. The present petition under Art. 32 on the same facts for the same relief based on the same article of the Constitution was therefore barred, L744 D] Where a writ petition is dismissed without notice to the other side but the order of dismissal is speaking order and the petition is disposed of on merits, that would still amount to res judicata and would bar a petition under Art.
 
32. The petitioner's only proper remedy in such a case would he to come in appeal from such a speaking order passed on the merits. [743 E-F] Daryao v. The State of U.P., [1961] INSC 118; [1962] 1 S.C.R. 574; explained and applied.
 (ii) Section 12 of the Madras as Act was not hit by Art. 14 of the Constitution.
