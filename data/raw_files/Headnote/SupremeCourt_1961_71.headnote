 The appellant was selling butter which was found to be below the standard prescribed. He was convicted under s. 16(1) read with S. 7(1) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954, and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two months and to pay a fine of Rs. 250/-. He contended (i) that butter prepared from curd was not butter within the meaning of r. A-11, 0. 5 of Appendix B to the Rules which defined butter to mean 'the product prepared exclusively from milk or cream, and (ii) that the butter was not adulterated as no foreign article bad been added to it.
 Held, that the appellant had been rightly convicted.
 Butter prepared from curd also came within the definition of " butter " in r. A-11, 0. 5 of Appendix B to the Rules. The plain meaning of the words used in the rule indicated that butter prepared from milk or cream, by whatever process, was comprehended by the definition. Even where milk was first converted into curd and then butter prepared therefrom, the butter was still prepared from milk.
 Sadashiv v. P. V. Bhalerao, I.L.R. [1959] Bom. 1800, approved.
 Section 2(i)(1) lays down that an article of food shall be deemed to be adulterated if its quality or purity falls below the prescribed standard or its constituents are present in quantities which are in excess of the prescribed limits of variability. If the prescribed standard is not attained, the statute treats' such article, by fiction, as adulterated food though in fact no foreign article is added to it. Selling butter below the prescribed standard amounted to selling adulterated butter.
