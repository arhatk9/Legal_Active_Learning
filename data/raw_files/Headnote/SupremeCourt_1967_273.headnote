 The appellant-licence inspector, filed a complaint against the respondent. The appellant had obtained permission to file the complaint from the Deputy Health Officer, who had been delegated the powers under s. 69(1) of the Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporation Act, 1949, by the Municipal Commissioner. The respondent was convicted, but, the High Court in revision, set aside the conviction. In appeal to this Court, the appellant contended that there was no limiting words in the order delegating the power to the Deputy Health Officer that he should file a complaint himself 'and not authorise others; and that- power to take proceedings includes power to authorise others to institute proceedings in the context of the Act. Dismissing the appeal, HELD : Only the authorities mentioned in s. 481 read with s.
 69 could launch proceedings, against persons charged with offenses under the Act or the rules, regulations or bye-laws made under it. A person who files a complaint under the Act must show that he has the authority to file that complaint and that authority cannot be conferred upon by an erroneous interpretation long acquiesced. [406 D-F] The words "take proceedings" cannot be interpreted. to mean "order proceedings to be taken" because the word "take" is an English word and only a meaning which it bears in the English language can be ascribed to it.
