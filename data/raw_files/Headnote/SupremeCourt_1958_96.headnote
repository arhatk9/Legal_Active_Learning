 The respondent had been carrying on business in the produc- tion and supply of limestone since 1920, and under an agreement entered into with the Bengal Iron Company was supplying all its requirements of limestone and dolomite.
 Sometime later the Indian Iron and Steel Company took over all the assets and liabilities of the former company.
 Subsequently differences having arisen between the respondent and the Indian Iron and Steel Company they entered into an agreement on May 9, 1940, in settlement of all the disputes between them whereby, inter alia, the respondent was to work a quarry of the company for a period Of 25 years and to supply the limestone quarried therefrom to the company according to its requirements and to get from the railway authorities facilities for transporting the limestone more economically; and it was agreed that till such facilities were given, the respondent was to be paid Rs. 4000/- every month. Under the agreement the respondent had the right to work other quarries of his own and supply limestone so quarried to other purchasers. The railway authorities having declined to grant facilities, it became impossible to carry out the agreement in the manner contemplated by the parties, who, thereupon, entered into a fresh agreement on August 2, 1941, terminating 111 the agreement dated May 9, 1940, on certain terms. The agreement provided inter alia (1) that the Company should pay " Rs. 2,50,000/- to the sellers as solatium besides the monthly instalments of Rs. 4000/-", remaining unpaid under the contract dated May 9, 1940, (2) that the company should purchase limestone from the respondent for a period of 12 years, and (3) that the respondent was to be appointed the loading contractors of the Company for loading iron ore. On a question as to whether the the sum of Rs. 2,50,000/- was liable to tax, the respondent claimed that it was not, 'being a capital receipt but the income-tax authorities held that it was a trading receipt and was income chargeable to tax. The High Court however held on a reference under s.
 66(1), that the income was not chargeable to tax, and hence the present appeal. In support of the appeal, the respon- dent contended inter alia that (1) the contract dated May 9, 1940, was for a period of 25 years of which more than 23 years had still to run at the time of the settlement, and it was therefore an asset of an enduring character, capital in character, and the compensation paid therefor was a capital receipt, and (2) that the true character of the agreement was that it brought into existence an arrangement which would enable the respondent to carry on a business and was not itself any business, and any payment made for the termination of such an agreement was a capital receipt.
 Held, that the contract of May 9, 1940, was entered into by the respondent in the ordinary course of his business and that the sum of Rs. 2,50,000/- which was paid as solatium for the cancellation of that contract, was a revenue receipt and was chargeable to tax.
 There is a distinction between a contract entered into in the usual course of business and an agency contract. While it may be possible to regard the latter as merely a framework for doing business, the former constitutes the business itself, and, therefore, compensation paid for the termination of the former kind of contract must be held to be revenue, whereas compensation paid for the termination of the latter might be capital in character.
 It would make no difference in the character of the receipt, when it is compensation for cancellation of a trading contract, whether its performance is to consist of a single act or a series of acts spread over a period.
