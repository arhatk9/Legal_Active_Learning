 A licence holder from the State for distribution of grain, appointed the appellant as his commission agent for the sale of the grain. The agreement provided that the appellant should be in possession of the grain purchased and dispose:
 it of in accordance with the directions given by the licence holder. Later the State Government paid to the licence holder, the price of the stock then in the possession of the appellant and took over the stock. The appellant, while handing over the grain, informed the Government that the licence holder owed him money tinder the agreement. He filed a suit to recover the amount from the State Government and the son of the licence holder (the father having died meanwhile). Though the plaint did not set out the basis of the claim against the State the trial court decreed the suit, against both defendants, but did not give any interest from the date of suit till date of decree. In appeal by the State, and cross-objections by the appellant claiming the interest, the High Court set aside the decree against the State, but did not pass any order on the cross-objections.
 In appeal to this Court, the appellant claimed to be pledgee of the goods and that he had a lien over the goods.
 
HELD : (1) The agreement does not show that the goods had been pledged to the appellant.
 The question whether an agent can enforce his lien in a particular case is a mixed question of law and facts. As a general rule, in order to have a lien an agent must have some possession, custody or control or disposing power in or over the subject-matter in which lien is claimed. The lien does not arise where the possession of the property is acquired by the, 'agent under a contract which expressly or impliedly shows a contrary intention or where it is delivered to him for a particular purpose inconsistent with the existence of a lien. Further, the lien is lost by parting with the possession, unless at the time of parting he expressly or impliedly reserved his right of lien, or the goods were obtained from him by fraud or unlawful means In the present case, from the mere fact that the appellant informed the Government that his principal owed him money, while voluntarily parting possession with the goods, it could not be said that he reserved expressly or by implication his right of lien against the State, if any.

 (2) As against the second respondent, the appellant was entitled to the principal amount decreed and the lower courts should have also decreed interest from date of suit till date of decree. [681 F-F]
