 The respondent was doing the duties of a civil agent in a Bank. His duties were those of clerk and the salary paid to him was that of a clerk. Pursuant to a scheme of amalgamation prepared by the Reserve Bank under s.
 45(4)(d)(ii) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the Bank was amalgamated with the State Bank of Travancore. The respondent was admitted as an employee of the State Bank and was allotted the duties of a 'civil agent'. But the State Bank directed that 'civil agents should be treated as 'subordinate staff consisting of peons, watchmen and sweepers, whose scale of remuneration was very much lower than that of the clerical staff. He submitted representations to the authorities which were rejected. The Reserve Bank of India, to which the matter was referred under s. 45(5) of the Act, held that the State Bank was justified in placing the respondent in the subordinate cadre which was a residual cadre in the State Bank.
 On the question : (1) Whether the decision of the Reserve Bank was final and binding under the second proviso to s.
 45(5)(i); and (2) Whether the terms and conditions of the respondent's service were not affected by the classification of his post in the subordinate cadre, 
HELD : (1) The decision of the Reserve Bank whether the qualifications and experience of any of the employees of a transferor bank are the same as or equivalent to the qualifications and experience of employees of corresponding rank or status of a transferee bank is declared final by the second proviso to s. 45(5)(i) of the Act. But finality is not attached to any other matter. In the present case, however, the Reserve Bank purported to determine that the rank and status of civil agents working in the original Bank corresponded with the rank and 'status of the subordinate cadre under the State Bank. That was a matter which could not be referred to the Reserve Bank and, its decision thereon was not final. [32 C-D; 33 A-D] (2)Under cl. (ii) of the proviso to s. 45(5) (i), a transferee bank must grant the same remuneration and same terms and conditions of service as are applicable to employees of corresponding rank or status of the transferee bank subject to the qualifications and experience of the employee being the same as or equivalent to those of such other employees of the transferee bank. That is, a person performing certain duties in a transferor bank when admitted into the service of the transferee bank must be fitted in a cadre which is equivalent in status and rank with the status and rank of the employees in the transferor bank. In grading him into the cadre of equivalent status and rank, experience and qualifications may be taken into account, but, the rank and status enjoyed by him in the transferor bank cannot be ignored. [33 F-H; 34 A-D] 29 In the present case, it was conceded that the respondent satisfied the conditions as to rank, status and qualifications of a clerk in the State Bank and it was only contended that he did not have the requisite experience On the ground of lack of experience the respondent could not be deprived of his rank and status in the transferee Bank.
 Also, the decision of the Reserve Bank that the subordinate cadre was a residual cadre is not supported by any evidence.
 Therefore, it was not open to the State Bank to fit the respondent, who was performing the duties of a clerk in the original bank, into a subordinate cadre manned by employees performing duties, which are not clerical, but of peons and the like. [33 D-F; 34 D]
