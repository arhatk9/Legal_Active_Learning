 Section 300, clause thirdly, of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, consists of two parts. Under the first part it has to be shown that there was an intention on the part of the accused to inflict the particular injury which was found on the body of the deceased. The second part requires that the bodily injury intended to be inflicted was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. So far as the first part is concerned, the court has to see whether the injury which was found on the deceased was the one intended by the accused or whether it was accidental without his having intended to cause that bodily injury. Once it is found that the injury was not accidental and that the accused intended to cause the injury which was actually inflicted and found on the body of the deceased the first part is satisfied. The court should then go into the second part and find, in the light of the medical evidence, whether the bodily injury inflicted was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. If the court finds that the requirements of both the parts have been satisfied, the case is covered by the clause unless it falls within one of the exceptions. [508 C-F] In the present case, the circumstances of the case showed that the assault by the accused on the deceased was premeditated and that the blow given by the accused to the deceased was not accidental. The fact that the accused aimed the blow on the head of the deceased-with a lathi showed that it was his intention to cause the precise injury which was found on the head of the deceased. As the injury was deliberate and not accidental, and as according to the medical evidence the injury was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, and as it actually resulted in the death of the deceased, the case would fall squarely within the ambit of clause 'thirdly' of s. 300, I.P.C., and the appellant would be guilty of the offence of murder. The fact that the accused gave only one blow would not mitigate the offence and make him guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder [508 F-H; 509 D-E] Observations in Chamru Budhwa v.
