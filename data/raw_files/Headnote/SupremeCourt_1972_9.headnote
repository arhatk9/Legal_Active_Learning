 On May 4, 1905 a licence was granted tinder s. 4(1) of' the Indian Electricity Act, 1903 to Crompton & Co. Ltd. for the supply of electricity in the municipal area of Nagpur. A notification granting the above license was published in the Central Provinces Gazette on May 6, 1905. The license provided that the right of the government to purchase the undertaking shall arise after 42 years from the commencement of the license and after every subsequent period of 10 years. Para 4 of the license provided that it would come into force and have effect on the (lay when the notification confirming it was published in the Central Provinces Gazette and that day would for the purpose of Act, be deemed to be the commencement of the license. On January 1, 1911 the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 came into force. On June 28, 1913 a notification permitting the assignment of the licence in favour of the Nagpur Electric Light and Power Company Ltd. (respondent herein) was published in the gazette. On May 2, 1947 amendments in the terms and conditions of' the licence were made under s. 4(3) of the Act of 1910 and were published in the gazette. In the preamble it was stated that these amendments were "in 'he terms and conditions of the Nagpur Electricity licence grantees under the Public Works Deptt. Notification No. 45 dated 4th May 1905............ In the various amendments made throughout the reference was made to May 4. 1947 as being the date when various changes were deemed to start or operate. In clause 3 paragraph (o) (i) was provided that "Option of purchase given by sub-section 1 of section 7 of the Act shall be exercisable on the expiration of ten years or 4th May 1957 and the expiration of every subsequent period of ten years during continuance of this licence." On September 4, 1948 the Electricity Supply Act, 1948 came into force.
 Section 71 of this Act provided that the right and options to purchase under the Indian Electricity Act. 1910 were deemed to have been transferred to the Provincial (now State) Electricity Board. The Indian Electricity Amendment Act. 1959 (32 of 1959) amended Indian Electricity Act. 1910.
 In the newly inserted section 4A(1) the proviso thereto said that no alterations or amendments in the license shall be made except with the consent of the lisensee unless such consent was in the opinion of the State government unreasonably withheld. In the amended Act section 6 provided for the purchase of the licensee's undertaking by the State Electricity Board. but the old section 7 was allowed to continue. On September 15, 1965 notice was given to the respondent under sub-section (1) and' sub-section (6) of section 6 of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 whereby the respondent was required 20 to sell its undertaking to the Board on the midnight of 3rd/4th May, 1967 being the date of the expiry of the licence granted to it. Doubts arose as to the interpretation of clause 3 paragraph (o) (i) of the licence because of the use of the word 'or' between words 10 years and "the 4th May. 1957" in the said clause. The State Government on April 19, 1966 published a notification whereby in the said clause between the words "10 years" and "the 4th May, 1957" the word "on" was' substituted, the effect of which was that the option to purchase became exer- cisable on the expiration of period of 10 years on the 4th May. 1957. After this amendment another notice was given under sub-section and (6) of s. 6 of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 on April 26, 190. The words of this notice were the same as that of the earlier notice but it was expressly given in supersession of the earlier notice.. The respondent filed a writ petition under article 226 of the Constitution challenging the aforesaid notice dated April 26, 1966. The High Court held that since the operation of license commenced on May, 6, 1905 it could not terminate on May 4, 1957 and therefore the amendment of 1966 was invalid. In appeal to this Court it was common ground that the licensee had never replied to the letter of the State Electricity Board asking for its consent for the amendment of the licence in 1966 in terms of section 4A(1) of the Electricity Act.
 
HELD : (i) In the circumstances of the case there could be no doubt that the State Government was entitled to hold the opinion that the consent of the licensee for the purchase of undertaking had been unreasonably withheld. [27 E] (ii) Two interpretations were possible of clause 3 paragraph (o) (i) of the license, as it existed before the amendment dated April 19, 1966. One was that the word 'or' had been wrongly used by some printing mistake and the true word was "on". The other interpretation was that two dates had been provided for the exercise of the option; one, the expiration of ten years from May 6, 1947 the other being May 4, 1957.
 Thus there was genuine doubts about the real date and if the State Government sought to clarify the point it cannot be said that it made an unreasonable demand from the licensee.
 It was not a case where government was providing for the option to purchase which was not originally intended to be given. [26 F-H] (iii) The High Court was wrong in holding that May 6 was the relevant date because the notification relating to the original license was published on May 6, 1905. When the license was amended in 1947 with the consent of the licensee it proceeded on the basis that the 42 years period expired on May 3. 1947 because throughout the crucial effective date in the amendments is May 4, 1947. Para 4 of the original license thus ceased to have effect for the purpose of construing the license as amended in 1947 and subsequently.
 (iv) If clause (3) paragraph (o)(i) is interpreted in the light of the rest of the amendments made in the license in 1947, it is quite clear that the previous period was deemed to have expired on May 3, 1947 and the fresh period started on May 4, 1947 and the subsequent periods of 10 years ended on May 3, 1957 and May 3, 1967. It is impossible to read the license as amended in 1947 in any other way than that it was agreed that the period of 10 years in the license would start from May 4, 1947. The details of distribution system, the valuation of assets as on May 4, 1947 and other clauses all point to this conclusion. The license rightly talked of Sec. 7 of the Electricity Act because the license still provided for the start of period of 10 years from May 1947 and 21 this could only be provided for while the old sec. 7 stood.
 The notice dated April 26, 1966 was thus in accordance with terms of the license and the law. The impugned notice did not suffer from any infirmity. The appeal must accordingly be allowed. [28D-H]
