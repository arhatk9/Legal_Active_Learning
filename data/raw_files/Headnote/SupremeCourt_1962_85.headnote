 The respondent was in the employment of the appellant company. He refused to comply with orders given to him by various officers of the appellant company, from time to time. He was suspended and charge-sheeted. An enquiry was held. After the enquiry, the appellant referred the matter for the decision of the Labour Commissioner without giving any prior decision of its own. However, the Labour Commissioner refused to pass any order and directed the appellant to take such action as it thought fit. Thereupon, the appellant dismissed the appellant. As two disputes were pending between the appellant and its workmen at Allahabad and Meerut, the appellant sent applications by post on the same day to the two authorities for approval of the action taken. The Tribunal at Allahabad approved of the action but the Labour Court at Meerut refused to approve the same.
 However the Labour Court held that the appellant was not motivated by victimisation and a prima facie case had been made out for the dismissal of the respondent. The approval was refused on the ground that the application for approval had been made after the dismissal of the respondent and the same should have been made before dismissing him.
 Held, that the employer can discharge or dismiss the employee before obtaining the approval of Tribunal or the Labour Court concerned. The use of the word "approval" suggests, that something has been done by the employer who seeks approval of the same from the Tribunal. If the intention had been that the employer could not pass the order of dismissal or discharge without first obtaining the approval, the language used would have been different. The legislature intended that the employer would have the right to pass an order of discharge or dismissal subject to two conditions, namely, payment of wages for one month and making of an. application to the authority concerned for 619 approval of the action taken. If the Tribunal does not approve of the action taken by the employer, the result would be that the action taken by him would fall and the workmen would be deemed never to have been dismissed or discharged and would continue to be in the service of the employer.
 The dismissal or discharge of an employee, payment of wages and the making of an application for approval should be simultaneous and part of the same transaction. When an employer dimisses or discharges an employee, he should immediately pay him or offer to pay him wages for one month and also make an application to the Tribunal for approval at the same time. Although all this cannot be done literally simultaneously, the conduct of the employer should show that the three things were done as a part of the same transaction.

 It is against the rules of interpretation to add words to a provision, when the provision, as it stands, is capable of a reasonable meaning which will give effect to the intention of the legislature even on the words as they stand.
