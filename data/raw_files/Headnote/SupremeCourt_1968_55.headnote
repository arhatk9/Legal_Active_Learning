 On April 15, 1940 respondent No. 1 took on ten years' lease a site for the purpose of building a cinema theatre, from a partnership firm. He thereafter built a cinema theatre on the land. Appellant No. 1 in 1948 instituted a suit for dissolution of the firm and for accounts. Respondent No. 1 who was impleaded as a defendant resisted the suit. In 1950 the firm filed a suit to evict the first Respondent from the leased land. In this suit appellant No. 1 was also impleaded as a defendant and he claim-ad that in addition to his original 23 shares in the firm he had acquired 39 shares by purchase. In 1953 respondent No. 1 also filed a suit alleging that all the partners of the firm except the appellant had entered into an oral agreement with him on July 6, 1952 to sell 137 shares in the site except the 23 shares belonging to appellant No. 1; that 98 shares had actually been sold to him; that 39 shares had not been sold to him and had been instead sold to appellant No. 1.
 Respondent No. 1 thereafter claimed specific performance of the agreement to sell the aforesaid 39 shares by their owners and contended that the sale of those shares in favour of appellant No. 1 was not binding upon him. The trial court decided against respondent No. 1 but the High Court decided in his favour. In appeal before the Court the following questions came up for consideration : (i) whether there was an oral agreement between 'respondent No. 1 and all partners of the firm other than appellant No., 1 for sale of their shares on July 6, 1952; (ii) whether the oral agreement was ineffective because the parties contemplated the execution of a formal document or because the mode of payment of the purchase money was not actually agreed upon;
 (iii) whether in respect of the 39 shares purchased by him appellant No. 1 was a purchaser without notice; (iv) whether in the absence of an application under s. 2 of the Partition Act 1893 the High Court was right in giving a direction that as far as possible the site upon which the cinema building stood should be allotted to the share of respondent No. 1 if it was comprised within the 137 shares to which he was entitled.
 
HELD : (i) On the facts of the case the High Court was right in holding that there was an agreement to. sell 137 shares in the site to respondent No. 1.
 (ii) A mere reference to a future formal contract does not prevent the existence of a binding agreement between the parties unless the reference to a future contract is made in such terms as to show that the parties did not intend to be bound until a formal contract is signed. The question depends upon the intention of the parties and the special circumstances of each particular case. In the present case the evidence did not show that the drawing up of a written agreement was a pre-requisite to the coming into effect of the oral agreement. [393 C-D] 388 Nor did the absence of a specific agreement as to the mode of payment necessarily make the agreement ineffective.
 Since the vital terms of the contract like the price and are of the land and the time for completion of the sale were all fixed.

L395 A-B] (iv) In the absence of an application by the respondent under s. 2 of the- Partition Act the High Court had no power to make a direction as to the particular portion of the site to be allotted to respondent No. 1 on partition.
