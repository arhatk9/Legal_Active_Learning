 The appellant, a stranger to the suit, was the auction- purchaser of the judgment-debtor's immovable property in execution of an ex parte money decree. On the question whether he was entitled to a confirmation of the sale, under O.XXI, r. 92, Civil Procedure Code, notwithstanding the fact that after the holding of the sale the ex parte decree was set aside.
 HELD : The sale should be confirmed.
 The law makes ample provision for the protection of the interests of the judgment-debtor, when his property is sold in execution. He can file an application for setting aside the sale under the provisions of O.XXI, rr. 89 and 90.
 Apart from exceptional cases when a court will refuse to confirm a sale because it was held without giving notice to the judgment debtor, or the court was misled in fixing the reserve price, or where there was no decree in existence at the time when the sale was held, ordinarily, if a sale had been validly held, an application for setting it aside can only be made under O.XXI, rr. 89 to 91. If no such application was made, or when such an application was made and disallowed, the court has no choice but to confirm the sale. [78 F-H; 79 H; 80 A-B] Case law reviewed.
