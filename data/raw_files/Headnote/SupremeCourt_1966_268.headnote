 The petitioners were school teachers in the service of the State of Jammu & Kashmir. Persons below them in the seniority list were promoted to the higher grade because the State Government in making the promotions gave- 50% of the higher posts to Muslims, 60% of the remain50% to Jammu Hindus and the rest to Kashmiri Pandits and Sikhs. its method of reservation was justified under Art. 16 of the Constitution an the ground that Muslims all over the State and Hindus in Jammu were backward communities. The petitioners were Kashmiri Pandits. They came to this Court under Art. 32.
 
HELD : The predominant concept underlying Art. 16 is equality of opportunity in the matter of employment; and without detriment to that concept, the State is enabled to make reservations in favour of backward classes to give a practical content to the concept of equality. It is impli- cit in the article- that the doctrine of equality of opportunity shall-be reconciled with that of reservation in favour of backward classes in such a way that the latter while serving the cause of backward classes shall not unreasonably encroach upon the field of equality. [268 G-H] The power under cl. 4 of Art. 16 can only be exercised in favour of backward classes of citizens. While the State has necessarily to ascertain whether a particular class of citizens are backward or not, having regard to acceptable criteria its is not the final word on the question, it is a justifiable issue. The power under cl. (4) is also conditioned by the fact that in regard any backward classes of citizens there is no adequate representation in the services of the State, [269 A-B] A class cannot be accepted as backward merely because it is not adequately represented in the services under the State.
 Such a contention if accepted would exclude the really backward classes from the benefit of the provision and confer the benefit only on a class of citizens who, though rich and cultured have taken to other avocation in life [270 B-C] [On the material before it the Court found it impossible to say whether the Muslims of the entire State of Jammu and Kashmir and the Hindus of Jammu Province were backward communities within the meaning of Art. 16. The High Court was therefore asked to collect the relevant material and to sent a report.] [270 E-G] M. R. Balaji v. State of Mysore, [1963] Supp. 1 S.C.R. 439 and R. Chitralekha v.
