 After the decision of the Supreme Court in Devadasan's case [1963] INSC 182; [1964] 4 S.C.R. 680 holding that the reservation for the backward communities should not be so excessive as to create a monopoly or disturb unduly the legitimate claims of other communities, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued a memorandum modifying the 'carry forward' Rule so as to comply with the decision. The said memorandum was suitably modified by the Railway Board in its application to Railway services by their letter dated 6th October, 1964. The Railway Board prepared a "Model Roster" signifying the turns of reserved and unreserved vacancies. The note appended to the Roster provided "if there are only two vacancies to be filled on a particular occasion, not more than one may be treated as reserved and if there be only one vacancy, it should be treated as unreserved. If on this account, a reserved post is treated as unreserved, the reservation may be carried forward in the subsequent two recruitment years".
 In order to minimise the chances of reserved posts being converted into unreserved posts, the Railway Board modified the Reservation Rule in 1971 by adding the following words "if there is one post to be filled, selection should invariably be held for two posts, i.e. one actual and the other to cover unforeseen circumstances". The SouthEastern Railway, a Government of India Undertaking, runs two higher secondary schools for girls, one at Adra and the other at Kharagpur. A vacancy in the post of Headmistress of the Adra School arose in 1966. According to the Roster, being the first vacancy, it should have been treated as a reserved post. But since there was only one post, the same was treated as an unreserved post and the appointment was made on that footing. In December 1968, the Railway administration was to hold interviews for the post of Headmistress at the Kharagpur school as the incumbent Headmistress was to retire with effect from 1-1-1969. The selection was stayed by the Calcutta High Court on a writ petition filed by Respondent No. 8. a Scheduled Caste candidate, for readjustment of her seniority. Respondent No. 8 filed another writ petition under Civil Rule No. 499 (W) of 1969 in the Calcutta High Court calling upon the court to declare that the Kharagpur post should be treated as a reserved post. The second attempt at holding the interview by the Railway Administration was thwarted by an injunction issued by Calcutta High Court at the instance, of Respondent No. 8. in Civil Rule No. 499(W) of 1969, a learned single Judge of the Calcutta High Court and then, on appeal (No. 454 of 1971) the Division Bench of the High Court held that the Kharagpur post was a reserved post.
 Through the impugned letter of 6th November 1971 the Railway Administration made yet another attempt to MI the vacancy in terms of the modification of the Rule in 1971. The same was obstructed by an injunction issued by the single Judge of the High Court in a writ petition filed by the petitioner (Civil Rule No. 1395 (W) of 1972). However, at the time of final hearing, the learned single Judge recalled the Rule and the injunction issued on the ground that he was kept in the dark regarding the direction of the appellate court in appeal No. 454 of 1971. The petitioner did not prefer any appeal against the decision of the learned single Judge but filed a writ petition in this Court. The petitioner contended that on a true interpretation of the Rules, the vacancy in the post of Headmistress at Kharagpur ought to be treated as an unreserved vacancy and, secondly, that the carry forward provision of the rules is violative of articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. The respondents raised a preliminary objection to the maintainability of the writ petition on the ground that the same was barred by principles analogous to res-judicata.
 2-1-447 Sup CI/74 2 Rejecting the petition, 
HELD : (1) The vice of the original carry forward rule contained in the memorandum of January 28, 1952 of the Ministry of Home Affairs, regarding excessive weightage to to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes pointed out by Devadasan's case was cured by the Home Ministry's Memorandum of December 4, 1963 (as modified from time to time) and the Railway Administration's letter of October 6. 1964 and its amendments. The modified carry forward rule provided that in any recruitment year, the number of normal reserved vacancies and the 'carried forward' vacancies together shall not exceed 45% of the total number of vacancies". It also provided that the reservation shall not continue for more than two years. The Rule also prescribed that if there are two vacancies, not more than one should be treated as a reserved vacancy but if there was only one vacancy in the recruitment year, it should be treated as an unreserved post. The Roster prepared by letter dated January 16, 1964 of the Railway Administration as also its modification on August 23, 1971, designed to recruit two people where there was only one vacancy, reduced the eventual hardship that might be caused to the Scheduled Castes & Scheduled Tribes employees. The Carry Forward rule is thus no longer open to the ,objection that the reservation is so excessive as to create in Government employment a monopoly in favour of backward classes or to disturb unduly the legitimate claims of other communities. [9E-G] (2) The petitioner's objection to the letter dated August 23, 1973 of the Railway Administration and the impugned Memorandum of November 6, 1971, for the selection of two candidates, on the ground that the Railway Board's letter dated January 16, 1964, provided "that if there be only one vacancy, it should be treated as unreserved", was untenable.
 Such a construction would rob the rule of carry forward of its prime significance and will render it illusory. The open class reaped the benefit in 1966-67 when a reserved vacancy at Adra was treated as unreserved by the appointment of an open candidate, Smt. Gita Biswas. If the carry forward rule is to be given any meaning the vacancy shall have to be carried forward for the benefit of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes until the close of the financial year 1968-69. The Kharagpur vacancy was to be filled in on January 1, 1969 and hence it cannot go to the petitioner who, admittedly, does not belong to the reserved class. The construction sought to be put on the rule, by the petitioner would perpetuate a social injustice which has clouded the lives of a large section of humanity which is struggling to find its feet. Such a construction is contrary to the plain language of the letter of the Railway Board, the intendment of the rule and its legislative history [10D-11C] T. Devadasan v. Union of India anr.

 (3 ) As the petition No. 1395 of 1971 filed by the petitioner in the High Court was not dismissed on merits, the present petition cannot be barred by res judicata or by the application of any principle analogous to it. The petitioner was not a party to the writ petition filed by respondent No. 8 in the High Court and she had not sought any relief, directly or indirectly, against the High Court judgment in the said petition but had independently challenged the legality of the carry forward rule. The maintainability of the petitioner under Art. 32 is therefore not open to challenge. [6F-H].
