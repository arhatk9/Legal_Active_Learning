 The petitioners were direct recruits to the post of Deputy Engineers in Bombay Service of Engineers Class II. In petitions under Art. 32 of the Constitution they challenged the promotion, by the first respondent, of respondents 2 to 5 and others similarly situated to the posts of officiating Executive Engineers contrary to the principles of natural justice and in violation of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. It was contended that under the rules in force the respondents were only officiating Deputy Engineers and they had to put in after confirmation as Deputy Engineers seven years of actual service before being eligible for promotion as officiating Executive Engineers;
 further, particularly in the case of employees from the erstwhile State of Hyderabad the first respondent had contrary to the rules relating to promotion, by a resolution in 1967 directed those employees to be treated as having been appointed in the reorganised Bombay State as temporary Deputy Engineers only for the purpose of fixation of their seniority in the grade of Deputy Engineers and for promotion to higher posts and therefore those employees did not satisfy the 7 year requirement. Dismissing the petitions, 
HELD : (i) There is nothing in rules 6 7 and 8 of the 1960 Resolution to militate against the interpretation that the service specified there can be the total service of any description whether provisional, temporary or permanent. If promotion from Class II as officiating Executive Engineer ran only be made after 7 years of permanent service then there would be no meaning in including the temporary service in Class II for the purpose of absorption as Executive Engineers. If temporary service can be taken into account for confirmation as an Executive Engineer so can officiating service and if officiating service can be taken into consideration there is no impediment to a Deputy Engineer with 7 years' service whether officiating, temporary or permanent to be entitled for promotion as an Executive Engineer The, Resolution of 1963 makes it abundantly clear that the seniority of promotees should be considered as from the date of promotion to officiate continuously irrespective of whether the appointments were made in temporary or permanent vacancies. [626 G-627 E] (ii) Those respondents who were from Hyderabad State were in fact selected by the Hyderabad Public Service Commission as Assistant Engineers and would have been appointed as such but for the States Reorganisation Act which came into force from 1956. Had they been appointed earlier they would have had to be equated with the posts in Bombay. The allocation of persons after the reorganisation from one State to another was subject to the Reorganisation Act which dealt with matters pertaining to allocation, transfer, fixation of service conditions, seniority etc. The claims of the respondents who were allotted from the Hyderabad State arose earlier than the appointments of the petitioners and the Govern- 616 ment of Bombay and subsequently the Maharashtra Government was entitled to consider these claims and to give redress.
 There is no statutory bar or rule which prohibits the Government of Maharashtra from deeming their appointment as from 31-3-1967 for the limited purpose of seniority and promotion. [628 E-629 C] (iii) Further, when promotions are made on the basis of seniority-cummerit all that can be required is that persons entitled to promotion should be considered 'and if having been considered they have been left out they would have no claim to promotion as a matter of right. The petitioners did not possess the required length of service in Class II for them to be entitled to promotion when the respondents were included in the List and promoted; as such they cannot challenge the appointments made as being in violation of Arts. 14 or 16. 629 D-E] State of Mysore v.
