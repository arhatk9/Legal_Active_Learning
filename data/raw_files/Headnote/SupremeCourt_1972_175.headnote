 In 1967, the first respondent and S contested for election for a seat in the Madras Legislative Council from the City Graduates' constituency, which fell vacant. S was declared elected and his election was challenged by the first respondent on the grounds, inter alia, that, (a) in an elec- tion from graduates' constituencies political parties were not competent. to sponsor candidates, and S, having been sponsored by the Swatantra Party, was not qualified to, be a candidate; and (b) that S was guilty of corrupt practices under s. 123(5) of the Representation of the People Act, 195 
1. The High Court set aside the election of S on the second ground. On the first ground, while holding that there was no cvidence that S was sponsored by a political party, the High Court observed that election to the Legislative Council from the Graduates' constituency was a non-party election and that political parties should not nominate any candidate for that election. This Court, in appeal, confirmed the finding' of the High Court that S was guilty of corrupt practices, but did not at all touch on the observations of the High Court.
 In 1970, the first and second respondents contested for election to the Legislative Council from the same constituency, which was a two member constituency, and they were both declared elected. The first respondent objected to the candidature of the second respondent before the Returning Officer, on the grounds, (1) that the High Court had decided in the earlier election petition against S, that the constituency was a non-political one and that the second respondent, having been sponsored by the Swatantra Party, any votes given to him would amount to throwing away the votes; and (2) that the second respondent was not a, graduate and hence, was not qualified to be a candidate at the election, The Returning Officer rejected the objections, but the first respondent continued the propaganda against the second respondent by publishing leaf. lets as well as appeals in newspapers. After the two respondents had been declared elected, the appellant, an elector in the constituency, filed an election petition, challenging the election of the first respondent on the ground that by his propaganda he was guilty of corrupt practices under s.123(2) and (4).
 The High Court, dismissed the petition with penal costs.
 In appeal to this Court.
 887 
HELD: (1) A debate whether a candidate was qualified to stand or whether a political party was competent to nominate candidates for a particular constituency cannot be undue influence within the meaning of s. 123(2). [891G-H] (a) The first respondent placed his point of view before the electorate and sought support for it from the judgment of the High Court and the second respondent. relied upon a press note issued by the Election Commission. Candidates in elections are not only entitled to raise political issues but can also raise social, economic and legal issues. [892A- B] (b) The first respondent did not make any attack. on the character of the second respondent. The mere fact that his contention was untenable did not convert it into undue influence. [89-2B, H] S. K. Singh v. V. V. Giri, [1971] 2 S.C.R. 197, referred to.
 (2) The first respondent was not guilty of any corrupt practice under 123(4). [891G] (a) His propaganda that the second respondent was not qualified to be a candidate was only an opinion expressed by him. He did not make any statement of fact and an opinion on a question of law could not be considered to be a statement of fact., The fact that the Returning Officer held that the second respondent was qualified to be a candidate did not preclude the first respondent from debating the issue before the electorate. [891D-G] (b) It could not be said that the opinion was neither bona fide nogroundless as the contention was accepted as correct by the High Court in an election petition filed against second respondent, though that decision was reversed by this Court. [891E] (c) Also, the first respondent's propaganda that the High Court had held in the election petition against S, that the graduates' constituency was a nonpolitical constituency could not, be said to be a false statement, because, the High Court, in fact, said so. [891F-G] Guruji Shrihar Balirenz Jivatode v. Vithalrao and Ors, [1968] INSC 281; [1969] 2 S.C.R. 766, referred to.
 (3) This conclusion of the High Court, that the graduates' constituency was a non-political one, however, was wrong.
 [894H] In the form prescribed for nominating candidates for Legislative Assemblies there is a clolumn requiring the candidate to mention whether he belonged to a political party, and if so, to which party. The electors to the Legislative Assembly are by and large illiterate and to facilitate the freedom of voting the symbol system had been introduced. The symbols are of two type,, reserved and free. it was necessary for he Election Commission to know whether a candidate was a nominee of a political party, because, reserved 'symbols are allotted to candidates spon- sored by recognised political parties. The symbol system is unnecessary in the elections to the Legislative Council, because, the electors are generally educated. Therefore, the absence of such a column in the form prescribed for nominating candidates to the Legislative Council does not lead to the inference that election to the Legislative Council from the Graduates' constituency is non-political.
 [894 F-H; 895 A-C] (4) Article 171(3)(d) of the Constitution says that members of the Assembly should elect, as nearly as may be, 1/3 members of the Council from amongst persons who are not members of the Assembly; but no 888 such stipulation is made in the other clauses of the Article. But from that it could not be concluded that when elections are held under clauses (a),(b) and (c) of Art.
 171(3), the person to be elected must be one who is a member of the electoral college in question. The candidate may either be a member of the electoral college or even an, outsider. If a person possesses all the qualifications prescribed in the Constitution as well as in the Representation of the People Acts and has not incurred any of the disqualifications mentioned therein he is qualified to be a ,candidate. [894D-F] G. Narayanaswami v. G. Pannerselvam and Ors. Civil Appeal No. 189 of 1971 decided on April 12, 1972, followed.
 (5) In the circumstances of this case here was no justification for imposing penal costs.
