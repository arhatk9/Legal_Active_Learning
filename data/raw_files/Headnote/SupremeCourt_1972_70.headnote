 The rule of estopple has gained new dimensions in recent years and a new class of estoppel, viz., promissory estoppel has come to be recognised by Courts. Where parties enter into an agreement which is intended to create local relations between them and in pursuance of such arrangement on a party makes a promise to the other which he knows will be acted on and which is in fact acted on by the promise, the Court will treat the promise at finding on the promiser to the extent that it will not allow him to act inconsistently with it even although the promise may not be supported by consideration in the strict sense. [721D, 723C] Hungerford Investment Co. owned hundred per cent shares in Turner Morrison & Co. During the assessment years 1939-1940 to 1955-1956 the latter did not distribute dividends and the undistributed dividends were utilised by it as working capital. In all those years, the income-tax authorities took proceedings under s. 23-A of the Income Tax Act, 1922, and the deemed dividends were assessed in the bands of Hungerford. But. year after year, from 1939 to 1954, the Directors of Turner Morrison passed a resolution to the effect that it would be in-equitable to ask Hungerford to pay the tax levied and that Turner Morrison itself should discharge that liability. The resolutions were implemented by Turner Morrison by playing all the, taxes due from Hungerford. If the dividends had been declared Hungerford would have got more than two and a half times the tax paid on its behalf. The payments were not debited to the account of Hungerford; nor were they shown as debts due from Hungerford in the balance sheets. At no time Turner Morrison made any demand on Hungerford to reimburse the money paid. In 1955 the control of Turner Morrison changed hands and, thereafter, by agreement, Turner Morrison under- took to discharge the tax liability of Hungerford to the extent of Rs. 46 lakhs. In 1965 Turner Morrison filed a suit against Hungerford for recovery of the tax paid. The suit was dismissed. In the appeal to this Court Hungerford raised the plea of promissory estoppel. Turner Morrison urged that its resolutions were mere promises to do something in future; they were not representations of any and as those promises were not supported by any consideration, they afforded no legal basis to resist the claim. Hungerford argued that the promises made under those resolutions were supported by consideration 712 in as much as Hungerford, in response to those promises, refrained from enforcing the right to have the profits distributed as dividends.
 Held, that by acting on the basis of. the representation made by Turner Morrison Hungerford placed itself in a disadvantageous position, and therefore, the pleas of promissory estoppel had to be sustained. [122B-C] Union of India v. Indo Afghan Agencies Ltd., [1968] 2 S.C.R.

 It was urged on behalf of Turner Morrison that the authority given to it to discharge the tax liabilities of Hungerford were ultra vires its powers and, therefore, provided no legal basis to resist the plain, claim, Held, that Turner Morrison had not acted ultra vires its powers. The nondistribution of the dividends had augmented the working capital of the company thus affording it facility to earn more profits. Any step taken to augment the working capital of the company was undoubtedly inci- dental to the business of the company and, further, the same was not for the attainment of the objects mentioned in the memorandum. When Turner Morrison paid the tax due from Hungerford, in substance, though not in form, it was distributing a portion of its assets to the 100 per cent share holder of the company, but without reducing its capital. [726H] Even on the assumption that the suit claim was otherwise good, Hungerford urged, it was barred by limitation. It was contended on behalf of Turner Morrison that in view of s.
 15(5) of the limitation Act,, 1963, the claim made, leaving aside the claim made in respect of the assessment for the assessment years 1955-1956, was not barred, because, Hungerford was a non resident company never present in India, and therefore, under the section the time during which "the defendant has been absent from India" had to be excluded for the purpose of computing the period of limitation. Held, that the suit was barred by limitation :
 (a) Turner Morrison had waived the lien it might have had over the shares. held by Hungerford. Hence the only claim that Turner Morrison could have made against Hungerford was a money claim. (b) The suit was governed by the Limitation Act 1963, which fixed a period of three years for money payable. The amounts claimed, except those in respect of the assessment for the assessment year 1955-1956, were all paid before November 15, 1962. Therefore, they were barred by limitation. So far as the payment made in respect of the assessment year 1955-56 was concerned, Turner Morrison had no claim against Hungerford, because, under the amended s.
 23A of the Income Tax Act, 1922, that liability was of the Turner Morrison itself. (c) Section 15(5) of the share holders of Turner Morrison. Under these circumstances, it that the provision does not apply to incorporated companies at all or, alternatively, that the incorporated companies must be held to reside in places where they carry on their activities and thus be present in all those places' Factually a company cannot either be DM-sent in India or absent from India. But it may have a domicile or residence in India. The Board of Directors of Hungerford used to meet in India now and then. It was, through its representatives, attending the general meeting of the share holders of Turner Morrison. Under these circumstances, it must be held to have been residing in' this country and consequently not absent from this country. Hence s. 15(5) cannot afford any assistance to Hurner Morrison to save the bar of limitation.
