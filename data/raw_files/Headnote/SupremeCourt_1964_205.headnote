 The respondents had made deposits with a mutual life assurance company. The Controller of Insurance had directed that the deposits should be repaid from future valuation surpluses and the respondents agreed to this. The insurance company, while it worked, had not shown any valuation surplus as a result of actuarial investigations under the Insurance Act, 1938. In fact the Company was insolvent from the point of view of the Insurance Act when it was taken over by the Life Insurance Corporation. When the business of the Company merged in the business of the Corporation, it became indistinguishable after- 1st September 1956, the date when the Life Insurance Corporation Act (XXXI of 1956) came into force. The working of the Corporation. showed an enormous valuation surplus and the respondent claimed that as the condition on which their deposits were held had been fulfilled, the Corporation was bound to return their deposits with interest. The Corporation resisted the demand and the matter was referred to the Life Insurance Tribunal.
 The Tribunal held that the contracts immediately prior to the date of vesting were not subsisting or effective because they could not be enforced, there being no surplus of the stated kind. Against that decision the depositors filed a petition under Arts. 226 and 227 of the Constitution in the High Court, and the High Court reversed the decision of the Tribunal. The Corporation appealed to the Supreme Court.
 HELD : The appeal should be di..;missed. [412D].
 (i) It was wrong to contend that as the company had no surplus on 1st September 1956. its contingent liabilities ceased to exist. The contracts subsisted as long as the Company worked but the payments were postponed till the condition about actuarial surplus was fulfilled. Under s. 9 of the Life Insurance Corporation Act the contractual liability of the Company became that of the Corporation there being no express provision the Act negativing it and as the Corporation had actuarial surplus the amounts were payable from that surplus. [410C-F] (ii) When ss. 9 and 28 of the Life Insurance Corporation Act are does not put any bar in the way of the Corporation in the fulfilment of its obligations under s. 9. The surplus under s. 28 is that which results from an actuarial investigation under the Insurance.Act. It is to be disposed of by allocating not less than 95% of it for the policy holders of the Corporation. The balance of the surplus "may" be utilized for such purposes and in such manner as the Central Government "may" determine. The Government while making directions is,expected to have regard to the liabilities of the Corporation under s. 9 of the Act. As in the instant case there was no special direction of the Central Government, the surplus was available for payment of deposits. [411E-H; 412C].
