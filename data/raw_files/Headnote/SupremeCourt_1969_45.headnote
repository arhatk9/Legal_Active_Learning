 The appellant applied to the R.T.A. for a permit to ply a stage carriage on a new route on which no stage carriage was plying before. The R.T.A. published the application under s. 57(3) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939. Some representations against the grant of the permit on the ground that there was no need were received. The R.T.A., after overruling the objections granted the permit to the appellant. The appeal by some of the objectors was allowed by the State Transport Appellate Tribunal on the ground that the procedure adopted by the R.T.A. was not in accordance with law inasmuch as it failed' to determine the question of the need for a service in that 'route before entertaining the application. The appellate order was confirmed by the High Court.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (Dismissing the appeal) Having regard to the purpose behind ss. 47 and 57, that only public interest should be considered and any manipulation in favour of a particular applicant should be eliminated, there should be two independent steps before granting a stage carriage permit :
 (a) there should be a determination by the R.T.A., under s.
 47(3), of the number of stage carriages for which permits may be granted on that route, and (b) applications for permits for such number of stage carriages should be entertained thereafter. Otherwise, the R.T.A. will 'have no opportunity to choose between competing operators. The 're- presentations' made under s. 57(3) cannot be considered as competing applications. Further, if 'representations' should be interpreted to include applications'. then s.
 57(3) becomes unworkable as there will be unending applications and publications. [733 B-C, F, H] Jaya Ram Motor Service v. S. Rajarathinam, C.A. No. 95/65 dated 27-10-1967, followed.
