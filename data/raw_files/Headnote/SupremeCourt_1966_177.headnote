 The appellant was the tenant of the respondents on a piece of land. According to the lease agreement the period of lease was fixed at ten years but the lessee was entitled to renew the lease after that period under certain conditions.
 The lease agreement further provided that if the lessor required the lessee to vacate the premises whether at the time of the expiry of the lease or thereafter (in case the lessee exercised his option to renew the lease), six months' notice to the lessee was necessary. The lessee exercised his option to continue the lease and offered to fulfill the conditions therefor. The Court of Wards on behalf of the respondents, sought to impose further conditions for the renewal of the lease which the appellant did not accept.
 The Court of Wards thereupon filed a suit in the Court of the First Subordinate Judge, Alipore for the eviction of the appellant on the ground that he was a trespasser. In the meanwhile the Calcutta Thika Tenancy Act, 1949 was passed by the West Bengal Legislature. As Provided in s. 29 of the Act the suit was transferred to the Thika Controller.
 Thereafter Amendment Act 6 of 1963 was passed which deleted s. 29 and the appellant urged before the Controller that he no longer had jurisdiction to try the matter. This con- tention was rejected and on the merits the Controller decided against the appellant holding that in view of s. 3 of the Act the six months' notice required by the lease agreement for the eviction of the appellant was not necessary. The High Court also decided against the appellant who thereupon came to this Court with certificate.
 
HELD : (i) Though s. 29 was deleted by the Amendment Act of 1953 the deletion could not affect pending proceedings and would not deprive the Controller of his jurisdiction to try such proceedings pending before him at the date when the Amendment Act came into force. Though the Amendment Act did not contain any saving clause, under s. 8 of the Bengal General Clauses Act, 1899 the transfer of the suit having been lawfully made under s. 29 of the Act its deletion would not have the effect of altering the law applicable to the claim in the litigation. There is nothing in s. 8 of the Amending Act, 1953 suggesting a different intention and therefore the deletion would not affect the previous operation of s. 5 of the Calcutta Thika Tenancy Act, or the transfer of the uit to the Controller or anything duly done under s. 29. That being the correct position in law the'High Court was right in holding that in spite of the deletion of s. 29 the Controller still had the jurisdiction to proceed with the said suit transferred to him. [479 G] (ii) The Thika Tenancy Act does not confer any additional rights on a landlord but on the contrary imposes certain restrictions on his right o evict a tenant under the general law or under the contract of lease.
 476 The Thika Act like other Rent Acts enacted in various States imposes certain further restrictions on the right of the landlord to evict his tenant and lays down that the status of irremovability of a tenant cannot be got rid of except on specified grounds set out in s. 3. The right of the ap- pellant therefore to have a notice as provided for by the proviso to cl. 7 of the lease was not in any manner affected by s. 3 of the Thika Act. The effect of the non-obstante clause was that even where a landlord had duly terminated the contractual tenancy or is otherwise entitled to evict his tenant he would still be entitled to a decree of eviction provided his claim for possession falls under any one or more of the grounds in s. 3. Before therefore the respondents could be said to be entitled to a decree for eviction they had first to give six months' notice as required by the proviso to cl. 7 of the lease and such- notice not having been admittedly given their suit for eviction could not succeed.
