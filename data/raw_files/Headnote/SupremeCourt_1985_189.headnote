 The respondent had 11 partners on 8.10.1956, including Shri Rabinder Kumar who left India for abroad on 29.1.1959 for prosecuting his studies. A fresh partnership deed was executed to that effect on 1.4.1959. The respondent-firm filed an application on 30.9.1959 for registration of the said firm under section 26A of the Indian Income Tax Act 1922. The Tribunal rejected the application on the ground that the firm was not genuine and the application for registration of partnership firm was not in accordance with the rules as Rabinder Kumar had not signed it.
 In a reference made under section 66(2) of the Act, the High Court held that the firm was entitled to be registered for two reasons, namely, (1) that another opportunity should have been given to show whether the firm was actually in existence or not; and (11) that Rabinder Kumar had acquiesced in the constitution of the firm and had accepted the position.
