 The appellant and R were convicted for murder on the testimony of an approver Corroborated by the recovery at the instance of R of the knife with which the murder was committed and of the evidence that the appellant and R had got the knife prepared nine weeks before the murder. The appellant contended that his conviction was illegal as there was no corroboration of the testimony of the approver so far as he was concerned.
 Held, that the conviction of the appellant was not sustainable. The law required that there should be corroboration of the approver in material particulars and qua each accused. The combined effect of ss. 133 and 114 illustration (b) is that though the conviction of an accused on the testimony of an accomplice could not be said to be illegal, the courts will not accept such evidence without corroboration in 831 material particulars. In the present case there was no corroboration of the testimony of the approver qua the appellant. The preparation of the knife nine weeks before the occurrence was no corroboration of the approver as within that time gap the appellant might have recanted; nor was the discovery of the knife at the instance of R sufficient to connect the appellant with the murder. The fact that the approver had made a confessional statement to his brother could not be called corroboration of the approver. It was not sufficient for the conviction of the appellant that there was evidence to corroborate the participation of R in the murder.
