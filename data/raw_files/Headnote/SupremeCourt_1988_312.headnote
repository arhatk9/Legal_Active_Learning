 The appellant had taken on lease a room from the respondent for running a dry-cleaning shop. The appellant later put up a parchhati in the shop for storing clothes.
 The respondent-landlord sought eviction of the tenant under section 13(2)(iii) of the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act, 1949 on the ground that the construction of the parchhati was an act causing material impairment to the building. Both the Rent Controller and the Appellate Authority upheld the contention of the respondent. The High Court, in revision, affirmed their findings.
 Before this Court, it was contended on behalf of the appellant that (i) the respondent had not adduced any evidence, although the burden of proof was on him, to show that by fixing the parchhati the building had been materially impaired so as to affect the value or utility of the building in any manner; (ii) the Rent Controller and the Appellate Authority had rendered their findings against the appellant without any basis for it; (iii) the High Court had failed to comprehend section 13(2)(iii) in its proper perspective; and (iv) the High Court had erred in treating the findings of the Rent Controller and the Appellate Authority as pure findings of fact whereas they were findings on a mixed question of law and fact.
 Allowing the appeal, it was, 
 HELD: (1) It is not every construction or alteration that would result in material impairment to the value or the utility of the building. [396E] (2) In order to attract s. 13(2)(iii) the construction must not only be one affecting or diminishing the value or PG NO 391 PG NO 392 utility of the building but such impairment must be of a material nature i.e. of a substantial and significant nature. [396E-F] (3) When a construction is alleged to materially impair the value or utility of a building, the construction should be of such a nature as to substantially diminish the value of the building either from the commercial and monetary point of view or from the utilitarian aspect of the building. [396G H; 397A] (4) The Rent Controller and the Appellate Authority had rendered their findings without any basis for it, and the High Court erred in accepting those findings without applying the correct principles of law underlying section 13(2)(iii).
