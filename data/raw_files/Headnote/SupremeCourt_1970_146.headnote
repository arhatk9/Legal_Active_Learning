 The petitioner, who was accused of certain criminal offenses, was in jail custody awaiting his trial. He applied to the High Court for a writ of habeas corpus. On January 22, 1970 the High Court held that the petition was not maintainable because the petitioner was an under trial prisoner awaiting his trial. Accordingly the High Court dismissed the plea for a writ of habeas corpus, but directed investigation against the petitioner to be completed within two months. The petitioner did not file 'appeal against this order, but much later filed a habeas corpus petition in the Supreme Court. In its return the State asserted that the investigation was completed by March 20, 197-0 and sanction was obtained on May 12, 1970, but no order by a Magistrate authorising the petitioner's detention in custody was produced.. The last order of remand disclosed to this Court was of February 2, 1970. But this order neither contained the period of remand nor did it, in terms, authorise the Dibrugarh Jail authorities to keep the petitioner in their custody : reasons for keeping him in jail custody was also not stated. Directing the petitioner's release, this Court 
HELD The petitioner's custody in jail was not shown to be in accordance with the procedure established by law.
 (i) If, a person has been deprived of his personal liberty in violation. of theprocedure established by law and no cogent ground for declining reliefin habeas corpus proceedings is made out, then this Court has no option except to order his release, for personal liberty of the individual is highly cherished in our set up giving priority only to the interest of the nation and the security of the State. [695 G] During the course of investigation, the order of the remand Magistrate under the Code of Criminal Procedure could not extend beyond a term of 15 days. The State did not show any special law which authorised a remand for longer period in this case. Even the order of the High Court directed the investigation to be completed within two months. These two months expired a long time ago. The fact that the charge against the petitioner pertains to security of the State and the fact that stringent measures may be necessary on our eastern and north-eastern borders does not afford sufficient justification for by-passing or violating the provisions of the Constitution. Executive expediency should not prevail over the rule of law as envisaged therein. For meeting with emergencies the Constitution contains adequate provisions.
 [694 F, 696 A-B] (ii) The writ of habeas corpus is a prerogative writ by which the causes and validity of a detention of a person are investigated by summary procedure and if the authority having his custody does not satisfy the Court- 691 that the deprivation of his personal liberty is according to the procedure established by law the person is entitled to his liberty. [695 D] (iii) The warrant of commitment should normally remain with the jail authorities directed to keep the person committed to their custody so that they can 'always satisfy the court, enquiring into the legality of such custody, that he has been deprived of his personal liberty according to the procedure established by law, (iv) The order of release in the case of a person suspected of or charged with the commission of an offence does not per se amount to his acquittal or discharge and the authorities are not, by virtue of the release only on habeas corpus, deprived of the power to arrest and keep him in custody in accordance with law, for this writ is nor designed to interrupt the ordinary administration of criminal law. [695 D] (v) Rule nisi in habeas corpus proceedings demands immediate attention and urgent compliance as it concerns the question of liberty of the custody, that he has been deprived of his personal liberty according to subject. [Delay in securing papers for production in this Court disapproved. [696 E]
