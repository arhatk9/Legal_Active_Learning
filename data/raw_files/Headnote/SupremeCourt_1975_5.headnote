 The petitioner was arrested on March 26, 1973, in connection with two incidents of theft said to have been committed by him on 20th and 21st March, 1973. He was released by the Court on bail on the same day. The police, however, in due course submitted the final report and the accused was discharged on July 22, 1974. But the respondent made the impugned order of detention on June 25, 1973 under sub- section (1) read with sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971. The order was made in order to prevent the petitioner from acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community. The petitioner was detained in pursuance of that order on July 13, 1973. The grounds which have been furnished to the detenu describe the occurrence of two successive days, namely 20th and 21st March, 1973. In the counter-affidavit submitted by the respondent it is stated that both the acts stated in the grounds of detention were committed by the detenu along with his associates in quick succession in the course of these successive days.
 Allowing the petition under Article 32 challenging the order of detention, 
HELD : The "three" successive incidents may include reference to the recovery of some stolen ball bearings from the possession of "one of your associates on 23-3-1973".
 Even so, it was absolutely necessary to communicate to the detenu the name of the particular associate from whose possession the recovery of the stolen articles, the subject matter of the thefts disclosed in the two grounds was made.
 Since the sin of the recovery from "one of your associates" visits the detenu against whom a prejudicial inference has been made by the detaining authority resulting in his sub- jective satisfaction in making the impugned order, omission to disclose the name of the associate in the grounds amounts to denial of an effective opportunity to the petitioner to represent against the order. [199B-E] In this case either the District Magistrate did not know the name of the associate for which alone it was not possible for him to disclose it to the detenu or knowing the same he, has refrained from furnishing it to the detenu. In the first case his subjective satisfaction was influenced by an unreal and non-existent material circumstance, the District Magistrate not having considered whether the associate could be in fact an associate of the detenu. In the second case a reasonable opportunity has not been given to the detenu to know a very relevant and material particular in the grounds to afford making an effective representation against the order. In either case the order will be reckoned as invalid under the aw. [199H]
