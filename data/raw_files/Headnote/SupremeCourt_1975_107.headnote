 All the appellants were convicted by the Sessions Judge under s. 302 read with s. 149 I.P.C. and s. 326 read with 149 I.P.C. and sentenced to life imprisonment. The High Court affirmed the conviction and sentence.
 In a dispute over land between the party of the appellants and the complainant, the appellants alleged that they had redeemed the mortgage in respect of the land and thereafter the mortgagee had himself delivered possession of the land and that they had grown wheat crop in it. The complainant, to whom the mortgagee sold his mortgage rights, tried to take its possession forcibly. It was alleged that on the day of the occurrence the complainant and his party, armed with deadly weapons, entered the disputed land and tried to destroy the wheat crop. In the scuffle that ensued two persons of the complainant's party died and some persons on both sides were injured. On the question of possession of the land the High Court gave a finding in favour of the appellants but on its own interpretation of the decision of this Court in Munshi Ram and Others v. Delhi Administration held that the appellants who were not in settled possession of the land, were rank trespassers and secondly that, instead of indulging in a free fight with the opposite party, the appellants could have taken recourse to the public authorities, Since the appellants had exceeded the limitations provided in s. 99 to 102 I.P.C. they could not claim any right of private defence.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) It is difficult to lay down any hard and fast rule as to when the possession of a trespasser can mature into settled possession. But what this Court really meant was that the possession of a trespasser must be effective, undisturbed and to the knowledge of the owner or without any attempt at concealment. There is no special charm or magic in the words settled possession" nor is it a ritualistic formula which can be confined in a strait jacket but it has been used to mean such clear and effective possession of a person, even if he is a trespasser, who gets the right under the criminal law to defend his property against attack even by the true owner. The nature of possession in such cases which may entitle a trespasser to exercise the right of private defence of property and person should contain the following attributes : (1) that the trespasser must be in actual physical possession of the property over a sufficiently long period; (ii) that the possession must be within the knowledge either express or implied, of the owner or- without any attempt at concealment and which contains an element of animus possendie. The nature of possession of the trespasser would however be a matter to be decided on facts and circumstances of each case (iii) the process of dispossession of the true owner by the trespasser must be complete and final and must be acquiesced in by the true owner; (iv) that one of the usual tests to determine the quality of settled possession, in the case of culturable land, would be whether or not the trespasser, after having taken possession, had grown any crop. If the crop had been grown by the trespasser. then even the true owner has no right to destroy the crop grown by the trespasser and take forcible possession. In such a case the trespasser will have 300 a right of private defence and the true owner will have no right of private defence. [307E-H, 308A-D] it is manifest that the finding of the High Court on the facts of the present case that the appellants were not in settled possession of the land is legally erroneous and cannot be allowed to stand. The ratio of the judgment of this Court in Munshi Ram's case his not been correctly applied by the High Court. [310-C-D] Munshi Ram and others v.

 (2)The appellants were protected by the right of private defence of their property and person and the prosecution case against the appellants, which has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt must fail. It is not the law that a person when called upon to face in assault must run away to the police station and not protect himself or when his property has been the subject matter of trespass and mischief he should allow the aggressor to take possession of the property while he should run to the public authorities.
 Where there is an attribute of invasion or aggression on the property by a person who has no right to possession then there is obviously no room to have recourse to the public authorities and the accused has an undoubted right to resist the attack and use even force if necessary. The right of private defence of property or person, where there is real apprehension that the aggressor might cause death or grievous hurt to the victim, could extend to the causing of death also and it is not necessary that death or grievous hurt should actually be caused before the right could be exercised. A mere reasonable apprehension is enough to put the right of private defence into operation.

 In the present case it could not be said that the appellants had exceeded the right of private defence. The appellants were undoubtedly in possession of the laid and had grown wheat crop and the prosecution party had tried to destroy the wheat crop. The appellants were entitled to resist the invasion of their right by the prosecution party. Again it cannot be said that the apPellants had in any event exceeded their right of private defence. As the prosecution bad deliberately suppressed the very material part of the origin of the occurrence it is not known how the occurrence started. Secondly when two persons on the side of the accused were injured by gun fire it was not possible for them to weigh their blows in golden scales in order to assault the prosecution party. After two members of their party had received gun shot injuries the appellants would have undoubtedly it reasonable, apprehension that either death or grievous hurt could be caused to the members of their party or one of them. This being the position they were fully justified in causing the death of the deceased Persons in exercise of their right of private defence of person. Such an apprehension could not be said to be hypersensitive or based on no ground and it will be idle to content that the appellants could have waited until one of their party members would have die or received serious injuries before acting on the spur of moment, nor could one expect a person who is attacked by an aggressor to modulate his blows in accordance with the injuries he received.
