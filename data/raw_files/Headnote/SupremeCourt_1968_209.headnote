 By two agreements of January 1, 1943 and January 1, 1945, the respondent obtained on lease from the Government certain salt pans. Each lease was to endure for 25 years but was liable to be determined by notice on either side at the close of any salt manufacturing season. The respondent sublet the rights under one lease for Rs. 15,000 per year and under the other lease for Rs. 18,000 per year. In the course of the respondent's assessment to. wealth-tax for the assessment year 1959-.60, the Wealth-tax Officer calculated the value of the respondent's interest in the salt pans for the unexpired period o.f the two leases and included it in the computation of her net wealth. His order was confirmed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner but the Tribunal, in appeal, held that the interest of the respondent in the salt pans was not an "asset", within the meaning of s.
 2(e)(v), and could not be included in the respondent's net wealth. The High Court, upon a reference, confirmed the view taken by the Tribunal.
 On appeal to this Court, 
HELD: Dismissing the appeal, Interest in property which is available to the tax-payer for a period not exceeding six years from the valuation date. is not an asset within the meaning of s. 2(e) and the value thereof cannot be included in the net wealth of the assessee for the financial year relevant to the valuation date. The interest of the lessee under each lease was precarious: it was liable to be determined by notice by the Government at the expiry of any manufacturing season. The leasehold interest in the salt pans was therefore not available to the assessee for a period exceeding six years from the valuation date. [4 C; 6 A] There was no force in the contention that the expression "is available to an assessee for a period not exceeding the six years" in clause 2(e) (v) means is and has been available to an assessee for the period of six years before the date of valuation and that if interest in property though revocable has remained unrevoked for more than six years before the valuation date, the interest would be an asset within the meaning of s. 2(e). [4 E-F] The terms, of the clause 'from the date the interest vests in the assessee" added after the expression "six years" in clause 2(e)(v) by the Wealth-tax (Amendment) Act, 1964 do. not show that the amendment was intended to be a parliamentary exposition of the meaning if the original clause.
