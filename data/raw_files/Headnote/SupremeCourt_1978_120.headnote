 Manchhanna taluqa or Mainpuri Raj was a part of the Mainpuri district in U.P. The district originally belonged to the Nawab Wazir of Oudh who ceded it to the East India Co. in 1801. Raja Dalel Singh the ancestor of the appellant was then the owner of the Manchhanna taluqa. A part of his estate was taken over by the British Government. Settlement operations of the taluqa lands were carried out from time to time. As it came to notice during the settlement operations in 1840 that there were under-proprietors or biswadars in 133 villages of the taluka, it was decided by the Government that while 133 villages would be settled with biswadars other villages would remain under the direct management of the Raja and that he would receive an allowance or 'malikana" for the 133 villages at 18% of the assets leaving 60% of the realisation with the Government as land revenue and 32% with biswadars as their share. The settlement was revised thereafter and the assets of the biswadars were redistributed so as to give 55 percent of the realisation to the Government as revenue, 201 to the Raja as "malikana" and 244 to the biswadars as their share. Then came the settlement of 1872 when Raja Ram Pratap Singh tried to reopen the question of direct engagement with the Government even in regard to the biswardari villages. It was ultimately agreed that the Raja would receive, in respect of each village, the same amount as before by way of malikana and the settlement would be made directly with the biswadars who would bear the burden of the arrangement. The Malikana thus worked out to Rs. 22,502/- per year. It was however stipulated that it would be reduced to 1/11 of the biswadari payment on the death of Raja Ram Pratap Singh. An order was issued in 1873 by which the Raja was held entitled to malikana at the rate of 5 per cent of the annual rental.
 Sheo Mangal Singh who was the last male descendant of Raja Dalel Singh thus received Rs. 8946-9-4 as annual rental of the 133 biswadari villages. He died in 1938 and thereafter the malikana was received by his widow Rani Prabhuraj Kumari. After her death in 1951 the malikana was paid to her daughter Rani Ratnesh Kumari the present appellant upto March 1953. Further payment was stopped because of the vesting of the estate in the State under the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950. Efforts of the appellant for its restoration did not bear fruit. She filed a writ petition in the Allahabad High Court on September 16, 1958 for quashing the State Government's order refusing the payment of the malikana and for a direction that it should be continued to be paid to her along with arrears. She based her claim mainly on the ground that the malikana was in the nature of a pension or allowance "in lieu of the taking over, forfeiture or acquisition" of the perpetual hereditary rights of the Raja in 133 villages and was not rent or revenue 18 derived from land She pleaded that the name of the Raja was never entered in the record of rights of the 133 villages and that she was neither an intermediary with respect to those villages nor those villages were included in he..
 estate. A single Judge of the High Court upheld the petitioner's contentions allowed the writ petition, quashed the orders of the State Government against her and directed the payment of the arrears of the malikana as well as its future payment. The Division Bench set aside the impugned judgment of the single Judge and dismissed the writ petition.
 Dismissing the appeal by certificate this Court ^ 
 HELD: (1) Manchhanna was an estate in Uttar Pradesh within the meaning of s. 3(8) of the Act. [19F, 22B] (2) Section 3(12) of the Act defines the expression "intermediary" with reference to any estate as a "proprietor, under proprietor, sub-proprietor, thekedar, permanent lessee in Avadh and permanent tenure-holder, of such estate or part thereof." The appellant was the proprietor of 133 villages also, as they were her villages even though her interest in them was limited on account of the settlements with the under-proprietors or biswadars. In other words, she had an interest in the biswadari villages and they undoubtedly formed part of her estate as its proprietor. [22C-D, 23F-G] (3) The appellant's contention that her interest in these villages was extinguished has not been substantiated by the evidence on record and cannot be accepted. Copies of the "Khewats" of several years placed on record including the quadrennial 'khewat' for the years immediately preceding the date of vesting under the Act in respect of the 'mahals' of 133 villages, showed that the name of Rani Prabhuraj Kumari mother of the appellant was recorded on the first page in column 6 meant for the entry of the name of the proprietor and the names of the inferior proprietors paying land revenue were recorded on the subsequent pages. [23E-F- G] (4) The fact that the payment was made as "haq taluqdari' by virtue of the superior proprietary right of the Raja and it was varied from settlement to settlement as a consequence of the variation in the amount of the land revenue and the assets of the villages, shows that the taluqdar's interest in the land of the 133 biswadari villages was not extinguished even after the fixation of the "malikana" which was really in the nature of an allowance for the purpose of excluding him from their management and their settlement with the under proprietors. There was thus a direct connection between the allowance and the right in land. [23C-D, 24A] (5) It is true that an interest in land or land revenue will not be created merely by measuring the quantum of the allowance or by equating it with a portion of his share in the net revenue of a part of the land, but this was not really so in the present case because the allowance was not determined once for all and was not dissociated from the revenue or the assets of the land. At any rate the malikana was allowed on account of the Raja's interest in the land or its revenue and was therefore a right or privilege in the biswadari lands. [24B-D] (6) As the Raja was an intermediary within the meaning of section 3(12) of the Act, by virtue of Sec 6 of the Act, his right, title and interest in the 19 biswadari land ceased and vested in the State on the publication of the notification under Sec. 4 of the Act. He could therefore lay a claim only for compensation under s.
 
27. [24D-E] In case of State of U.P. v. Kanwar Sri Trivikram Narain Singh, [1961] INSC 250; [1962] 3 SCR 213; the settlement was by way of "pension" which was neither land nor an estate within the meaning of the Act. The pension was in the nature of a mere compensation payable in lieu of the ancestral rights over the estates comprised in the pargana and was in fact granted as a consideration for the settlement of the claim which was litigated in a civil court relating to the land and also in consideration of the extinction of the right in land of the land revenue. It was therefore held that the person receiving an allowance from the State in consideration of extinction of a right in the land or land revenue was not a "proprietor" within the meaning of the Act- the more so when it was found that his name had not been entered in the revenue record under clauses (a) to (d) of s. 32 of the Land Revenue Act. In that case there was no direct connection between the right or privilege which was claimed and the land in the estate or its revenue. [24F-H, 25A] State of U.P. v. Kanwar Sri Trivikram Narain singh [1961] INSC 250; [1962] 3 SCR 213 distinguished.
