 The appellant Organisation, set up as an independent Organisation separate from the Hindustan Steel Ltd. to manage the three Coal Washeries at Dugda, Bhojudih and Patherdih, maintained separate accounts in respect of its establishment and also prepared a separate balance sheet and profit and loss account showing theaggregate financial result of the operation of these three coal washeries. The appellant adopted the straight line method of calculation of depreciationwith the result that the Balance-sheets and Profits and Loss accounts for the years 1964-65, 1965-66 to 1968-69 showed profits. On this basis the Workmen of the Bhojudih Coal washery pressed their claim for bonus from the year 1964-65. The appellant disputed the claim of the workmen and contended that by reason of sub-section (1) of s. 16, the workmen were not entitled to be paid bonus under the Act. The industrial dispute arising out of the claim of the workmen was referred for adjudication and the Tribunal took the view that since the appellant denied from its three coal washeries in the year 196465, the workmen were entitled to be paid bonus under the Act from that year, but it was held that since the profits were inadequate to warrant payment of a larger bonus, the workmen were entitled to receive the minimum bonus of 4% of the wages as provided in section 10. The Tribunal thus awarded the minimum bonus at 4% of the wages to the workmen of the Bhojudh Coal Washery for the years 1964-65 to 1968-69.
 The appellant being aggrieved by the award preferred an appeal to this Court after obtaining special leave. During the pendency of the appeal a settlement was arrived at for ex-gratia payment of 4% of the wages for the years 1965-66 to 1967-68. In accordance with the terms of this settlement every workman whether a member or not of the Hindustan Coal Washeries Workers' Union received payment. The appellant did not, therefore, Press the appeal, and it was dismissed.
 Though the appeal was, dismissed and the award of the Industrial Tribunal which was in favour of the workmen stood in tact. another union called the Hindustan Steel Coal Washeries Employees Union which is a minority Union filed C.M.P. No. 3382/78 claiming that the workmen represented by it were not party to the settlement and therefore, it was not binding and prayed for setting aside the order of dismissal of the appeal and rehearing of the appeal.
 Allowing the appeal and answering against the respondents, the Court 
HELD (1) Where an establishment is newly set-up, the workmen employed in such establishment are entitled to be paid bonus under the Act only from the accounting year in which the employer derives profit from such establishment or from the sixth accounting year following the accounting year in which the employer sells goods produced or manufactured by him from such establishment, whichever, is earlier. So long as the employer does not start deriving profit from the establishment, he is exempt from liability to pay bonus to the workmen under the Act. But, even if he is not able to derive profit from the establishment the does not enjoy perpetual immunity, because in any event from the sixth accounting year following the accounting year in which he starts selling goods produced or manufactured by him, he becomes liable to pay bonus to the workmen. [1027 D-E] 1024 (2)The word "profit" within the meaning of clause (a) of sub-section (1) of S. 16 must be construed according to its ordinary sense-a sense in which it is understood in trade and industry because the rationale behind clause (a) of sub- section (1) of section 16 is that it is only when the employer starts making profit in the commercial sense that he should become liable to pay bonus to the workmen under the Act. Now profit in the commercial sense can be ascer- tained only after deducting depreciation and since there are several methods' of computing depreciation the one adopted by the employer would, in the absence of any statutory provision to the contrary govern the calculation of depreciation for the purpose of arriving at the profit earned by the employer. But Explanation 11 to sub-sec.(1) of S. 16 provides that for the purpose of clause (a), an employer shall not be deemed to have derived profit in any accounting year unless he has made provision for that year's depreciation to which he is entitled under the Income-tax Act. This explanation embodies a clear legislative mandate that in determining, for the purpose of clause (a) of sub- sec.(1) of Section 16, whether the employer has made profit from the establishment in any accounting year, depreciation should be provided in accordance with the provisions of the Income-tax Act. Whatever be the method of computation of depreciation followed by the employer, depreciation should be deducted in accordance with the provisions of the Income- tax Act and it is only if any profit remains after adjusting such depreciation that the employer can be said to have derived profit for the purpose of clause (a) of sub-section (1) of S. 16. [1028 G-H, 1029 A-C] In the instant case :- (a) The appellant followed the straight line method of calculating depreciation and on that basis the Balance Sheets and Profits and Loss Accounts of the appellant showed profit for the year 1964-65 to 1968-69. [1029A] (b)Clearly, the depreciation that was required to be deducted for the purpose of determining whether the appellant derived profit from the three coal washeries during the years 1964-65 to 1968-69 was not depreciation according to the straight line method followed by the appellant, but depreciation admissible under sub-section (1) of S. 32 of the Income-tax Act. [1029D] (c)The appellant did not derive profit from the three coal washeries in any of the years 1964-65 to 1968-69 and the workmen were not entitled to be paid bonus under the Act for any of these accounting years since the quantum of depreciation admissible under Sub-section (1) of S. 32 of the Income-tax Act was clearly proved by the appellant through the evidence of its Accounts Officer and the Tribunal also conceded that if depreciation calculated on this basis were deducted there would be loss incurred by the appellant in each of the years 1964-65 to 1968-69.
