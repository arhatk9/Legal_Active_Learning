 The appellant, a pointsman, bore grudge for some time against one C, a railway guard. While C was on -duty as a guard on a train standing at the platform, the appellant came armed with a scythe, and waiving it in a menacing way told C that he would cut his neck and hurled abuses on him.
 The appellant was tried and convicted under s. 121, Indian Railways Act for wilfully obstructing a railway servant in the discharge of his duties. He contended that no offence unders. 121 was made out.
 Held (per Imam, Subba Rao and Mudholkar, JJ.) that the appellant was rightly convicted under s. 121 of the Indian Railways Act. The Act of the appellant was actuated by malice on account of the grudge and was wilful within the meaning of s. 121. Further, C was on duty as a guard and even when the train was standing he had to discharge multi- farious duties,and during the time the incident took place he was obstructed from discharging these duties.
 Per Dayal, j.-The appellant was not guilty of the offence under s. 121, Indian Railways Act, but of the offence under s. 506, Indian Penal Code. For a conviction under s. 121 it had to be established that C was obstructed "in the discharge of his duty". The offence under s. 121 is committed only when an accused commits an act with the intention of preventing a railway servant from discharging his duty and the act does prevent him from doing so. Even threats of violence would amount to obstruction if the accused indicates that violence would be used if the railway servant persists in performing his duties.
