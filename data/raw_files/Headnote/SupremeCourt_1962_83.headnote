 The appellant obtained a preliminary decree, on an anomalous mortgage of a share in the Zamindari village of Sonchari Mouza in the Patna District and khudkasht land appertaining to the Mouza, against the mortgaged properties with a direction for a personal decree for the balance and there followed a final mortgage decree on 30.9.1947. An application for execution against the mortgaged properties was dismissed on 9.1.1954 as in the meantime the mortgaged properties which constituted an estate within the meaning of s. 2(1) of the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950, had vested in the State.
 Execution was sought personally against the mortgagor by attachment and sale of other, properties of the mortgagor and it was ultimately ordered by the executing court. The 565 Patna High Court in revision held that in view of s. 4(d) of the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950, the execution petition could not proceed and dismissed it.
 On appeal to this Court it was contended that s. 4(d) of the Act prohibited execution only against the mortgaged property not in respect of the personal decree. It was brought to the notice or this Court that the appellant had preferred a claim tinder the Act and that the Claim Officer had deter- mined a sum of Rs. 58,100/- with interest at 4 per cent as payable to the appellant from the compensation payable on abolition of the Estate.
 Held, that s. 24(5) of the Act made the compensation payable on acquisition of the mortgaged estate a kind of substituted security against which the mortgage claim would be enforced under the provisions of the Act. According to the Scheme of the Act the debts of the proprietors in respect of the estate were to be investigated and adjusted exclusively by the Tribunal tinder the Act. On a proper construction, s.
 4(d) of the Act precluded the executing Court from enforcing the direction for a personal decree for realising the mort- gage debt at present ; it could only be done eventually if the realisation from the mortgaged property was found insufficient to satisfy the decree, as in the present case the whole of the mortgaged property was an estate, in respect of which a claim was pending.
