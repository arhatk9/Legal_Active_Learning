 A partnership was dissolved and the deed of dissolution provided that the machinery, raw-materials and finished goods in stock as also other assets and liabilities were to be divided equally between the two partners. The respondent was to have the advantage of continuing the firm name, the benefit of the existing import licences, and of pending applications for import licences. Thereafter the respondent firm applied for import licences for necessary raw-materials and was granted 50% of what the original firm was getting.
 The respondent filed a writ petition in the high court, contending that the installed capacity of the factory was double that of the actual production before dissolution, that in the division, the respondent got the actual production capacity whereas the other partner got the unutilized spare capacity, and that therefore, the respondent was entitled to get import licences after dissolution as before.
 The High Court allowed the petition and directed the Government to consider the claim of the respondent on the basis of its own production.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The respondent was not entitled to anything more than what was granted to him by the Government. [369 A-B] (1)According to para 71 of the Hand-book of the Rules and Procedure in relation to Import Trade Control, in the case of industries borne on the registers of the Directorate General of Technical Development licences are normally issued on the basis of the recommendations of the Directorate General of Technical Development and the respondent was given import licences on that basis. [368 G- 369A] (2)Under para 88(2)(c) of the Hand-book if there is a division of a factory amongst partners, a joint application by all the succeeding parties had to be made for re-issue of separate licences in their favour in proportion to their share. So also if division takes place after importation.
 If that is-so in respect of the importation of goods against current licences, the same principle should apply for future licences also. [368 E-G] Controller v. Aminchand, [1956] 1 S.C.R. 262, followed.
 (3)In the circumstances, the most equitable way of dealing with the matter was to divide the old import entitlement equally between the two partners which is what the appellant did. If the petitioner's contention is accepted it follows logically that it should apply to the other partner also.
 Merely because there was delay in the other partner starting his production, he cannot be denied his import entitlement, which would mean, that between them they would be entitled for import licence at twice what the partnership was originally getting. [366 E-F] (4)The fact that after dissolution the new firm was able to take advantage of its inbuilt installed capacity cannot entitle it to get the whole of the quantity issued to the former firm, for that would mean depriving the other partner. Such a contention cannot be considered unless the other partner is also made a party to the proceedings. [367 F-G] (5) Paragraph 73 of the Hand-book shows that a licence is issued on the basis of certified requirements for 12 months consumption after scrutiny by the licensing authority. In the present case, the respondent was not the same firm as the old one. There were no imports by the respondent during the past licensing period, because, the imports and production in the past were only by the former firm. [367 D- F] 365
