 The appellant filed a suit for eviction of the respondent from the appellant's house. The suit was dismissed by the trial court. In appeal, a compromise was entered into between the parties and a decree was passed in terms of the compromise. The compromise provided for the respondent's continuation of possession of the house for five years, but it enabled the appellant to execute the decree by evicting the respondent if the respondent failed to pay rent for any three consecutive months. When the appellant sought to evict the respondent, the latter claimed protection from eviction as a tenant under the Orissa House-Rent Control Act, 1958.
 On the question whether the compromise decree created a lease or a licence, 
HELD : The facts that the appellant had filed a suit for eviction of the respondent and the compromise decree enabled him to execute the decree by evicting the respondent, show, that the intention of the parties, which is the decisive test, was not to enter into the relationship of a landlord and tenant, in spite of the fact the word 'rent' was used in the compromise. Therefore, the respondent was not entitled to any protection against eviction. [562 C; 563 A-C] Associated Hotels of India v. R. N. Kapur, [1960] 1 S.C.R.
