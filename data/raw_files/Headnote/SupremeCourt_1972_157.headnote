 The appellants were convicted by the trial Court and the High Court inter alia for the offence of murder under s. 302 read with s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code. In appeal to this Court it was contended that the appellants were not guilty, on the facts of the case, of murder or culpable homicide but of a lesser offence.
 
HELD : Apart from the injury on the head of the deceased, which proved fatal, the other injuries were not of a serious nature. There was no previous enmity between the parties and the quarrel arose over a trifling incident. In the circumstances the High Court was justified in its finding that the common intention of the four accused was only to cause grievous hurt. The fact that one of them exceeded the bound and gave a fatal blow on the head of the deceased would make him personally liable for the fatal injury, but so far as the other three were concerned, they could be held liable only for the injuries caused in furtherance of the common intention and not for the fatal injury. As it was not possible on the material on record to find out as to which one of the accused gave the fatal blow, there was no escape from the conclusion that each one of the four accused appellants could only be guilty of the offence under section 325 read with section 34 Indian Penal Code.
