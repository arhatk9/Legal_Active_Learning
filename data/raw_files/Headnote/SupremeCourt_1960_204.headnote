 The appellant filed an appeal while he was in jail which was summarily dismissed on merits. Thereafter lie filed a Memo- randum of Appeal through a pleader which was rejected on the ground that it was not maintainable owing to his appeal from jail under S. 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure having been dismissed earlier. His review petition before the judicial Commissioner was also dismissed but his prayer for certificate under Art. 132(1) was granted.
 The question was whether S. 421 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which enables a court to dismiss an appeal filed by a convicted person, while he was in jail, without hearing him offended against Art. 14 of the Constitution.
 Held, that the Code of Criminal Procedure in giving the right of appeal in Ch. XXXI based it on a classification which was rational and reasonably connected with the object the Legislature had in view in enacting that chapter. The position of a convicted person in jail, and therefore unable to present an appeal either in person or through a pleader, was entirely different and distinct from that of a convicted person who was able to do so. The Proviso to s. 421 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in no way offends against the provisions of Art. 14 of the Constitution.
 Held, also, that a second appeal from the same judgment of conviction presented through a pleader was not maintainable because the previous order dismissing the first appeal under S. 420 presented from jail was lawful and final under S. 430 of the Code.
