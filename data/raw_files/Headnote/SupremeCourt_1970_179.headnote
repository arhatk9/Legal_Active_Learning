 The appellant, an electrical engineer, entered the service of Simla Electricity Board in 1934. In 1949 his services were transfeere d to the Central Electricity Commission, later designated as Central Water and Power Commission (Power Wing). In 1955 he was also promoted to the post of Direct(* and was confirmed as such with effect from 1960.
 There were adverse remarks in his confidential reports for the years 1964 and 1965. On these being communicated to him he made representation asking for specific instances on which adverse information about him bad been recorded.
 These representations were rejected. In the meantime the question of filling the post of Director (Selection Grade)/Deputy Chief Engineer arose. Both in 1964 and 1965 the appellant was over-looked by the Departmental Promotion Committee and the Union Public Service Commission for this post or that of a member. Later with effect from August 15, 1967, on completion of the age of 55 years he has compul- sorily retired under r. 56(j) of the Fundamental Rules made under Art. 309 of the Constitution. The appellant filed three writ petitions in the High Court of Punjab challenging the validity of the said entries. and the said order of compulsory retirement. The High Court dismissed all the writ petitions. Appeal in this Court was filed with certificate. The appellant's contentions which fell for consideration were (1) that the said two confidential reports were contrary to the Departmental Rules in as much as they did not set out specific instances justifying them;
 (2) that they were placed before the Departmental Promotion Committee and the Public Service Commission before they were communicated to him and he was prejudiced thereby; (3) that the refusal of the Departmental Promotion Committee to recommend him for the higher posts and of the Public Service Commission to select him based on such invalid reports was also invalid; (4) that making an adverse entry which resulted in withholding promotion to him amounted to a penalty; since no opportunity was given to him of being heard in this respect, there was a violation of Art., 311 of the Constitution; (5) that making an entry without holding a departmental inquiry and hearing him was contrary to natural justice; (6) that the adverse entries in question were contrary to facts; (7) that the 'said entries were mala fide; (8) that the higher posts to which he was eligible were promotion and not selection posts at the relevant time;
 (9) that the order compulsorily retiring him was bad in as much as Fundamental Rule 56(j) was itself invalid; (10) that in any 56 event the order was not made in public interest and was, therefore, contrary to the rule and also, Arts. 14 and 16 of the Constitution.
 
HELD: (1) An examination of the departmental rules clearly shows that a confidential report is intended to be a general assessment of work ,performed by a Government servant subordinate to the reporting authority, that such reports are maintained for the purpose of serving as data of comparative merit when questions of promotion, confirmation etc. arise. They also show that such reports are not ordinarily to contain .specific instances upon which assessments are made except in cases where as a result of any specific incident censure or a warning is issued and when such warning is by an order to be kept in the personal file of the ;Government servant. Such cases an officer making the order- has to give reasonable opportunity to the Government servant to present his case. The contention, therefore, that the adverse remarks against the appellant did not contain specific instances and were, therefore, contrary to the rules could not be sustained. Equally unsustainable was the corollary that because of that omission the appellant could not make an adequate repre- sentation and that therefore the confidential reports were vitiated. [62 C--E] (2) Whenever a Government servant is aggrieved by an adverse entry he has an opportunity of making a representation. Such a representation would be considered by a higher authority, who, if satisfied would either amend, correct or even expunge a wrong entry, so that it is not as if an aggrieved Government servant is without remedy.
 Making adverse entry is not equivalent to imposition of a penalty which would necessitate an enquiry or the giving of a reasonable opportunity of being heard to the ,Government servant. It does not amount to the penalty of censure set out in r. 11 of the Central Civil Service (Classification, Control & Appeal) Rules. [62 H] (3) The confidential report in respect of the appellant for the year 1964 was prepared on March 18, 1966. Since the Departmental Promotion Committee had met in 1964, obviously, the adverse entry for the year 1964 was not and could not be before that Committee. If at all the Committee declined to recommend the appellant's name because of adverse confidential reports, such reports could only be for the earlier years. The record showed that confidential reports for 1955, 1956 and 1959 were adverse to, him. The confidential report for 1965 was prepared in 1966.
 Therefore, that report also would not be before the Committee when it declined to recommend the appellant in 1965. The fact that the appellant's representation against the report for 1964 was not before the Committee when it made its recommendation did not make any difference. The representation made by the appellant though made subsequently was actually rejected with the result that the confidential report for 1964 remained unchanged. The practice followed by the Promotion Committee was that if in such a case a representation were to be accepted and in consequence the confidential report was altered or expunged, the Promotion Committee would have to review its re- commendations in the light of such result. In the present case no question of such a review arose as the reports for 1964 and 1965 were, in spite of representations by the appellant neither altered nor set aside. There was, therefore, no question of injustice having been done to the appellant despite the fact that the Committee had before it the confidential report without there being along with it any representation made by the appellant. Nor did the question of breach of natural justice arise in view of the aforesaid practice followed by the Promotion Committee. [63 F-64 D] 57 (4) Under r. 11 of the Central Services Rules, 1965, although with holding promotion is not a penalty which could be imposed on a Government servant; the explanation thereto expressly provides that non-promotion of a Government servant after consideration of his case does not constitute a penalty. There was, therefore, no question of the department having to hold an inquiry and then only to decide not to promote the appellant to the higher posts. [64 E] (5) The appellant could also not challenge his non- promotion on the ground of seniority alone. The post of a Member was declared to be a selection post by the President as early as in 1952. By Rules made by the President under Art. 309 dated November 6, 1965, the post of a Member along with certain other posts was declared to be a selection post. The respondent's counter affidavit clearly affirmed that the post was a selection post. The burden of proving otherwise was on the appellant which he had not discharged.
 On the material brought on record it could not be held that the post of a Member was not a selection post so that the mere fact of the appellant being the seniormost amongst the Directors in the department could not entitle him to be appointed [64 F65 B] (6) The appellant had been unable to prove that the action against him was mala fide. [69 H-70 A] (7) The validity of r. 56(j) cannot be challenged in view of the earlier decisions of this Court [,71 F-G] Union of India v. Vol. J. N. Sinha, [1971] 1 S.C.R. 791, applied.

 (8) On the facts of the case it could not be held that the order of compulsory retirement was not in public interest or that the authority concerned had not applied its mind. [72 D-F]
