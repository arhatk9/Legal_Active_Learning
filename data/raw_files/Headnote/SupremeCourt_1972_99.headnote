 The second respondent was employed on 3-1-1947 as a Grade II Clerk in the- Imperial Bank of India (taken over by the State Bank of India in 1955) on a scale running from Rs. 70 to Rs. 170. Shortly after, he was given a raise of Rs. 4 because of his proficiency in using the machine. On 1-1-49 he was promoted to Grade 1. The Sastry Award prescribed a uniform scale of pay for clerks of Grade I & II and gave directions to make fitments in that grade. The second respondent disputed the computation of benefits admissible to him under the Award. In the consequent industrial dispute the Labour Court fixed the basic pay of the second respondent under paragraph 292 of the Award as Rs. 164 p.m.
 as on 1-4-1954. The Labour Court accepted his contention that clause (4) (b) of paragraph 292 should be read with clause 5(a) and that the latter clause was applicable to him because before the Award came into force he was promoted from Grade If to Grade 1. The High Court confirmed the decision of the Labour Court. In appeal by the State Bank of India to this Court the questions that fell for determination were : (i) whether the direction in clause (2) of paragraph 292 that the basic nay in the new scale shall not exceed what point to point adjustment would have given to the workman in the new scale has the effect of excluding clause (4)(b); (ii) whether s. (5)(a) of the paragraph was applicable to the second respondent.
 
HELD : (i) The report of the Gajendragadkar Commission made it clear that what the Award meant in clause (2) when it referred to point to-point adjustment is the placing of each employee at the stage in the/ new scale to which In would have risen by reason of length of service had he entered service in the new scale. What was sought to be ensured by clause (2) was that the adjusted basic pay in the new scale shall not exceed the point-to-point adjustment or the maximum of the scale., if the meaning given to the phrase point-to-point adjustment is what is stated by the Commission in the report, then there would be no impediment in giving effect to the directions in clause (4)(b). It would not therefore be right to say that clause (4)(b) is to be ignored or that the advantage ends only with that given in clause (4)(a). [136G-137A] (ii The directions given in clause 5(a) are that the, length of service in the scale in which the workman is and in which he gets an increment or increments either at the initial start or by special promotion should be that which he would have taken to reach the basic pay which he would draw on 31st January 1950 with the initial start. The condition precedent to the applicability of the directions in this clause is the receipt of increment or increments by way of special promotion. The use of the word 'special' would itself show that what is contemplated is advance increments in the same grade. [137D-F] 127 As the, 2nd respondent did, not got any increment or increments in the existing_scale which was Grade I. either at the initial start or by way of special promotion, the directions in clause 5(a) were inapplicable to him and his actual service in-the cadre had to be computed for the purpose of clause (4)(b). The words 'same' cadre in the latter clause would refer to both Grade 11 and Grade 1. The actual serviceman both the grades will alone be considered for giving him an increment for every three years of service which in his case would work out to one increment in respect of his 3 years service from 31-1-47 to 31-1-50.
 [137H-138B] The Court, applying the principles as laid down above, held that the second respondent had to be fitted in the new scale on a basic pay of Rs. 1481.
