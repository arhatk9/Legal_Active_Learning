 The validity of the recruitment of the appellants as Grade- II Sub-registrars as well as the vires of r. 5 of the Andhra Pradesh Registration Subordinate Service Special Rules under which the recruitment was made, were challenged by some of the respondents. The rule deals with the qualifications for being recruited as Grade II sub-registrars. It put' in one class for the purpose of recruitment, both U.D.Cs. as well as L.D.Cs. It was therefore contended that the rule violated Art. 14 of the Constitution by treating unequals as equals.
 The High Court held that the recruitment was in accordance with the rule, but struck down the rule as violative of Art.
 14.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD: (1) (a) U.D.Cs. and L.D.Cs. belong to a district wise cadre, that is, promotion from L.D.C. to U.D.C. is made district-wise. Since the chances of promotion from L.D.C. to U.D.C. in one district differ materially from that of another, a L.D.C. in one district may be promoted as a U.D.C. much earlier than a L.D.C. in another district who may be his senior, more efficient or may possess the same or better qualifications. But Grade-II sub-registrars are in a statewise cadre. Though the position of a U.D.C. is superior to a L.D.C, if the State treated U.D.Cs. as superior to L.D.Cs. while recruiting for a statewise cadre, it would result in great injustice to a large section of the clerks, because of the fortuitous circumstance of a L.D.C. in a particular district becoming a U.D.C. in that district. Therefore, the State was justified in not Classifying the U.D.Cs. and L.D.Cs. separately.
 (b) Though there was an anomaly in the case of L.D.Cs. and U.D.Cs. serving in the same district, the anomaly could not have been avoided. The validity of the rule has to be judged by assessing its overall effect and not by picking up exceptional cases. Further, the rule provides for giving preference to the U.D.Cs. who had put in service of 5 years or more. [552H-553F] (2) The selection in the present case was made on the basis of seniority-cum-merit. A list of all the clerks, U.D.Cs.
 as well as L.D.Cs., was prepared in the order of seniority as L.D.Cs. and fitness of each person was considered. Also, those persons who were entitled to be given preference under the rules were considered separately and recruited in the first instance. The method adopted was the most reasonable one and was in accordance with the rule. [553H-554B]
