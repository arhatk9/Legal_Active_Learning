 By a resolution dated April 18, 1927, the Borough Municipality of Ahmedabad declared its intention of making a town-planning scheme under the Bombay Town Planning Act, 1915. A plot of land measuring 18,219 sq. yards belonging to the first respondent was covered by the scheme. In the draft scheme the plot was reconstituted into two plotsone plot measuring 15,403 sq. yards reserved for the first respondent and the other, measuring 2,817 sq. yards reserved for the Municipality. The arbitrators were appointed to decide various matters made little progress. In 1955, the 1915-Act was repealed by the Bombay Town Planning Act, 1955 which received the assent of President on August 1, 1955, and came into force on April 1, 1957. By s. 90(2) of the 1955 Act, the proceedings preparing a scheme commenced under the repealed Act was continued. Under the 1955 Act, on the coming into force of the scheme all lands which are required by the local authority, unless otherwise determined in the scheme, by the operation of s. 53(a) vest absolutely therein free from all encumbrances. By cl. (b), ownership in a plot belonging to a person is substituted by the ownership in the reconstituted plot, his ownership in the original plot is extinguished and simultaneously therewith he becomes the owner of a reconstituted plot subject to the rights settled by the Town Planning Officer. The reconstituted plots, having regard to the exigencies of the scheme need not be of the same dimensions as the original land and are generally smaller. Section 67 provides that the difference between the market value of the plot with all the buildings and works thereon at the date of the declaration of the intention to make a scheme and the market value of the plot as reconstituted on the 'same date and without reference to the improvements contemplated in the scheme is to be 'the compensation due to the owner Section 71, which is a corollary to s. 67, provides, inter alia that if the owner of the original land is not allotted a plot at all, he shall be paid the value of the original plot, at the date of the declaration of intention to make a scheme. The Town Plan- ning Officer informed the first respondent that Rs. 25,411 were awarded to him as compensation. He filed a petition in the High Court, challenging the validity of the Act on the ground that it violated Art. 31(2) of the Constitution 'Me High Court declared ss. 53 and 67 of the Act ultra vires and declared the town planning scheme invalid as a corollary.
 In appeal to this Court' on the questions, (1) whether the Act was exempt from the operation of Art. 31(2), because its object was promotion of public health and fell within the terms of Art. 31(5)(b)(ii), and (2) whether the Act specifies the principles on which compensation is to be determined and the guarantee under Art. 31(2) is on that account not infringed, 342 
HELD : (1) Section 53 (a) of the Act is a law for compulsory acquisition of land; it cannot be said that because the object of the Act is to promote public health it falls within the exception of Art. 31(5)(b)(ii) .The principal objects of town planning legislation no doubt are to provide for planned and controlled development and use of land in urban areas with special regard to requirements of better living conditions and sanitation; but acquisition of property for such purposes could not be made under laws coming within the purview of Art. 31(5)(b)(ii) without pay- ment of compensation.

 (2)The legislature specified in the 1955 Act, principles for determination of compensation. The principles for determination of compensation cannot be said to be irrelevant, nor can the compensation determined, be said to be illusory. Being a principle relating to compensation, a challenge to that principle, on the ground that a just equivalent of what the owner was deprived of is not provided, is excluded by Art. 31(2) after the Constitution Fourth Amendment Act. [370 D] (a)It was not necessary to provide for compensation for the entire land ofwhich a person is deprived, because, the concept that the lands vest inthe local authority when the intention to make a scheme is notified is against the plain intendment of the Act. A part of the plot or even the whole plot belonging to an owner may go to form a reconstituted plot which may be allotted to another person or may be appropriated to public purposes under the scheme.
 No process actual or notional of transfer is contemplated in that appropriation. The lands covered by the scheme are.
 subjected by the Act to the power of local authority to re- adjust titles, but no reconstituted plot vests at any 'stage in the local authority unless it is needed for a purpose of the authority; and when land is so required on the coming into force of the scheme, compensation is paid to the owner of the land. [356B, F-H] (b)The Act specifies the principles on which the compensation is to be determined and given. Specification of principles means laying down general guiding rules applicable to all persons or transactions governed thereby.
 Compensation determined on the basis of market value prevailing on a date anterior to the date of extinction of interest is still determined on a principle specified.
 Whether an owner of land is given a reconstituted plot or not, the rule for determining what is to be given as recompense remains the same. It is a principle applicable to all cases in which by virtue of the operationof the Town Planning Act a person is deprived of land whether in whole or in part. [357H-358B] (c) By Art. 31(2)as it originally stood, exercise of the power to legislate for-compulsory acquisition was subject to the condition that the law for compulsory acquisition for public purposes either fixed the amount of the compensation or specified the principles on which, and the manner in which, the compensation was to be determined and given.
 'Ibis Court in Bela Banerjee's case [1953] INSC 81; [1954] S.C.R. 558 and Subodh Gopals case[1953] INSC 85; , [1954] S.C.R. 587, held that 'compensation' meant a 'just equivalent'. But after the Fourth Amendment Act; adequacy of compensation fixed by the Legislature or awarded according to the principles specified by the legislature for determination is not justiciable. It does not mean, however, that something fixed or determined by the application of specified principles which is illusory or can in no sense be regarded as compensation must be upheld by the courts, for to do so, would be to grant a charter of arbitrariness, and permit a device to defeat a constitutional guarantee.
 343 But compensation fixed or determined on principles specified by the Legislature cannot be permitted to be challenged on the indefinite plea that it is not a 'just or fair' equiv alent. Principles may be challenged on the ground that they are irrelevant to the determination of compensation, but not on the plea that what is awarded as a result of the application of those principles is not just or fair compensation. Such a challenge will be in clear violation of the constitutional declaration that adequacy of compensation provided is not justiciable. [366 A-D] Observations contra in P. Vajravelu Mudaliar v. The Special Deputy Collector, Madras, [1964] INSC 214; [1965] 1 S.C.R. 614, obiter.
 Union of India v. Metal Corporation of India Ltd. [1966] INSC 154; [1967] 1 S.C.R. 255 overruled, because (i) Parliament had specified in the Metal Corporation of India (Acquisition of Undertaking) Act, 1965, the principles for determining compensation of the undertaking, (ii) those principles expressly related to the determination of compensation payable, (iii) they were not irrelevant to the determination of compensation, and (iv) the compensation was not illusory.
 [370C] (d)The statute which permits the property of an owner to be compulsorily acquired by payment of market value at a date which is many years before the date on which the title of the owner is extinguished cannot be attacked on the ground of unreasonableness, because, a law made under Art.
 31(2) is not liable to challenge on the ground that it violates Art. 19(1)(f). [370 H] Smt. Sitabati Debi v. State of West Bengal, [1967] 2 S.C.R.
 749, followed.
 (e)The validity of the statute cannot depend upon whether in a given case it operates harshly. If the scheme came into force within a reasonable time from the-date on which the declaration of intention to make the scheme was notified, it could not be contended that fixation of compensation according to s. 67, would make the scheme invalid. The fact that considerable time elapsed cannot be a ground for declaring the section ultra vires. [371 B] (f)If s. 71 read with s. 67 lays down a principle of valuation, it cannot bestruck down on the ground that, because of the exigencies of the scheme,it is not possible to allot a reconstituted plot to an owner of land covered by the scheme. [371 D] (g)The method of determining compensation in respect of lands which are subject to the town planning scheme is prescribed in the Town Planning Act and when power is given under the statute to do a certain thing in a certain way, it must be done in that way or not at all. Therefore, unlike Vajravelu, Mudaliar's case, where the State Government could resort to one of two methods-the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 or the Land Acquisition (Madras Amendment) Act, 1961,and therefore arbitrarily, in the present case, the local authority can only act under the Town Planning Act for purposes of town planning, and therefore does not violate Art. 14.
