 Resin is a forest produce extracted from certain pieces of trees popularly known as Chir trees. The process of extraction is called tapping, involves several steps, and requires employment of skilled labour and involves a considerable amount of expenditure. The State of Jammu & Kashmir started tapping operation in respect of its Chir trees since about 1973 by giving contracts to private parties for extraction and collection of resin. The contracts were of three types; one was contract on wage basis commonly known as wage contract which was given by auctioning the blazes to the person who was prepared to undertake the work of extraction and collection of resin at the lowest rates of labour charges and in such contract the entire resin extracted and collected by the contractor would belong to the State and the contractor would be entitled only to the wage or labour charges for extraction and collection of resin; the second type of contract was on the basis of royalty without load and under this contract which was given by auction stipulating for payment of royalty per blaze, the entire resin extracted and collected by the contractor would belong to him and he would be free to sell or process it as he likes; the third type of contract was on the basis of royalty with load and under this contract which was also given by auction, the royalty was payable per blaze and out of resin extracted and collected by the companies, a certain part would have to be surrendered to the State, while the balance would remain with the contractor.
 Every year, the State auctioned the blazes in the different forests within its territory and about 40 per cent of the forests were given on royalty basis, some with load and some without load, while the balance of about 60 per cent were given on wage contract basis. Most of the contractors bidding at the auction were having their factories outside Jammu & Kashmir either in U.P. or in Punjab. The State in furtherance of its policy to bring about rapid industrialisation decided that from the year 1979-80 onwards the resin extracted from its forests should not be allowed to be exported outside the territories of the State and should be utilised only by industries set up within the State. The State, in fact, entered into contracts with three manufacturers, namely, Prabhat Turpentine & Synthetics Pvt. Ltd., Dujedwala Resin and Turpentine Co.
 Ltd. and Pine Chemicals Ltd. Under these contracts the three manufacturers agreed to set up factories in the State for the manufacture of resin turpentine and other derivatives and the State agreed to make available to them respectively an ensured supply of 4000, 3500 and 8000 metric tonnes of resin per year. The State had also commitments to supply resin to its own concerns namely, J&K Industries Ltd. which was running a factory for manufacture of resin and turpentine as also to various small scale units which are set up in the State. Since 1339 the total requirement of these 24,000 metric tonnes always fell short it was decided at a meeting held on 9th December, 1976 of the Forest officials that the increase of target of production could be achieved only through replacement of royalty contracts by wage contracts wherever possible and hence in future blazes should be auctioned for tapping only on wage contract basis.
 There were certain forests in Resin and Ramban Division of the State which was out of access on account of their distance from the roads and so were some forests in the Poonch Division near the line of actual control and there were 1,28,856 blazes situated in the lower regions of inaccessible forests and no contractors could be found for taking tapping contracts even on the basis of royalty without load for blazes in the higher regions of the inaccessible areas. In the Rasi Division out of 6,08,115 blazes which were attempted to be given for tapping in the year 1976-77 on royalty contract basis without load, only 1,28,856 blazes were taken by one Prem Kumar Sood and that too on royalty of only Rs. 2.55 per blaze as against royalty of about Rs. 6 per blaze obtained by the State in other inaccessible areas by giving contract on royalty basis with load of 3 Kg. per blaze. For the year 1978-79 no one came forward to make a bid for taking the contract even on royalty basis without load, with the result that practically no tapping was done from these 6,08,115 blazes in the forests of the Rasi division upto 1979-80. There were also some new blazes marked in the forests of the Rasi division for the year 1979-80 and out of them 4,20,340 blazes were in areas which were inaccessible on account of their being at a distance of 8 to 40 kilometers from the road side. Even out of the old 6,08,115 there were 3,10,604 blazes which were situated in the same category of inaccessible areas. So far as the forests in the Ramban Division are concerned there were 1,24,400 blazes which were equally inaccessible "due to long lead up to coupe boundaries and transit depots" and the position in regard to 3,30,000 blazes which were under tapping in Poonch Division was also similar to that of the inaccessible areas in Rasi and Ramban Division with the additional handicap of their being situated along the line of actual control. There were thus in all about 11,85,414 blazes in the Rasi, Ramban and Poonch Division which were inaccessible areas and having regard to the high cost of extraction and collection of resin as also the scarcity of trained labour in those areas it was not possible to give out those blazes by auction on wage contract basis. The past experience showed that even on the basis of royalty without load contractors were not forthcoming for taking contracts in respect of blazes in the inaccessible areas of the Rasi Division and giving out of the aforesaid blazes in the Rasi Ramban and Poonch Division on wage contract basis was, therefore, almost an impossible proposition. The Chief Conservator of Forests and other Forest Officers accordingly decided at the meeting held on December 9, 1978 that those blazes could not be tapped through wage contract because "apart from the total non-availability of local labour in these areas cost of production due to long lead up to coupe boundaries and transit depots would be prohibitive" and all such areas should, therefore, be excluded from tapping through wage contract. These decisions taken at the meeting on 9th December, 1978 were confirmed at a subsequent meeting which took place between Forest Minister, the Forest Secretary, the Chief Conservative Forest Officer and other Forest Officers on 26th December, 1978. It was further decided in this meeting that the "departmental tapping through wage contract should be confined to accessible Chir forests" only and so far as 11,85,414 blazes in the inaccessible areas of the Rasi, Ramban and Poonch Division are concerned the consensus was that "these blazes should be allotted to some private party 1340 as procurement of resin from them through wage contracts was not feasible being difficult and costly" and "the financial status and experience in extraction of resin from forest and its distillation in the factory should be decisive factors" in regard to such allotment. Therefore, the second respondent who had earlier addressed a letter dated 15th April, 1978 to the State Government offering to set up a factory for manufacture of resin turpentine oil and other derivatives in the State with the latest know-how under the supervision of the State Government and seeking allotment of 10,000 metric tonnes of resin annually for the purpose was, by an Order of the State Government dated 27th April, 1979, sanctioned allotment of 11.85 lacs blazes in the inaccessible areas of Rasi, Ramban and Poonch Divisions for a period of 10 years on the terms and conditions set out in the order.
 The petitioners, thereupon challenged this order made by the State Government under Article 32 of the Constitution on the grounds, namely, (a) that the order is arbitrary, mala fide and not in public interest, inasmuch as a huge benefit has been conferred on the 2nd respondents at the cost of the State; (b) the order creates monopoly in favour of the 2nd respondent who is a private party and constitutes unreasonable restriction on the right of the petitioners to carry on tapping contract business under Art. 19(1)(g) of the Constitution; and (c) the State has acted arbitrarily in selecting the 2nd respondent for awarding tapping contract, without affording any opportunity to others to complete for obtaining such contract and this action of the State is not based on any rational or relevant principle and is, therefore, violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution as also of the rule of administrative Law which inhibits arbitrary action by the State.
 Dismissing the petitions, the Court ^ 
 HELD: (1) With the growth of the welfare state, new forms of property in the shape of Government largess are developing, since the Government is increasingly assuming the role of regulator and dispenser of social services and provider of a large number of benefits including jobs, contracts, licences, quotas, mineral rights etc. There is increasing expansion of the magnitude and range of governmental functions, as we move closer to the welfare state, and the result is that more and more of our wealth consists of these new forms of property. Some of these forms of wealth may be in the nature of privilege. The law has however not been slow to recognise the importance of this new kind of wealth and the need to protect individual interest in it and with that end in view, it has developed new forms of protection. Some interests in Government largess, formerly regarded as privileges, have been recognised as rights, while others have been given legal protection not only by forging procedural safeguards but also by confining, structuring and checking Government discretion in the matter of grant of such largess. [1354 F- H, 1355 A] The discretion of the Government is not unlimited in that the Government cannot give largess in its arbitrary discretion or at its sweet will or on such terms as it chooses in its absolute discretion. There are two limitations imposed by law which structure and control the discretion of the Government in this behalf. The first is in regard to the terms on which largess may be granted and the other, in regard to the persons who may be recipients of such largess.
 [1355 A-B] So far as the first limitation is concerned, it flows directly from the thesis that, unlike a private individual, the State cannot act as it pleases in the matter 1341 of giving largess. Though ordinarily a private individual would be guided by economic considerations of self-gain in any action taken by him, it is always open to him under the law to act contrary to his self-interest or to oblige another in entering into a contract or dealing with his property. But the Government is not free to act as it likes in granting largess such as awarding a contract or selling or leasing out its property. Whatever be its activity, the Government is still the Government and is, subject to restraints inherent in its position in a democratic society.
 The constitutional power conferred on the Government cannot be exercised by it arbitrarily or capriciously or in an unprincipled manner; it has to be exercised for the public good. Every activity of the Government has a public element in it and it must therefore, be informed with reason and guided by public interest. Every action taken by the Government must be in public interest; the Government cannot act arbitrarily and without reason and if it does, its action would be liable to be invalidated. If the Government awards a contract or leases out or otherwise deals with its property or grants any other largess, it would be liable to be tested for its validity on the touch-stone of reasonableness and public interest and if it fails to satisfy either test, it would be unconstitutional and invalid. [1355 B-F] Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. The International Airport Authority of India & Ors. [1979] INSC 111; [1979] 3 S. C. R. 1014, reiterated.
 (2) In forming his own conception of what is reasonable, in all the circumstances of a given case, it is inevitable that the social philosophy and the scale of values of the judge participating in the decision, would play an important part, but even so, the test of reasonableness is not a wholly subjective test and its contours are fairly indicated by the Constitution. The concept of reasonableness in fact pervades the entire constitutional scheme. The requirement of reasonableness runs like a golden thread through the entire fabric of fundamental rights and, as several decisions of this Court show, this concept of reasonableness finds its positive manifestation and expression in the lofty ideal of social and economic justice which inspires and animates the Directive Principles. Article 14 strikes at arbitrariness in State action and since the principle of reasonableness and rationality, which is legally as well as philosophically an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness, is projected by this article, it must characterise every governmental action, whether it be under the authority of law or in exercise of executive power without making of law.
 So also the concept of reasonableness runs through the totality of Art. 19 and requires that restrictions on the freedoms of the citizens, in order to be permissible, must at the least be reasonable. Similarly Art. 21 in the full plenitude of its activist magnitude as discovered by Maneka Gandhi's case, insists that no one shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except in accordance with procedure established by law and such procedure must be reasonable, fair and just.
 [1355 G-H, 1356 A-D] State of Madras v. V. G. Rao [1952] INSC 19; [1952] SCR 597; Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India [1978] 2 SCR 621; E. P. Royappa v.
 State of Tamil Nadu [1973] INSC 214; [1974] 2 SCR 348 referred to.
 (3) The Directive Principles concretise and give shape to the concept of reasonableness envisaged in Articles 14, 19 and 21 and other Articles enumerating the fundamental rights. By defining the national aims and the constitutional goals, they set forth the standards or norms of reasonableness which must guide and animate governmental action. Any action taken by the Government 1342 with a view to giving effect to any one or more of the Directive Principles would ordinarily, subject to any constitutional or legal inhibitions or other overriding considerations, qualify for being regarded as reasonable, while an action which is inconsistent with or runs counter to a Directive Principle would incur the reproach of being unreasonable. [1356 D-F] (4) The concept of public interest must as far as possible receive its orientation from the Directive Principles. What according to the founding fathers constitutes the plainest requirement of public interest is set out in the Directive Principles and they embody par excellence the constitutional concept of public interest.
 If, therefore any governmental action is calculated to implement or give effect to a Directive Principle, it would ordinarily, subject to any other overriding considerations, be informed with public interest. [1356 A-H, 1357 A] (5) Where any governmental action fails to satisfy the test of reasonableness and public interest and is found to be wanting in the qualities of reasonableness or lacking in the element of public interest, it would be liable to be struck down as invalid. It must follow as a necessary corollary from this proposition that the Government cannot act in a manner which would benefit a private party at the cost of the State; such an action would be both unreasonable and contrary to public interest. The Government, therefore, cannot, for example, give a contract or sell or lease-out its property for a consideration less than the highest that can be obtained for it, unless of course there are other considerations which render it reasonable and in public interest to do so. Such considerations may be that some Directive Principle is sought to be advanced or implemented or that the contract or the property is given not with a view, to earning revenue but for the purpose of carrying out a welfare scheme for the benefit of a particular group or section of people deserving it or that the person who has offered a higher consideration is not otherwise fit to be given the contract at the property. These considerations are referred to only illustratively for there may be an infinite variety of considerations which may have to be taken into account by the Government in formulating its policies and it is on a total evaluation of various considerations which have weighed with the Government in taking a particulars action, that the Court would have to decide whether the action of the Government is reasonable and in public interest. [1357 A-E] But one basic principle which must guide the Court in arriving at its determination on this question is that there is always a presumption that the Government action is reasonable and in public interest and it is for the party challenging its validity to show that it is wanting in reasonableness or is not informed with public interest. This burden is a heavy one and it has to be discharged to the satisfaction of the Court by proper and adequate material.
 The Court cannot lightly assume that the action taken by the Government is unreasonable or without public interest because, there are a large number of policy considerations which must necessarily weigh with the Government in taking action and therefore the Court would not strike down governmental action as invalid on this ground, unless it is clearly satisfied that the action is unreasonable or not in public interest. But where it is so satisfied, it would be the plainest duty of the Court under the Constitution to invalidate the governmental action. This is one of the most important function of the Court and also one of the most essential for preservation of the rule of law. [1357 E-H] 1343 It is imperative in a democracy governed by the rule of law that governmental action must be kept within the limits of the law and if there is any transgression, the Court must be ready to condemn it. It is a matter of historical experience that there is a tendency in every government to assume more and more powers and since it is not an uncommon phenomenon in many countries that the legislative check is getting diluted, it is left to the Court as the only other reviewing authority under the Constitution to be increasingly vigilant to ensure observance with the rule of law and in this task, the Court must not finch or falter.
 This ground of invalidity, namely, that the governmental action is unreasonable or lacking the quality of public interest, is different from that of mala fides though it may, in a given case, furnish evidence of mala fides. [1358 A-C] (6) The second limitation on the discretion of the Government in grant of largess is in regard to the persons to whom such largess may be granted. The Government is not free like an ordinary individual, in selecting the recipients for its largess and it cannot choose to deal with any person it pleases in its absolute and unfettered discretion. The law is now well established that the Government need not deal with anyone, but if it does so, it must do so fairly without discrimination and without unfair procedure. [1358 C-E] Where the Government is dealing with the public, whether by way of giving jobs or entering into contracts or granting other forms of largess, the Government cannot act arbitrarily at its sweet will and, like a private individual, deal with any person it pleases, but its action must be in conformity with some standard or norm which is not arbitrary, irrational or irrelevant. The governmental action must not be arbitrary or capricious, but must be based on some principle which meets the test of reason and relevance. [1358 B] In the instant case;
 A. The impugned order cannot be said to be disadvantageous to the State or in any way favouring the second respondents at the cost of the State. [1363 B] (i) It was not a tapping contract simpliciter which was intended to be given to the second respondents. The whole object of the impugned order was to make available 3500 metric tonnes of resin to the second respondents for the purpose of running the factory to be set up by them. [1361 B, E] (ii) The advantage to the State was that a new factory for manufacture of resin, turpentine oil and other derivatives would come up within its territories offering more job opportunities to the State and increasing their prosperity and augmenting the State revenues and in addition the State would be assured of a definite supply of at least 1500 metric tonnes of resin for itself without any financial involvement or risk and with this additional quantity of resin available to it, it would be able to set up another factory creating more employment opportunities. [1361 E-G] (iii) The State would be able to secure extraction of resin from the inaccessible areas on the best possible term instead of allowing them to remain unexploited or given over at ridiculously low royalty. [1361 E-H] (iv) No huge benefit was conferred on the second respondents at the cost of the State. The terms of the contract made it clear that the second respon- 1344 dents would have to extract at least 5000 metric tonnes of resin from the blazes allotted to them in order to be entitled to retain 3500 metric tonnes. [1362 A-B] (v) Under the impugned order the State would get 1500 metric tonnes of resin at the rate of Rs. 114/-per quintal while the second respondent would have to pay at the rate of Rs. 474/- per quintal for the balance of 3500 metric tonnes retained by them. Obviously, a large benefit would accrue to the State under the impugned order. If the State were to get the blazes in these inaccessible areas tapped through wage contract, the minimum cost would be Rs. 175/- per quintal, without taking into account the additional expenditure on account of interest, but under the impugned order the State would get 1500 metric tonnes of resin at a greatly reduced rate of Rs. 114/- per quintal without any risk or hazard.
 The State would also receive for 3500 metric tonnes of resin retained by the second respondent price or royalty at the rate of Rs. 474/- per quintal which would be much higher than the rate of Rs. 260/- per quintal at which the State was allotting resin to medium scale industrial units and the rate of Rs. 320/-per quintal at which it was allotting resin of small scale units within the State. [1362 G-H, 1363 A-B] B. The impugned order neither created any monopoly in favour of the second respondent nor imposed unreasonable restriction on the right of the petitioner to carry on tapping business under Article 19(1)(g). [1364 D] (i) The impugned order did not hand over the tapping of the entire forest area in the State exclusively to the 2nd respondent so as to deny the opportunity of tapping any forest areas to the petitioner. What was done under the impugned order was merely to allot 11,85,414 blazes in the inaccessible areas of Rasi, Ramban and Poonch divisions to the 2nd respondent so that the respondent could have an assured supply of 3500 metric tonnes of resin for the purpose of feeding the factory to be set up by them in the State and a large number of blazes amounting to about 60 lacks in other forest areas of the State were left available for tapping by the petitioners and other forest contractors.
 [1364 D-G] (ii) The petitioner and other forest contractors could bid for wage contract in respect of the other blazes which were more than five times in number than the blazes allotted to the second respondent. The petitioners in writ petition 481 of 1979, in fact, obtained a wage contract for extraction of resin from an easily accessible forest in Rajouri Division for the aggregate sum of Rs. 2,80,250/- in the year 1979-80 and though it is true that the petitioners in writ petition No. 482/79 did not obtain any wage contract for tapping in this year, it was not because blazes were not available for tapping, but because the petitioner did not get their registration renewed. [1364 F-H] C. Neither the impugned order in favour of the second respondents could be said to be arbitrary and unreasonable.
 [1365 A] (i) The State was not unjustified in excluding 11,85,414 blazes situated in the inaccessible areas of Rasi, Ramban and Poonch divisions from the auctions, since the past experience showed that even on the basis of royalty without load, it was difficult to attract bidders and the maximum that could be obtained, and that too only in one solitary year, was Rs. 2-55 per blaze without load, which was an absurdly low return and it was, therefore, felt quite 1345 justifiably, that it would be futile to include these blazes in the auctions for tapping on wage contract bases.
 The State also could not award a contract simpliciter for tapping on the basis of royalty with or without load because as a matter of policy, with a view to encouraging industrialisation, the State did not want resin to go outside its territories but wanted it to be used only for the purpose of feeding industries set up within the State and even if a condition could legitimately be imposed on the contractor that he should sell the resin extracted and retained by him only to industries within the State, it would be difficult to ensure observance of such condition and moreover the object of the State to make resin available to the local industries at a reasonable price might be frustrated, because the contractor taking advantage of scarcity in supply of resin might, and in all probability would, try to extract a much higher price from the industries needing resin. It was thus found to be an impracticable proposition to tap these blazes either on wage contract basis or on the basis of royalty with or without load. [1365 A-F] (ii) The impugned Order was unquestionable and without doubt in the interest of the State and even with a microscopic examination there in nothing in it which could possibly incur the reproach of being condemned as arbitrary or irrational. [1366 B-C] (iii) It is true that no advertisements were issued by the State inviting tenders for award of tapping contract in respect of these blazes or stating that tapping contract would be given to any party who is prepared to put up a factory for manufacture of resin, turpentine oil and other derivatives within the State, but it was not a tapping contract simpliciter which was being given by the State. The tapping contract was being given by way of allocation of raw material for feeding the factory to be set up by the 2nd respondent [1366 A-C] The predominent purpose of the transaction was to ensure setting up of a factory by the 2nd respondent as part of the process of industrialisation of the State and since the 2nd respondent wanted assurance of a definite supply of resin as a condition of putting up the factory, the State awarded the tapping contract to the 2nd respondent for that purpose. If the State were giving tapping contract simpliciter there can be no doubt that the State would have to auction or invite tenders for securing the highest price, subject, of course, to any other relevant overriding considerations of public weal or interest, but in a case like this where the State is allocating resources such as water, power, raw material etc., for the purpose of encouraging setting up of industries within the State, the State is not bound to advertise and tell the people that it wants a particular industry to be set up within the State and invite those interested to come up with proposals for the purpose. The State may choose to do so if it thinks fit and in a given situation, it may even turn out to be advantageous for the State to do so, but if any private party comes before the State and offers to set up an industry, the State would not be committing breach of any constitutional or legal obligation if it negotiates which such party and agrees to provide resources and other facilities for the purpose of setting up the industry. The State is not obliged to tell such party; "Please wait I will first advertise, see whether any other offers are forthcoming and then after considering all offers, decide whether I should let you set up the industry". It would be most unrealistic to insist on such a procedure, particularly in an area like Jammu and Kashmir which on account of historical, political and other reasons, is not yet industrially developed and where entrepreneurs have to be offered attractive terms in order to persuade them to set up an 1346 industry. The State must be free in such a case to negotiate with a private entrepreneur with a view to inducing him to set up an industry within the State and if the State enters into a contract with such entrepreneur for providing resources and other facilities for setting up an industry, the contract cannot be assailed as invalid so long as the State has acted bona fide, reasonably and in public interest. If the terms and conditions of the contract or the surrounding circumstances show that the State has acted mala fide or out of improper or corrupt motive or in order to promote the private interests of some one at the cost of the State, the Court will undoubtedly interfere and strike down State action as arbitrary, unreasonable or contrary to public interest. But so long as the State action is bona fide and reasonable, the Court will not interfere merely on the ground that no advertisement was given or publicity made or tenders invited.
