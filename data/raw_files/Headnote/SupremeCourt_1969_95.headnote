 The respondent was elected as Pradhan of a Goan Sabha in Uttar Pradesh. The appellant-government by an order suspended the respondent, and pending enquiry, directed the respondent to give charge to the up-pradhan. The respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging the order. The High Court dismissed the petition but in appeal, the High Court quashed the order holding that s. 95(1)(g) of the U.P. Panehayat Raj Act, 1947 did not empower the Government to pass the impugned order. In appeal by special leave, this Court affirming the decision of the appellate bench of the High Court, 
HELD : Where an Act confers a jurisdiction it impliedly also grants the power of doing all such acts, or employing such means as are essentially necessary to its execution. But before implying the existence of such a power the court must be satisfied that the existence of that power is absolutely essential for the discharge of the power conferred and not merely that it is convenient to have such a power. The power to place under suspension an officer is not absolutely essential for the proper exercise of the power conferred under s. 95(1)(g). It cannot be said that the power in question cannot be properly exercised without the power to suspend pending enquiry. The mere possibility of interference with the course of enquiry or of further misuse of powers are not sufficient to enlarge the scope of a statutory power. If it is otherwise, the mere power to punish an offender would have been held sufficient to arrest and detain him pending enquiry and trial. There would have been no need to confer specific power to arrest and detain persons charged with offences before their conviction.
 Further no provision either in the Act or in the rules framed thereunder has been shown under which the Government could have directed the up-Pradhan to officiate as Pradhan during the Suspension of the respondent. If the order could not have been made, is it could not be made, then the question arises as to_who could discharge the functions or Pradhan when he is placed under suspension pending enquiry of the charges levelled against him. Absence of a provision providing for such a contingency is a clear indication of the absence of the power contended for. [154 F-155 D] Babu Nandan v. Sub Divisional Officer Salempur A.I.R 1966 All 1958, approved.
 A Pradhan cannot be considered is a servant of Government.
 He is an elected representative. There is no contractual relationship between him and the Government much less the relationship of master and servant [154 A-B] Management of Hotel Imperial, New Delhi v.

 152 The Goan Sabha is the creature of a statute. Its powers and duties as well as the powers and duties of its officers are all regulated by the Act Hence no question of any inherent power 'arises for consideration.
