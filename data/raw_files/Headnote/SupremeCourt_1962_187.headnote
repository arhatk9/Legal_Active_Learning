 The appellants carried on the trade of auctioning vegetables in a private house in the Subzimandi quarter. The persons who brought vegetables for sale kept their carts on the public road where they caused obstruction to traffic. The noise caused by the auctioning caused discomfort to persons living in the locality. An order was passed under s. 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure restraining auctioning vege- tables in their house.
 Held, that the order was not justified under s. 133 of the Code. Merely because the appellants carried on auctioning in connection with which the carts were brought, they could not be considered to have caused the obstruction. In a trade like auctioning which has to be carried on as necessary for the well being of the community some amount of noise has to be borne by the public. Section .133 was not intended to stop such trades merely because of the discomfort caused by the noise.
