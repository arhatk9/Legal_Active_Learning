 In the 145 proceedings converted from the 144 proceedings on a police report dated 29-2-1968, both the appellants-second parties and the respondents first parties claimed title as well as possession of the disputed land with them and filed in support documents and several affidavits. The magistrate referred he matte to the Civil Court for a finding on the issue. On a consideration of he materials placed before him, the munsif by an order dated 22-12-1975 found that the appellants-second parties were in possession. The magistrate passed an order dated 7-4-1976 in accordance with the findings on the issue as to possession by the munsif holding that the appellants-second parties were in possession. The High Court in revision under sections 435 and 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898, was of the view that the finding as to possession on the basis of documents alone without applying the mind to the affidavits cannot be sustained and set aside the orders passed by the magistrate.
 Allowing the appeal by special leave, the Court.
 ^ 
 HELD : (1) The finding of the Civil Court given under s. 146(1B) of the 1898 Code regarding possession is final and cannot be challenged by way of appeal, review or revision, though the Civil Court acting under section 146 (IA) and (IB) of the Criminal Procedure Code has not ceased to be a Civil Court. Neither an appeal nor a revision lies against the finding of the Civil Court in the reference because of the express provision in section 146(1D) and not because the proceeding before the Civil Court is not a civil proceeding [951C-D, E] State of U.P. v. Ramachandra Aggarwal [1966] Supp. SCR 393 followed.
 (2) An order passed by the magistrate in conformity with the decision of the Civil Court cannot be challenged under sections 435 and 439 of the code. Sub-section (1B) requires the magistrate on receipt of the findings by the Civil Court to proceed and dispose of the proceedings under s. 145 in conformity with the decision of the Civil Court.
 If the order of the magistrate is in conformity with the decision of the Civil Court, the magistrate will be complying with the requirements of section 146 (1B) and the order thus passed cannot be challenged. It will of course be open to the High Court to interfere if the order of the magistrate is not in conformity with the finding of the Civil Court. When the order of the magistrate is in conformity with the finding of the Civil Court, the High Court has no jurisdiction to interfere under sections 435 and 439 of 948 the Criminal Procedure Code. When there is an express provision namely, sub-section (1D) in the Code against the challenge of the finding of the Civil Court, other provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code cannot be relied on for doing what is expressly prohibited. [952A-D] (3) The powers conferred on the High Court under Art.
 227 of the Constitution cannot in any way be curtailed by the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code. Therefore the powers of the High Court under Art. 227 of the Constitution can be invoked in spite of the restrictions placed under s.
 146 (TD) of the Criminal Procedure Code. [952D-E] But the scope of interference by the High Court under Art. 227 is restricted to seeing that the tribunal functions within its limits of authority. The power of superintendence cannot be invoked to correct the error of fact which only a superior Court can do in exercise of its statutory power as the Court of appeal and that the High Court cannot in exercise of its jurisdiction under Art. 227 convert itself into a Court of appeal.

 In the instant case, the Civil Court has taken into account the affidavits filed on behalf of the parties and rejected them on finding that no weight could be given to the affidavits having been sworn by persons who were interested and belonged to one party or the other. [953D-E] OBSERVATION :
 [In view of the coming into force of the Cr. P.C. 1973 (Act II of 1974) and the amendment of Art. 227 of the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment, the question as dealt with in the Judgment will not any longer arise.]
