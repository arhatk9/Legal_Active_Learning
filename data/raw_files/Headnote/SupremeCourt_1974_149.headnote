 On the death of B who had the Shebaiti right of the deities in a temple, one of his two widows, carried on the sheba puja and on her death, her brother took possession of the temple premises. The other widow filed a suit and obtained a decree in her favour declaring her right to be entitled to the temple premises and to the right of sheba puja. She sold a half share of the temple and the shebaiti right to G for meeting the expenses of the litigation. The appellant, a legatee of G, filed a suit claiming a declaration that he was entitled to the shebaiti right, which the respondents, who are the heirs of 'B' denied. The High Court, in appeal held against the appellant on the ground that the transfer to G was invalid.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : Although shebaiti right is heritable like any other property, it lacks the other incident of proprietary rights, namely, capacity of being freely transferred by the person- in whom it is vested. The rule against alienation of shebaiti right has been relaxed in certain decisions of the High Courts, which are classified under three heads (a) where the transfer is not for any pecuniary benefit and the transferee is the next heir of the transferor or stands in the line of succession of shebaits and suffers from no disqualification regarding the performance of duties; (b) when the transfer is made in the interest of the deity itself and to meet some pressing necessity; and (c) when a valid custom is proved sanctioning the alienation of shebaiti right within a limited circle of purchasers, who are actual or potential shebaits of the deity or otherwise connected with the family. In the present case, the appellant rested his claim on the second exception on the ground that the transfer was made in the interest of the deity and to meet a pressing necessity. But, the appellant cannot invoke the doctrine of transfer of shebait right for the benefit of the deity, because, the transfer to G is illegal, for the reason, that neither the temple nor the deities, nor the shebaiti right can be transferred by sale for pecuniary consideration. The rule of necessity extended only to an alienation of the temporality of the idol and does not and cannot apply to alienation of the spiritual rights and duties. The doctrine of alienability of the shebaitship itself on the ground of necessity or benefit to the deity is based upon a misconception of the observations of the Judicial Committee. Such a sale is void in its inception. An assignment of a religious office by which the alien or gets pecuniary benefit is against public policy and cannot be upheld.

 ARGUMENTS For the appellant-The alienation in favour of G is in same terms as the alienation under which B himself had acquired rights. The documents were understood throughout by all the parties as a mere transfer of the personal proprietary interest of a shebait which is ancillary to his duties as a ministrent of the deity and a manager of its temporalities.
 There is no justification for not giving effect to the true import and substance of the document, and, indeed it was conceded before the High Court that no claim was being laid to either the deity or the temple. In such circumstances, the only question which arose for determination was whether in the fact and circumstances of the instant case the transfer to G was invalid and could not be given effect to.
 729 It is now well settled that in the concept of shebaiti both the elements of office and property are there. It has been held (vide Angurbala v. Devabrata (1951) SCR 1125 that shebaitship is property within the meaning of Hindu Women's Right to Property Act and was also property in the general sense and the general law of succession governed succession to shebaitship. It has also been held that a partition of the shebaiti right amongst several co-shebait or co-heirs can be suitable effected under a scheme allotting different palas or terms of worship to the different claimants (vide I.L.R. 42 Calcutta 445). If the proprietary interest of a shebait is both heritable and capable of being partitioned, there is no reason why, subject to certain limitations, it should not be alienable. To the general rule, founded on the principle that the elements of office and property, of duties and personal interests are more or less blended together, that shebaiti right was inalienable, there are, certain notable exceptions, one being that such transfer is permissible if it was neither contrary to the intentions of the Founder as expressed in the Deed of Endowment or otherwise nor was in any was obnoxious to the principles of Hindu Law, and subject always to this fundamental limitation, a shebait can always transfer his or her shebaiti interest which was an amalagam of office and property for the benefit of the idol or the deity or for any legal or pressing necessity.
 Now in the instant case the following facts are either admitted or found : Either under the transfer from the original founders, or under the transfer to B and also under the transfer to the predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiff, a right of transfer to strangers was conferred expressly and each had a right to extinguish and exhaust the line of succession.
 It is apparent that the intention of the founders was that strangers could be taken in management and power was expressly given by them in redelegate the authority to such strangers. Accordingly, the transfer cannot be said to be contrary to the founders' intentions, and, as the transfer has been made to a person who was in no manner disqualified to discharge the duties of the office of a shebait, the transfer comes squarely under the exception mentioned above.
 To impose a total ban will be contrary to the principle enshrined in Article 19(1)(b) of the Constitution and, in any case it cannot be in consonance with a sound public policy to ban a transfer to a qualified person even in a case of dire legal necessity such as presentation of the very existence of the deities and recover them and their abode from possession of one who had taken forcible possession.
 An alienation of shebaiti right for necessity or benefit of the deity was held justified in the under noted cases 
 1. I.L.R. 17 Cal. 557 
 2. I.L.R. 35 Cal. 226 
3. 42 C.W.N. 1138 
4. 8. I.A. 146 (152) 
5. 44 I.A. 147 
6. 48 I.A. 302 7. 36 I.A. 148.
 
8. 45 C.W.N. 809 
 9. I.L.R. 6 Bom. 298 Therefore, the alienation was wrongly held as invalid.
 For the respondent-The earlier transfers were not challenged in the suit. It is well settled that neither the temple nor the deities can be the subject matter of any sale transactions and this proposition has not been contested by the appellant. That being so, on the face of it, the impugned transfer should fail. It is submitted that the deed should be read as a whole from which the subject matter of the sale is to be ascertained. That being so, it is not permissible to consider separately the question of transfer of the half share of her shebaiti-right. It is submitted that the 'said transfer as a whole should be held to be invalid.
 Even assuming that the question of transfer of shebaiti- right can be separated, ,as contended by the appellant, the transfer of shebaite-right should be held to be 730 invalid. It has been held in Raja Ravi Varma's case (4 I.A.
 76) and in several other decisions that sale of shebaitship is altogether void. This subject has been dealt within detail by Dr. B.K. Mukherjee in his Tagore Law Lectures on Hindu Law of Religious and Charitable Trusts delivered in 1951 at pages 228 onwards of the Original Edition. After considering the texts and Case Law on the subject the opinion expressed by the learned author is that although alienation may be permissible in favour of next shebait or one in the line of succession or to a co-shebait the same cannot be made in favour of a stranger even on the ground of necessity. The learned author at page 235 has observed that certain decisions of the Calcutta High Court which hid purported to uphold the transfer of shabaiti-right on the ground of necessity was of doubtful authority and was to a great extent based upon misconstruction of certain pronouncements of the judicial Committee. The editor of the said Edition of Dr. Mukherjee's said Tagore Law Lectures (Mr. T. L. Venkatarama Ayyar) has also expressed the same view. This being the legal position, it is submitted G did not acquire any right of shabaitship of the deities by the deed of' sale in his favour. Accordingly the appellant also derived no right and the High Court in appeal rightly decided the question raised before it.
 For the Receiver : On behalf of the Receiver some submissions were made regarding his remuneration and expenses including the salary of his clerk.
