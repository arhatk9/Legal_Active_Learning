 Respondents No. 1 to 5 entered into an agreement with the appellant whereunder the appellant advanced money to the respondents and the respondents entrusted the management of their property, consisting of land and the buildings and the machinery of mills standing thereon, to the appellant for a period of one year. The agreement provided that on the expiry of period of one year, respondents would get back possession of their property after paying the amount due to the appellant. However, before the expiry of the period of one year fixed under the agreement the respondents entered into another agreement, dated March 22, 1955 with one TM which provided that on paying the amount due to the appellant after the stipulated period TM could take up the management by himself, pay the rent of the building, conduct the business and if necessary file a suit against the appellant and get the Mill vacated and do anything as per his will and pleasure. Thereafter, TM executed a Deed of Assignment, dated December 11, 1956, whereby he assigned the property to the appellant for a sale consideration with liberty to the appellant to manage the mills, to enter into rental agreement with the Jenmi of the building by paying the rent directly, to effect alienation etc. The said agreement also provided that TM would not have any right or liability thereafter.
 Subsequently, respondent Nos. 1,3 and 5 filed a suit against respondent Nos.2, 4 and 6 as well as against the appellant and TM seeking 372 partition and separate possession of their shares in the suit properties, and for possession of the mill contending that the agreement dated March 22, 1955 executed by respondent Nos. 1 to 5 in favour of TM was a sham transaction and no rights were conferred on TM under the said agreement. TM died during the pendency of the suit. In the suit all disputes between the parties and the legal representatives of TM were settled out of Court and the only dispute requiring adjudication was that relating to the property in question which was claimed by the appellant as the assignee from TM. The said suit was dismissed by the Trial Court. Respondents 1 to 6 filed an appeal in the High Court against the said judgment which was dismissed. While the said appeal was pending before the High Court, respondent Nos. 1 to 6 filed a suit for redemption and recovery of possession of property and decree for possession of the suit property excluding the plant and machinery was passed in favour of the respondents. The appeal filed by the appellant was dismissed by the First Appellate Court and the second appeal filed by the appellant was also dismissed by the High Court. Relying upon the judgment of the Additional Sub-Judge in the earlier suit the High Court rejected the contention urged by the appellant that there was relationship of landlord and tenant between the plaintiff respondents and him and he was entitled to protection of the Kerala Building (Lease and Rent Control) Act.
 In appeal to this Court, on the question whether the respondents had a subsisting leasehold interest in the property in question, it was contended on behalf of the appellant that the judgment of the Additional Sub-Judge, having merged in the judgment of the High Court on appeal, the said judgment of the High Court alone was operative and as per that judgment the earlier suit only related to transfer of movable property, namely, the Oil Mill. As regards the leasehold rights in the suit property it was submitted that the respondents ceased to have any subsisting right in the property as lessee since they impliedly surrendered their leasehold rights in favour of TM by executing the agreement dated March 22, 1955; thereafter a fresh tenancy was created in favour of TM by executing the agreement dated March 22, 1955; thereafter a fresh tenancy was created in favour of TM which was assigned by him in favour of the appellant.
 Allowing the appeal and setting aside the judgment of the High Court, this Court, 373 
 HELD : 1. The judgment of Additional Sub-Judge had merged in the judgment of the High Court on appeal which shows that the earlier suit was confined to the Oil Mill only, treating it as movable property and the said suit did not relate to the land and building in which the oil mill is installed and the plea raised in that suit can have no bearing in the subsequent suit relating to possession of land and building. [380A-B] 
 2. It was permissible for the appellant to raise the plea that the plaintiffs have no subsistitng leasehold interest in the suit property and the appellant is in possession of the same as a tenant of the owner of the property. [380-C] 
 3. Under Clause (f) of Section 111 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, implied surrender is a mode for determination of a lease of immovable property. In English Law, delivery of possession by tenant to a landlord and his acceptance of possession effects a surrender by operation of law. It is also called implied surrender in contradistinction to express surrender which must be either by deed or in writing. Directing the occupier to acknowledge the landlord as his landlord, i.e., to attorn to the landlord, is a sufficient delivery of possession by the tenant to the landlord. Receipt of rent from a person in possession may be evidence of the landlord's acceptance of him as tenant, whether he is a stranger or whether he was already in possession as sub-tenant. [380F-G] Under the illustration to clause (f) of Section 111 of the Transfer of Property Act, there would be an implied surrender of the former lease if a lessee accepts from his lessor a new lease of the property leased to take effect during the continuance of the existing lease. The said illustration is, however, not exhaustive of cases in which there may be an implied surrender of the lease. Just as under the English Law, there can be an implied surrender under the law of transfer of property in India, if the lessor grants a new lease to a third person with the assent of the lessee under the existing lease who delivers the possession to such person or where the lessee directs his sub-tenant to pay the rent directly to a lessor.

 4. By executing the agreement dated March22, 1955 respondent Nos. 1 to 5 surrendered their leasehold interest in favour of TM inasmuch as in clause 4 of the said agreement they have clearly stated that respondents will not have any responsibility or objection for TM paying the amount due to the appellant after the stipulated period and take up the management by himself and pay the rent of the building and conduct its business.
 [382-F] 
 5. After the execution of the agreement dated March 22, 1955, TM entered into an agreement with the landlord for a fresh lease on a higher rent and by Deed of Assignment dated December 11, 1956, TM impliedly surrendered his leasehold rights in the suit property. [383A-C] 
 6. On the date of the filing of the present suit the respondents had no subsisting leasehold interest in the suit property. The suit for the recovery of the possession of the suit property field by them on the basis that they are the lessees thereof was, therefore, not maintainable and is liable to be dismissed. [383-E]
