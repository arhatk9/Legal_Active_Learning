 In May 1956, One D obtained a money decree against H. in January 1958, T was appointed Receiver in an insolvency proceeding against one G, a partner of the defendant firm in respect of premises No. 99 and 128 Cotton Street, Calcutta for the purpose of selling those properties. On April 3, 1958, Mr T was also appointed receiver in execution of the decree obtained by D for the sale of the two premises. The properties were put up for sale by auction and K was declared tile purchaser of premises No. 128, Cotton Street.
 K made a deposit of earnest money. There were various proceedings thereafter but on May 19, 1964, the receiver was directed to complete the sale within one month and K was directed to pay the balance of the purchase money. The Receiver was directed to execute and register a conveyance on behalf or the judgment-debtors in case of refusal. On June 17, 1964, the Receiver executed the conveyance on behalf of the judgment-debtor and the insolvent. in due course, the Court made an order to deliver up vacant possession to the auction-purchaser and on appeal, the appellate Court 'Confirmed the original order.
 The main contention of the appellant was that as soon as a receiver in execution has executed a conveyance in favour of an auction purchaser, the decree stands satisfied and there is an end of the execution proceedings. For delivery of vacant possession of the immovable property he has to file a separate suit to get that possession.
 Dismissing the appeal and agreeing with the decision of the Calcutta High Court in Kailash Chandra Tarafdar v. Gopal Chandra Poddar, I.L.R. 53 Calcutta 781, 
HELD : (i) if a confirmation of the sale would finally terminate all questions as to the execution of the decree, it is difficult to appreciate why the legislature would frame such rules as rules 95 to 102 under order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure. The legislature must have thought that the duty of the executing court should not end with the confirmation of the Sale as it is because the legislature thought "that the auction purchaser should have the right of applying for possession under the provisions of r. 95 and r.
 96 that proceedings for obtaining possession were included in the catena of rules relating to the execution of the decree". [213G] (ii) Sec. 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure should be construed liberally. If such a construction is put it is difficult to understand why a decree holder who has been a party to the decree will shed his character as such party merely upon purchasing the property at the execution sale.
 After all, a decree holder purchases the property in execution of his decree with the permission of the Court.
 There is no reason why he should not retain his character of a party to the suit until the delivery of possession to him of the property purchased by him. Having regard to the consideration, if any question is raised by the judgment- debtor at the time of delivery of possession concerning the nature of the rights purchased and if the judgment-debtor offers any resistance to delivery of possession the question must be one which in our view relates to the execution, discharge and satisfaction of the decree and arises between the parties to the suit. [213 H] Kailash Chandra Tarafdar v. Gopal Chandra Podder I.L.R. 53 Calcutta 781 referred to and Ram Singh Gopal Singh and others v. Abdullah Habilullah I,L.R. 26 Lah. 252 over ruled.
