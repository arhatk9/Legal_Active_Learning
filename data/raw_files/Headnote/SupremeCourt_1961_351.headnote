 The Punjab Tehsildari Rules, 1932, were framed under s. 9 of the Punjab Land Revenue Act, 1887, by the Financial Commissioner. They conferred authority upon the Financial Commissioner to appoint and to remove Tehsildars from service. After the enactment of the Government of India Act, 1935, s. 9 was amended by the Adaptation of Indian Laws Order, 1937, and the power of the Financial Commissioner to make such rules was abrogated. The appellant, who was a Tehsildar, was dismissed by the Financial Commissioner in 1953. The appellant contended that the Financial Commissioner was not competent to remove him from service as his powers to make rules regarding appointment and removal from service of Tehsildars were abrogated and the Tehsildari Rules lost their vitality as they were not preserved by the Government of India Act, 1935, or by the Adaptation Order.
 Held, (per Gajendragadkar, Subba Rao, Hidayatullah and Shah, JJ., Dayal, J., contra.) that notwithstanding the abrogation of the powers of the Financial Commissioner to frame rules, the Tehsildari rules, 1932 continued in force and the Financial Commissioner was competent to remove the appellant from Service. By the combined operation of cl. 15 (2) of the Government of India (Commencement and Transitory Provisions Order, 1936, and the Adaptation Order, 1937, the condition of service applicable to civil servants remained unaltered, until other provisions were made under the Government of India Act, 1935. Though s. 241 of the Government of India Act,1935 provided that the conditions of service of persons serving in connection with the affairs of a province, were to be such as may be prescribed by rules made by the Governor, or by persons authorised by him, s. 241 was itself Subject to cl. 15(2) of the 1936 Order. It was not shown that 516 these rules were superseded or abrogated by the Civil Service Rules made by the Government of Punjab in 1941.
 Per, Dayal, J.-The Financial Commissioner was not the competent authority to remove the appellant from service.
 Section 241 (1) which provided that the Governor would be the appointing and consequently the dismissing authority for all civil servants in the service of the Province abrogated the Tesildari Rules which were inconsistent with it and cl.
 15 (2) of the Transitory Order, 1936, did not save them.
 Even if cl. 15 (2) preserved these Rules, the reference to the Financial Commissioner therein had to be read as refe- rence to the Governor in view of para. 7 of the Adaptation Order. The Civil Service Rules framed by the Government in 1941 governed the conditions of service of Tehsildars and Naib Tehsildars and the Tehsildari Rules ceased to be opera- tive from 1941 even if they continued to be effective till then in view of the provisions of the Transitory Order.
 From April 1, 1953, the Punjab Civil Service Rules, 1953, were in force which applied to the case and the Financial Commissioner was not shown to be one of the authorities prescribed by the Government in the rules regulating the appointment and conditions of service of Tehsildars and Naib Tehrildars.
