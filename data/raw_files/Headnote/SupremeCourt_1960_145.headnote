 After the death of B, the holder of an istimrari estate, on September 28, 1947, leaving no male issue, the Court of Wards took over the estate and issued a notice under the provisions of the Ajmer Land and Revenue Regulation, 1877, inviting claims to the estate. While the enquiry was pending, an application was filed to the effect that the appellant was adopted on February 24, 1948, by the widow of B and that steps should be taken for the confirmation of the adoption under the third proviso to S. 23 of the Regulation.
 On September 10, 1951, the adoption was confirmed by the President of India. Thereupon the first respondent instituted a suit for a declaration, inter alia, that the appellant was not adopted as a fact and, in the alternative, the adoption was invalid and illegal. The appellant in his defence pleaded that after the confirmation of the adoption by the Central Government, which must be deemed to have considered and decided the factum and legality of the adoption, such questions could not be challenged in a civil court in view of S. 119 read with S. 23 of the Regulation and that, therefore, the suit was not maintainable.
 Held, (S. K. Das, J., dissenting), (1) that though under S.
 23 of the Ajmer Land and Revenue Regulation, 1877, an adoption made by a widow is not deemed valid until confirmed by the Central Government, such confirmation cannot confer validity on the adoption if it be otherwise invalid under the general law ; and (2) that under S. 119(1) of the Regulation the only thing done, ordered or decided by the Central Government which cannot be impeached, is the confirmation, but the decision to grant confirmation does not imply an ouster of the jurisdiction of the civil courts to examine the facts and acts of the parties, which preceded the proceedings for confirmation.
 Accordingly, the present suit brought in the civil court seeking relief not with reference to the confirmation but for a declaration that the adoption is invalid, is not barred under. SS. 23 and 119 of the Regulation.
 Per S. K. Das, J.-The confirmation referred to in the third proviso to S. 23 of the Regulation necessarily involves a determination of two facts, viz., (a) whether the widow has power to 617 adopt, and (b) whether she has in fact adopted a son to the late istimrardar, as otherwise, divorced from these two facts, the confirmation has no meaning and no intelligible content. Since under s. 119 no suit lies to obtain a decision contrary to the Sin order of confirmation, on a proper construction of ss. 23 and 119 of the Regulation, the present suit is barred.
