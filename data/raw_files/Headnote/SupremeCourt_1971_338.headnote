HELD : The different expressions used in s. 123(7), namely, obtaining,,. Procuring, 'abetting or attempting to obtain or procure are various forms of corrupt practice. It has to be found as to whether the allegation of obtaining assistance amounts to an allegation of fact. It is well settled that general expression like 'fraudulently', 'negligently' or 'maliciously' in pleadings do not amount to allegations of fact. [746 H] In the present case the allegations in para 16 of the election petition did not amount to any statement of material fact of corrupt practice. It was not stated as to what kind or form of assistance was obtained or procured or attempted to be obtained or procured. It was not stated from whom the particular type of assistance was obtained or attempted to be obtained or procured. It was not stated in what manner the assistance was for the furtherance of the prospect of the election. The government of the charge of corrupt practice is obtaining or attempting to obtain or procure any assistance other than the giving of a vote. In the absence of any suggestion as to what the assistance was the, election petition was lacking in the most vital and essential material fact to furnish a cause of action. It did not amount to an election petition on grounds mentioned in s. 123 (7) of the Act and was therefore liable to be dismissed. [750 F-G] The fact that s. 83 under which material particulars are required to be supplied is not mentioned in s. 86 as one of the sections non-compliance with which must result in dismissal of the petition cannot lead to a contrary conclusion.

A suit which does not furnish cause of action can be dismissed, [750H-751A] Samat N. Balakrishna etc. George Fernandex & Ors., [1969] INSC 37; [1969] 3 S.C.R. 603, Manubhai nandlal Amersey v.
