 For the assessment years 1953-54 and 1954-55 the appellant showed the gross dividend derived by him from shares held by him, as his income. The Income-tax Officer however included in the assessee's income the gross dividend of certain shares held by the assessee's wife and sons. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner confirmed the order. The Appellate Tribunal held in favour of the assessee on the ground that though the shares might have been acquired out of the secreted profits of the appellant, in the absence of any evidence that the shares remained in substance the property of the assessee, the dividend income could not be included in his total income, and that it was only the wife and the sons of the assessee, who were registered holders of the shares, that could be assessed for the dividend income from those shares.
 The High Court, in reference, held against the assessee.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) The order of the Income-tax Officer showed that it had been admitted by the assessee in the past, before the Department, that the shares in question, standing in the name of the assessee's wife and sons, belonged to the assessee and were his own investments., The Tribunal nowhere observed that the observations of the Income-tax Officer were factually incorrect or that the said admission had not been made by the assessee. There was ample material to justify the inference that the assessee was the real owner of the shares and that they were held by him benami in the name of his wife and sons. [1061 E-F, G-H] (2) If the Tribunal had given a finding that the purchase was not benami, and if the finding was based on some evidence, the same would have to be accepted in proceeding in reference under s. 66(1) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922. But the tribunal nowhere dealt with the question as to whether the purchase of shares was or was not benami in the name of the wife and sons of the assesses [1O63 B-C] (3) Once it was found that the assessee was the real owner of the shares and that they had been purchased benami in the names of his wife and sons, it would be presumed that the ownership of the shares continued to remain vested in the assessee, unless it was shown by 'him that because of some subsequent event, he had ceased to be the own" of the shares. Therefore. even thought the wife and sons were the registered holders of the shares. the dividend income from those shares should be assessed as the assessee's income.
 The tribunal excluded the dividend income on a ground which was not legally tenable. [1062 E-H] Kishanchand Lunidasing Balaji v. Commissioner of Income Tax, [1966] 60 I.T.R. 500 followed.
