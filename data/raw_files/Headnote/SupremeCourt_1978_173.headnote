 The appellant Corporation sometime in the year 1957 invited applications for allotment of plots in the industrial estate guaranteeing that for a period of 12 years no octori duty will be levied as provided in rule 62-B and also specifically inserted a clause at item (B) of the conveyances executed by the respondents to that effect. Some years later, the appellant passed a resolution dated 30-5-68 recommending to the Govt. to bring about an amendment in rule 62-B which, inter alia, contained: "octroi rule 5(8) is hereby repealed. Provided that notwithstanding such repeal the exemption already granted shall continue until the expiry of the respective periods of their grants". However, the State Government, while accepting the recommendation of the corporation, in para 2 of its resolution dated 30-7-78 specified 1st September 1968 as the date on which its sanction shall become operative. The respondents who felt that they were adversely affected filed separate writ petitions in the Bombay High Court, which were allowed.
 Allowing the appeals by certificate, the Court ^ 
 HELD: 1. Sub-section (2) of Section 149 of the Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporation Act. 1949 gives three alternative courses to the Government. After the matter is submitted by the Corporation to the Government (1) it may refuse to sanction the rules recommended, or (2) it may refer back to the Corporation any rule for further consideration or (3) it may sanction the rule as recommended or with certain modifications as it thinks fit. There can be no doubt that the Government had the power to make modifications in the recommendation submitted by the Corporation, but the express provision by which the Government could refer the matter back to the Corporation is clearly suggestive of the fact that the Government would refer the matter to the Corporation if it wanted to modify the proposal. [774A-C] In the instant case :
 (a) While exercising its power to delete rule 5(8) the Government had the following materials before it, (1) It knew that Rule 5(8) had granted exemption for a period of 10 years to some industrialists, who on the basis of the representation made by the Corporation had set up their.
 industries; (2) the Municipal Corporation had made an express recommendation that while deleting rule 5(8) the previous concessions regarding exemption from octroi duty must 766 continue, (3) the Government could delete rule 5(8) in the exercise of the powers conferred on it by sub-sections (2) and (5) of section 149 and sub section (1) of section 455 of the Act. [773E-F] (b) The Government has done nothing of the sort as required by S. 149(2) of the Act, but has clearly passed the order purely in terms of the recommendation. Therefore, the Government never intended to make any changes in the rule recommended by the Corporation particularly because the question of not accepting the condition recommended by the Corporation, namely, that the existing concessions must continue would entail taking away of vested rights and put the Corporation in a wrong box inasmuch as it would than have to go back from its own assurance. [774B-D] 
 2. The Government order dated 30th July, 1968 must be so interpreted as to include the proviso recommended by the Corporation while deleting rule 5(8), namely, that the concessions already granted to the industrialists would continue. It is true that the Government resolution does not say so in so many words, but having regard to the language in which it was couched and express reference to the letter dated 2nd July, 1968 of the Municipal Commissioner contained in the order itself which clearly mentions that rule 5(8) should be repealed provided the exemption already granted shall continue until the expiry of the respective periods of their grants, the aforesaid condition would be deemed to be included in the order dated 30-7-1968 by necessary intendment. Such an interpretation will be fully in consonance with the well settled rule of interpretation of statutes that any amendment to a statute affecting the legal rights of an individual must be presumed to be prospective unless it is made expressly or is impliedly retrospective.
 This principle is contained in section 7 of the Bombay General Clauses Act. [774E-G] In the instant case, the result of a different view would be that a valuable right vested in the respondents and others would be taken away and there no evidence in the language of the Government order to indicate any such intention. [774G-H] (b) Even assuming that the order of the Government deleted rule 5(8) without any condition and without retaining the exemption granted to the respondents, the order would suffer from a very serious legal infirmity.
 Section 149(2) of the Act empowers the Government to modify the recommendation of the Corporation provided it does not involve any increase in the rate or rates of the levy or the extent thereof. There can be no doubt that if the concession of exemption from octori duty given to the respondents is unconditionally withdrawn with effect from 1-9-1968 then this would have the effect of extending the application of the rules to an area where they did not apply. This is yet another reason why the Government's impugned order should be read down so as to provide for deletion of rule 5(8) with the exception that the concession already granted will continue. The deletion of Rule 5(8) has not taken away the concession already granted to the respondents. [775A-D]
