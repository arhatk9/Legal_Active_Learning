 In the Kerala Plantation (Additional Tax) Act 1960 (Act 17 of 1960) there is a levy of additional tax on plantations.
 "Plantations" mean land used for growing cocoanut, Arecanut, Rubber, Coffee, Tea, Cardamom and Pepper. Under s. 3 of the Act, for each financial year a Plantation tax additional to the basic tax charged on land tax under the Land Tax Act 1955 is payable at the rate mentioned in Schedule I of the Act, the said rate being Rs. 8 per acre. Plantations of 5 acres or below held by a Person do not attract tax. For the purpose of finding out the extent of the; Plantation in acres held by a person a method of calculation is laid down in Schedule 11. Act 17 of 1960 was -amended by the Kerala Plantation (AdditionalTax) Amendment Act 1967 (Act of 1967). By the amending Act the word 'additional' is 'removed from all places and it is declared that the tax is additional to land revenue or any tax in lieu thereof, if any, payable in respect of such land. The unit of assessment is charged from acre to hectare, and the rate of tax in Schedule I is raised to Rs. 501- per hectare. The tax is payable in respect of plantations of two hectares or more with an exemption for the first hectare. According to the new Schedule II the extent of the, plantation for the purpose of tax in-the case of cocoanut, arecanut, rubber, coffee and pepper plantations is arrived at by dividing the total number of trees, plants or vines standing thereon by a number specified in each case. In the case of tea and cardamom the extent of the plantation is the extent of lands on which these plants are grown and have begun to yield crops.
 The petitioner company was incorporated in India and the majority of its share-holders were Indians. It owned a tea estate in the Kuttikenam area in the Peermade Hills in Kerala State. The company paid without protest the additional tax levied on plantation by Act 17 of 1960. When the rate became heavier as a result of the amendments made.
 by Act 19 of 1967 the company field the present petitions under Art. 32 of the Constitution. The challenge was based mainly on Art. 14 of the Constitution. It was urged that there were differences of fertility and rainfall in the different areas where the plantations were situated.
 Figures cornpiled by the Tea Board were submitted to show the difference in yield between different estates. Relying on Moopil Nair's case it was argued that the uniform tax on unequals resulted in discrimination (a) as between the tea plantations themselves and (b) as between different kinds of plantations. The competence of the Kerala Legislature to levy a land tax was also challenged.

HELD: Per Hidayatullah, C.J., and Vaidialingam and Ray, JJ.--The Petitions must be dismissed.
 (i) The legislature has a wide range of selection and freedom in appraisal not only in the objects of taxation and the manner of taxation but also in the determination of the rate or rates applicable. If production were always to be taken into account there will have to be a settlement for every year and the tax will become a kind of income-tax.
 The burden of proving discrimination is always heavy and heavier still when a taxing statute is under attack.. The burden is on the person complaining of discrimination. The burden is proving not possible 'inequality' but hostile 'unequal' treatment. This is more so when uniform taxes are levied. The State cannot be asked to demonstrate equality.
 Simply stated the law is this : Difference in treatment must be capable of being reasonably explained in the light of the object for which the particular legislation is undertaken.
 This must be based on some reasonable distinction between the cases differentially treated. When differential treatment is not reasonably explained and justified the treatment is discriminatory. If different subjects are equally treated there must be some basis on which the differences have been equalised, otherwise discrimination will be found. To be able to succeed in a charge of discrimination, a person must" establish conclusively that persons equally circumstanced have been treated unequally and vice versa. [393 C-D, H; 394 E-G] (ii) Applying the above. principles the impugned law does not single out any particular plantation for hostile or unequal treatment. The Legislature thinks that Rs. 50 per hectare in the case of cardamom and tea is reasonable levy and this is equal to other plantations, where the crop yielding plants and trees have to be converted into hectares according to a formula. It is obvious that the legislature has made an attempt at equalisation of tax burden for different plantations. [395 C] In Moopil Nair's case this Court considered the tax therein impugned to be discriminatory because it paid no heed to quality or productive capacity of land and the tax was also held to be confiscatory since owners of unproductive land were liable to be eliminated by slow degrees. The present was however not a case where barren lands have been subjected to equal tax with productive lands. The tax is only levied on crop yielding land. In some cases where the crop may be scattered over a wide area, there is an elaborate mechanism to determine the: extent of the crop yielding plantation. [389 E-F, 391 F] As between different tea gardens it was not possible to say that the difference in yield was entirely due to natural circumstances and no other cause.
 It may be conceded that a uniform tax falls more heavily on some plantations than on others because the profits are widely discrepant. But that by itself cannot involve discrimination, for then hardly any tax direct or indirect would escape the same sensure. The rich and the -poor pay the same taxes irrespective of their incomes in many instances such as the sales-tax and profession tax etc. [389 H-390 B] Nunnathat Thathunni Moopil Nair v.

 (iii) immediately after the Travancore-Cochin Land Tax Act, 1955 as amended by the Travancore-Cochin Land Tax Act 10 of 1957 was declared invalid by this Court in Moopil Nair's case, the Kerala Land Tax Act 1961 was passed following an ordinance. That Act was included in the 9th Schedule to the Constitution at No. 38 and received the protection of Art. 31-B. The competency of the Kerala Legislature to impose land tax was therefore no longer open to dispute.
 Per Shelat and Grover, JJ. (dissenting).--The petitions must be allowed.
 Like Moopil Nair's case the present case also was one where inequality emerged as a result of imposing an ad hoc tax uniformly levied without making any rational or intelligible classification. There is no indication in the Act and none was sought to be shown as to how and on what basis the uniform rate of Rs. 50 per hectare was fixed and whether it had any reference to the productive capacity of the lands.
 [406 D-F] As regards tea plantations, the tax is uniformly levied merely on the footing of the land being used for growing tea, without any regard to its potentiality, situation, the kind of tea which can suitably be grown at a particular place, its geographical and other features etc. No doubt, the State in exercise of the taxing' power can select persons and objects for taxation but if it is found that within the range of that selection the law operates unequally by reason either of classification or its alsence, such a provision would'be hit by the equality clause of Art.
 
14. 1408 DI Even among the selected plantations inequality as a result of uniformity of tax must result because it is possible that the user of the land for one specified purpose may give a better and a more valuable yield than the user of another land though situated in the same area for another specified purpose. , This had happened in the case of tea plantation with which alone the present petitions were concerned.
 Therefore to the extent that Act 17 of 1960 as amended by Act 19 of 1967 imposes the tax on holdings of tea plantations, it is violative of Art. 14 and therefore void.
 [408 D-F] Moopil Nair's case applied Case-law referred to.
