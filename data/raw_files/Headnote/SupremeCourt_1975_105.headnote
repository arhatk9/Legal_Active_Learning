 A notification issued under the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 allowed exemption to, among others, cream but excluding "products sold in sealed containers". The appellant sends cream to Calcutta in sealed container& The sales tax authorities held that the sales were of cream, that they were interstate sales but that the exemption extended by the notification could not be enjoyed by the assessee since he fell within the area of exclusion contained in the exemption notification.
 The High Court rejected the writ petition of the appellant.
 On appeal to this Court it was contended that the containers were used for bulk mission, that sealing was for preventing abuse on the way or to avoid pilferage and that the emphasis should be on the "cream" and the container had no relevance in the context.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD: It is not forthe Court to launch on obscure fiscal astrology but merely to construe whathas been expressed in plain words. "Sealed container" merely means acontainer which is "so closed that access to the contents is impossible without breaking the fastening. The expression seal in this context does not involve affixture of the seal of the seller such as impressing a signet in wax etc., as evidence or guarantee of authenticity. An article may be regarded as put in sealed containers if it is closed securely in any vessel or container by any kind of fastening or covering that must be broken before access can be obtained to what is packed inside. This is the popular, perhaps the literal, meaning of the expressions used in the notification. Maybe the State thought that sealed containers would be used only by big manufacturers who were able to bear the burden of tax; maybe administrative convenience in assessing quantities sold induced this step.
