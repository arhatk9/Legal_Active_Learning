 The appellant and the first respondent were candidates for election in February, 1967 from the Yadagiri constituency which was won by the first respondent. The appellant challenged his election by a petition on the ground that he was a partner in a firm which had two contracts with the State Government, one for the construction of a road and the other for the construction of a dispensary building, which were subsisting on, the day when nominations were filed; he was therefore disqualified from being a candidate under s.
 9A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 and his election was void. The appellant also claimed that he was entitled to be declared elected as the votes cast in favour of the first respondent must be regarded as thrown away.
 From the evidence led before the High Court it was clear that the first respondent had obtained certificates from officers of the State Government to the effect that the contracts were complete but that these certificates were subsequently cancelled as it was considered that the work was not completed. After appraising the evidence, the High Court came to the conclusion that although some of the items from the two contracts might not have been completed, the contracts as a whole were substantially performed and, therefore, there was no bar to the candidature of the first respondent. It also held that although the agreements contained clauses for maintenance and repairs over a period of time after the completion of the work of construction, the did not have the effect of making them subsisting contracts. The High Court therefore dismissed the election petition.
 
HELD : On appeal to this Court, The High Court was in error in holding that the contracts had been fully performed and s. 9A did not apply. The appeal must therefore be allowed and the election of the first respondent declared void. Furthermore the votes caste in favour of the first respondent must be treated as thrown away and in the absence of any other contesting candidate, the appellant declared elected [403 F, 404 B-C] (i) Taking the fact that some portion of the original contracts remained to be performed with the fact that under the contracts the con tractor was required not only to complete the original work but to repair defects or do something which he had not properly done, the matter must be regarded as falling within s. 9A of the Act. In the context of construction of buildings and roads, it is obvious that if some part is found defective and has to be done again, the contract of execution as such is still to be fully performed. It is possible to describe the action, taken as one to repair the defect, but in essence it is a, part of the contract 396 of execution, because no execution can be said to be proper or complete till it is properly executed. [403 B-D] (ii) There was no force in the contention that under Art.
 299 the ,contract in question had to be signed by the Secretary to the Government whereas in the present case it was signed by the Executive Engineer. [403 G] Chatturbhuj Vithaldas Jasani v. Moreshwar Parashran and Others, [1954] INSC 14; [1954] S.C.R. 817, applied.
 (iii) The law requires that a candidate should not have any interest in any contract with Government and therefore even a partner in a firm has an interest sufficient to attract the provisions of s. 9A. The fact that the partnership itself had been dissolved in the present case would have no effect upon the relations between the first respondent and, the Government. [403 H] The first respondent could not by a private dissolution of the partnership escape his liability under the contract to the Government, and there was here no notation, because notice of the dissolution was not given to Government and the Government had not accepted the person to whom the business was transferred in place of the respondent's firm.
