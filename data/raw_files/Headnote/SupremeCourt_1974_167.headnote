 Order 6, Rule 2(14) provides that the powers of the Court in relation to applications for enlargement or abridgement of time except where the time is fixed by the Court or relates to deposit of security and except applications for condonation of delay in filing Special Leave Petitions, may be exercised by a single Judge sitting in Chambers.
 On the question whether applications for condonation of delay in filing petitions ofappeal should be heard only by the Court which can dismiss the appeal andnot by the Judge, in Chambers, because, the refusal of such an applicationwill amount to dismissal of an appeal by the Judge in Chambers, 
HELD : The words 'Enlargement or abridgement of time in 0.6 r. 2(14) of the Rules, take in applications for enlargement of time appointed by the Rules. A petition of appeal is required under Order 15 of the Rules to be presented within 60 days from the grant of certificate of fitness, and under Order 46, r. 3 of Rules, the Supreme Court, on application may enlarge and abridge the time appointed by these rules for doing any act etc. Therefore, a Chamber Judge may exercise the powers of the Court in relation to any application for condonation of delay in filing a petition of appeal. In fact, but for the exception in the Rule even applications for condonation of delay in filing special leave petitions would be included therein. Further, this practice of the Chamber Judge hearing applications for condonation of delay in filing petitions of appeal within the time appointed by the Supreme Court Rules has been followed ever since 1966. Where a practice has existed it is convenient to adhere to it, because, the practice of the Court is the law of the Court. [8H-9C] Cocker v. Tempest [1841] EngR 242; 7 M. & W. 502, referred to.
