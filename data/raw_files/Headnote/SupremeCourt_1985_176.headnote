 The Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1984 by Section 15(b) amended section 23(2) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 to provide that in sub-section (2) of section 23 for the words "fifteen per centum", the words "thirty per centum" shall be substituted, and by Section 18(a) provided that in Section 28 of the Principal Act for the words 'six per centum the words ' nine per centum' shall be substituted. Section 30(2) of the Amendment Act provided that the increased Solatium was to be applicable "in relation to any award made by the collector or Court or to any order passed by the High Court' or Supreme Court in appeal against any such award under the provisions of the Principal Act after the 30th day of April, 1982 (the date of introduction of the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill, 1982 in the House of the People) and before the commencement of this Act.
 The State Government issued a notification on 19th October 1974 under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 for acquisition of land for the purpose of establishment of a cantonment. The Land Acquisition Collector thereafter issued a notice under section 9 and required persons interested in the land to submit their claims for compensation. The claims submitted by various claimants including the appellants, were considered by the Land Acquisition Collector and an award made on 9th October 1975 dividing the land acquired into three belts and awarding compensation at varying rates. The appellants and other 950 claimants being aggrieved by the aforesaid award sought references under section 18 of the Act, and the Additional District Judge, enhanced the rates of compensation. The appellants who were still dissatisfied preferred appeals to the High Court.
 A single Judge of the High Court enhanced the amount of compensation, and directed that the claimants shall be entitled to interest at the rate of 6% per annum and Solatium at the rate of 15% on the enhanced amount of compensation. This order awarding enhanced compensation was, however, made subject to the claims put forward in the memoranda of appeal preferred by the claimants and the Court fee paid on such claims. As the appellants had not paid the requisite court fee on the enhanced amount of compensation they could not get the benefit of the said order.
 The appellants preferred Letters Patent Appeals. The Division Bench dismissed the appeals taking the view that the appellants were entitled to the enhanced amount of compensation for acquisition of their land, but restricting the benefits of the enhanced compensation only to those claimants who had made payment of proper court fee.
 In the Appeals to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellants: (1) that they should have been given an opportunity of paying up the deficit court fee, so that like other claimants, they could also get enhanced compensations and (2) that by virtue of Section 30(2) of the Amendment Act of 1984, the claimants are entitled to be paid Solatium at the rate of 30 of the compensation ultimately awarded to them instead of 15 awarded by the Division Bench as also interest at the rate of 9 instead of 6% per annum on the enhanced amount of compensation.
 Allowing the Appeals, ^ 
 HELD: 1. (i) The order passed by the Division Bench in so far as it refused to grant enhanced compensation to the appellants on account of non-payment of deficit court fee is set aside. It is directed that the appellants shall be paid enhanced compensation at the rate determined by the Division Bench. They shall also receive Solatium calculated at the rate of 30% on the amount of enhanced compensation under the amended Section 23 sub-section (2) as also interest at the rate of 9% per annum on the enhanced amount of compensation from the date on which 951 possession was taken up to the date of payment cf such enhanced compensation. The appellants will pay up the deficit amount of court fee within two months. [963 A-C] (ii) The Division Bench and the single judge should not have adopted a technical approach and denied the benefit of enhanced compensation to the appellants merely because they had not initially paid the proper amount of court fee. They should have allowed the appellants to pay up the deficit court fee and awarded to them compensation at the higher rate or rates determined by them. [956 B] (iii) In the instant case, a claim was made by the appellants against the State Government for compensation for acquisition of their land and under the law, the State was bound to pay to the appellants compensation on the basis of the market value of the land acquired and if according to the judgments of the single Judge and the Division Beach, the market value of the land acquired was higher than that awarded by the Land Acquisition Collector or the Additional District Judge there is no reason why the appellants should have been denied the benefit of payment of the market value so determined. To deny this benefit to the appellants would be tantamount to permitting the State Government to acquire the land of the appellants on payment of less than the true market value. Under agrarian reform legislation, the holder of land may legitimately, as a matter of social justice, be deprived of land which is not being personally cultivated by him or which is in excess of the ceiling area with payment of little compensation or no compensation at all, but where land is acquired under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, it would not be fair and just to deprive the holder of land without payment of the true market value when the law declares that he shall be paid such market value. [955 E-H] 
2. (i) Under Section 30 sub-section (2) the provisions of the amended Section 23 sub-section (2) and Section 28 are made applicable to all proceedings relating to compensation pending on 30th April 1982 or filed subsequent to that date, whether before the Collector or before the Court or the High Court or the Supreme Court, even if they have finally terminated before the enactment of the Amending Act. [961 H] (ii) The Amendment Act came into force with effect from 24th September 1984 but the Bill which ultimately became the Amending Act was introduced in Parliament on 30th April 1982.
 952 Parliament desired that the amended provisions of Section 23 sub-section (2) and Section 28 should be given effect from the date of introduction of the Bill in Parliament and therefore enacted Section 30 sub-section (2) making the provisions of the amended Section 23 sub-section (2) and Section 28 applicable to and in relation to "any award made by the Collector or Court or to any order passed by the High Court or Supreme Court in appeal against any such award and before the commencement of this Act", that is, the Amending Act after the 30th day of April 1982. [959 F, 962 D-G] (iii) The intendment of Parliament in enacting Section 30 sub-section (2), is brought out in no uncertain terms by the express language of Section 30 sub-section (2). The adverbial phrase "after the 30th day of April 1982 and before the commencement of this Act" governs not only the words "any award made by the Collector or Court" but also the words "any order passed by the High Court or Supreme Court in appeal against any such award". The amended provisions of section 23 sub-section (2) and Section 28 are applicable not only in relation to an award made by the Collector or court after 30th April 1982 and before the commencement of the Amending Act but also in relation to an order passed by the High Court or Supreme Court in appeal between 30th April 1982 and the commencement of the Amending Act. [960 E-F] (iv) Parliament deliberately and advisedly introduced the adverbial phrase "after the 30th day of April, 1982 and before the commencement of this Act", so as to qualify both "any award made by the Collector or Court" as also "any order passed by the High Court or Supreme Court in appeal against any such award. The word "such award" in the context in which they occur mean only the award made by the Collector or court and do not import the time element which finds place only at the end of the sentence and not immediately following the words "any award made by the Collector or Court". [961 F-G] In the instant case, the award of the Collector was made on 9th October 1975 and the award of the court was made on 31st July 1979. The award of the Court as well as the award of the Collector were thus made prior to 30th April 1982. So also was the order passed by the single Judge of the High Court in appeal against the award of the court made on 10th November 1981, that is, before 30th April, 1982. But on 30th April, 1982 the Letters Patent Appeal preferred by the appellants was pending before the Division Bench of the High Court and that was disposed of on 8th December 1982 and this was followed by the present appeal before 953 this Court. The present appeal was pending at the date of commencement of the Amending Act and therefore, this Court 18 bound to given effect to the provisions of the amended Section 23 sub-section (2) and Section 28 in determining the amount of compensation. [962 D-G] State of Punjab v. Mohinder Singh & another approved Kamalajamannivaru v. Special Land Acquisition Officer [1985] INSC 24; 1985 (1) SCC 582 disapproved.
