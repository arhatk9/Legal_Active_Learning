 The respondents manufacture and sell bidis in the state. At the time of import of tobacco and other raw materials into the municipal limits for the manufacture of bidis they paid octroi duty payable under the rules. Their claim for refund of octroi duty on the raw materials utilised for the bidis which they manufactured and exported outside the municipal limits was rejected by the municipal council.
 Rejecting the appellant-council's contention that the benefit of rule 27(b) of the Rules was not available to the respondents for the reason that the exported goods (bidis) were not the same or identical as the imported raw materials the Sub-Divisional Officer allowed the respondent's appeal.
 In revision the High Court upheld the order of the Sub- Divisional Officer.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended that refund is available under rule 27(b) only where even after undergoing the manufacturing process the imported article retained its essential character as such article and the same was exported outside the municipal limits. (2) The respondents were not entitled to refund as they failed to satisfy the committee that the same or identical goods had been exported.
 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD : 1 (a) Rule 27(b) of the Octroi Rules in terms provides for refund of octroi paid on imported raw materials when such raw material is actually used within the municipal limits for manufacturing the exported articles, Clause (b) of this rule itself speaks of the raw materials being "used in the manufacture" 308 so that use or consumption which a manufacturing process entails was present to the mind of the framers of the rule when they provided for the refund on the export of finished goods manufactured within municipal limits. [313 F-H] (b) The well settled connotation of "manufacture" and "manufacturing process" is that as a result of undergoing the process, a distinct commercial commodity different from the raw materials, comes into existence. Therefore the expression 'manufacture' occurring in rule 27(b) cannot be given a limited meaning as suggested by the appellant. [313 H, 314 A-B] 
 2. The proviso to the rule is not attracted to a case of manufactured goods falling under clause (b). The proviso is applicable to cases where there is an export of the imported goods themselves without subjecting them to any manufacturing process. It is in such cases that in order to claim refund the exporter has to satisfy the committee that the same goods on which import duty had been paid were being exported. The proviso is not a proviso to clause (b) at all but will be applicable to the other parts of the rule. [314 C, D, E] 
 3. It is not just to permit the appellant to raise the plea of limitation in the case because at one stage it acquiesced in the trial court's finding and did not raise the question in appeal before the High Court. While asking for a certificate for appeal the appellant did not raise the question of limitation before the High Court nor did it include the point of limitation in the memo of appeal filed in this Court. The point raised needs investigation into facts. [316 F-G]
