 Under cl. VA of the 6th Schedule to the Electricity Supply Act, 1948, on the purchase of an undertaking the development reserve shall be handed over to the purchaser. The appellant-Board purchased an electricity distributing company in liquidation and insisted that a certain sum in the development reserve should be handed over to it or deducted from the purchase price. The official liquidator, who was administering the company, contended that the development reserve had, been used in adding to the assets of the electricity undertaking and that, therefore that amount could not be paid. The High Court held against the appellant.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The development reserve can be handed over to the purchaser only if it is available. Since the entire sum has been utilised by investment in the business and there is no amount left in cash in the development reserve the official liquidator cannot be directed to pay any amount, as representing the development reserve to the appellant-Board.
 [144-G] (1) The whole of the development reserve had admittedly gone into the ,creation of assets which had enhanced the value of the undertaking, and the appellant-Board had the benefit of all such, additions, improvements and accretions to the assets of the undertaking. "at is really asked on behalf of the appellant-Board is that the official liquidator should pay to it a notional sum representing what should have been the development reserve and not that there is any amount available in the development reserve, but a notional amount cannot be handed over. The demand of the Board would amount to saying that it must be paid twice over, once in the form of the assets created out of the development reserve which it had already got, and again in cash as though it is still available. There is no justification either in law or in equity for such a demand.
 [144E-H] (2) Under cl. VA (3) of the 6th Schedule to the Electricity Supply Act, the development reserve shall be available only for investment in the business of electricity supply of the undertaking. I here is no allegation that the development reserve was used for any purpose other than in the business of electricity supply of the undertaking or on any item not permissible either under the Electricity Supply Act, of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910. [144D-E] (3) The provision regarding development reserve came into existence. in 1957 when the new cl. VA was inserted in the 6th Schedule. The language of that clause therefore is not the same as the language of cls. II, III and IV which have been in the Act from the very beginning. But that does not create any difficulty or problem in the interpretation of cl. VA. [145C-D]
