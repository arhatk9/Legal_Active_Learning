 The petitioner-firm made four applications between November 1969 and November 1970 for April 1969 to March, 1970. for the grant of licences to import stainless steel sheets and electrolytic copper wire bars for the manufacture, of automobile parts. The Deputy Chief Controller of Imports and Exports. received some complaints that the firm had been misutilising imported material, and criminal proceedings were started against the firm. Since the applications, were not disposed of within the usual time of three weeks, the petitioner filed writ petitions in the High Court and the High Court directed the respondents. to dispose of the applications as expeditiously as possible. In September 1972, instructions were given by the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports that the import trade control policy had been amended and that the import of the materials in question for utilisation in automobile parts was prohibited.
 In November, 1972 the Deputy Chief Controller of Imports and Exports informed the petitioner ',hat its applications have been rejected.
 Dismissing the writ petitions filed under Art. 32 in this Court, alleging violation of the petitioner's fundamental rights under Arts. 14 and 19, 
HELD : (1) Since the firm stands for all the partners and the petitions must be deemed to have been filed by all the partners who are citizens of India, the writ petitions on behalf of the firm were maintainable. [329H] (2) But no relief could be granted to the petitioner. The jurisdiction of this Court under Art. 32, can be invoked only for the enforcement of fundamental rights. L330A-B] (a) An applicant has no vested right to an import licence in terms of the policy in force at the time of the application, and in accordance with the amended import trade control policy the licences applied for could not be granted. The Import and Export Control Act, 1947, or any Order or rule made thereunder is not ultra vires; and the validity of the Import control Policy Statement had not been impeached. No person can merely on the basis of such a statement claim a right to the grant of an import licence, enforceable at law. The policy cane be changed or rescinded by mere administrative orders or executive instructions issued at any time. [330E-G; 331C] (b) There is no substance in the contention that the instructions or orders made in pursuance of the Import and Export Control Act place unreasonable restrictions on the petitioners' right to carry on trade, or business. These restrictions obviously have been imposed in the interest of general public and national economy. [331G] (c) The Deputy Chief Controller did not lack inherent jurisdiction to deal with and decline the applications for the grant of licences. In view of the supervening criminal proceedings against the petitioner the Deputy Chief Controller might have thought that it was better for him to defer decision on the application till the termination of those proceedings. There was thus delay in dealing with the application, but the delay could not be said to be undue or motivated by bad faith. [331A-B, F] (d) There is no question of violation of Art. 14 of the Constitution as no particulars have been given of any other applicant, similarly situated, of having been given an import licence in similar circumstances.
