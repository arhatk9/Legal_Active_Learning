 The petitioners were detained by orders of detention under the Orissa Preventive Detention Act, 1970, and the grounds of detention were furnished to them on the same day. They sent a representation to the State Government, and the State Government rejected it 17 days later. The petitioners challenged the validity of the order of detention under Art.
 32 on the allegation that the delay constituted a violation of their right under Art. 22(5).
 Allowing the petitions.
 
HELD : There has been an unexplained delay of 17 days in disposing of the representation of the detenus, and consequently, there has been a violation of the constitutional right guaranteed under Art. 22(5) to the petitioners. [1030 A-B] The question whether there is delay in disposing of the representation made by a detenu and if so whether that delay has been properly explained by the State will have to be gathered from all the facts and circumstances of a particular case. In the present case, the respondent did not state what steps were, taken from the date of receiving the representation to the date of rejecting it, excepting making a very bald statement that inquiries were sought from jail authorities through the sub-deputy collector, and that the jail authorities sent a letter two days before rejecting the representation. There is no averment in the counter affidavit that the inquiries were made (*ally, and in the, absence of such an averment it is reasonable to presume that being an official matter there would be some correspondence.
 But neither the details of any enquiries made, nor the correspondence, were referred to or disclosed. [1029 E-H] Durga Show etc. v. State of West Bengal, W.P.
