 When the Orissa Estates Abolition Act came into force in February 1952, the appellants along with another person moved the High Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution challenging the constitutionality of the Act. The High Court held that the Act was valid and the lands of the appellants could be taken over by the State. When the case came to this Court in appeal, it held that the Act did not apply to the proprietors of Hemgir and Sarpgarh as they were not intermediaries as defined in s. 2 (h) of the Act. The Zamindar of Nagra was held to be an intermediary as he had acknowledged overlordship of the Raja of Gangpur. The Orissa legislature passed Act XVII of 1954 and changed the definitions of estate' and intermediary' to cover the cases of the proprietors of Hemgir and Sarpgarh.
 The appellants, the Zamindars of Hemgir and Sarpgarh, moved the High Court for a writ of mandamus against the State of Orissa and the Collector of Sundargarh. The appellants claimed sovereign status and contended that the Amending Act did not apply to them. Their petitions were dismissed 363 by the High Court which held that as a result of historical process the appellants had lost all vestiges of their sovereignty and become subject to the laws promulgated by ruler of Gangpur and when that ruler merged his State with the State of Orissa, the appellants 'were not better than mere subjects and had absolutely no claims to sovereign power. The other contentions raised by the appellants regarding discrimination etc. were also rejected by the High Court. The appellants came to this Court after securing the certificate.
 Held, that the appellants or their ancestors had ceased to be sovereigns on the eve of the merger of the State of Gangpur with the State of Orissa and their position was that of intermediaries who held or owned interests in land between the Raiyat and the State and their interests in their lands could be acquired by the State under the Act.
 Although there was no evidence of actual conquest of the territory of the appellants by the Raja of Gangpur or the active imposition of the sovereignty of the Raja over the territories in question, as a matter of fact the former rulers of those territories had submitted to the sovereignty of the Raja as a result of a continuous process. The Raja of Gangpur exercised sovereign authority over those territories. The outward symbols of sovereignty were that the laws of Gangpur State were in force in Hemgir and Sarpgaph. The whole of the administrative control was in the hands of the Raja of Gangpur. Neither in fact nor in law was there any vestige left of the sovereignty of the appellants when the Raja merged his State with the State of Orissa.
