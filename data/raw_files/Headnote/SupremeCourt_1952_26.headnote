 Section 27 (1) of the City of Bombay Police Act, 1902, does not contravene the provisions of Art. 19 of the Consti- tution inasmuch as it was enacted in the interest of the general public and, having regard to the class of cases to which this sub-section applies and the menace which an externment order passed under it is intended to avert; the restrictions that it imposes on the fundamental right of free movement of a citizen which is guaranteed by Art. 19 (1) (d) of the Constitution are reasonable and come within the purview of Art. 19 (5).
 The determination of the question whether the restric- tions imposed by a legislative enactment upon the fundamen- tal rights of a citizen enumerated in Art. 19(1) (d) of the Constitution are reasonable or not within the meaning of clause (5) of the article depends as much on the procedural part of the law as upon its substantial part, and the Court has got to look in each case to the circumstances under which and the manner in which the restrictions have been imposed.
 There are two kinds of externment orders contemplated by sub-section (1) of s. 27 of the City of Bombay Police Act, 1902; one, where the externment is directed from Greater Bombay, and the other where the externee is to remove himself 738 from the State of Bombay. In the first class of cases, the externment order has to specify the place where the externee is to remove himself and it must also indicate the route by which he has to reach that place. On the other hand, where the externment is from the State of Bombay, the externee can remain anywhere he likes outside the State and no place of residence can or need be mentioned.
 Where an externment order made under s. 27 (1) of the City of Bombay Police Act directed a person who resided in the City of Bombay to remove himself from Greater Bombay and to go to his native place at Amritsar, and on his represen- tation that he did not like to go to Amritsar and might be allowed to stay at Kalyan, which was outside Greater Bombay, he was permitted to do so: Held, that in view of the subse- quent request of the externee which was acceded to by the Commissioner of Police, the externment order could be con- strued as an order of externment from Greater Bombay to Kalyan and it was therefore a valid order of externment.
