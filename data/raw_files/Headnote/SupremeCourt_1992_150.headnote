 The Central Engineering Service Class II Recruitment Rules, 1954 provided for four methods of appointment to the category of Assistant Engineers in the Central Public Works Department, viz., (i) by competitive examinations to be conducted by Union Public Service Commission - Rule 3(a);
 (ii) by direct appointment, i.e. selection from amongst temporary engineers and temporary Section Officers employed on the Civil engineering side of the C.P.W.D. after consultation with the Union Public Service Commission - Rule 3(b); (iii) by promotion, i.e. by selection on merit from amongst permanent Section Officers employed in the Civil Engineering side of the C.P.W.D. - Rule 3(c); (iv) by transfer - Rule 3(d). From time to time appointments to the category of Assistant Engineers were made from 134 different sources. Since particular method of confirmation was followed, some of the temporary Assistant Engineers, who we're directly appointed under Rule 3(b), filed a Writ Petition in Delhi High Court challenging the confirmation procedure stating that the other Assistant Engineers recruited by competitive examination under Rule 3(a) as well as those directly appointed under Rule 3(b) and appointed subsequent to them have been confirmed leaving the petitioners unconfirmed. The High Court allowed the petition by directing that the petitioners be considered for confirmation and their inter se seniority fixed accordingly.
 Subsequent to the judgment of the High Court, the Central Government prepared a seniority list of Assistant Engineers in 1972 which was based on the date of appointment/promotion and communicated to all concerned inviting objections thereto. However, before the said seniority list could be finalised, the decision of the Delhi High Court was challenged before this Court; it was upheld by this Court. After the judgment of this Court, the 1954 Rules were amended in 1977 and again in 1978. The Central Government than promulgated Central Public Works Department Assistant Engineers (Central Engineering Service and Central Electrical Service) Group 'B' (Confirmation and seniority) Rules, 1979 with retrospective effect from 1954. These rules, which prescribed the mode of determination of seniority of Assistant Engineers, were extensively amended in 1982.
 The effect of the amended Rules was that the Assistant Engineers who were appointed by direct recruitment from amongst temporary engineers and Section Officers after consultation with the Union Public Service Commission were sought to be treated as promotees. Persons appointed under 3(a) were treated as appointed against permanent post of Assistant Engineers and were given prior claim for confirmation. Appointments made prior to 22nd December, 1959 and those made after this date were to be treated differently for the purpose of confirmation. The Assistant Engineers appointed before 22nd December, 1959 were to be confirmed in the order of their seniority. But in the case of appointments made subsequent to 22nd December, 1959, the Assistant Engineers recruited against permanent posts were first to be confirmed en bloc against permanent vacancies in that year and thereafter Assistant Engineers recruited against temporary posts and those promoted from lower posts were to be confirmed against permanent vacancies available in that 135 year by continuous interspersing of one promotee and one direct recruit appointee against temporary post till the permanent vacancies of that year exhausted.
 Giving effect to the 1979 Rules a fresh seniority list of Assistant Engineers was prepared. The petitioners filed a Writ petition in this Court challenging the validity of 1979 Rules and for quashing the 1979 seniority list and restoration of 1972 list alleging that by virtue of 1972 seniority rules, the promotees have been relegated to far lower positions in seniority as compared to their position in 1972 list.
 Allowing the petition, this Court, 
 HELD: 1. Rules made under the proviso Article 309 of the Constitution being legislative in character cannot be struck down merely because the Court thinks that they are unreasonable. They can be struck down only on the grounds upon which a legislative measure can be struck down. [154 G] B.S. Vadera v. Union of India, [1968] INSC 84; A.I.R. 1969 S.C. 118;
 B.S. Yadav v. State of Haryana, [1980] INSC 207; A.I.R. 1981 S.C. 561, referred to.
 
 2. Rule 4 of the Central Public Works Department Assistant Engineers (Central Engineering Service and Central Electrical Engineering Service) Group `B' (Confirmation and Seniority) Rules, 1979 (as amended by the Central Engineering Service and Central Electrical Engineering Service) Group `B' (Confirmation and Seniority) Amendment Rules, 1982, insofar as it predicates the seniority of Assistant Engineers, appointed on or after December 22, 1959, on the date of their confirmation, is violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed to the petitioners and other similarly placed Assistant Engineers by Articles 14 and 16(1) of the Constitution of India and accordingly held to be inoperative and void. [157 -D-E] 
 3. The cadre, it is admitted, consists of both permanent and temporary members. The Rules do not say that promotees shall not be appointed against permanent posts or that they shall be appointed only against temporary posts.
 It is true that generally direct recruitment is made only against permanent vacancies whereas promotions may be made both against permanent as well as temporary vacancies. But in this service, 136 It is clear from the Rules themselves that even direct recruitment is made against temporary posts. There is no distinction between the four erstwhile categories mentioned in unamended Rule 3 of the Central Engineering Service, Class II Recruitment Rules, 1954. All the four sources were equal quality-wise. Neither was superior to the other. They could be appointed both against permanent as well as temporary posts. In these circumstances, bringing in new concepts of "Assistant Engineers recruited against permanent posts", and "assistant Engineers promoted from the lower ranks" through the 1979 Rules, as amended by 1982 Rules, and treating the latter category unfavourably on that basis vide Rules 4 and 5 of 1979/1982 Rules, is a clear case of hostile discrimination. [155 B-F] 
 4. The entire course of amendments and new Rules appears to be designed to undo the effect of the Judgment of the High Court with retrospective effect. Not only the classification has no basis in the Rules-or in the factual situation-It is unreasonable and unjust; it is also unrelated to the object-the object being efficiency of administration. [155H, 156-A] 
 5. The formula constrained in Rule 5 of 1979 Rules (as amended in 1982) is devised to govern the order of confirmation. This very rule is discriminatory inasmuch as it seeks to treat to equals unequllly, to the prejudice of what is now compendiously called, the class of "Promotees".
 [157-C] 
 6. The seniority of Assistant Engineers appointed on or after December 22, 1959 shall be determined on the same basis and in the same manner as it is determined in the case of Assistant Engineers appointed prior to the said date.
