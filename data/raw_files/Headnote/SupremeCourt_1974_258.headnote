 The respondent Landlords made an application to the Rent Controller for eviction of the appellant-tenants on the ground of non-payment of rent and personal requirement under Hyderabad Houses (Rent. Eviction and Lease) Control Act, 1954. The Rent Controller negatived the landlords' contention and dismissed the eviction application. An appeal filed by the landlords before the Assistant Judge was also dismissed. In a Revision Petition filed by the land- lords before the High Court under section 26 of the Act the High Court examined the reasons given by the Rent Controller and the Assistant Judge and held that there was no cogent reason to reject the testimony of the first petitioner on the question of bona fide requirement.-- On appeal to this Court by Special Leave it was contended on behalf of the appellant-tenants that the High Court was wrong in reappreciating the evidence to come to a contrary conclusion to the one arrived at by both the courts below in Revision under section 26 of the Act. The scope of the section 26 of the Act is narrower than section 115 of the Civil Procedure Code.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : There is a 3 tier machinery provided in the Act. The first court is that of Rent Controller which is to make a summa ry enquiry. The second stage is of an appeal before the District Judge which is a complete re-hearing with additional power to make further enquiry if necessary. The third stage is the revision to the High Court. It is well known that the appellate power is different from revisional power. Usually in the absence of any clear provision in the law power of revision is narrower than that of appeal.
 There is no substantial difference between the powers conferred by section 26 of the Act and section 115 of the Civil Procedure Code. In a series of decision-, starting from Privy Council days it is firmly well established that section 115 of the Civil Procedure Code applies to jurisdiction alone, the irregular exercise or the non- exercise of it or the illegal assumption of it. The section is not directed against conclusions of law or fact in which the question of jurisdiction is not involved. [892E-893C] Rajah Amir Hassen Khan v. Sheo Baksh Singh, 11 Indian.
 Appeals 237, Balakrishna Udayar v. Vasudeva Aiyar " 44 Indian Appeals 261, Keshardeo Chamria v. Radha Kissen Chamriya and Others, [1952] INSC 52; [1953] S.C.R. 136 and D.L.F. Housing & Construction Company Private Ltd., New Delhi v. Sarup Singh and Others, [1969] INSC 237; [1970] 2 S.C.R. 368.
 Under section 26, the High Court has to see whether there is any error of jurisdiction or whether there is any such manifest error of procedure committed by the courts as may affect the ultimate decision resulting in gross injustice.
 The High Court in reappreciating the evidence in order to differ from the conclusions of the two authorities below has clearly made an error of jurisdiction and acted in excess of the power conferred on it under section 26 of the Act. The High Court cannot sit in appeal over the orders of the original and the appellate authority. [893C-E]
