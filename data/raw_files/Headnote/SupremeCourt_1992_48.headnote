 The Karnataka Public Service Commission conducted competitive examinations for the State Civil Services.
 Clause (I) of the General Instructions to the candidates provided that the candidates should write their roll number only on the front page of the answer books in the space provided for it and not anywhere else inside the answer sheet. Clause (xii) provided that the candidates must abide by the instructions and clause (xiii) provided that failure to abide by the instructions will render them liable to expulsion from examination or such other punishment as the Commission may deem fit. Some of the candidates violated the instructions and entered their roll numbers inside the answer books. Consequently their answer books were not got evaluated by the Commission. The candidates challenged the action of the Commission before the Karnataka Administrative Tribunal which directed the Commission to get their answer books evaluated by holding that (i) no penalty was provided for breach of the instructions and (ii) the failure of the Commission to afford any opportunity to the candidates to explain their bonafide and innocence was arbitrary. Against the decision of the Tribunal the Commission and 669 the State filed appeals in this Court.
 Allowing the appeals and setting aside the order of the Tribunal, this Court, 
 HELD: 1. The Tribunal faulted in inferring that no penalty was provided for breach of instructions requiring a candidate not to write his role number inside the answer book. The expression `such other punishment as the Commission may deem fit to impose' in clause (xiii) of the General Instructions read with clause (xii) provides action for breach of that which is, clearly specified. Provisions attempting to infuse discipline in competitive examinations cannot be construed with same yardstick as a provisions in penal statutes. Direction not to write roll number was clear and explicit. Once it was violated the issue of bonafide and honest mistake did not arise. [671C, G-H, 672A, 673D] 1.1. However, the Commission did not impose any penalty on the candidates because neither their examination was cancelled nor were they debarred from taking any examination conducted by the Commission. The only action taken was that those answer books in which roll number had been written inside were not subjected to evaluation. Therefore the action of the Commission could not be characterised as arbitrary. [672B-C] 
 2. Natural justice is a concept which has succeeded in keeping the arbitrary action within limits and preserving the rule of law. But with all the religious rigidity with which it should be observed, since it is ultimately weighed in balance of fairness, the courts have been circumspect in extending it to situations where it would cause more injustice than justice. Absence of any expectation of hearing in matters which do not affect any interest and call for immediate action, such as the present one, where it would have delayed declaration of list of other candidates which would have been more unfair and unjust are rare but well recognised exceptions to the rule of natural justice.
 [672F-H; 673C-D] 2.1. Even though the procedure of affording hearing is as important as decision on merits yet urgency of the matter, or public interest at times require flexibility in application of the rule as the circumstances of the case and the nature of the matter required to be dealt may serve interest of justice better by denying opportunity of hearing and permitting the person concerned to challenge the order itself on merits not for lack of hearing to 670 establish bonafide or innocence but for being otherwise arbitrary or against rules. [672G-H] 2.2. Rule of hearing has been construed strictly in academic disciplines. It should be construed more strictly in such cases where an examinee is competing for Civil Service post. Present case can safely be placed in a category where natural justice before taking any action stood excluded as it did not involve any misconduct or punishment. Therefore the Tribunal in issuing the directions approached the matter technically and completely misdirected itself in this regard. [673E-F, 673H, 673G]
