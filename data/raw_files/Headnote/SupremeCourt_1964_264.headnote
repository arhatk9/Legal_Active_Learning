 The respondent-company was carrying on the business of redrying tobacco entrusted to it by its customers. The process involved the keeping of the moisture content of tobacco leaf at a particular level, and in order to ensure that level, the leaf was packed in bales, in water-proof packing material, as it emerged from the reconditioning plant. The tobacco was then returned, packed in the costly packing material, to the constituent. In the company's charges for redrying each bale of tobacco, no separate charge was made for the value of the packing material used.
 The Deputy Commercial Tax Officer was of the view that the packing material must be regarded as sold to the constituent and that tax was exigible, under the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939, on the value of the packing material used.
 The order was confirmed by the Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes and by the Sales Tax Tribunal. The High Court, in revision, set aside the order. It was held that the packed tobacco was stored by the assessee for the requisite period, before it was returned to the customer, and that _packing formed an integral part of the redrying process. 'Me State appealed to the Supreme Court and contended that, packing of tobacco was not an integral part of the process of redrying, and that, since there was transfer of property in the packing material from the respondent to its customers, there was sale of the packing material for the purpose of the Act.
 
HELD (Per Shah and Sikri, JJ.) : The redrying process could not be completed without the use of the packing material, and on the finding recorded by the High Court, that tobacco was stored for the requisite period, the intention of the assessee and its customers was that the material should from an integral part of the process. Since there was no independent contract for the sale of packing material, the fact that tobacco delivered by the constituent was taken away with the packing material would not justify an inference that there was an intention to sell the material.
 [184 H; 185 A-C] In order that there should be a sale of goods which is liable to sales tax as part of a contract for work, there must be a contract in which there is not merely transfer of title to goods as an incident of the contract, but there must be a contract, express or implied, for sale of the very goods which the parties intended should be sold for a money consideration. From the mere passing of title to goods, whether as an integral part of or independent of goods, it cannot be inferred that the goods were agreed to he sold and that the price was liable to sales tax. [181 G-H; 183 C] Case law reviewed.
 Per Subba Rao, J. (dissenting) : There was nothing on the record to show that after packing the packed tobacco was retained in the factory for the completion of the redrying process. Packing, therefore, was not an integral part of the redrying process. Once the idea of packing being a part of the redrying process is eliminated, the transaction qua the 168 packing material involved either a contract of agency, gift or sale, and on the facts, a contract of sale was necessarily implied. As all the ingredients of the charging section read with the definition of "sale", were satisfied, the, sales tax authorities rightly assessed the turnover in regard to the packing material.
