 The assessee, while selling goods, charged the sales tax separately and collected it from the buyers. It did not include the sales-tax so collected in its turnover. The authorities under the Madhya Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1958, as well as the High Court, held that the sales tax collected from the buyers was a part of the price of the goods,sold and therefore should have been included in the asscssee's turnover.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD: Under s. 4 of the Act the liability to pay tax is that of the dealer. There is no provision in the Act imposing any liability on the purchaser to pay the tax so imposed on the dealer and there is no law empowering the dealer to collect the tax from his buyer. Hence the dealer would not be legally entitled to collect the tax payable by him from his buyer, and whatever collection the dealer. makes from his customers can only be by adding the tax to the price, lo that, the tax becomes part of the valuable consideration given by a purchaser for the goods purchased by him.
 Therefore, the distinction between the two amounts-tax and price-loses all significance, and the tax becomes a part of the sale price as defined in s. 2(c) of the Act and must be taken into consideration in computing the turnover. [948D-G;
