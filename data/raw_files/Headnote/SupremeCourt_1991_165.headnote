 The appellant was appointed as Assistant Technical Officer in the Punjab Financial Corporation and was con- firmed as Assistant Technical Officer (Textiles) on 14.7.1976. Thereafter he applied for the post of Assistant Manager, which was to be filled up by direct recruitment and he was selected and appointed as Assistant Manager on proba- tion on 26.5.1980. The period of probation of the appellant was extended from time to time and ultimately the Respond- ent-Corporation vide its order dated 11th May 1984 terminat- ed the service of the appellant.
 The appellant being aggrieved, filed a writ petition, which was dismissed by the High Court against which this Appeal was made.
 The appellant contended that even if the order of termi- nation from the post of Assistant Manager during the period of probation was held to be proper, still he was entitled to continue on the post of Assistant Technical Officer on which he was admittedly confirmed.
 The Corporation contended that as soon as the appellant was selected for the post of Assistant Manager, the earlier post of Assistant Technical Officer held by the appellant stood abolished; that there was no post of Assistant Techni- cal Officer on which the appellant could have been appointed after his termination of service from the post of Assistant Manager; and that mere selection on the new cadre post of Assistant Manager was sufficient for abolishing the post of Assistant Technical Officer.
 Partly allowing the appeal of the employee, this Court, 185 
 HELD. 1.01. The object of the resolution of the Board was that if an employee of the Corporation was inducted in the new cadre post then the post already held by him shall be abolished from the date of such appointment in the new cadre. The entire purpose of such resolution was that if an employee of the Corporation was appointed in the new cadre post, to be filled up by direct recruitment, then the Corpo- ration did not want to continue the earlier post held by such employee of the Corporation. Thus in the scheme of things such appointment of the employee of the Corporation to the new cadre posts ought to have been confirmed appoint- ment. [187E-G] 1.02. It would be against all canons of justice that confirmed employee of the Corporation though allowed to compete for a new cadre post by direct recruitment, but having not been confirmed on such post, is rat allowed to claim his right even on the lower post on which he had permanent lien to continue. It would be a travesty of jus- tice to throw the person on the streets after a period of service of nine years in the Corporation. [187G-H] 1.03. The post of Assistant Technical Officer held by the appellant as a confirmed employee, could have only been abolished in case he was confirmed on the post of Assistant Manager. [187H] 1.04. The appointment in the new cadre post as mentioned in the resolution of the Board means confirmed appointment on such post. [188A-B] 1.05. The order of termination of the appellant so far as the post of Assistant Manager is concerned is upheld, the respondent--Corporation is directed to allow the appellant to continue on the post of Assistant Technical Officer (Textiles) on which he had already been confirmed on 14.7.1976 with all the back wages and other benefits. In case no post of Assistant Technical Officer (Textiles) is existing in the Corporation, the appellant can be appointed on any other equivalent post carrying the same scale of pay which the appellant was drawing on the post of Assistant Technical Officer.
