 Four persons S, G, L and R were tried for offences under s. 302 read with 34 Indian Penal Code. The Sessions Judge gave the benefit of doubt to R and acquitted him but he convicted the other three of the offences charged and sentence them to death. No appeal was preferred against the acquittal of R but the three convicted persons appealed to the High Court. The High Court was of the view that the Sessions Judge was wrong in giving the benefit of doubt to R, that R was present at the scene of offence and all the four accused had the common intention alleged by the prosecution. Relying upon the evidence of the eye witness it dismissed the appeal, but reduced the sentence of G to life imprisonment. The appellants contended that the High Court had no jurisdiction or authority to embark upon an enquiry into the propriety or validity of the acquittal of R and that its finding that R had taken part in the offence as alleged by the prosecution had introduced a serious infirmity in the judgment of the High Court.
 655 ^ Held, that it was open to the High Court, when considering the whole of the evidence in respect of the accused persons, to consider it so far as it related to the acquitted accused also.
 One of the grounds on which the appellants had attacked the prosecution evidence was that it had not been accepted by the Trial Court against R. In dealing with this question the High Court had necessarily to deal with the case against R and there was no legal bar against it doing so.
 Besides, the Trial Court had not held that the evidence against R was false ; it had merely found that the case against his was not free from reasonable doubt.
