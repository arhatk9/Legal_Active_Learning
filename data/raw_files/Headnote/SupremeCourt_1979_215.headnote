 The State of Tamil Nadu had schools at various levels, primary, middle and high which were run by the public sector consisting of Panchayats, District Boards and the Government. Progressively, Panchayat schools were absorbed by District Boards and eventually those managed by the latter were taken over by the Government. In 1970, the State Government took a major policy decisions that all District Board schools be taken over with effect from 1st April 1970.
 By G.O.M.S. No. 761 dated 16th May, 1970 the teaching and non-teaching personnel were absorbed as a separate service in the Education Department named the Tamil Nadu Educational Subordinate Service. The ministerial service, which related to the non-teaching staff, also was kept separate. The direct consequence of the maintenance of two separate services was that while promotional prospects were available to Government employees, they were not open to the former District Board servants on their absorption into Government service. This led to agitation and representation.
 Government considered afresh the question, and by G.O.
 1786 dated October 17, 1974 reorganised the service, to provide that all Government Schools' servants be called the 'A' Wing and the staff of the former District Board Schools be referred to as 'B' Wing and decided that as complete integration of the be referred to as 'B' Wing and decided that as complete integration of the Wings was administratively difficult, they be kept separate as two Wings of the Tamil Nadu Educational Subordinate Service and the Tamil Nadu Educational Service. The personnel of the 'B' Wing represented to the Government that ever since their absorptional as Government servants with effect from April 1, 1970 they were not having enough promotional avenues.
 Government again examined the matter, decided to re- integrate these Wings and for this purpose passed G.O. No.
 1968 dated November 2, 1978 which provided for fixing the ratio between the two Wings in the matter of promotion and also the principle for computation of service in determining the common seniority.
 In the writ petitions to this Court, the petitioners contended that there was no rational formula for integration of the two separate Wings; the methods of recruitment, qualification and seniority provided for the two wings being different, their integration into a common service cadre and equalisation of their service conditions was violative of Articles 14 and 16. The 'B' Wing personnel having been absorbed into Government service with effect from April 1, 1970 1027 it was not permissible to grant seniority from a date anterior to their eligibility as Government servants.
 The State Government however contended that the decision for integration of the two wings was taken after examining the matter in great detail and taking into account the number of personnel of different categories in both the wings and their promotional opportunities.
 Dismissing the petitions, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The students who are coached for examinations, the syllabus for such courses and the nature of the teaching are virtually identical in the two sets of schools and the qualifications of the teachers also resemble. In this background, the State probably assumed as inadmissible of contrary argument that the quality of the service, the nature of the qualifications for employment and other features were de facto identical and consequentially service in District Board Schools and service, in Government Schools could be legitimately equated for purposes of reckoning seniority. Mathematical precision in equation is a vain chase. [1034 B-C] 
 2. In Service Jurisprudence integration is a complicated administrative problem where, in doing broad justice to many, some bruise to a few cannot be ruled out.
 Some play in the joints, even some wobbling, must be left to Government without fussy forensic monitoring, since the administration has been entrusted by the Constitution to the Executive, not to the Court. All life, including administrative life, involves experiment, trial and error, but within the leading strings of fundamental rights, and, absent unconstitutional 'excesses', judicial correction is not right. Under Art. 32, this Court is the constitutional sentinel, not the national ombudsman. [1031 A-B] In the instant case even if the quota rule is an administrative device to inject justice into the integrating process, the ratio cannot be arbitrary nor based on extraneous factors. [1031-D] 
 3. The ratio of 5:3 and 3:2 respectively were prescribed for the ministerial staff and teaching staff, taking a realistic note of the total numbers of the two equivalent groups viz. quondom District Board servants and relative Government School staff. This is not an irrational criterion when coalescence of two streams springing from two sources occurs. [1030 H] 
 4. Having regard to the strength of the District Board staff to be inducted, the ratio is rational. A better formula could be evolved, but the court cannot substitute its wisdom for Government's, save to see that unreasonable perversity, mala fide manipulation, indefensible arbitrariness and like infirmities do not defile the equation for integration. [1031 F] 
 5. All the schools having been taken over by the State directly the personnel had to be woven into the basic fabric. Some relevant formula had to be furnished for this purpose so that the homogenisation did not unfairly injure one group or the other. In 1970 Government chose not to integrate but to keep apart. Later, this policy was given up. The court cannot quarrel if administrative policy is revised, nor strike down the order because Government have responded to the question hour or re-examined the decision at the instance of a sensitive minister. [1031H-1032C] 1028 
 6. In the area of equation, an overall view, and not a meticulous dissection, matters. [1033C] 
 7. Policy is not static but is dynamic and what weighed with the Government when panchayat institutions were amalgamated with the District Board institutions might have been given up in the light of experience or changed circumstances. What was regarded as administratively impractical might, on later thought and activist reconsideration, turn out to be feasible and fair. The court cannot strike down a G.O., or a policy merely because there is a variation or contradiction. What is important is to know whether mala fides vitiates or irrational and extraneous factor fouls. [1034G-H, 1035A] 
 8. Once the principle is found to be rational the fact that a few freak instances of hardship may arise on either side cannot be a ground to invalidate the order or the policy. However unhappy it is to see the seniors of yesterday becoming the juniors of today, this is an area where, absent arbitrariness and irrationality, the court has to adopt a hands-off policy.
