 The appellant-University held the "Combined Pre-Medical Test" for admission to the seven medical colleges in U.P.
 during the year 1982. The pattern of examination adopted was known as the "Multiple Choice Objective type" test according to which a paper containing 100 questions with four alternative answers for each question was set in each of the four subjects prescribed for the test and the candidates were asked to tick the correct answer from out of the four alternatives given. The marking of answer-book was done by a computer into which had been fed the key-answers supplied by the paper-setters. When the University published the key- answers along with the result of the test, the respondents who had appeared in the test and whose names did not figure in the list of successful candidates filed writ petitions contending that the key-answers published by the University in regard to three questions were wrong, that the answers ticked by them in regard to those three questions were correct and that if their answer-books were reassessed correctly they would be entitled to be entitled to the M.B.B.S. course. The High Court accepted their contention and allowed the petitions.
 Council for the University contended that no challenge should be allowed to be made to the correctness of a key- answer unless, on the face of it, it is wrong.
 Dismissing the appeals, 
 HELD: Normally, the key-answer furnished by the paper- setter and accepted by the University as correct, should not be allowed to be challenged. The key-answer should be assumed to be correct unless it is proved to be wrong and it should not be held to be wrong by an inferential process of reasoning or by a process of rationalisation but must be clearly demonstrated to be wrong, that is to say, it must be such as no reasonable body of men well-versed in the particular subject would regard as correct. [81 D, H, 82 A- B] 74 In the instant case, the contention of the University is falsified by a large number of acknowledged text-books, which are commonly read by students in U.P. Those text books leave no room for doubt that the answers given by the students are correct and the key-answers are incorrect.
 Since the matter is beyond the realm of doubt, it would be unfair to penalise the students for not giving an answer which accords with the key-answer, that is to say, with an answer which is demonstrated to be wrong. [82 B-D] The publication of the key-answer has unravelled an unhappy state of affairs to which the University and the State Government must find a solution. The State Government should compile under its own auspices a text book which should be prescribed for student desirous of appearing for the Combined Pre-medical Test. A system should be devised for moderating the key-answers furnished by the paper- setters. If English questions have to be translated into Hindi it is not enough to appoint an expert in Hindi language as a translator. The translator must know the meaning of the scientific terminology and the art of translation. In a system of "Multiple Choice Objective-type Test" care must be taken to see that questions having an ambiguous import are not set in the papers. Whenever the attention of the University is drawn to any defect in a key- answer or any ambiguity in a question set in the examination, prompt and timely decision must be taken by the University to declare that the suspect question will be excluded from the paper and no marks assigned to it.
