 Between June 1946 and March 1947 the assessee-company, which then had its head office at Lahore, paid advance tax to the Income-tax Officer, Lahore, under s. 18-A of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922. For the assessment year 1947-48, the assessment was completed by the Pakistan Income-tax Officer on 28th January 1948 after adjusting the advance income-tax paid. The Income-tax Officer, New Delhi, assessed the tax for the same year 1947-48 in 1952. The assessee contended that credit should be given to him of the advance tax paid by him in Lahore under s. 18-A(11). The claim was disallowed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner but the Appellate Tribunal and the High Court on a reference,held in favour of the assessee.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The effect of s. 18(3) of the Indian Independence Act was to change the incidents of the advance tax paid.
 Previously it was to be adjusted towards a single regular assessment to be made by British India. After the Independence Act, the advance tax was liable to be adjusted against two regular assessments, one by India and one by Pakistan. In Pakistan, under s. 18A(11), the Pakistan Government was entitled to adjust the advance tax paid by the assessee against its demand. Similary, the Government of India was entitled to adjust the amount against its demand. It,follows that if the assessee had been given credit for' the advance tax, by the Pakistan Government, he cannot claim that credit should be given to him by the Indian income-tax authorities.
