 The respondents in the appeals were manufacturers of cigarettes. They manufactured cigarettes in their factories and the cigarettes so manufactured were packed initially in paper/card board packets of 10 and 20 and these packets were then packed together in paper/card board cartons/outers.
 These cartons/outers were then placed in corrugated fibre board containers and these corrugated fibre board containers filled with cartons/outers containing packets of cigarettes of 10 and 20 were delivered by the respondents to the Wholesale dealers at the factory gate.
 The wholesale price charged by the respondents for the cigarettes sold to the wholesale dealers included not only the 124 cost of primary packing in packets of 10 and 20, but also the cost of secondary packing in cartons/outers and the cost of final packing in corrugated fibre board containers.
 On May 19, 1976 the Cigarette Manufactures Association made a representation to the Central Board of Excise and Customs pointing out that corrugated fibre board containers "are not an Integral or essential requirement for the sale of cigarettes and are used for the sole purpose of protecting cigarettes from any damage that may arise during transportation , and that the cost of such corrugated fibre board containers should not therefore be included in the value of goods for the purpose of excise duty. The Board accepted this plea of the Association and by a letter dated May 24, 1976 intimated to the Association that "Instructions have been issued to the Collectors of Central Excise that the cost of corrugated fibre board containers in question does not form part of the value of cigarettes for the purposes of excise duty". This representation contained in the letter dated May 24, 1976 continued to hold the field until November 2, 1982 when the Central Board of Excise and Customs addressed a circular to all Collectors of Central Excise, stating that the matter had been re-examined and the earlier advice should be treated as cancelled.
 In the appeals by the Revenue to this Court, the question for consideration was whether the cost of packing is includible in the value of the cigarettes for the purpose of assessment to excise duty.
 On behalf of the appellant-Revenue it was contended that on a true construction of section 4 (4)(d)(1) read with the Explanation, that whatever be the packing, primary or secondary, in which the cigarettes were packed when delivered to the buyer in the course of wholesale trade at the factory gate, the cost of such packing would be liable to be included in the value of the cigarettes, and that lt was a totally unwarranted gloss on the Language of section 4 (4)(d)(1) read with the Explanation to make a distinction between primary and secondary packing because that section did not make any such distinction and on the contrary, provided in the clearest terms for inclusion of the cost of the entire packing in which the cigarettes were packed when delivered to the whole-sale buyer at the time of removal.
 On behalf of the respondents - companies, it was contended that though section 4(4) (d)(i) read with the Explanation did not make any distinction between the primary packing and secondary 125 packing, the cost of only such secondary packing was liable to be included in the value of the cigarettes as was necessary for sale of the cigarettes in the wholesale trade, and not the cost of secondary packing which was necessitated in order to protect the packed cigarettes ant to prevent them, from being damaged during the course of transportation from the factory gate to the godown or warehouse of the wholesale dealer. It was further contented that the cost of corrugated fibre board containers was not includible in the value of the goods because the letter dated 24th May, 1976 constituted an exemption order within the meaning of Rule 8 sub-rule (2) of the Central Excise Rules, 1944 and the respondents were accordingly exempted from payment of excise duty on the cost of corrugated fibre board containers w ed for packing the cigarettes, and the doctrine of promissory estoppel was invoked against the Government on the basis of the representation contained in the letter dated 24th May, 1976.

 HELD 1.[per Bhagwati, C.J.. Pathak and Sen,j.j] The Central Government and the Central Board of Excise and Customs were clearly bound bypromissory estoppel to exclude the cost of corrugated fibre board containers from the value of the goods for the purpose of assessment of excise duty for the period 24th May 1976 to 2nd November 1982. The respondents would be entitled to exclusion of the cost of corrugated fibre board containers from the value of the cigarettes only during the period 24th May 1976 to 2nd November 1982. [147 B, C] In the instant case, a representation was undoubtedly made by the Central Board of Excise and Customs and approved and accepted by the Central Government, that the cost of corrugated fibre boards containers would not be includible in the value of the cigarettes for the purpose of assessment to excise duty. The respondents acted upon this representation and continued the use of corrugated fibre containers for packing the cartons/outers of cigarette and did not recover from the wholesale dealers the amount of excise duty attributable to the cost of such corrugated fibre board containers during the period 24th May 1976 to 2nd November 1982. It would be most inequitable to allow the Excise authorities to assess excise duty on the basis that the value of the cigarettes manufactured by the respondents should include the cost of corrugated fibre board containers, when lt was clearly represented by the Central Board of Excise and Customs that the cost of corrugated fibre board containers would not be includible in the value of the cigarettes for the purpose of assessment of excise duty. [146 C-F] 126 
 2. What has been laid down in Motilal Sugar Mills case [1978] INSC 254; [1979] 2 S.C.R. 641 represents the correct law in regard to the doctrine of promissory estoppel. The observations in Jeet Ram's case [1980] INSC 85; [1980] 3 S.C.R. 689 to the extent that they conflict with the statement of the law in Motilal sugar Mills case and introduce reservations cutting down the full width and amplitude of the propositions of law laid down in that case are dissented from. If the Bench of two Judges in Jeet Ram's case found themselves unable to agree with the law laid down in Motilal sugar Mills case they could have referred Jeet Ram's case to a larger Bench. It was not right on their part to express their disagreement with the enunciation of the law by a co-ordinate Bench of the same Court in Motilal Sugar Mills case. [145 c-e] 
 3. Union of India v. Bombay International Ltd. 11984] 1 S.C.C. 467 broadly dealt with the question of cost of packing, and it was conceeded on behalf of the respondents in that case that the cost of primary packing must be regarded as falling within the terms of s. 4(4)(d)(i) read with the Explanation and lt was only the cost of secondary packing which gave rise to dispute between the parties. [131 F; 134 F] (Per Bhagwati, C.J.) 
 1. Whenever a question arises whether the cost of any particular kind of secondary packing is liable to be included in the value of the article, the question to be asked is does the packed condition in which the article is generally sold in the wholesale market at the factory gate include such secondary packing? If it does, it would be liable to be included in the value of the article for the purpose of excise duty. lt must therefore follow that if the packed condition in which the cigarettes manufactured by the respondents are generally sold in the wholesale market at the factory gate includes packing in corrugated fibre board containers the cost of such corrugated fibre board containers would be liable to be included in the value of the cigarettes for the purpose of excise duty. [135 B-D] 
 2. The condition for applicability of the inclusive defenition of value in s. 4 (4)(d)(i) is that the goods are delivered at the time of removal "in a packed condition" and where this condition is satisfied, the "value" of the goods would include "the cost of such packings and "such packing" must obviously mean the packing in which the goods are when they are delivered at the time of removal. The question therefore to be 127 asked is - what is the packed condition in which the goods are A when delivered at the time of removal? Whatever is the packing of the goods at the time when they are delivered at the time of removal, the cost of such packing would be liable to be include in the 'value' of the goods. The explanation to s. 4 (4)(d)(i) provides as exclusive definition of the term "packing" and it includes not only outer packing but also what may be called inner packing.
 1135 F-G] 
 3. Ordinarily bobbin, pirl, spool, reel and warp beam on which yarn is wound would not be regarded as packing of such yarn, but brought within the definition of "packing" by the Explanation. The Explanation thus extends the meaning of the word "packing" to cover items which would not ordinarily be regarded as forming part of "packing". The Explanation then proceeds to say that "packing" means wrapper, container or any other thing in which the excisable goods are wrapped or contained. [135H;136B] 
 4. It is apparent from the wide language of the Explanation that every kind of container in which it can be said that the excisable goods are contained would be "packing" within the meaning of the Explanation and this would necessarily include a fortiorari corrugated fibre board containers in which the cigarettes are contained. [136 C] 
 5. The question is not for what purpose a particular kind of packing la done. The test is whether particular kind of packing is done in order to put the goods in the condition in which they are generally sold in the wholesale market at the factory gate and of they are generally sold in the wholesale market at the factory gate in a certain packed condition, whatever may be the reason for such packing, the cost of such packing would be includible in the value of the goods for assessment to excise duty. [137 E-F] In the instant case, there can therefore be no doubt that corrugated fibre board containers in which the cigarettes are contained fall within the definition of "packing" in the Explanation and if they form part of the packing in which the goods are packed when delivered at the time of removal, it is difficult to resist the conclusion that under s, 4 (4)(d)(i) read with the Explanation, the cost of such corrugated fibre board containers would be liable to be included is the value of the cigarettes- [136 E-F] 128 
 6. Rule 8 of the Central Excise Rules, 1944 deals with the power to authorise exemption from duty in special cases.
 Sub-rule (2) Rule 8 postulates the making of a special order by the Central Board of Excise and Customs in each case exempting from payment of duty any exciseable goods. [139 C,G] 7- The letter dated 24th May 1976 could not possibly be regarded as a special order by the Central Board of Excise and Customs in the case of each of the manufacturers of cigarettes exempting cigarettes from payment of duty to the extent of the cost of packing by way of corrugated fibre board containers. The argument of the respondents based on sub-rule (2) of Rule 8 must be therefore rejected. 1139 G;
 140 A] 
 8. The doctrine of promissory estoppel is well- established in the administrative law of India. It represents a principle evolved by equity to avoid injustice and, though commonly named promissory estoppel, lt is neither in the realm of contract nor in the realm of estoppel. The basis of this doctrine is the inter position of equity which has always, true to its form " stepped in to mitigate the rigour of strict law.
 
 9. The doctrine of promissory estoppel is applicable against the Government in the exercise of its governmental, public or executive functions at the doctrine of executive necessity or freedom of future executive action cannot be invoked to defeat the applicability of the doctrine of promissory estoppel. [144 G] Central London Property Trust Limited v. High Trees House Limited, [1966] 1 ALL E. R. 256, Rederiaktiebolaget Amphitrite v. The King [1921] 3 K.B. 500, Roberston Minister of Pension, [1949] 1 K.B. 227, Union of India v. Indo Afghan Agencies, [1967] INSC 267; [1968] 2 S.C.R. 366 and Century Spinning and Manufacturing Company Limited v. Ulhasnagar Council, [1970] 3 S.C.B. 854, referred to.
 
 10. The doctrine of promissory estoppel being an equitable doctrine, must yield the equity so requires, If it can be shown by the Government or public authority that having regard to the facts as they have transpired, it would be inequitable to hold the Government or public authority to the promise or representation made by it. The Court would not raise an equity in favour of the person to when the promise or representation is made and enforce the promise or representation against the Government or public authority. The doctrine of promissory 129 estoppel would be displaced in such a case, because on the facts A equity would not require that the Government or public authority should be held bound by the promise or representation made by it. [145 G; 146 A] (Per Pathak & Sen, JJ. dissenting) The corrugated fibre board containers are not necessary for selling the cigarettes in the wholesale market at the factory gate. The cost of such packing cannot be included in the 'value' for the purpose of assessment of excise duty.
 [148 G; 151 Bl (Per R.S. Pathak, J.) 
 1. Under s. 3 of the Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944 the levy of excise duty is made on manufactured cigarettes, the excisable goods. Section 4 of the Act provides how the 'value' shall be determined. The expression "value" has been extended to include the cost of packing. The packing itself is not the subject of the levy of excise duty. [148 B] 
 2. For the purpose of computing the measure of the levy, the statute has given an extended meaning to the expression 'value' in clause (d) of sub-s. (4) of sec. 4 of the Act. The expression must be strictly construed. What is being included in the value now is something beyond the value of the manufactured commodity itself. [148 C] 
 3. The corrugated fibre board containers are employed only for the purpose of avoiding damage or injury during transit. The wholesale dealer who takes delivery may have his depot a very short distance only from the factory gate or may have such transport arrangements available that damage or injury to the cigarettes can be avoided. The corrugated fibre board containers are not necessary for selling the cigarettes in the wholesale market at the factory gate. [148 F-G] 
 4. The position expressed by the Central Board of Excise and Custom in its letter dated May 24, 1976 was right when lt declared that the Collector of the Central Excise has been instructed that the cost of corrugated fibre board containers in question does not form part of the value of cigarettes for the purpose of excise duty."[148 H] Union of India v. Bombay Tyre International Ltd., [1984] 1 S.C.C. 467, referred to.
 130 (Per A.N. Sen, J.) 
 1. Excise duty which is levied on the goods is ultimately passed on to the consumers of the goods and they have ultimately to bear the burden. So far as the consumers are concerned they buy cigarettes, loose or in packets or even in cartons. Cartons packed in corrugated fibre board containers are not purchased by the consumers. So far as the retail sellers are concerned who may buy from wholesalers, they usually buy loose packets of cigarettes or packets of cigarettes packed in cartons. So far as the buyers in the wholesale trade are concerned, they buy the cartons of cigarettes In which the packets of cigarettes are course of their wholesale trade for selling the sale to retailers or to their customers. It is only for the sake of convenience in the matter of smooth delivery of cartons in which the packets of cigarettes are packed that the cartons may be further packed in corrugated fibre board containers for facility of transport and smooth transit of the cartons before delivery of the sake to the whole ale buyer. [151 B- D] 
 2. On a proper construction of s.4(4)(d)(i) of the Act read with the Explanation any secondary packing done for the purpose of facilitating transport and smooth transit of the goods to be delivered to the buyer in the wholesale trade cannot be included in the value for the purpose of assessment of excise duty. [150 G-H] In the instant case, the cost of corrugated fibre board containers which the cartons containing the packets of cigarettes is packed, cannot be included in the value for the purpose of assessment of excise duty. [151 A] Union of India v. Bombay Type International Lit. [1984] S.C.C. 467, referred to.
