 The first respondent challenged the appellant's election on the ground that he had committed various corrupt practices at the election held in June, 1963. The Election Tribunal negatived the allegations of corrupt practices and dismissed the petition. The High Court allowed an appeal under S.
 116A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 and declared the appellant's election void under s. 100(1) (b) of the Act. The Court held it was proved that the appellant had incurred or authorised expenditure in excess of the permissible limit in s. 77 of the Act, and he was, therefore, guilty of a corrupt practice within the meaning of s. 123(6).
 The order of the election Tribunal was delivered on December 28, 1966. The certified copy of the order was supplied to the respondent on April 27, 1967. The High Court was closed for the summer recess between May 7, 1967, and June 29, 1967 and the memorandum of appeal was lodged in the office of the Registrar of the High Court on July 1, 1967.
 During the examination of one of the witnesses before the Tribunal it appeared from the statements made by him that the appellant had spent a large amount of money for purchasing cloth for banners used for the purpose of elections, and that amount was not disclosed in the state- ment of expenditure. The respondent applied to the Tribunal to amend the petition, but the Tribunal rejected the applications. In the appeal before the High Court the respondent repeated his request for leave to amend the petition. The High Court granted the application observing that the application was merely intended to amplify the particulars of the corrupt practice which had already been alleged in the election petition.
 In respect of an allegation of a corrupt practice under s.
 123(4) the High Court had held that it was proved that S.
 who was the agent of the appellant printed and published statements of facts which were false in relation to the personal character and conduct of the respondent and that the appellant did not believe any of them to be true; and those statements were reasonably calculated to prejudice the election prospects of the respondent. The High Court observed that S might have in his own enthusiasm published the false statements and, therefore, the Court gave the "benefit of doubt" to the appellant "with much hesitation".
 The High Court also rejected an application made at the hearing that a proceeding should be drawn under s. 99 of the Act against S and a notice should be issued to him to show cause why he should not be named as having committed corrupt practice under s. 123(4) of the Act.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended : (i) the appeal to the High Court was barred by limitation and the High Court had no power 9 to entertain and decide the appeal; (ii) the High Court was not justified in allowing the particulars of the corrupt practices set up in the petition to be modified and to allow the petition to be amended at the stage of the hearing of the appeal or in recording evidence in support of the fresh corrupt practices so set up; and (iii) that the evidence did not justify the finding that any corrupt practice was committed by the appellant as found by the High Court.
 
HELD : (i) The right to appeal against the order of a Tribunal is conferred by s. 116A of the Act. The 'Act provides a special period of limitation different from the period of limitation prescribed by article 116 of the Limitation Act, 1963, for an appeal to the High Court under the Code of Civil Procedure from any decree or order. But the expression ,,under the Code of Civil Procedure" in article 116 of the Limitation Act 1963 means an appeal governed by the Code of Civil Procedure, and by s. 1 1 6 (A) (2) of the Representation of the People Act the procedure with respect to an appeal from an order of the Tribunal. By virtue of s. 29(2) of Limitation Act, s. 4 and 12 thereof apply and if the appeal is filed on the date on which the court reopens after the recess it will be regarded as within time if the period of limitation after taking into account the time of obtaining a certified copy had expired during the course of the recess. There is no provision in the Repesentation of the Peoples Act, which excludes application of s. 4 of the Limitation Act. Therefore, the appeal filed by the respondent before the High Court must in law be deem- ed to be filed within the period of limitation. prescribed by s. 116(A)(3) of the Act. [12D, 13A] Vidyacharan Shukla v. Khubchand Baghel & Ors. [1963] INSC 261; [1964] 6 S.C.R. 129, referred to.
 (ii) The High Court was right in granting the amendment.
 Under Cl. (5) of s. 90 the Tribunal had no power to allow any amendment of the petition so as to supply or introduce particulars of a corrupt practice not alleged in the petition: But the particulars of a corrupt practice alleged in the petition may in appropriate cases be permitted to be introduced by amendment. By adding to the particulars of expenditure incurred which obviously could not be within the knowledge of the election petitioner, new plea of corrupt practice was set up by the respondent. The particulars were of the election expenses. By seeking to amend the petition the respondent did not add a new ground of corrupt practice not disclosed in the petition. He only furnished particulars of the corrupt practice already set out in the petition. [18 B-E] (iii) The High Court was right in holding that it was proved that the appellant had spent an amount which exceeded the amount permissible under s. 77 of the Act and the appellant having incurred or authorised expenditure in contravention of s. 77 was guilty of the corrupt practice under Section 123(6) of the Act, and that the election of the appellant was, therefore, void under Section 110 (b) of the Act. [27H] (iv) In respect of the corrupt practice under s. 123(4) the High Court first held that the appellant had consented to the publication of the statements in the three annexures and then proceeded somewhat inconsistently to give the "benefit of doubt" to, the appellant "with much hesitation". The method adopted by the High Court cannot be endorsed. In an election petition a corrupt practice may be proved only by evidence which establishes the case beyond reasonable doubt.
 But, in giving the benefit of doubt the court has to reach a judicial conclusion, it cannot vacillate. [1 5 H] Under s. 99 of the Act, the court has no discretion in the matter if the court is of the view that any person who is proved at the trial to have 10 been guilty of any corrupt practice, not to name that person. The duty under the Act is cast upon the court or Tribunal and on the ground that a party to the petition has not applied for a notice, the High Court cannot avoid the obligation imposed by statute to take proceedings under s.
 99 against the person proved at the trial to have been guilty of corrupt practice and to name him. [The court remanded the proceedings directing the High Court to give notice to 'S' under s. 99 of the Act]. [29 G]
