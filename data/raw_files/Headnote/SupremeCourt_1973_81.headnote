It would be field in trust by the Government on behalf of such person and refunded to him if application for that purpose was maid within a period laid down in the section. Section 17 of the Amending Act contained consequential and validating provisions. The High Court of Allahabad in petitions filed by the respondents held that the therefore enactment was unconstitutional. Consequently s. 17 of the Amending Act was also unconstitutional.
 Dismissing the appeal filed by the State.
 
HELD: (i) The argument that provision like section 29-A is ancillary or incidental to the collection of tax legitimately due under a law made under entry 54 has no force in view of this Court's derision in Abdul Quader's case and in Ashoka Marketing Ltd., wherein provisions similar to s. 29-A were held not to fall under entry 54 of List II. [991 D] (ii) The impugned law could not also be held to fall under entry 7 List III which relates to contracts. A similar argument was rejected by this Court in Ashoka Marketing Ltd.
 [992 G] (iii) The impugned law could not be said to relate to Mats so as to fill under entry 10 of List HI. A law compelling deposit of money wrongly realised as sales,-tax cannot in pith and substance be considered to be a law relating to trusts. [993 B] (iv) S. 17 was linked with s. 15 and could not exist independently of that section. The High Court rightly held it to be unconstitutional.
 Abdul Quarder and Co. v. Sales Tax Officer, Hyderabad, [1970] 25 S.T.C. 155 and Ashoka Marketing Ltd. v. State of Bihar and Another, [1970] 26 I.T.R. 254, applied.
