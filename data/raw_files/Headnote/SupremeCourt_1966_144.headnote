 The respondent carried on the business of exhibiting cinema to graphic pictures a Ahmedabad. Under the Bombay Cinema Rules 1954 framed under the Bombay Cinema (Regulation) Act 1953 such business could be carried on only under a licence renewable from year to year. The respondent held a licence for the year 1960. On June, 1960 a notice was served on him requiring him to show cause why his licence should not be suspended for contraventions of the Rules. An enquiry was instituted in this connection. On December 31, 1960 the licence issued to the respondent for the year 1960 expired and an endorsement renewing it for the next year i.e., 1961 was made on the same date. Subsequently as it result of the aforesaid enquiry the first appellant passed an order suspending the respondent's licence for two months from the date of service of the order. The service was effected on March 5, 1961. Aggrieved by this order the respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court. The, petition was allowed, the High Court faking the view that the renewed licence was a 'separate licence and not in continuation of the licence for 1960 and therefore the renewed licence could not be suspended without a fresh show cause notice. The appellants came to this Court with certificate.
 
HELD : Ile fact that under the Bombay Cinema Rules renewal is not a matter of course, the fact that the licensing authority can in proper circumstances refuse an application for renewal and is not precluded from imposing different conditions and can grant it for a different period coupled with the absence of any Rules for renewal are all indications leading to the result that renewal is a fresh grant and is not merely continuation of the licence previously issued. The High Court was therefore correct in allowing the writ petition on -a conclusion that the show cause, notice relating to the licence for the year 1960 could not be regarded as a show cause notice in respect of the renewal for the next year and if the renewed licence was sought to be affected in the enquiry a fresh show cause notice relating to the renewed licence was necessary.
