 The accused was tried for offences under s. 302 and s. 392 Indian Penal Code. The Sessions judge acquitted her under s. 302 and s. 392 but convicted her under s. 411 Indian Penal code. The accused appealed to the High Court against her conviction under s. 41 1. The State did not appeal against the acquittal nor did the High Court issue any notice to the accused under s. 439 (2). The High Court set aside the order of conviction under s. 41 1 as well as- the order of acquittal 905 .under s. 302 and s. 392 and ordered a retrial on the original charges. The accused contended that the High Court had no jurisdiction to set aside the order of acquittal and to direct a retrial on the original charges.
 Held, that while exercising its powers under s. 423 (1) (b) Code of Criminal Procedure in the appeal against the convic- tion under s. 411 Indian Penal Code the High Court had no jurisdiction to set aside the order of acquittal passed in favour of the accused by the Sessions judge in respect of the offences under ss. 302 and 392 Indian Penal Code.
 Section 423 (1) (b) is confined to appeals against orders of conviction and sentence, and the powers exercisable under it must be restricted to the conviction and sentence. If an order of acquittal is not challenged by an appeal under s.
 417 Code of Criminal Procedure and if no action is taken by the High Court under, s. 439 Code of Criminal Procedure the order of acquittal becomes final and cannot be challenged indirectly in an appeal by the accused against the order of conviction and sentence. It is wrong to assume that the whole case is before the High Court when it entertains an appeal against conviction. The power conferred by s. 423 (1) (b) (1) is intended to be exercised in cases falling under ss. 236 to 238 Cr. P. C., and the expression "alter the finding" in s. 423 (1) (b) (2) does not include the power to alter or modify the finding of acquittal.
