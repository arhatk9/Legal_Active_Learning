 The Petitioner was the Managing Director of a company engaged in the business of manufacture and production of plastic goods. The Company imported certain materials and the good were cleared for bonded warehouseing after assessment to duty. The Company cleared part of the material, after payment of duty, under the supervision of the Customs Officials on different dates, and the balance was kept in the warehouses, which were kept under lock and key and the key was in the custody of 268 Customs officials. Sometime later, the Customs officials discovered shortage of material kept in the warehouses.
 Certain enquiries and proceedings ensued and in the course of these enquiries, the petitioner came to know that an order of detention had been passed against him under Section 3(1) of the Conservation of Foreign Exchange & Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974, with a view to preventing him from abetting the smuggling of goods. Without waiting for the order and the grounds of detention being served on him, the petitioner filed a writ petition before the High Court challenging the order of detention. The authorities did not file any counter affidavit affirming or denying the facts mentioned in the writ petition nor did they come forward to disclose or even indicate the grounds of the proposed detention, if any. A Single Judge of the High Court dismissed the writ petition on the ground that, on the facts disclosed in the petition, the case, prima facie fell within the scope of the expression 'smuggling' as defined in the Act.
 On appeal, the Division Bench held that the circumstances referred to in the petition were not sufficient to constitute 'smuggling'. However, it dismissed the appeal on the view that without the grounds of detention it would not be proper for the courts to go into the validity or otherwise of the order of detention or make any pronouncement that the order in question had not been passed under the Act under which it was proposed to have been passed or that it was passed with a wrong purpose or was passed on vague, extraneous or irrelevant grounds.
 In the Special Leave Petition before this Court on behalf of the Petitioner it was contended that the Division Bench of the High Court having held that activities did not constitute 'smuggling' ought to have straightaway quashed the detention order; that the goods in question had been assessed to customs duty by the authorities and an order for their clearance from the customs area had been made on the execution of a bond for the due payment of the duty; that the petitioner was not guilty of 'smuggling' or the abetment thereof; that the scope of s.111(j) should be restricted to goods which were dutiable and no duty had been assessed and their removal from a warehouse where they were lodged, pending assessment of duty, that the operation of 'import' was concluded once the goods were assessed to customs duty and cleared from the customs area and the concept of 'smuggling' could have no meaning in respect of such goods thereafter, that where goods were removed from a warehouse in which they 269 were lodged under section 59 without permission of the concerned authorities, the only consequence that could follow was action under section 72; and there could be no levy of penalty under Section 125, and such goods were not liable to confiscation, and the provision for the contravention of which there could be no penalty or confiscation should not be so read as justifying the draconian remedy of preventive detention; once the goods were cleared by the customs authorities, they were not liable to confiscation, unless the order granting clearance was reversed in appropriate proceedings.
 Dismissing the Special Leave Petition, this Court, 
 HELD : 1. It is now well settled that, even in a case of preventive detention, it is not necessary for the proposed detenu to wait till a detention order is served upon him before challenging the detention order. Though the Constitution of India, which permits preventive detention, requires the detaining authorities to serve the grounds of detention within a prescribed period after the detention order is served on the detenu, it does not envisage any disclosure of the grounds of detention prior to the service of the detention order on the detenu. To apprise the detenu in advance of the grounds on which he is proposed to be detained may well frustrate the very purpose of the law. On the other hand, to insist that no order of detention can be challenged until actual detention in pursuance thereof takes place might irretrievably prejudice the rights of proposed detenus in certain situations. Thus, the conflicting claims of the State and the fundamental right of a citizen need to be reconciled and the limitations, if any precisely enunciated.

 2.1. The activity of the company would amount to smuggling and that of the petitioner to abetment of smuggling if they had removed or caused or abetted the removed of the goods from the bonded warehouse without the permission of the concerned authorities. The order of detention proposed cannot be said to proceed on a basis totally extraneous to the provisions of the Act and cannot be described as an order not made under the Act under which it is purportedly made nor can it be said that the grounds of detention are vague, irrelevant or extraneous to the purpose or provision of the Conservation of Foreign Exchange (prevention of Smug- 270 gling Activities) Act. [280 G-H, 281A] 2.2. There can be no smuggling if the goods had been removed from the warehouse not by the petitioner but by the customs authorities or somebody else. But that will be a question of fact. Assuming that the goods have been removed by the petitioner or the company for the warehouse without the permission of the proper officer, a simple reading of the relevant sections is sufficient to say prima facie that, in the present case, there has been smuggling by the Company, and an abetment of smuggling by the petitioner. On the broad conspectus of facts and the special definition clauses in the relevant statutes it cannot be said that the proposed detention in this case is totally outside the provisions of the statute. If there is prima facie, smuggling or abetment of smuggling, it is open to the competent authorities to issue a detention order, which may be challenged later on the merits on any grounds that may be available but it cannot be said that the action is flagrantly in violation of the statute or that the order is one not made under the provisions of the statute under which it has been purportedly issued. [277 A-D] 3.1. There is no justification to restrict "dutiable goods" to "dutiable goods not yet assessed to duty". The suggestion that "warehouse" referred to in the clause (j) of Section 111 should be understood to mean a warehouse to which goods are removed under s.49 but not one to which goods are taken in pursuance of s.59, ignores the wide definition of that expression set out in s.2(43) of the Customs Act. [278 D-E] Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes v. M/s. Caltex India) Ltd., AIR 1962 Mad 298 and Union of India v. Jain Sudh Vanasapthi Ltd., [1982] INSC 7; 1992 1 Scale 34 10 E.L.T. 43 (Del.), referred to.
 3.2. Even the general concept of smuggling contains two elements: one, the bringing into India of goods, the import of which is prohibied; and two, the bringing into country's trade stream, of goods the import of which is permitted without paying the customs duties with which they are chargeable. The second eventually can occur not only where there is a clandestine import evading the assessment of duty but also where there is a clandestine removal without payment of the assessed duty. In a case where the goods are warehoused under s.49 and they are clandestinely removed, there would be smuggling as the duties payable thereon have been evaded altogether. But even in a case where the goods are assessed 271 to duty and allowed to be warehoused under s.59, a clandestine removal can result in loss of duty. No doubt, there is a provision in s.72 for collection of the duty and forfeiture of the bond furnished to secure due payment of duty but these may not always be adequate cover to the Revenue if the goods are spirited away without permission.
 [278 F-H, 279 A] 3.3. The mere fact that the goods have been ostensibly cleared, after assessment of duty, to a warehouse does not preclude the applicability of the concept of smuggling even in such a case. In a sense, import may be said to be complete for certain purposes, say, sales tax purposes on their clearance after assessment of duties at the customs barrier but it is not complete in a real sense. Even the warehouse, to which the goods are permitted to be removed under s.59 is a premises under the lock and key of the customs authorities and is, in a sense, an extension of the customs area. Good's can be cleared therefrom for home consumption or exportation only after payment of duties.
 Till that is done, there is always the risk of the loss to the State of the duties payable. So import cannot be said to be complete till then. There is no reason to read down s.111 (j) which only recognises this position. [279 B-D] Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes v. M/S Caltex (India) Ltd. AIR 1962 Mad 298, referred to.
 3.4. The consequences which follow on a particular act or omission will depend on the statutory provisions in question. It may be that the petitioner's act in the present case may not have attracted s.125 as it stood earlier but will now attract a penalty in view of s.125(2) inserted w.e.f. 27.12.1985. It may also attract s.72 but this cannot, however, be decisive of the interpretation of s.111(j). [279 G] Shewpujanrai Indrasanrai Ltd. v. The Collector of Customs & Ors., [1958] INSC 56; [1959] S.C.R. 821, referred to.
 3.5. Even if it is assumed that s.72 will not be applicable where the goods are confiscated, the authorities have to choose, having regard to all the circumstances, between confiscating the goods on the one hand or collecting the duties payable thereon on the other. Having regard to the language of s.111(j), it cannot held that in such a case, the goods are not liable to confiscation, merely because an alternative recourse to Section 72 is available.
 In view of the language of Section 111(j), the goods are liable 272 to confiscation. This conclusion does not go behind or ignore the effect of the order clearance. It accepts the fact of clearance and proceeds on the footing that the goods, rightly cleared under s.59, have been clandestinely removed from the warehouse within the meaning of s.59.
