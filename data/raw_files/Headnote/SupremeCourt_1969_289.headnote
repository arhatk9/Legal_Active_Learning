 In a suit for possession of immovable property filed in 1949, it was found that the plaintiff had not established his title to the property, but it was proved that he was in possession from 1930 to 1945 and that the defendant trespassed on the property in 1946.
 On the question whether a decree could be passed in plaintiffs favour, 
HELD : Possessory title is a good title as against everybody other than the lawful owner. Therefore, in an action of ejectment against a wrong doer, Prior possession of the plaintiff is sufficient title even if the suit was not brought within 6 months of dispossession as required by's. 9 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877. The wrongdoer (trespasser) cannot successfully resist the suit by showing that the title and right to possession are in a third person. [874 B-D] Ismail Ariff v.
