 Section 4 of the Bombay Port Trust Act provides for the creation of a Trust Board. It is a body corporate with perpetual succession and can sue and be sued. Section 61A(1) charges the Board with the duty of carrying out the provisions of the Act. Section 61B provides that the responsibility of the Board for loss, destruction or deterioration of goods of which it has taken charge shall, subject to the other provisions of the Act, be that of a bailee under sections 151, 152 and 161 of the Contract Act, 1872 omitting the words "in the absence of any special contract", in section 151 of the Contract Act. Paragraph 2 of section 87 provides that the Board shall not be responsible for any misfeasance, malfeasance and nonfeasance of any employee appointed under this Act.
 A case containing machinery imported by the respondent was taken charge of by the Board upon its landing in the Bombay Port. While being transported by the Board's employees on a four-wheeler trolly to one of the sheds in the docks the case fell down and the machinery was badly damaged.
 After carrying out a survey of the damage caused to the machinery, the respondents gave notice to the Board claiming a large sum as damages. Invoking the provisions of section 87 of the Act the Board denied all liability for the damage caused to the machinery.
 In the course of the trial of the plaintiff- respondent's suit the parties drew up certain "consent terms" which formed the basis of the decision at the trial and appeal. Summarizing the finding of the consent terms the appellate court stated that (i) the trust Board admitted an element of negligence on the part of its employees; (ii) the employees, who were with the trolly at the time of the accident, were appointed under the Act and (iii) while the Board merely claimed that the persons accompanying its trolly were employees, the respondents claimed that they were employees as well as agents of the Board.
 The High Court came to the conclusion that the liability of the Board was that of a bailee. As regards the applicability of the provisions of paragraph 2 of section 87 on which the appellant relied the High Court was of the view that this provision related to a totally different subject with which section 61B was not concerned and, therefore, the provisions of that section did not 533 afford any protection to the Board and that since a master is always liable for the torts committed by his servants in the course of the employment the Board was responsible for the damage caused to the machinery by its employees in the course of their employment.
 Allowing the Board's appeal ^ 
 HELD : (1)(a) Section 61B makes it clear that the responsibility of the Board was that of a bailee under three sections of the Contract Act and no more. It was not the case of the plaintiff that there was a contract of bailment as contemplated by section 148 of the Contract Act. Since there was no such contract between the parties, neither section 151, nor section 152 or section 161 would have been attracted as such: nor would the provision in section 61B have been applicable in a case of contractual bailment. Even though there was no contractual bailment, the responsibility of the Board for the loss, destruction or deterioration of the goods was clearly that of a bailee subject to the reservations provided by the section. [539 A-D] (b) The essence of bailment is possession. A bailment may arise even when the owner of the goods has not consented to their possession by the bailee at all. A bailment is not, therefore, technically and essentially subject to the limitations of an agreement and the notion of privity need not be introduced in an area where it is unnecessary to do so. It follows that a bailment may exist without the creation of a contract between the parties and it essentially gives rise to remedies which cannot be said to be contractual. That is why it is said that bailment is predominantly a tortious relation and that the two are fundamentally similar. Therefore, since the claim in the present case was not based upon a mere breach of statutory duty under section 61B but was based on the Board's liability as bailee, it was no other than by way of an action in tort. [539 F-H] (c) It may be that section 61B has fastened certain obligations on the Board which in truth are not contractual because they did not rest on an agreement but which by virtue of the same section were to be treated as if they were so and were made the subject matter of liability under sections 151, 152 and 162 of the Contract Act. Such a relationship may well be called as one arising out of an implied contract. But that does not mean that an altogether new cause of action arises merely because a duty to take charge of the goods is cast on the Board. By the very nature of that relationship it was essentially a delictal obligation, a civil wrong for which the remedy is an action in damages and not by way of an action of breach of contract. [540 B-D] (d) In casting a duty on the Board to take charge for the goods immediately upon landing, the Legislature took care to lay down and define the nature and extent of the liability which is set out in terms to be that of a bailee.
 It is well settled that non-contractual bailment is predominantly a tortious action. [541 A-B] In the instant case the plaintiff's claim was founded not upon a breach of statutory duty under section 61B apart from tort but on negligence, malfeasance and nonfeasance and the acts of misconduct on the part of its employees. In short the claim was based on careless handling by the appellants when the case slipped and fell while it was being removed by them as bailees. [541C] 2(a) The words "any person" in section 87 include the Board. The benefit of the limitation prescribed in paragraph 1 of this section is available to other "persons" also. But unlike paragraph 1, the protection of paragraph 2 is not 534 extended to cover "any person" but is confined to the Board.
 Yet another and more serious restriction is that the Board is made responsible for the misfeasance, malfeasance or nonfeasance of only those of its employees who have not been "appointed under this Act" which means that the protection does not extend to any tortious act if it has been committed by an employee who has not been appointed under the Act.
 [542 A-D] (b) Section 21 empowers the Board to appoint employees whom it deems necessary and proper to maintain for the purposes of the Act. But that could not possibly include all the employees like artisans, porters, labourers etc., who under the proviso to the section "shall not be deemed to be within the meaning of this section." The protection which the Board enjoys is therefore confined to the tortious acts of the employees appointed under the Act. Therefore, the loss, destruction or deterioration of goods of which the Board has taken charge would clearly amount to the Board's responsibility under section 61B. But section 87 paragraph 2 has its resonance in section 61B and vice versa. Both the sections are interconnected and have to be read together as a whole. [542 E-H] (c) The view of the High Court that the provisions of paragraph 2 of section 87 are upon a totally different subject with which section 61B is not at all concerned, runs counter to the clear provisions of the two sections if read together and is wholly unsustainable. It is section 61B which makes the responsibility of the Board for the goods of which it has taken possession subject to the other provisions of the Act. There is no occasion or justification for reading the clause regarding the subjection to the other provisions of the Act so as to exclude section 87 as if it were outside the Act. [543 B-E] (d) When the High Court, while interpreting the consent terms stated that it was admitted that those employees at whose hands the machinery suffered damage in the course of transport "were appointed under the said Act" it was a short and inevitable step for it to hold that the Board was entitled to be absolved of its liability for the acts of those employees by virtue of paragraph 2 of section 87. [543 H] (e) The liability of the master for the acts of his servants would not possibly arise in a case where the statute intervenes and provides in express terms that the master would not be responsible for any act of misfeasance, malfeasance or non-feasance committed by a special class of its employees. The omission on the part of the High Court to appreciate this aspect of the matter arose because it based its findings on the mistaken impression that it was concerned with the act of an ordinary employee of the Board and not a special category of employee referred to in paragraph 2 of section 87. The High Court also failed to notice that paragraph 2 of section 87 related essentially to acts of misfeasance, malfeasance and nonfeasance of only those employees who had been appointed under the Act, and, as such employees were very few, the restriction on the Board's liability was limited and confined quite substantially. [544D-F; 545 D] 
 3. Moreover, the so called statutory duty is not unequivocal and even assuming that it took the case outside the purview of the law of torts and made it an innominate obligation, that would not take the case out of the exception provided by paragraph 2 of section 87. Section 61B and section 87 are parts of the same statute. [546 B-C] Gulam Hussain Ahmedali & Co. Pvt. Ltd. v. Trustees of the Port of Bombay, 64 Bombay L.R. 670 overruled.
