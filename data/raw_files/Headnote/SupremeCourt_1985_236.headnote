 The Forest Range Officer, Flying Squat, Nirmal seized teak timber valued at Rs.. 1,71,000 from the residential house of respondent no. l and produced the same before the Divisional Forest Officer, Hyderabad who is the Authorised Officer under s.44 (2A) of the ALP. Forest Act, 1967 along with a report under sub-a.(2) thereof that he had reason to believe that a forest offence had been committed, for purposes of confiscation of the seized timber under sub-s.
 (2A) of s. 44 of the Act. While the confiscation proceedings were pending before the Authorised Officer under s. 44(2A) in relation to the seized timber, the Forest Range Officer simultaneously lodged a complaint with the Metropolitan Magistrate, City Civil Court, Hyderabad for trial of the respondents for commission of offences punishable under 8.
 20(1)(c)(iv) and (x) and y. 20(1)(t) read with s.
 29(4)(a)(ii) of the Act. The respondents moved the High Court under s. 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1963 for stay of the c proceedings before the Authorised Officer under 8. 44(2A) of the Act in view of the pending criminal prosecution. Upon the view that the power of the Authorised Officer to direct confiscation under sub-s. (2A) of 8- 44 of the Act and that of the Metropolitan Magistrate under s. 45 of the Act were mutually exclusive therefore there could not be simultaneous proceedings for confiscation before the Authorised Officer under s. 44(2A) as also 681 prosecution of the respondents for commission of a fore t offence A under 8. 20 or 29 of the Act, a learned Single Judge by the impugned order directed stay of the proceedings before the Authorised Officer under 8. 44(2A) till the disposal of the criminal case by the Metropolitan Magistrate.
 Allowing the appeal.
 ^ 
 HELD:1. The power of the Authorised Officer to direct confiscation of the seized timber or forest produce and the implements etc. under sub-s.(2A) of s.44 of the Act produced before him by the Forest Range Officer along with a report under sub-s.(2) thereof, if the Authorised Officer i- satisfied that y for. t offence has been committed in respect thereof, and the power of the Magistrate to direct confiscation of such property under 8. 45 upon conviction of the accused for commission of a forest offence under 8. 20 or 29 of the Act, are separate and distinct and there is no overlapping of the same. The changes brought about by Act No.17 of 1976 clearly contemplate for two separate proceedings before two independent forums. There is no conflict of jurisdiction as 8.45, as amended by the Amendment Act, in terms curtails the power of the Magistrate to direct confiscation of the seized timber or forest produce on conviction of the accused, by the use of the words 'except where an order for confiscation has already been passed in respect thereof under 8. 44' inserted in 8.45 of the Act.
 
 2. The High Court was in error in holding that there could not be simultaneous proceedings for confiscation before the Authorised Officer under sub-s.(2A) of the Act and prosecution of the accused for commission of forest offences under 8.20 or 29 of the Act.
