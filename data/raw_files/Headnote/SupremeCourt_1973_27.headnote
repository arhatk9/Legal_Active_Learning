 For the assessment year 1959-60 the tot-at income of the assessee company was utilised and a rebate was allowed, on the corporation tax payable by it, under the provisions of Finance Act, 1959. Thereafter, that rebate was wiardrawn on the ground that there was an unabsorbed reduction of rebate in the assessment year 1957-58. For the assessment year 1958-59 the assessee's assessment disclosed a loss and. no corporation tax was legal for that year. It was contended by the assessee that the unabsorbed reduction in rebate for the year 1957-58 could only be carried forward and set off against the rebate for the assessment year 1958-1959 under the provisions of Finance Act, 1958, and as there was no rebate available for the assessment year 1958-59 the unabsorbed reduction in rebate exhausted itself and could not be 'further set off against the rebate available in' the assessment year 1959-60. The contention was rejected by the Income-tax Officer and the Appellate Assistant Commissioner.
 The Tribunal and the High Court in reference, however, held in favour of the assessee.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : It is a clear from paragraph D of Part II of the First Schedule to the Finance Act, 1959, that it does not provide for carry over of any unabsorbed rebate from year to year. All that the provision provides for is that if there is any unabsorbed reduction of rebate in the assessment year 1958-59, then that can be taken into consideration while allowing rebate in the assessment year 1959-60. A power in favour of the revenue to take into consideration any unabsorbed reduction in rebate for any year prior to 1958-59 cannot be read into the provision. At any rate the view taken by the High Court appears to-be a reasonable one, and, it a provision of taxing statute can be reasonably interpreted in two ways that interpretation which is favourable to the assessee must be accepted [513F-H; 514D-E]
