 The appellant had obtained a usufructuary mortgage from the respondents in 1925 in respect of three sets of properties in Bihar : (a) five items of milkiat properties; (b) a three storey house in the town of Gaya; and (c) certain bakasht lands. By virtue of a notification issued under s 3 of the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950, the milkiat properties vested in the State of Bihar in January 25, 1955,, and in respect of the bakasht lands, the respondents became statutory tenants under s. 6. On April 24, 1955, the appellant filed an application under s. 14 of the Act before the Claims Officer alleging that no amounts had been paid by the mortgagors towards their liability. The respondents filed objections disputing the amounts claimed by the appellant.
 The Claims Officer partly allowed the claim of the appellant. The respondent thereupon filed an appeal before the Board consisting of a single Judge of the High Court constituted under s. 18( 1) of the Act. On November 9,1959 the appellant filed an application for permission to withdraw the claim case preferred by him before the claims -officer and further requested that the proceedings in the claim appeal filed by the respondent be dropped. This application was rejected by the Board on the ground that having once elected the procedure under the Act the appellant was not entitled to enforce his right under the ordinary law even in respect of properties not affected by the Act. On the merits, the respondents' appeal was allowed. The appellant came to this Court by special leave.
 The question that fell for consideration was whether in a case where a mortgage related to two sets of properties- those which vested in the State and those which had not-the right of the mortgagee to pursue remedies under the ordinary law in respect of non-vested properties had in any way been curtailed by the Act.
 
HELD : (i) The Act gives jurisdiction to the authorities concerned only inrespect of properties which have vested in the State; and the claims that are filed and adjudication made by the authorities concerned, under the Act, can only be with reference to estates that have vested in the State. The prohibition contained in ss. 4(d) and 35 of the Act must also relate only to matters which can form properly the subject of a claim or an adjudication under the Act. [67 E-F] Therefore while in respect of the estates which have vested in the State under the Act, the mortgagee, will be bound to have recourse, to the procedure laid down in the Act, in so far as his mortgage takes in other properties his right to enforce his claim under the ordinary law has not been, in any manner, infringed or taken away by the Act. [67 G] 57 (ii)The High Court was wrong in holding that the appellant when he filed an application under s. 14 must be considered to have elected his remedy under the Act and therefore he should not be permitted to withdraw the claim. There is no bar to a tribunal permitting the withdrawal of any proceeding if it is satisfied that the said request can be granted otherwise, even though, technically, the provisions of O.XXIII C.P.C. may not apply. There could be no possible prejudices to the respondents by the appellant being allowed to withdraw his-claim petition to enable him to seek his remedy under the ordinary law in respect of the non-vested properties. But, as and when the appellant sought his remedy to enforce his mortgage as against the properties which had not vested in the State the Tribunal or Court may have to apply the principle of Marshalling.
