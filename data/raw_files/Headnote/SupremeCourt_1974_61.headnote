 The appellants, along with others, were charged with offences arising out of the murder of two persons. The trial court assessed the evidence on the following principles, namely : (a) in rioting cases discrepancies are bound to occur in the evidence but the duty of the court is to have regard to the broad probabilities of the case;(b) in a factious village independent witnesses are unwilling to come forward and therefore the testimony of eye witnesses who may be interested in the deceased cannot be discarded merely for that reason, provided of course the presence of the witnesses is proved; and (c) the First Information Report does not constitute substantive evidence in the case and the mere circumstance that there are certain omissions in it will not justify the case being disbelieved; and gave weighty reasons for holding that the 'guilt of the accused was not proved beyond reasonable doubt. In appeal, the High Court, while acquitting others, convicted the appellants under s. 302 read with s. 149 I.P.C.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The High Court ought not to have interfered with the order of acquittal ven if there Were two possible views of the evidence. [654D-E] (a) The High Court wrongly refused to attach any importance to the circumstance that the names of the appellants were not mentioned in the very first report to the police and that a totally different group of persons were mentioned as the assailants. The High Court held that that report could not be treated as the First Information Report under s. 154 Cr. P.C., because, the person who gave the Report had no personal knowledge of the incident.. But s. 154 does not require that the Report must be given by a person who has personal knowledge of the incident reported. It only speaks of an information relating to the commission of a cognizable offence given to an officer in-charge of a police station.
 [654H-655C] (b) Another report, given by the Kotwal of the village, was treated by the High, Courtas the First lnformation Report.
 But this report.wholly destroys the prosecution case, because, while the case of the prosecution was that the incident happened on the afternoon of the previous day, the Kotwal stated in his report that the incident had taken place during the early hours of the day on which he gave the report. [655E-G] (c) In that Report also the names of the assailants were not mentioned. The inference arising from the fact that the name of an accused is not mentioned in the First Information Report must vary from case to case; but the High Court wholly ignored the fact that even the Kotwal of the village had not come to know the names of the assailants though 20 hours had elapsed after the incident had taken place according to the prosecution. [655G-H] (d) The High Court refused to attach any importance to the discrepancies between the medical evidence and the evidence of the eye witnesses that the deceased were attacked with spears and axes, on the ground that the witnesses had not stated that 'the miscreants dealt axe blows from the sharp- side or used the spears as a piercing weapon'. The High Court explained the absence of incised or punctured wounds by observing, without any basis, that the accused might have used the blunt side. [656C-E] (e) It is generally not easy to find witnesses on whose testimony implicit reliance can be placed. It is always advisable to test the evidence of witnesses on the anvil 653 of 'objective circumstances of the case. But the High Court, in the present case, accepted the evidence of the two alleged eye-witnesses as implicitly reliable,without so testing their evidence. They claimed to have seen the incident in the afternoon, but if the incident took place at night, the whole superstructure of the prosecution must' fall. (656A,F-G)
