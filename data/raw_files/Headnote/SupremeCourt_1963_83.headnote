 The Legislature of the Bombay State enacted the Salsette Estates (Land Revenue Exemption Abolition) Act, XLVII of 1931 which was brought into force on March 1, 1952. The object of the Act was to abolish the rights of intermediaries"n lands and to abolish exemption from land revenue enjoyed by holders of certain estates in the island of Salsette in the Bombay Suburban and Thana District in the State of Bombay. The "Estate" as defined under the Act means a village or a part thereof specified in the Schedule attached to the Act. The seven villages namely (1) Mogra(2) Wasivre,(3) Bandivli, (4) Majas (5) Part Pahad'(6)Goregaon and (7) Poisar are included in the schedule of the Act. The East India Company transferred its 'farm rights' in these seven villages to one Banajee by a 'cowl' dated October 2, 1830. Ultimately by a document dated September 22, 1847, the East India Company granted these seven villages to Banajee free from liability to pay land revenue and assess- ment in the nature of land revenue in future and on certain terms and restrictions set out therein. The freedom from liability to pay land revenue was subject to these restrictions 738 namely (1) to preserve the rights of occupants of land (2) to pay annual rent of Re. I/- if demanded, (3) to maintain rights of dewasthans, dharmadawas and customary allowances to Palls' (4) to the right of levy of customs and excise duties and also duties in respect of manufacture and sale of spirituous liquors and poisonous or injurious drugs by the Government. The appellant is the successor-in- interest of Banajee. The appellant filed the suit in which he challenged the application of provisions of the Act to the lands of the appellant. The suit was dismissed by the Trial Court and the appellate Court.
 Held (1) that the grant dated September 22, 1847, was not a lease within the meaning of s. 2 (d) of the Act as it transferred the right of ownership in the lands and not merely the right to enjoy them.
 (2)that the grant was not in the nature of a "farm" because the grantee was not liable to pay any revenue as a farmer.
 (3)that the villages were at the date of the Act held under an agreement from the State of Bombay and both the conditions prescribed under the definition, namely specification in the schedule and holding under a cowl were fulfilled.
 (4)that cl. 3 of s. 3 saves the right of a person other than an estate holder, who holds the land in an estate exempt from payment of land revenue, if such exemption is under a special contract or grant made or recognised under the terms of the cowl, or under a law for the time being in force.
