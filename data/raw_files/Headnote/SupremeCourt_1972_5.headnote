 The appellant was Professor and Head of the Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics in the Medical College Jabalpur. In connection with a research project to be carried out by him in collaboration with the Atomic Energy- Commission a Double Distillation Apparatus was purchased from Messrs S. K. Biswas and Co. Calcutta for Rs. 450/- in September 1964. In 1965 the Indian Council of Medical Research entrusted him with another research project for which he required a Double Distillation apparatus of 10 litres capacity. An order for the supply of the same was Placed with Messrs Goverdhandas Desai Pvt. Ltd. Bombay.
 They were asked to send their acceptance and bills in triplicate immediately. Messrs Goverdhandas aforesaid sent their acceptance and bills in triplicate for Rs. 969710. A draft for that sum was issued by the Accounts officer Indian Council of Medical Research in favour of Messrs Goverdhandas and was received by the appellant on April 12, 1965. The appellant thereafter wrote to Messrs Goverdhandas that he did not want the apparatus as shown in the sketch shown by them but wanted it according to the original order placed by him. Messrs Goverdhandas replied expressing their inability to supply the same. In May 1965 the appellant happened to be in Bombay. He asked Messrs Goverdhandas to accept the draft for Rs. 969 in their favour and to issue a bearer cheque for the same amount to him so that he could purchase the apparatus required by him in Bombay. A receipt for the draft was given to the appellant by Messrs Goverdhandas and he issued a receipt for the cheque to them. The appellant was subsequently tried for misappropriation of the amount.
 According to the prosecution he did not purchase any apparatus in Bombay and continued to use the apparatus earlier purchased from Calcutta. According to the appellant however, he contracted one Rasiklal Shah (DW3). a partner of Messrs Scientific Sales Syndicate who after a telephonic conversation wrote to him a letter introducing one D'Souza who could supply the apparatus to the appellant. The appellant claimed that he purchased the apparatus from D'Souza. obtained a receipt for the amount paid and brought the apparatus to Jabalpur and used it in his laboratory.
 The bill given to the appellant by D'Souza bore the name of M.B. Corporation. An apparatus Art. A was seized by the police, from the appellant's laboratory which according to the prosecution was the apparatus purchased in 1964 but according to the appellant was the one purchased in Bombay.
 The appellant produced before the investigating officer the letter written by Rasiklal Shah as well as other documents connected, according to him, with the purchase. 'Me trial court convicted the appellant of offences under ss., 409 and 420 I.P.C. and s. 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
 The High Court dismissed his appeal. This Court in appeal by special leave, 
HELD : 'The onus of proving all the ingredients of an offence is always upon the prosecution and at no stage does it shift to the accused. It is no part of the prosecution duty to somehow hook the crook. Even in cases where the defence of the accused does not appear to be credible 949 or is palpably false that burden does not become any the less. it is only when this burden is discharged that it will be for the accused to explain or controvert the essential elements in the prosecution case which would negative it. It is not however for the accused even at the initial stage to prove something which has to be eliminated by the prosecution to establish the ingredients of the offence with which he is charged, and even if the onus shifts upon the accused and the accused has to establish his plea, the standard of proof is not the same as that which rests upon the prosecution. Where the onus shifts to the accused, and the evidence on his behalf probabilities the plea he will be entitled to the benefit of reasonable doubt.
 [954 C-E] In the present case the High Court itself held that it was not possible on the evidence of the prosecution witnesses to hold that the apparatus Art. A could be identified as the one purchased in September 1964. The oral evidence produced by the appellant to the effect that a new apparatus had been purchased in 1965 was wrongly rejected by the courts below.
 The evidence of DW3 regarding the enquiry made by the appellant for a double distillation apparatus and his sending D'Souza with a plant which conformed to the specifications given by the appellant and sending it with a covering letter could not be assailed and had not been rejected by the High Court. There was no suggestion that this letter was fabricated or got up sub equently. Once the genuineness of the letter sent by DW3 to the appellant was believed it corroborated his plea., Once the probability of the accused's plea is established he must be given the benefit of doubt. The appellant had at the very initial stage even before the F.I.R. was issued produced the original receipt and given a copy of the same to the investigating officer. This will indicate that the bill and the receipt were genuine. The appellant was not responsible if no such firm as M.B. Corporation actually existed and a spurious bill (assuming that it was so) was given to him, [958 G.H; 962 D; 963 B-D] On the facts and circumstances of the case the appellant had established his plea and the courts below were wrong in holding that he had failed to discharge the burden of proof that lay upon him.
