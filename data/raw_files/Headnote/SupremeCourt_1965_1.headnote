 Consequent upon a direction by the Board of Revenue, Bihar, fixing the security deposit of Excise shops working under a certain system, the Commissioner of Excise directed realisation of the defecit in the security deposit of the appellant's shops. The appellant moved the Board of Revenue for revision of the Excise Commissioner's order. The Board of Revenue held that it was open to the appellant to move the Excise Commissioner for relief. Subsequently on the appellant's motion the Excise Commissioner in supersession of his previous order, directed that in the special circumstances of the case, the security depoit in respect of the appellant's shop need not be increased. In spite of a representation made by the Deputy Commissioner, the Excise Commissioner refused to revise his order. At the request of the Deputy Commissioner the Commissioner of the Division referred the matter to the Board of Revenue. After hearing the appellant, in exercise of its powers of revision under s. 8 of the Act the Board, suo motu, set aside the order of the Excise Commissioner with the direction that until the expiry of the current licences there would be no change in the amount of security, but proper security in terms of the general directions by the Board should be demanded from the appellant at the time of the renewal of the licenses. In appeal, 
HELD : (i) Neither the orginal order nor the subsequent order was passed by the Excise Commissioner under s. 35 on a consideration of the matters referred to in that section.
 The finality of s. 35 did not attach to these orders and the Board of Revenue had ample power to revise them under s. 8.
 [696 B-C] (ii) On a true construction of ss. 38 and 91 of the Act, the Board in exercise of its powers under s. 38 read with s. 91 could from time to time issue general directions with regard to the conditions of any licence granted under the Act including the amount of security to be deposited by the licensee. [696 G-H] (iii) Instruction No. 101 (10) of the Board of Revenue at p. 30 of Vol. III of the Bihar and Orissa Excise Mannuall 1955 Ed. read with Board's circular letter No. 8624 dated September 9, 1956 did not prevent enhancement of security at the time of the renewal of license. [697 C-D] (iv) The Board of Revenue may exercise its powers of revision under a. 8(3) suo motu. [697 E-F] (v) In a case where the Board exercises its power of revision of its own motion, no question of limitation arises. [697 H]
