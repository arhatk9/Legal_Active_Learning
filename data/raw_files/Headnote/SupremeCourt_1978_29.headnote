 A contract for Sale of premises No. 88-A Rash Behari Avenue, Calcutta was entered into between the appellant and deceased Smt. Paribala Das on 8-2-1956 for a consideration of Rs.
 46,000/-. The agreement for sale Ex.I, recites that Rs.
 1001/- were paid as earnest money and subsequently the defendant vendor received a further sum of Rs. 2000/- from the plaintiff intending purchaser. Parties had agreed to complete the transaction by the end of April '56. The appellant was put in actual possession of the 1st and 2nd floors of the premises by the defendant vendor in her anxiety to complete her part of the contract, but the appellant was seeking time on some pretext or the other and ultimately filed a suit for specific performance on 28th January 1957, alleging non-performance by the vendor defendant. The trial Court decreed the suit on 30th April, 1962, styling it as preliminary decree. The defendant vendor was directed to execute and register the deed of sale in favour of the plaintiff on receipt of the amount stated in the order within 30 days of date failing which the plaintiff appellant was directed to file in Court, within 15 days after the expiry of 30 days, the draft of conveyance with stamp therefor. The decree was drawn up on 15-5-1962.
 The appellant did not comply with the terms of the decree but sought some directions from the Court regarding the excess land and a Commissioner was appointed on 14-5-1964.
 On 26-8-65, the Court directed the plaintiff appellant to deposit the amount in Court by 22-9-1965; but the appellant filed a revision application before the High Court which was dismissed on 8-1-1968. The High Court granted 3 weeks' time for depositing the amount and again further time till 8-2- 1968. The appellant deposited the money on 6-2-68 and thereupon the vendor defendant No. 1 made an application on 25-3-1968 requesting the Court to draw the final decree so as to enable her to prefer first appeal. ibis application was rejected by the Court on 27th March 1968, and thereafter she preferred First Appeal to the High Court on 11-4-1968 and filed an application for condonation of delay, if any, on 8- 7 .
 The High Court held that the appeal was barred by limitation; but on the facts of the case condoned the delay as sufficient cause having been shown, and examined the appeal on merits and Allowed the appeal.
 840 Dismissing the plaintiff's appeal, by special leave, the Court 
HELD (1) '(a) Discretion is conferred on the Court before which an application for condonation of delay is made and if the Court after keeping in view relevant principles exercises its discretion granting relief unless it is shown to be manifestly unjust or perverse the Supreme Court would be loathe to interfere with it. [847 C-D] (b) It is undoubtedly true that in dealing with the question of condoning the delay under section 5, the party seeking relief has to satisfy the Court that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal or making the application within the prescribed time and this has always been understood to mean that the explanation has to cover the whole period of delay. However, it is not possible to lay down precisely as to what facts or matters would constitute "sufficient cause" under Section 5. But those words should be liberally construed so as to advance substantial justice when no negligence or any inaction or want of bona fides is imputable to a party i.e. the delay in filing an appeal should not have been for reasons which indicate the party's negligence in not taking necessary steps which he would have or should have taken. What would be such necessary steps ;will again depend upon the circumstances of a particular case. [847 A-C] Sitaram Ramacharan v. M. N. Nagarashana, [1960] 1 SCR 875 @ 889 =A.I.R. 1960 SC 260 @ pp. 265-66; State of West Bengal v. Administrator, Howrah Municipality, [1971] INSC 346; [1972] 2 S.C.R. 874 = [1971] INSC 346; A.I.R. 1972 S.C. 749, relied on.
 (c) In the instant case, the High Court took into consideration the fact that no affidavit in opposition to the application for condoning delay was filed even though a copy of the application was served on the respondent before the High Court and accordingly it was concluded that averments in the application remained unrebutted. The High Court also took into consideration the relevant fact that plaintiff sought extension of time to deposit balance of consideration from time to time and this is important because if the deposit was %not made the suit for specific performance of contract was liable to be dismissed as per the decree of the trial court as well as the order of the High Court in earlier revision application. The,-,High Court recapitulated the events since the judgment of the trial Court and concluded that it was satisfied that the appellant before it had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal within the period as prescribed in law and accordingly condoned the delay in preferring the appeal.
 These are vital and relevant considerations, while considering the prayer for condoning the delay in preferring the appeal and thus no case has been made out for interfering with the same. [847 E-G] (d) To contend that assuming that there was delay on the part of the plaintiff in performing her part of the contract once she was put in possession of 'a substantial portion of the property, which was intended to be purchased a decree for specific performance should not be refused is not always correct and again it depends on the facts of each case. [850 G-H] Williams v. Greatrex. [1956] All. E.R. 705 quoted with approval.
 
2. (a) In a suit for specific performance of contract for sale of immovable property it is incumbent upon the Plaintiff to affirmatively establish that all throughout he or she, as the case; may be, was willing to perform his or her part of the contract, and that the failure on the part of the plaintiff to perform the contract or willingness to perform her part of the contract may in an appropriate case disentitle her to relief, one such situation being where there is inordinate delay on the part of the plaintiff to perform his or her part of the contract. [849 B-C] (b) The question whether relief of specific performance of the, contract for the purchase of immovable property should be granted or not always depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and the Court would not grant such a relief if it gives the plaintiff an unfair advantage over the defendant. [850 A-B] 841 (c) In the instant case, by the terms of the contract the vendor had to put the purchaser in possession of the property when conveyance is executed and balance of consideration is paid land that was to be done by the end of April 1956. Even though the plaintiff purchaser had failed to perform any portion of her part of the contract by the end of April 1956, the vendor put the plaintiff in actual possession of the first and second floors of the premises to be sold on 28th April 1956, and the plaintiff is in possession of the same till today that is after a lapse of more than 20 years. On the other hand he deposited after struggle and procrastination the balance of consideration on 6th February 1968 that is nearly 12 years after the date of agreement. The plaintiff thus enjoyed actual possession of the property from April 1956 to February 1968 when she parted with consideration without paying a farthing for the use and occupation of the premises which, on a reasonable construction of the contract, she was not entitled to at all, till she parted with the full consideration and took the conveyance. The stages within which the contract was to be completed were actually demarcated, and set out in the contract itself and by the land of April, 1956, the transaction was to be completed. In her anxiety to see that the transaction was completed, the defendant vendor put the plaintiff in possession of a substantial portion of the property even when the plaintiff had not paid a major part of the consideration. The procrastination on the part of the plaintiff put the defendant in such a disadvantageous position that she was forced to sell the adjacent property to raise enough money to pay off the dues in respect of the property which the plaintiff desired to purchase. [849 D-H, 850 E-F] (d) The High Court was justified in refusing the decree for specific performance of the contract, on the ground that while the defendant did everything within her power to meet the requests made by the plaintiff, the latter avoided performing her part of the contract under one or the other pretext.[850 F-G] (e) The contract was to be completed by April 1956. It was not completed till 1957, even though the defendant after satisfying the queries of the plaintiff fixed different dates on different occasions calling upon the plaintiff to complete the transaction. Thereafter the plaintiff filed a suit. The suit was decreed on 30th April 1962. The Plaintiff by that decree was called upon to deposit the balance of consideration within 30 days of the date of the decree. She did not deposit the amount by the stipulated date. She asked for extension of time. In fact, it prominently appeared that the plaintiff put off performing her part of the contract presumably because she had not the necessary wherewithals to take the conveyance when she could be obliged to pay the balance of consideration and having obtained possession hung on to it without meeting her obligation. If in this background the High Court interfered within the decree of the trial Court, there was 'nothing objectionable in it. [853 C-G] Jitendra Nath Roy v. Smt. Maheshwari Bose, A.I.R. 1965 Cal.
 45, Bank of India Ltd. v. Jamsetji A. H. Chinoy and Anr., 77 IA, 76 discussed.
 
3. To assert that the decree made in a suit for specific performance of contract for sale of immovable property calling upon the purchasers to deposit the balance of consideration within the time stipulated in the decree with super added condition that in the event of default the suit would stand dismissed, is a preliminary decree, is to ignore the relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure which require in certain types of suits to pass preliminary decree. Such a suit when contested, each party would be accusing the opposite party of committing breach of contract. The right to ask for specific performance of contract would be adjudicated upon and in fact in this case it was adjudicated upon. The trial court did call upon the defendant to execute the conveyance on receipt of consideration. Such a decree could never be said to be preliminary decree. [841 E-G]
