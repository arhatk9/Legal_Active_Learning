 The Produce Cess Act, 1966 is a dual enactment. It provides for the levy and collection, as a cess, of customs duty on produce specified in the first schedule to the Act and exported beyond the limits of India; and (ii) of excise duty of the produce specified in the second schedule.
 Section 8 of the Act requires the occupier of a mill to furnish to the "Collector" every month a return stating the total amount of produce, specified in the Second Schedule consumed or brought under processing or extracted in the mill during the preceding month. The return has to be furnished before the seventh day of each month together with such other information as may be prescribed, and every such return is to be made in such form and to be verified in such manner as may be prescribed. There must be a "Collector" within the meaning of the Act, that is as defined in section 2(a) of the Act to whom such monthly returns are to be furnished. On noncompliance with the provisions of section 8, the "Collector" so appointed by the Central Government under the Act, is empowered under sub- section 2 of section 9 to proceed at once and make an assessment in the manner prescribed by the Produce Cess Rules 1969. Such a "Collector" was appointed under the Act on July 13, 1970. The Appellate Authority, entitled to hear appeals from the orders of the collector was appointed on August 21, 1972. The appellant carries on the business of oil extraction from ground nut, cotton-seeds, sarson and other oil seed and also deals in vegetable and other essential oils. On September 29, 1972 the Superintendent, Central Excise, issued a notice requiring the 5 appellant to produce certain documents and to appear before the authority for the purpose of an enquiry pertaining to the cess leviable under the Act. The appellant did not comply with the notice. On December 22, 1972, the Superintendent, Central Excise, issued a further notice requiring the appellant to show cause against the imposition of a penalty for its failure to file a return and deposit the cess. The appellant questioned the jurisdiction of the authority to levy cess. A further notice dated September 3, 1973 was issued by the Assistant Collector, Central Excise requiring the appellant to appear before him in connection with the aforesaid proceedings. The appellant, admittedly, did not deposit any cess nor file any return, contending that there was no jurisdiction in the authorities to levy and recover the cess on the products manufactured and dealt in by it. The appellant then filed a writ petition in the High Court of Punjab & Haryana raising various points, including the question whether sub-section (2) of section 3 and section 4 of the Act and rule 6 of the Cess Rules were ultra vires and whether the notices issued by the authorities were valid on the ground that no machinery had been provided for the levy of the cess during the relevant period and prayed for relief against the proceedings. The Writ Petition was dismissed and hence the appeal by special leave.
 Dismissing the appeal, the Court, ^ 
 HELD: 1.1. The entire machinery under the Produce Cess Act, 1966 through which the occupier of a mill must discharge his statutory obligations remains non-existent unless a "Collector" within the meaning of the definition in section 2(a) is appointed. So long as there is no Collector there is no obligation on the occupier of a mill to furnish monthly returns and there is no existing statutory authority for taking proceedings for the assessment and collection of the cess. Clearly there can be no Collector for the purpose of the Act unless he is an officer appointed by the Central Government to perform the duties of a Collector provided under the Act and Rules. A subordinate officer is also envisaged within the definition of section 2(a) but he must be an officer authorised in writing by the Collector appointed under the Act to perform such duties. Even the earliest step required of an occupier, that is to say, the furnishing of a statement containing the particulars specified under section 7 must be made to a Collector, and that is also not possible in the absence of a duly appointed Collector under the Act. [10 B-D] 6 
 1.2 The appellant in this case, cannot be prosecuted for its omission to furnish monthly returns required under section 8 of the Act during the period upto July 30, 1970 for which there was no Collector appointed under the Act.
 The Appellate Authority was appointed on August 21, 1972, but the delay in appointing the Appellate Authority can be no ground for not furnishing the returns after July 30, 1970, when the Collector was appointed. [11 G-H, 12 A & 13 B] 
 1.3 The absence of duly appointed Collector under the Act for a certain period is a good defence against a prosecution for non-compliance with section 8 of the Act during that period only. However, the delay in appointing the Collector under the Act does not relieve the appellant of the liability to excise duty in respect of the period during which the Collector was not appointed. [13 B-D] The levy is imposed by sub-section 2 of section 3 of the Act and comes into existence immediately on the taxable event attracting excise duty. The accrual of the obligation to suffer the duty does not depend on the appointment of a Collector, which is only part of the machinery designed by the Act for the Assessment and recovery of the duty. The imposition and accrual of the duty is a thing apart from its assessment and collection. There is an obligation to file a return under section 8 of the produce and a return must be filed every month before the 7th day. Noncompliance with the latter obligation is sufficient to bring the occupier within the mischief of sub-section 2 of section 9 of the Act. But where such non-compliance is due to the circumstance that Collector was appointed to whom such returns could be furnished, sub-section 2 of section 9 cannot come into play.
 However, the obligation to file a return remains and it remains in respect of the entire period during which the Collector had not been appointed, and once the Collector is appointed the occupier is obliged to file a return for the entire period from the commencement of the levy including the period during which there was no Collector. That is because the liability to excise duty had already accrued with the earliest excisable event and it subsisted during the entire period including the period during which there was no Collector. The position is that when the Collector is appointed the occupier must within a reasonable time thereafter, file monthly returns of the produce consumed or brought under processing or extracted in the mill during each preceding month, such monthly returns being in respect of all the months included in the period uptodate. Or the occupier may 7 make a composite return specifying the amount of such produce monthwise or the entire period. The Collector will then take the return into consideration and take proceedings under section 9 of the Act.[12 C-H 13 A] 
 2. Recourse to sub-section 2 of section 15 of the Act on the ground that no steps are instituted by the Government to bring Sections 2(a),6,7,8,9 and 20 into working life by taking action under them cannot be resorted to. Sub-section 2 of section 15 is not intended as a substitute for the other provisions of the Act. It is not an interim provision intending that recourse may be had to it until action is taken by the Government to instal the machinery and institute the steps required by the Act for making its provisions workable. Sub-section 2 of section 15 is intended to cover that area only which is not included within the area covered by the remaining provisions of the Act. It is a residual provision and nothing more. For example, a Collector appointed under the Cess Act can alone be the assessing authority authorised to receive returns and make assessments. No officer or authority constituted under the Central Excises and Salt Act can do so. Nor can the appellate authority appointed under the latter enactment entertain and hear appeals against assessments made under the Cess Act. The jurisdiction to do so belongs solely to the appellate authority appointed under subsection 1 of section 10 of the Act. [11 C-G]
