 The assessee had received in the previous years (1950-51 and 1951-52) dividends from two companies. These companies had been allowed rebate under the Part B States (Taxation Concession) Order, 1950. For the assessment years 1951-52 and 1952-53, the assessee claimed before the Income-tax Officer that the dividend received by him should be "grossed up" under s. 16(2) of the Act, without taking into con- sideration the rebate allowed to the said companies under the said concession order. On a construction of s. 16(2) the assessee pleaded that the rate applicable to the total income of the said companies was the rate prescribed by the relevant Indian Finance Act. The Income-tax Officer grossed up at the State rate and not at the rate prescribed by the relevant Finance Act. Before the Tribunal and the High Court the assessee succeeded.
 Held: (i) In interpreting s. 16(2) effect must be given to these words occurring in the said section 'without taking into account any rebate 264 allowed or additional income-tax charged'. If these words are ignored, it will be rewriting s. 16(2). Section 16(2) applies the rate of the year in which the dividend is paid, etc., and not of the year when the profits were made by the company. On the fact of this case it was held that the rates prescribed by the relevant Finance Act apply.

 (ii) The word 'rebate' in s. 16(2) not only relates to rebate granted under the Indian Finance Act but is wide enough to include any rebate which may be granted by other statutory orders.
 The form of the certificate prescribed under the Income-tax Rules cannot change the meaning of the word 'rebate'. The word 'rebate' is an apt word to use in respect of remission.

 (iii) The words 'exemption' or 'other modification' in s. 60A are wide enough to enable the Central Government to give rebate such as been allowed under the Concession Order.
