 Under r. 95(b) of the Mysore Civil Service Rules, a Government servant under suspension on a charge of misconduct shall not be required or permitted to retire on reaching the age of superannuation but shall be retained in service till the enquiry into the charge is conducted and a final order is passed. Rule 95(b) was repeated on March 2, 1965.
 The respondent was placed under suspension in February, 1961, and though he was due to retire on January 24, 1962, he was continued in service by reason of r. 95 (b) to facilitate a departmental enquiry. No departmental action was, however, taken against him, but he was prosecuted. He was acquitted in June, 1966. On January 24, 1967, the State Government passed an order that he should be deemed to have retired from service on January 24, 1962. The High Court allowed his writ petition holding that he was entitled to draw his salary till March 2, 1965.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court.
 ^ 
 HELD : (1) There is no finding of misconduct nor is there a verdict of guilt against the respondent. Since the order of suspension was a bar to his compulsory retirement, he continued in service till January 24, 1967. The Government cannot go back on that position and retire him retrospectively with effect from the date on which he attained the age of 55. [322 H-323 B] (2) The repeal of the rule has no retrospective effect.
 Whatever action was taken by the Government under r. 95(b) while that rule was on the statute book, would continue to be valid. The physical fact of the respondent's lawful continuance in service cannot be wiped out by imagining a putative state of affairs. [323 C-E] (3) But, the respondent's contention that he was entitled to draw salary, not till the date of the repeal of the rule, but till January, 1967, cannot be upheld because, he had not filed a cross-appeal against the judgment repelling his claim.
