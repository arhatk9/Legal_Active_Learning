 The appellant firm was allotted contracts for manufac- ture and sale of liquor for the year 1959 and for the subse- quent periods from 1.1. 1960 to 31.3.1961 for Rs.2,56,200 and Rs.4,71,900 respectively by the M.P. Govt. who also charged 7-1/2% over the auction money as mahua and fuel cess. As writ petitions challenging the government's right to charge this 7-1/2% were pending in the M.P. High Court, the Govt. announced that it would continue to charge it and the question of stopping it was under consideration of Govt.
 whose decision would be binding on the contractors. The appellant firm paid for the above contracts a total extra sum of Rs.54,606.00. On 24.4.1959 the M.P. High Court in Surajdin v. State of M.P., [1960] MPLJ 39 declared the collection of 7-1/2% as illegal. Even after this decision the Govt. continue to charge 7-1/2% extra money. Again on 31.8.1961, the High Court of Madhya Pradesh in N.K. Doongaji v. Collector, Surguja, [1962] MPLJ. 130 decided that charg- ing of 7-1/2% by the Govt. above the auction money was illegal. Appellants came to know of this decision only in or about September, 1962.
 On 17.10.1964 the appellants gave a notice under section 80 C.P.C. to the Govt. of Madhya Pradesh requesting for the refund of Rs.54,606.00. failing which a suit for recovery would be filed and later they instituted a civil suit in the court of additional District Judge, Jabalpur on 24.12.1964.
 The Govt. resisted the suit inter alia on the ground of limitation. The Trial Court held that the suit was barred by 597 limitation and dismissed it. The High Court also dismissed the appeal. The appellants then came up in appeal by special leave. While allowing the appeal and remanding the suit to the Trial Court for decision on merits. This Court, 
 HELD: 'Nul ne doit senrichir aux depens des autres' No one ought to enrich himself at the expense of others. This doctrine at one stage of English common Law was remedied by 'indebitatus assumpsit' which action lay for money' had and received to the use of the plaintiff'. It lay to recover money paid under a mistake or extorted from the plaintiff by duress of his goods, or paid to the defendant on a consider- ation which totally failed. On abolition of 'indebitatus assumpsit', courts used to imply a promise to pay which, however, in course of time was held to be purely fictitious.
 [601G-602A] Courts is England have since been trying to formulate a juridical basis of this obligation. Idealistic formulations as 'aequum et bonum' and 'natural justice' were considered to be inadequate and the more legalistic basis of unjust enrichment is formulated. The doctrine of 'unjust enrich- ment' is that in certain situations it would be 'unjust' to allow the defendant to retain a benefit at the plaintiff's expense. The relatively modern principle of restitution is of the nature of quasi contract. But the English law has not yet recognised any generalised right to restriction in every case of unjust enrichment. [602H-603B] The principle of unjust enrichment requires; first, that the defendant has been 'enriched' by the receipt of a "benefit"; secondly. that this enrichment is "at the expense of the plaintiff" and thirdly, that the retention of the enrichment be unjust. This justified restitution. Enrichment may take the form of direct advantage to the recipient wealth such as by the receipt of money or indirect one for instance where inevitable expense has been saved. [603C- 603D] There is no doubt that the suit in the instant case, is for refund of money paid by mistake and refusal to refund may result in unjust enrichment depending on the facts and circumstances of the case. [604D] Though there is no constitutionally provided period of limitation for petitions under Article 226, the limitation prescribed for such suits has been accepted as the guide- line, though little more latitude is available in the for- mer. [604F] For filing a writ petition to recover the money paid under a mis- 598 take of law the starting point of limitation is three years is prescribed by Article 113 of the Schedule to the Indian Limitation Act, 1963 and the provisions of S. 17(1)(c) of the Act will be applicable so that the period will begin to run from the date of knowledge of the particular law, where- under the money was paid, being declared void and this could be the date of the judgment of a competent court declaring that law void.
