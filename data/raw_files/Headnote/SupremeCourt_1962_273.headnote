 The appellant appeared as a witness in a jury trial for murder. Before the Court he gave a statement contradictory to the one he had given before the committing court. After the conclusion of the trial and delivery of judgment the Sessions judge passed a separate order for prosecution of the appellant for intentionally giving false evidence.
 Held, that the provisions of s. 479A had not been complied with and no cognizance could be taken of the offence, Two conditions were laid down for the exercise of the powers under s. 479A, (i) the court must form an opinion that the person has committed one of the two categories of offences referred to in s. 479A, and (ii) the Court must come to the conclusion that for the eradication of the evils of perjury etc. and in the interests of 502 justice it is expedient that the person be prosecuted. This opinion and conclusion must be arrived at the time of the delivery of the judgment or final order in the trial; the court cannot later on resort to s. 476 and make a complaint against the witnesses. The provisions of ss. 476 to 479 were totally excluded where the offence is of the kind specified in s. 479A, and if in such a case action is not taken under s. 479A no action can be taken under ss. 476 to 479.

 Durga Prasad Khosla v. State of U. P., A. 1. R. 1959 All.

 1960 Bom. 483, disapproved.
 Badullah v. State, A. 1. R. 1961 All. 397, distinguished.
 The provisions of s. 479A were applicable to the present case. The fact that the trial was with the aid of a jury did not preclude the Sessions Judge from recording the findings required by s. 479A. While considering whether action should be taken under s. 479-A it was open to the Sessions judge to say whether the evidence tendered at the trial was true or false.
 The committal proceedings are a stage in the judicial proceedings before the Sessions Judge, and even if the statement made by the appellant before the committing Court was false the Sessions judge could take action under s.
 479A.
