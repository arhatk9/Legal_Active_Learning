 Section 27 of the Indian Railways Act, 1890 cast a duty on the railway administration to arrange for receiving and forwarding traffic without unreasonable delay and without partiality. Section 28 prohibited the railway administration from giving undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person or railway administration or any particular description of traffic. Section 27A was inserted in the Act after 1950 to give power to the Central Government to issue directions for giving special facilities or preherential treatment in transport of goods or class of goods consigned to the Central Government or the Government of any State or of such other goods or class of goods as may be specified in the order.
 The Government of India, Ministry of Railways issued an order dated April 1, 1972 containing its decision to add an abbreviation 'GX' below the abbreviation 'G' in the list of abbreviations at page 14, Chapter VI of the IRCA Alphabetical list of Railway Stations in India and asking the railway administration to decide and notify the names of stations to which this new provisions would apply. Putting abbreviation 'GX' against a station meant that the station was not open for outward booking of coal, coal shale etc. in wagon loads. Pursuant to this order, the abbreviation 'GX' was appended to all way-side stations in the coal-belt.
 Thereafter Government of India, Ministry of Railways by its order dated April 27, 1972 revised rules 1 and 2 of the Eastern Railway Coal Traffic Part 1. The revised rules provided inter alia that all traffic in coal 658 etc. in wagon loads will be loaded only from colliery sidings, coke oven plant and washeries on the Eastern Railway, but coal in wagons will not be permitted at the stations serving these colliery washeries. A further restriction followed with effect from December 4, 1979 when the Divisional Operating Superintendent, Bilaspur for apparent reasons stopped booking of coal in smalls including clubbing at all stations of North Eastern Railway. On February 11, 1980, a telegraphic communication was issued explaining that coal in wagon-loads can be booked from colliery sidings by the collieries concerned. Booking of slack coal was wholly stopped as per a phone call dated April 9, 1981. In exercise of the power conferred by sec.
 27A of the Act, Union of India, the Ministry of Railways issued Preferential Traffic Schedule. The schedule prescribed five priorities 'A' to 'E' with inter se priorities amongst 'A' to 'E' to be accorded by the railways for transport of certain goods or class of goods specified under each category. Different kinds of coal falls under priority 'C' (iii) which provides for movement of coal from collieries in accordance with programmes and movements sponsored or recommended by the Coal Controller and/or any Committee appointed by him and/or the State Government and/or other recommending authorities and accepted by the Railway Administrations and/or Director. Movement (Railways), Calcutta, and in accordance with the Zonal Scheme applicable to each field and the principles of transport rationalisation in force from time to time.
 Priority 'E', a residuary clause again involves coal from collieries.
 The petitioners who were coal merchants, alleged that sum total of various restrictions including one dated April 1, 1972 introducing abbreviation 'GX' and the Preferential Traffic Schedule specifying priorities under sec. 27A (1) of the Act in their cumulative effect imposed a total ban on transport of coal by the Railways, at their instance and this action was violative of Art. 14 and 19(1) (g) of the Constitution. The petitioners contended; (1) that the Railway Administration's action of giving priority to some transporters of coal denying use of its transport facilities to the petitioners who were similarly situated was discriminatory in character and hence violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution; (2) the orders dated April 1,1972, December 31, 1980 and April 11, 1981 imposed unreasonable restrictions on the the freedom of the petitioners to carry on their trade guaranteed by Art. 19(1) (g); (3) that sec.
 27A is violative of Art. 19(1) (g);(4) that para (iii) of priority 'C' of the Preferential Traffic Schedule in so far as it permits special facility or preference to individuals or groups of persons selected by the sponsoring authority or recommending body for transport of coal is ultrn virea sec.
 27A of the Act; (5) order dated April 1,1972 was violative of sec. 28 of the Act and was also violative of Art. 19(1) (g) of the Constitution.
 Dismissing the writ petitions, ^ 
 HELD: Railway is a monopolistic undertaking in the matter of transport of coal by railways. Barring some tiny dots which may become visible only by a magnifying glass, the entire railway net work is nationalised and the railway is a department of the Union of India. It is therefore, indisputably a State monopoly. A monopoly unless kept within bounds may prove to be a menace, 659 Therefore, regulatory measures are necessary to prevent the abuse of monopolistic power. But there is a constitutional check on the State monopoly, namely, it being State within the meaning of Art. 12 of the Constitution, all its actions will have to conform to the fundamental rights enshrined Part III in of the Constitution. Sec. 28 of the Indian Railways Act seeks to achieve the same result which on the advent of the Constitution, Art. 14 would achieve. But sec.
 28 is subject to sec. 27A. If while giving effect to the orders of the Central Government issued under sec. 27A, priority is accorded in the matter of transport of goods consigned to Central or State Government or class of goods specified in the general or special order issued in this behalf, the action of the railway administration in complying with such special or general order could not be said as tentamounting to giving undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to in favour of any particular person or railway administration and therefore violative of sec. 28. What sec. 28 forbids is discrimination in the matter of transport of goods against a class but this is subject to the permissible classification that would be introduced by a special or general order issued by the Central Government in exercise of the power conferred by sec. 27A. It may be recalled that the Preferential Traffic Schedule according Priority 'C' to transport of coal by those mentioned therein has been issued in exercise of the power conferred by sec. 27A. Therefore, the submission that petitioners in the matter of transport of coal are similarly situated with the Central or State Government or transporters given priority by general or special order issued under sec. 27A cannot be entertained. This is all the more so because the petitioners are coal merchants who want to transport their coal by railway for carrying on business in coal and they may sell the coal to any intending purchaser while those accorded preferential treatment under Priority 'C' of the Preferential Traffic Schedule are transporters of coal who have been recognised one year in advance under Zonal Distribution Scheme as persons who would be transporting the coal to satisfy fixed goals which subserve needs of the public at large. Classification of those covered by Priority 'C' and the present petitioners is founded on intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the group and the differentia has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the impugned orders.
 Those falling within Priority 'C' (iii) would from a class by themselves and the petitioners clearly stand out of the group. [679 A-H; 680 A-E] Nav Rattanmal and Ors. v. The State of Rajasthan, [1961] INSC 176; [1962] 2 S.C.R. 324 referred to.
 Art. 19(1) (g) guarantees to the citizen the fundamental freedom to carry on any occupation, trade or business. This fundamental freedom is subject to reasonable restrictions that can be imposed by law relating to the carrying on by the State, or by a corporation owned or controlled by the State, of any trade, business, industry or service, whether to the exclusion complete or partial, of citizens or otherwise. Whenever the Court is called upon to examine the complaint that restrictions imposed on the freedom to carry on trade are unreasonable, it is necessary to find out what is the trade or business of the complainant-petitioner and to what extent the restriction, if any, is imposed upon the freedom to carry on trade or business and then to determine whether the restriction is reasonable or otherwise. It is the direct impact of the 660 restriction on the freedom to carry on trade that has to be kept in view and not the ancillary or incidental effect of the governmental action on the freedom to carry on trade.
 [682 C-D; F-H] In the instant case, if the law of demand and supply and non-availability of facility for loading coal in smalls at wayside stations result in not making available wagons to the petitioners because of pre-planning and priority it cannot be said that there has been a total ban on the transport of coal offered by the petitioners by railways, which would violate the fundamental freedom to carry on their trade guaranteed to the petitioners under Art. 19(1) (g). If the impugned orders constitute a restriction on the freedom of carrying on trade, though it is not considered to be so, the same is reasonable and imposed in larger public interest. Prima facie it appears that the petitioners' business or trade as coal merchants is no way interfered with by the railways by not being able to provide transport facility. Let it not be forgotten that the railway is not the only means of transport. There are other means of transport by which the coal can be transported by the petitioners to their respective place where they carry on their business as the coal merchants. Even assuming that the direct impact of the policy laid down by the railway administration pursuant to the orders of the central Government under sec. 27A results in denial of allotment of wagon to the petitioners, the restriction will none-the-less be reasonable because petitioners are not wholly denied the allotment of wagons. [681 H; 682 A-B; 683 A-C] A developing country with mixed economy and economic planning have certain targets to achieve. These targets are planned in advance and the economic activity is geared to the achievement of these targets. If the required resources necessary for achieving targets were readily available, no difficulty would arise. But a developing country has to so distribute its scarce resources to achieve and accomplish desired targets. This situation is bound to lead to a gap between the demand and supply of various facilities.
 Transport is one such. Once there is a gap between the demand for transport service offered by the railway and the supply of the service, the resources being not sufficient to meet with all existing demands, the scarce resources will have to be equitably distributed keeping in view the planned target. This equitable distribution would necessitate imposing of reasonable restrictions and according of priorities. [683 D-F] In the instant case, coal falls in Priority 'C' (iii) in the Preferential Traffic Schedule being the Primary source of energy. Planned regulated movement of coal to meet priority needs if it results in denial of that facility to non-priority sector could not be rejected as placing an unreasonable restriction on the fundamental freedom to carry on trade or business. And that is the object underlying sec.
 27A. It is therefore, idle to contend that the section being violative of Art. 19(1) (g) is unconstitutional. [684 A-B] Annexure 'B' to Preferential Traffic Schedule sets out the list of sponsoring authorities. The list shows that the Central and State Governments as well as highly placed Central and State Government Officers have been appointed as sponsoring authority in respect of coal required by different area and industries.
 661 Again in various States various sponsoring authorities have been set up by State Government. Power is conferred on these sponsoring authorities to sponsor persons who would be accorded priority in transport of coal. These responsible persons and bodies set up in each State as sponsoring authority are expected to act in a responsible manner keeping in view the demands of the area and the industry, for coal in each State. It is, therefore, idle to contend that setting up of sponsoring or recommending authority in Priority 'C' (iii) of the Preferential Traffic Schedule is ultra vires sec, 27A of the Act. [684 C-F] The transport of coal is according to a plan drawn up a year in advance. Further this plan is subject to the decision of the Standing Linkage Committee. Every meticulous detail is worked out in advance. A daily loading of maximum number of wagons is pre-planned. Loading of the wagons with coal at a targeted number daily requires rotational movement also according to plan. A wagon once loaded with coal when it moves out to the destination has a certain average return time stipulated and worked out in advance. In order to give effect to this planned movement abbreviation 'GX' is devised and appended to all the railway stations informing the transporters that the station is not open for transport of coal in wagon loads. Coal in smalls can be offered for transport that is what the petitioners do not desire. All the regulatory measure clearly indicate that transport of coal is scientifically planned and devised in advance. All the impugned orders are made for effective implementation of the planned movement of coal. If consistent with this planning, the railways have stopped booking of coal in wagon load from wayside station, it cannot be said that this regulatory arrangement violates sec. 28 of the Act and also that this action has imposed such an unreasonable restriction on the fundamental freedom of the petitioners to carry on their trade as to be violative of Art. 19(1) (g).[685 A-B; F-H]
