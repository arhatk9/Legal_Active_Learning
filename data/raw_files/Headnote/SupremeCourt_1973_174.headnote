 The first appellant was an employee in a firm and the second appellant was a supplier of lime stone to the firm. The procedure in respect of the supply was that the second appellant would bring four bags of lime stone every day to the first appellant and present a chalan to him. The first appellant would then send the chalan to P.W. 2 who Would initial it and send it back to the first appellant.
 Thereupon, the first appellant would put a seal and his signature on it and the second appellant would present it to the concerned department and receive payment for the supply made. On complaints that the first appellant was in the habit of signing the chalan without actually receiving the goods, P.W. 2 was asked to make a physical verification. On the day the verification was made, the first appellant, as usual sent the chalan to P.W. 2. After initialling it, P.W.
 2 verified the stock and not finding the four bags of lime stone questioned the two appellants. They were then prosecuted and were convicted for offences under s. 120B read with s. 420 and s. 511 read with s. 420, I.P.C.
 On the question whether there was only a preparation and not an attempt to cheat, 
HELD : Under s. 511, I.P.C., a person commits the offence of "attempt to commit a particular offence" when (i) he intends to commit that particular offence and (ii) he, having made preparations and with the intention of committing the offence, does an act towards its commission : such an act need not be the penultimate act towards the commission of that offence but must be an act during the course of committing that offence. The provisions of the section differ from English law in that it is not necessary for the offence under s. 511 that the transaction commenced must end in the crime, or offence, if not interrupted.
 (740 E-G] When the chalan is sent by the first appellant for initials of P.W. 2 the first appellant takes upon himself the responsibility of assuring P.W. 2 that the little stone had been received. In the present case, the chalan had been prepared and the initials of P.W. 2 obtained. This is the most important and crucial step towards cheating though it is not the penultimate step. Towards this end both the accused had co-operated. Therefore, the accused aid not stop at the stage of preparation but had reached the stage of attempt.
