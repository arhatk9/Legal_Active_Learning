 Criminal proceedings were started against the petitioner and three others on an complaint made by the first respondent alleging that the four accused persons had committed offences under s. 420 read with s. 120B of the Indian Penal (,ode. Originally the Magistrate had dispensed with the personal appearance of the petitioner in court, but on application made by the complainant, the Magistrate made an order directing the petitioner to be present in court in order to give an opportunity to the complainant's witness to identify her. Apprehending that this order would lead to her prejudice, she made an application in the Supreme Court for transfer of the case to some other court, on the grounds, inter alia, that the facts alleged by the complainant might perhaps constitute a civil dispute but the said facts had been deliberately twisted and a criminal complaint had been made to harass the petitioner. After the petition was admitted and interim stay -ranted to the petitioner pending the hearing and final disposal of the main petition, an affidavit was filed on behalf of the Delhi Administration, by the Magistrate himself, opposing the application and stating, Inter alia, that the clause indemnifying the purchaser contained in the sale deed on which the petitioner relied on would not absolve the peti- tioner from criminal liability. Thus it was clear that the deponent Magistrate had adopted the argument which might probably be. -urged by the complainant at the trial.

HELD : (i) The action of the Magistrate in making an-affida- vit and opposing the application for transfer was wholly improper.
 In criminal trials, particularly, it was of utmost importance that the Magistrate who tried the case must remain fearless, impartial and objective; and if a Magistrate chose to male an affidavit challenging the application made by in accused person whose case was pending in his court, made the said affidavit on behalf of the Administration, and in the affidavit put a strong plea opposing the transfer, all essential attributes of a fair and impartial criminal trial were immediately put in jeopardy.
 (ii)Even without considering the merits of the contentions raised bythe petition or, it was expedient in the ends of 'Justice that the caseshould be transfered to some other court of competent jurisdiction.
