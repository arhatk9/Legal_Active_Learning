 The appellant was the plaintiff in a suit for declaration of title in respect of a building. The defendant in that suit filed another suit claiming damages against the appellant. Both the suits were heard by the Additional Sub- Judge who by a common judgment, dismissed the appellant's suit and decreed the defendant's suit.
 The appellant thereupon issued notice to the Additional Sub Judge alleging that he (the Additional Sub-Judge) "created new facts", had "intentionally and with bad faith and maliciously disordered the existing oral and documentary evidence with a view to help the plaintiff" in the second suit, had "maintained different standards even with regard to self-serving statements" and that these acts could not be said to have been done in the discharge of his judicial duties within the limits of his jurisdiction in good faith and threatened to seek redress if damages claimed by him were not paid.
 The Additional Sub Judge submitted this notice to the High Court for suitable action being taken against the appellant. At the instance of the High Court the Advocate General instituted contempt proceedings against the appellant. Negativing the appellant's defences the High Court convicted him holding that the passages in the notice were per se scandalous and scurrilous, that the notice was a deliberate and determined attempt to scandalise the Judge and the Court by imputing lack of good faith and mala fides to a judicial officer in the discharge of his judicial duties and that what the appellant had stated in the notice was clearly 'criminal contempt' as defined in section 2(c) of the Contempt of Courts Act.
 In appeal to this Court the appellant contended (i) that bad faith and malice stated by him in the notice were facts constituting the cause of action; (ii) that in any event since the suit had been disposed of, execution proceedings did not constitute a pending matter and, therefore, what he stated fell within the exception of section 3, particularly the Explanation and lastly, (iii) assuming that his action technically amounted to contempt of court no sentence could be imposed on him in view of section 13 of the Act under which a person cannot be convicted for contempt under the court is satisfied 321 that it substantially interferes or tends substantially to interfere with the due course of justice.
 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD : The tone, temper and contents of the notice imputing malice, partiality and dishonesty to the Subordinate Judge constitute a deliberate attempt to scandalise the Judge, to embarrass him and to lower the authority of his office and the Court. The act and conduct of the appellant in issuing the impugned notice fell squarely within sub-clauses (i) and (ii) of the definition of `criminal contempt' in section 2(c) of the Contempt of Courts Act. [326G-H] The contempt committed by the appellant is serious and gross. He has recklessly imputed mala fides and lack of good faith to the judicial officer who had decided the case against him. The imputations were per se scandalous, actuated by bad faith. He did not even pretend to give any reason either in the notice or in the counter-affidavit for the alleged malicious attitude on the part of the judicial officer. Even in this court he has not relented. He has not adopted, even obliquely, an attitude of contrition or a pretence of remorse. [329 H] 
 1. Section 1 of the Judicial Officers' Protection Act, 1850 affords protection to two broad categories of acts done or ordered to be done by a judicial officer in his judicial capacity, namely (1) acts which are within the limits of his jurisdiction and (2) acts which though not within his jurisdiction were done or ordered to be done believing in good faith that he had jurisdiction. The protection afforded by the statute to the first category is absolute and no enquiry will be entertained that the act in question was erroneous or done without behaving in good faith. [325 B-E] The expression "jurisdiction" has been used in the section in a wide sense meaning "generally the authority of the judicial officer to act in the matters". If the judicial officer had the general authority to enter upon an enquiry into the cause, action etc. in the course of which the impugned act was done, his act, even if erroneous, would still be within his "jurisdiction". The mere fact that it was erroneous would not put it beyond his "jurisdiction".
 Therefore, if the judicial officer is found to have been acting in the discharge of his judicial duties, then, in order to exclude him from the protection of this statute, the complainant has to establish that (a) the judicial officer was acting without any jurisdiction whatsoever and (b) he was acting without good faith in believing himself to have jurisdiction. [325 H] In the instant case the judicial officer had jurisdiction to try the suits. The acts characterised by the appellant as "wrong", "malicious", and "dishonest" were acts done in the discharge of his judicial duties i.e. within the exercise of his jurisdiction and, therefore, those acts enjoy absolute protection against civil action. The notice in question can not be said to have been issued bona fide as a preliminary lawful step to the filing of a suit against the subordinate Judge. [326 D] 
 2. Section 3(2) is not applicable to this category of contempt which falls under sub-clause (i) of section 2(c) or which is otherwise of a kind different from those mentioned in section 3(1).
 322 In the instant case though the contempt committed was not in connection with any pending proceeding, it primarily and squarely fell under sub-clause (i) though the aforesaid residuary phrase in sub-clause (iii) may also be attracted.
 An unfounded imputation of mala fides, bias, prejudice or ridiculing the performance of a Judge or casting aspersions on his integrity is always considered to mean scandalising the Court and lowering the authority of his Court by bringing him and his office into disrespect and disrepute.
 Vilification of the Judge, even in administrative matters or decided judicial matters, may amount to "criminal contempt" under sub-clause (i) of section 2(c) as it lowers or tends to lower the authority or dignity of the Court by undermining public confidence in the capacity of the Judge to mete out evenhanded and impartial justice. [328 H] 
 3. The amplitude of the words "due course of justice' in section 13 is wider than the words "due course of any judicial proceedings" or "administration of justice" used in sub-clause (ii) or (iii) of section 2(c). The contempt of court committed by the appellant falls under sub-clause (i) and also within the amplitude of sub-clause (iii). If the act complained against scandalizes the judicial officer in regard to the discharge of his judicial functions, thereby substantially interferes or tends to interfere with "due course of justice" which is a facet of the broad concept of the "administration of justice" it is punishable under section 13.
