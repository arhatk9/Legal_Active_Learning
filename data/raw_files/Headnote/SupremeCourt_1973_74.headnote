 On the wife's application, judicial separation was granted under the Indian Divorce Act by the single Judge of the High Court. The custody of the eldest son was maintained with the husband while that of the daughter and the youngest son was given to the wife. In the Letters Patent Appeal preferred by the husband, the Division Bench varied the order directing handing over the custody of the daughter and the youngest son also to the husband. The principal question before the Court was whether the husband's application for the custody of the children u/s 25 of the Guardian and Wards Act, 1890, was maintainable and, if so, what are the considerations which the Court should bear in mind in exercising the discretion regarding custody of children.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD: (i) On the facts and circumstances of the case, namely, that the Court cannot make any order under the Divorce Act, as the daughter had attained majority, and no guardian could be appointed U/S. 19 of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 during the life time of the existing guardian, husband's application was competent. Welfare of the children is the primary consideration, and hyper- technicalities should not be allowed to deprive the guardian necessary assistance from the Court in effectively discharging his duties and obligations towards his ward.
 [932D] (ii) The controlling consideration governing the custody of the children is the welfare of the children concerned and not the right of their parents. The Court while exercising the discretion should consider all relevant facts and circumstances so as to ensure the welfare of the children.
 The contention that if the husband is not unfit to be the guardian of his minor children, then the question of their welfare does not at all arise, is misleading. If the custody of the father cannot promote the children's welfare, equally or better, than the custody of the mother, then, he cannot claim indefeasible right to their custody u/s 25 merely because there is no defect in his personal character and he has attachment for his children-which every normal parent has. As the daughter has just attained puberty and the youngest son was of the tender age, in the interest of their welfare, the mother should have the custody in preference to the father. [933D]
