 The respondent was, assessed to sales tax under the Madhya Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1958, for the period October 1, 1953 to December 26, 1958 in respect of sales of manganese ore including the sales from the mines in two districts in the erstwhile State of Madhya Pradesh which were transferred to the State of Maharashtra on 1st November 1956 under the States Reorganisation Act, 1956. The respondent challenged the order of assessment on the ground, among others, that by virtue of s. 78 of the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, the State of M.P. had no jurisdiction to recover the amount of tax in respect of sales made in the two districts after November 1, 1956. The High Court, without deciding the other points, which bad been raised in the writ petition, quashed the assessment by referring to s. 78 of the States Reorganisation Act which, inter alia, provided : "The right to recover arrears of any tax or duty on property including arrears of land revenue shall belong to the successor State in which the property is situated and the right to recover any other tax or duty shall belong to the successor State, in whose territories the place of assessment for that tax or duty is included".
 The High Court held that before the assessment proceedings were completed and the final amount due was determined, it could not be said that any particular amount was due against the assessee and so long as there was. no determination and no demand for payment of tax was raised the assessee could not be said to be in "arrears" of any tax within the meaning of s. 78.
 Allowing the appeal and remanding the case to the High Court, 
HELD : (1) The word "arrears" in section 78 must be held to have been used in the sense of dues or what has become due by way of tax and that does not depend upon proceedings for quantification of the amount. The word "arrears" cannot be given a narrow meaning in the manner done by the High Court.
 If the view of the High Court is accepted, arrears of tax can refer to only that amount of tax which has been quan- tified after proper assessment. This would lead to the result that where there has been no quantification or assessment order, the position would be wholly uncertain and it would not be possible to say which State would be entitled to realise those taxes or duty-, in other words, until the tax liability had been determined and quantified, there would be no arrears of tax and s. 78 would be inapplicable. The word "arrears" should be given its proper meaning as understood in the ordinary sense of the word. It is a part of the general scheme of sales tax laws that taxes become due the moment a dealer makes either purchases or sales which are subject to tax and the obligation to pay tax arises. Although the tax liability which comes into existence cannot be enforced till the quantification is effected by assessment proceedings, the liability for payment of tax is independent of the assessment. [865 F-866 D] 862 (2)Section 78 deals with arrears and s. 83 deals with refund of taxes. Both the sections indicate that when the question is of any tax or duty other than that on property, the right has been conferred and the liability imposed on the successor State in whose territories the place of assessment of that tax or duty is included. Further the amounts due by way of tax are not covered by the residuary provisions as mentioned in s. 91 of the Act. [865 B-D] Kedarnath Jute Mfg. co. Ltd. v.
