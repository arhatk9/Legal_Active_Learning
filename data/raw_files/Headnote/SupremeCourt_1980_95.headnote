 Under Rule 4 of the Andhra Pradesh Excise (Lease of Right to sell Liquor in Retail) Rules, 1969, made in exercise of the powers conferred upon the Government by section 72 read with section 17, 29, 31 and 64 of the Andhra Pradesh Excise Act, 1968, a notification dated August 20, 1979 was published in the District Gazette, Hyderabad, by the Commissioner of Excise Andhra Pradesh, giving a notice of a proposal to hold an auction from September 1, 1979 to September 3, 1979, of the right to sell arrack, in retail in respect of 78 arrack shops in the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad during the Abkari year October 1, 1979 to September 30, 1980. The notification mentioned that 22 out of 78 shops would be auctioned in ten groups of two and three shops, while the remaining 56 shops would be auctioned individually. This was according to the pattern which obtained for the year 1978-79 for which year the auction fetched an aggregate monthly rental of Rs. 32,99,537-72 np.
 On account of some representations made by Excise Contractors in regard to some conditions regarding the bottling of arrack, the auction was postponed to September 7, 1979. Auction was sought to be held on September 7, 1979 and September 12, 1979 but there were no bids. On September 21, 1979, the Collector (the auctioning authority) followed a peculiar procedure. First he auctioned 34 arrack shops in Hyderabad City individually and the bids fetched an aggregate of Rs. 6,49,700 (monthly rental). Then he put the 34 shops to auction as a single lot but there was no bid.
 Similarly he auctioned the 44 arrack shops of Secunderabad city individually and they fetched an aggregate bid of Rs.
 6,02,100 (monthly rental). He then put the 44 shops to auction as a single lot, but there was no bid. Thereafter he put the entire lot of 78 shops to auction as a single lot.
 There was no bid. The auction was postponed to September 22, 1979 and on that day the same peculiar procedure was repeated. The highest bid for all the 78 shops in one lot was Rs. 24,00,000/-, while there were two tenders for Rs.
 15,11,111/11 ps and Rs. 25,55,555/55 ps. Therefore, the tender for Rs. 25,55,555/55 ps. was accepted.
 Seventeen persons who were lessees of the arrack shops in the twin cities during the year 1978-79 filed two writ petitions in the High Court of Andhra Pradesh questioning the auction held on September 21, 1979 and September 22, 1979 on the ground that the Collector had no jurisdiction to auction the 78 shops as one lot, thereby altering the entire pattern of the auction as 795 notified earlier. It was pleaded that the action of the Collector was contrary to rule 12 of the A.P. (Lease of Right to sell Liquor in Retail) Rules, 1969 and the administrative instructions issued by the Excise Commissioner by which the Collector was bound. A learned single Judge allowed the writ petitions and directed a re- auction to be held within a period of fifteen days. The present appellants and some others, as well as the State of Andhra Pradesh preferred appeals under clause 15 of the Letters Patent. The Division Bench dismissed them on the ground that there was a contravention of Rule 12 of the Rules as the auctioning authority failed to record reasons for grouping the 78 shops in one lot.
 Dismissing all the appeals by special leave, the Court ^ 
 HELD : 1. The scheme of the Andhra Pradesh Excise Act shows that the Commissioner is at the apex, as it were, of the Excise Administrations of the State. He is the Chief Controlling Authority for all matters connected with the administration of the Excise Act and has the control of the administration of the Excise Department. The Collector who is invested with the power to perform various functions under the Act is also subject to the control of the Commissioner. Having regard to the scheme of the Act, it may be presumed that such functions as are directly assigned to the Commissioner under the Rules are considered by the Legislative delegate to be important functions for the purposes of the Act and if the Commissioner is authorised to issue instructions, those instructions are meant to be obeyed by the other authorities constituted under the Act.
 [803 A-C] Under Rule 3 it is the Commissioner that is invested with the power to fix the number of shops to be established in an area, their location and the minimum guaranteed quantity that should be sold in each shop. These matters are required to be determined by the Commissioner before the auction notice is published under R. 4 so that the details may be incorporated in the auction notice. The auction notice has to specify, among other particulars, the shop or group of shops in respect of which the lease to sell liquor is proposed to be granted by public auction. The advance notice is obviously meant to enable the intending bidder and tenderers to make the necessary preparations including vital arrangements regarding finance, since the successful bidder has to deposit one month's rental and two percent of the annual rental forthwith on acceptance of the bid or tender and an additional two months rental within fifteen days from the date of auction. [803 D-F] The fixation of number of shops, the location of the shops and their grouping is considered so important a matter that the power in regard to it is vested in the apex authority, the Commissioner. If some changes have to be made, as a measure of emergency such changes also can only be made in accordance with the administrative instructions issued on the subject by the Commissioner. Even so, the emergency exercise can only be undertake if reasons are recorded in writing. The freedom of the auctioning authority to regroup and rearrange shops is thus deliberately circumscribed. It is not for the auctioning authority to make ad-hoc experiments on the spot if he decides to regroup the shops. If he desires to regroup the shops, he has (1) to act in accordance with the administrative instructions issued on the subject by the Commissioner, and (2) to record in writing the reasons for the change. [803 G-H, 804 A] 796 It is true that the Collector, as per the administrative instructions issued on June 10, 1975, sought instructions from the Commissioner on September 20, 1979 over the phone and the Commissioner did give certain instructions on September 21, 1979. All that was said in the instructions dated September 21, 1979 was that regrouping might be done to get maximum revenue. It did not mean that the instructions previously in force were to be ignored or thrown overboard or that complete freedom was given to the auctioning authorities to act at their discretion. All that it meant was that regrouping might be done, if necessary, to get maximum revenue, but such regrouping was naturally to be in accordance with the instructions already given from time to time. In the earlier instruction dated June 10, 1975, the Commissioner pointed out that the shops and groups approved by the Board of Revenue (Commissioner of Excise) and notified for auction should be auctioned without disturbing the approved pattern. Bigger groups could be split into smaller groups and auctioned if the highest rental offered was lower than the current rental for the bigger group. It was strictly stipulated that approved groups should not be enlarged under any circumstances and where groups were re- formed reasons should be recorded in detail. The emphasis throughout was on the splitting of bigger groups into smaller groups but was never in the opposite direction i.e.
 forming bigger groups in the place of smaller groups. The instructions were definitely against creation of monopoly.
 The instructions dated August 3, 1979 also emphasised this aspect and expressly mentioned that monopoly should be broken as that would fetch better Revenue. The specific instructions given on September 20, 1979, i.e. on the eve of the adjourned auction were that two to four groups might be formed in the case of the arrack shops of the twin cities.
 [806 F-H, 807 A-C] In the instant case, the regrouping of all 78 shops into a single group was clearly opposed to the instructions issued by the Commissioner of Excise particularly the specific instruction issued on September 20, 1979 with respect to the very shops in the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad. It was opposed to the earlier general instruction that `approved groups should not be enlarged under any circumstances' and monopoly should be avoided. The accident that the regrouping fetched a higher bid is not sufficient justification of the departure from the administrative instructions which aim at breaking a monopoly in regard to lease of excise shops. The result could well have been otherwise and the bids lower. [807D-E] The question whether a provision is mandatory or directory is not to be resolved merely by reference to the emphatic or gentle language employed in the provision, nor even by the presence or absence of an express stipulation regarding the consequences of a breach of the provision.
 These are circumstances of importance which naturally have to be considered. But one must give greater consideration to the statutory design and the importance of the provision in the context of that design. Generally one may say a provision which insists upon recording of reasons before an action is taken must prima facie be considered to be mandatory, as it is aimed at preventing arbitrariness. Where the rights of citizens are involved there can be no question that such a provision should be regarded as mandatory. Where the provision involves the public interest also the provision must be regarded as mandatory. Examined in that light the Andhra Pradesh Excise Act is an Act intended to raise and secure revenue to the State, without at the same time sacrificing the public interest involved which requires the regulation of 797 trade in intoxicants. The administration of the Act is, therefore, vested primarily and centrally in the Commissioner of Excise who is expected to take a decision on all vital matters. The fixation of the number of shops, their location and grouping are considered by the legislative delegate to be matters of such vital importance in Excise administration that the power in regard to these matters is vested in the Excise Commissioner. In that setting, the object of the rule is clearly seen to be to secure strict compliance with the arrangement already made by the Commissioner of Excise, the highest authority, and to permit no departure from the arrangement save in exceptional cases, on the clearest of grounds. What is involved is the protection of revenue and what is to be prevented is ad hoc improvisation which jeopardises the revenue. That a particular improvisation yielded better results may be the exception which proves the rule. The public interest is thus seen to be served in two ways by the recording of reasons, first by protecting the public revenue and next by making public authorities not to function arbitrarily and also not appear to function arbitrarily. [807 G-H, 808 A-E] It is true that the Government is the exclusive owner of all rights and privileges in regard to intoxicants and no citizen has any right in regard to them. Here, the question is whether the Government having invited members of the public to participate in a public auction on certain terms and conditions, it is open to the officer entrusted with the task of conducting the auction to vary the terms and conditions publicly announced earlier, without assigning any reasons when the statutory rules require the recording of reasons. Departure from the rules and failure to record the reasons is impermissible merely because no citizen has any right in the sale of intoxicants. The situation changes as soon as statutory provision and rules are made and the public is invited to participate in the auctions to be held as provided by rules. Therefore, the requirement regarding recording of reasons contained in Rule 12 of the Andhra Pradesh Excise (Lease of Right to Sell Liquor in Retail) Rules, 1969 is mandatory. [808 E-H, 809 A] To record the reasons contemporaneously, that is to say, soon after the auction was held is not proper. The object of the insistence upon the recording of reasons is to eliminate arbitrariness. Reasons, if given, substitute objectivity for subjectivity. When reasons are set down in writing greater thought goes into it and greater objectivity is attained. Where the action to be taken involves a departure from what has already been decided by the apex authority and the public interest is involved, the reasons required to be recorded must be recorded before and not after the action is taken.
