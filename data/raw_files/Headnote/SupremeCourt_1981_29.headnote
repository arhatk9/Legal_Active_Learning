 Gratuity is payable to an employee on the termination of his employment after he has rendered continuous service under the conditions mentioned in section 4(1) of the Payment of Gratuity Act 1972. The term "continuous service" has been defined in section 2(c) to mean uninterrupted service and includes service which is interrupted, among others, by leave or cessation of work not due to any fault of the employee concerned. Explanation I to this section provides that an employee, who is not in uninterrupted service for one year, shall be deemed to be in continuous service, if he has been actually employed by an employer during the twelve months immediately preceding the year for not less than 240 days except when he is employed in a seasonal establishment. Explanation II provides that an employee of a seasonal establishment shall be deemed to be in continuous service, if he has actually worked for not less than 75% of the number of days on which the establishment was in operation during that year.
 Certain permanent employees of the respondent, on termination of their employment, made a claim for payment of gratuity in respect of every year during which they were in permanent employment irrespective of whether they had actually worked for 240 days or not.
 On being made permanent the badli workers claimed gratuity in respect of the period prior to their being made permanent irrespective of whether in those years they had been actually employed for 240 days or not.
 The respondent, however, paid gratuity calculating the number of years in which they were actually employed for 240 days.
 As regards the permanent employees, the Labour Court held that they were governed by the substantive part of the definition of continuous service in section 2(c) upon the basis that there was no break in service; and as regards the badly employees, it held that they were not entitled to gratuity in respect of the years in which they were not actually employed for 240 days since they fell within Explanation I of section 2(c) of the Act.
 797 The Appellate Authority upheld the view of the Labour Court.
 On appeal, as regards the permanent employees the High Court held that unauthorised absence from work resulted in a break of service and, therefore, the employees were not in uninterrupted service and fell outside the substantive part of section 2(c) but came within Explanation I. As regards badli workers it upheld the view of the authorities.
 In appeal it was contended that the permanent employees, even if they were absent without leave for a number of days in a year and had actually worked for less than 240 days due to absence without leave, were entitled to gratuity under section 4(1) since the jural relationship of employer and employee continued during that period. The badli employees on being made permanent became entitled to gratuity for the badli period because of the fact that they were required to report for work at the factory irrespective of whether they were provided with employment or not on any day.
 Dismissing the appeal.

 HELD : 1. The High Court was right in holding that the permanent employees were not entitled to payment of gratuity under section 4(1) for the years in which they remained absent without leave and had actually worked for less than 240 days in a year. [806A] The expression "actually employed" used in Explanation I and "actually worked" used in Explanation II, having regard to the context and purpose with which they were enacted, are synonymous. An employee, who is not in uninterrupted service for one year is deemed to be in continuous service, even though he falls outside the substantive part of the definition in section 2(c) provided he has been actually employed for 240 days in a year. In the case of seasonal establishments, however, it is difficult to predicate the number of days on which the establishment would be in operation in the year and an employee of such a seasonal establishment shall be deemed to be in continuous service, if he has actually worked for not less than 75% of the number of days on which the establishment was in operation. [802 F-H] The badli workers do not fall within the substantive part of the definition of "continuous service", but are covered by Explanation I. They are, therefore, not entitled to payment of gratuity for the badli period i.e. in respect of the years in which no work was allotted to them due to their failure to report to duty. Simply because a worker is required everyday to attend the mills for ascertaining whether work would be provided to him or not, he cannot be deemed to have rendered service and would not, on that account, be entitled to claim gratuity. Gratuity is paid for services rendered. [807 C; 806D] Delhi Cloth and General Mills Co. v. Its Workmen, [1968] INSC 231; [1969] 2 SCR 307 at 338, followed.
 In construing a social welfare legislation, the Court should adopt a beneficent rule of construction. If a section is capable of two constructions, that construction should be preferred which fulfils the policy of the Act, and is more beneficial to the persons in whose interest the Act has been passed. Where the language is plain and unambiguous the Court must give effect to it whatever may 798 be the consequences. In that case the words of the statute speak the intention of the legislature. The argument of inconvenience and hardship is a dangerous one and is only admissible in construction where the meaning of the statute is obscure and there are two methods of construction. In their anxiety to advance beneficent purpose of legislation, the Courts must not yield to the temptation of seeking ambiguity when there is none. [804G-H]
