 While the petitioner was in confinement under section 3 of the Official Secrets Act. 1923 an order of detention, made under section 3 of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971, was served on him. The order expired since that was not approved by the State government. Thereafter the petitioner was released on bail. After his release on bail a fresh order of detention was passed. The detention was approved by the Advisory Board and the State Government confirmed the order.
 The grounds of detention served on the petitioner were identical with the grounds on which the first order of detention was based except at ground No. 7 stated that since the petitioner was released on bail he was likely to continue his spying activities which would be highly prejudicial to the security of the State. Another difference was that in the first order of detention "Security of the State' and maintenance of Public Order were mentioned but in the second order only, security of the State" was mentioned.
 The petitioner urged that since the grounds which formed the basis of the first order of detention were identical with the grounds for detaining him under the subsequent order, the latter order was bad and his detention was illegal. The respondent-State contended that since the petitioner was in jail at the time when the first order was served on him and revoked, his subsequent release on bail constituted a fresh fact. It was further urged on behalf of the State that the Act made a distinction between grounds and facts and that while grounds must have a nexus with the object of the order of detention facts stated therein need not necessarily have that nexus.
 On the question whether the two variations from the first order of detention can be construed as "fresh facts" justifying the impugned detention within the meaning of section 14(2) of the Act. [289E] 
HELD : There being no fresh facts on which the impugned detention order is made the order is invalid and the detention of the petitioner cannot be sustained had arisen on the basis of which the Central Government or the State Government or an Officer, as the case may be, was satisfied that such an order should be made the subsequent detention on the very same grounds would be invalid.

 11, 1973; Hadt Bardu Das v. District Magistrate [1968] INSC 139; [1969] 1 S.C.R. 227 referred to.
 (ii).While it is true that 'grounds' and "facts" are used in opposition to each other, they must be taken as referring to two different things. The grounds are conclusions of fact or reasons which have induced the detailing authority to pass the order of detention. These are sometimes referred to as basic facts. Facts, however, constitute the evidence upon which the conclusions justifying the detention are made. [288B] State of Bombay v. Atma Ram Vaidya [1951] S.C.R. 157; Ram Krishan v. State of Delhi [1953] INSC 35; [1953] S.C.R. 708 referred to.
 282 There may be facts which are not germane or are not relevant to the grounds justifying the detention and when section 14 refers to "fresh facts" it does not refer to facts which are not relevant but or such fresh facts on which the detaining authority is satisfied that an order of detention should be made if the fresh facts cannot form the basis of a conclusion on which the detention order can be made, then those facts are not fresh facts which will justify the detaining authority to make an order of detention. A fresh order of detention can only be made if fresh grounds came into existence after the expiry or revocation of the earlier order of detention. No fresh order could be made on the ground which existed prior to the revocation or expiry of an earlier order of detention. Parliament has enacted section 14 in order to prevent such a contingency.
 [288E] Massod v. Union of India W.P. Nos. 469 & 470 of 1972 decided on Jan. 11, 1973.
 (iii).....The release of the detenu on bail does not constitute fresh facts as would justify the impugned detention order. Both the detention orders are passed under s. 13(1)(a)(ii) which set out the prejudicial acts under which the suspected actions of the detenu will fall and for which the detention is made. It is immaterial whether the detaining authority is satisfied that the grounds on which the detention is being made for preventing the detenu from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of the State or the maintenance of public order or for preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of the State alone, because, in either case, one of the objects is to prevent the detenu from acting in a manner prejudicial to the security of the State. The variation in the enumeration of prejudicial acts has nothing to do with fresh facts.
