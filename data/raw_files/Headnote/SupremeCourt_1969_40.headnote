 The respondent was the karta of a joint Hindu 'family firm carrying on business, before the partition of India, in area now forming part of Pakistan. The firm had a cash credit account with the Imperial Bank (now State Bank of India) in that area and had pledged its goods with the Bank as security for repayment of the advances. After the partition, the family and its members came away to India and became evacuees in relation to Pakistan. The Bank sold the pledged goods in 1948 and after adjusting the amounts due to it credited the surplus amount in the account of the firm.
 The Pakistan (Administration of Evacuee Property) Ordinance, 1949, was promulgated on October 15, 1949 and was amended by the Pakistan (Administration of Evacuee Property) Amendment Act, 1951. Under s. 6(1) of the Ordinance all evacuee property shall vest and shall be deemed to have vested in the Custodian in Pakistan from March 1, 1947. By a notification dated February 19, 1952 the Pakistan Government exempted, from the operation of the provision of the Ordinance 'cash deposits made in Banks by persons other than companies or associations or bodies of individuals whether incorporated or not'.
 The respondent applied under s. 13 of the Displaced Persons (Debts Adjustments) Act, 1951 (Indian Act) before the Tribunal constituted under the Act, claiming the amount in the Bank credited in the account of the family. The Tribunal dismissed the application. In revision, the High Court allowed the claim on the ground that the amount was a 'cash deposit made by an individual' in terms of the Pakistan Notification dated February 19, 1952.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) Having regard to the juristic nature of the Hindu Joint family under the Mitakshara Law, the family firm could not be treated as a 'person' within the meaning of the Pakistan notification. The firm was 'a body of individuals not incorporated' and hence the amount in the Bank was evacuee property and had become vested in the Custodian of Evacuee Property, Pakistan, with effect from March 1, 1947.

 (2) The rule of Private International Law is that where an involuntary assignment occurs after a voluntary assignment has already been made, the question whether the rights of the voluntary assignee have been postponed or defeated would be governed by the lex situs of the debt. In the present case, since the involuntary assignment in favour of the Custodian in Pakistan occurred in 1949, when the Ordinance was promulgated after the voluntary assignment by the Bank in favour of the firm in 1948 and the situs of 682 the debt was Pakistan (the Bank having garnishable assets of the respondent in Pakistan which could be attached by the Custodian in Pakistan), the question of priority would be governed by the law in Pakistan, namely, the provisions of the Ordinance; and under the Ordinance, the amount vested in the Custodian in Pakistan with effect from March 1, 1947.
 Therefore, the liability of the Bank to the firm must be deemed to have been extinguished. [687 H; 688 G; 689 F] Re : Queensland Mercantile and Agency Co. [1891] 1 Ch. 536 and Arab Bank Ltd. v. Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) [1954] AC. 495, applied.
