 The respondent firm is a manufacturer of plywood circles to be used as component part of packing materials for wire and cables. The firm used to be assessed to duty under the Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944 on the basis of the Total area of the circles manufactured and the duty to be collected when the circles were issued out of the factory premises. An audit objection was taken to this mode of assessment on the ground that the process of cutting out circles and punching of holes cannot be considered as incidental or ancillary to the completion of the manufacture of plywood, that the levy of excise duty must be on the total area of blocks or panels of plywood that come out of the press and not on the area of the circles made out of the blocks or panels and that by plywood it was meant only plywood which had a general market and not plywood circles specially manufactured for a particular purpose or a particular customer. Pursuant to the audit objection, the Central Excise Range Officer issued a notice calling upon the firm to furnish area of the plywood manufactured at the panel stage for taking clearance of the plywood circles. It was also mentioned that the assessment of the plywood circles would be made at the panel stage and not on the finished circles and directed the firm to file ARI accordingly. The firm sent reply through an Advocate and wanted the order of the Collector referred to in the notice, but the same was not furnished and instead the Range Officer issued another notice reiterating the earlier stand and directed that duty paid on plywood panels cleared outside the factory could not be brought back for further process of cutting circles with prior permission.
 The firm challenged the validity of the two notices under Article 226 of the Constitution.A Single judge of the High Court disposing of the writ petition directed the Collector to issue a copy of the order referred to in the notice on the Range Officer dated 22-2-67 within a month and on receipt on that order the firm might seek appropriate remedies by way of appeal under the statute.
 476 The Division Bench, however, allowed the appeal of the firm and quashed the said two notices. It held that the real dispute was as to what stage the excise duty-became leviable on the goods, and that the blocks or panels from which the firm cuts out circles are all unfinished products, because they will become furnished products only when they are trimmed and their edges are sanded.
 In the appeal by the Revenue to this Court it was contended that the plywood as and when it comes out of the press in blocks or panels is a manufactured product known in the market as plywood and is exigible to duty, that the blocks or panels so manufactured do not cease to be plywood under item 16B merely because they are not trimmed and their edges are not sanded, that the cutting of the blocks does not form a part of the manufacture of the plywood, that the circles which are made by the cutting of the blocks and punching holes into blocks and panels, do not result in the manufacture of any different product for the purpose of assessment to duty and that the plywood earlier manufactured in blocks and panels when it came out of the press can be said to constitute materials for the purpose of manufacture of circles and becomes exigible to duty under Item 16B.
 Allowing the Appeal, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The High Court was in error in quashing the two notices. They are valid and lawful. Item 16B makes it clear that plywood in sheets, blocks, boards or the like attracts excise duty.A special provision by way of exception is made only in the case of plywood for tea-chests when cut to size in panels or shocks and packed in sets. The provision in Item 16B that ply wood in sheets, blocks and board or the like, which attracts duty is in very broad terms and the expression 'like' includes circles. There is nothing to indicate in this item that plywood must be trimmed or sanded Plywood is manufactured as soon as it comes out of the press, though the same may not be trimmed or sanded out of which circles are to be produced. There is nothing to indicate that plywood in panel stage not trimmed and not sanded, is not known in the market as plywood.
 Plywood when it comes out of the press at the panel stage, therefore, clearly falls within Item 16B of the First Schedule and the authorities were justified in seeking to levy duty on plywood at the panel stage.

 2. The facts and circumstances go to indicate that the respondent firm is a small scale industry and carried on business on small scale. Prior to the impugned notification, the assessment of the excise duty was made on the plywood circles after the same had been produced and not on plywood as and when the same came out of the press. This was the mode of assessment adopted by the Excise Authorities and there was no default on the part of the firm. It was` only in the year 1967 the Excise Authorities sought to change the mode of assessment because of audit objection. The respondent assessee succeeded in the High Court. The present was instituted in 1971 and this is being 477 disposed of in the year 1985. If the respondent firm is saddled with all the accumulated liability on account of excess amount of excise duty payable for all these years, the firm will be very seriously prejudiced and it may be difficult to meet this liability. On the other hand, so far as the Union of India is concerned even without this excess amount, it had managed without any serious prejudice or inconvenience. The excess amount is not likely to be a very substantial sum from the point of view of Union's financial position and will not be of any material gain but may very likely spell doom for the respondent firm. Apart from this aspect, no assessment for all these years on the basis of the said notices has been made or could have been made. To make fresh assessment for imposition of duty for so many years after such a long lapse of time may require a prolonged exercise which may not ultimately be worth the trouble and is bound to cause a great deal of hardship and harassment to the firm. In these circumstances, the ends of justice require that there should be no levy of excise duty on the basis of the said notices for the years which have already passed.
