 The assesee--a public limited company, entered into a partnership on April 20, 1950 with another firm, and thus had two sources of income,(i) from it,,, own business and (2) from the shares of the partnership business. The Income-tax Officer included the shares of profit of the assessee from the partnership business up to November 30, 1950 and up to March 31, 1951 in the assessment of the assessment year 1951-52. The see objected, contending that this income accrued after the accounting year of the assessee which ended on September 30, 1950, and at its general meeting held on May 17, 1951, the assessee could not be expected to declare a dividend for the assessment year 1951-52 which related to the accounting year ending on September 30, 1950 out of its profits that accrued during subsequent accounting period. The Revenue maintained the assessment, which, on reference, the High Court answered in favour of the assesse. In appeal, this Court.
 
HELD : The assessable income of the assessee included the share of the assessee's profits in the partnership for the purpose of application of s. 23A of the Income-tax Act, 1922 so far as the assessment year 1951-52 was concerned.
 Under s, 2(11) of the Act an assessee may have different previous years in respect of different sources of income and under the scheme of the Act the income of the varying previous years from the different sources should be lumped together to arrive at the total income of the assessee. The provisions of s. 2(11) of the Act make it clear that, except in cases where a previous year is determined by the Department under cl. (b), the 'varying previous years must all necessarily end with or within the financial years next preceding the assessment year. In the present case, the previous year so far as the personal business of the assessee was concerned, was the previous year ended on September 30, 1950, but with regard to the income of the partnership the previous year was the period between November 30, 1950 and March 31, 1951 when the accounts of the partnership were made up and closed. The provisions of s. 23(1) must be construed in the context of s. 2(11) of the Act and the expression' previous year' of the company in s.
 13A(1) Must be. interpreted as meaning two previous years where the company carries on two different businesses with different sources of income for which there are separated accounting periods. [736F-737 B] The annual general meeting of the assessee was hold on May 17, 1951 after the close of the accounting year of the firm.
 It is true that the actual profits of the assessee from its partnership business were ascertained after the close of the accounting period i.e., March 31, 1951. But the 732 income may accrue to an assessee without actual receipt of the same and if the assessee acquires a right to receive the income, the income can be said to have accrued to him though it may be received later on on its being ascertained. The legal position is that a liability depending upon a contingency is not a debt in praesenti or in futuro till the contingency happens. But if it is a debt the fact that the amount has to be ascertained does not make it any the less a debt if the liability is certain and what remains is only a quantification. of the amount : Debitum in praesenti.
 Solvendum in futuro. [737 E-H] Commissioner of Inland Revenue v. Gardner Mountain & D' Ambrumenil Ltd. 29 T.C. 69, applied.
