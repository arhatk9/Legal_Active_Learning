 On the success of the assessee's appeal against in assessment made by the Income Tax Officer, District 1 (2), the Department appealed to the Tribunal. This was filed by the Income Tax Officer, District VI, in whose jurisdiction the assessee had shifted his residence. The assessee objected that the appeal was incompetent as it was not filed by the Income 'Tax Officer who had made the assessment. The Tribunal rejected the objection. On reference, the High Court sent for the records looked into them and on new facts, answered the question against the Revenue. In appeal by special leave 
HELD.-The Income Tax Officer, District VI, bid jurisdiction over the assessee and he could be directed by the Commissioner to file the appeal.
 Under S. 33(2), the person who has a right to appeal is the Commissioner of Income Tax and not the Income Tax Officer.
 The Income Tax Officer, when he files the appeal under the direction of the Commissioner performs merely a ministerial function. But the Income Tax Officer selected must have some concern with the assessee against whom the appeal is filed by the Commissioner of Income-Tax. It may be that the Income Tax Officer who completed the original assessment Would also be concerned with the appeal to be filed by the Commissioner, but it does not mean that he is exclusively so concerned. If the case had been transferred by the Commissioner or the Board of Revenue from Abe Income Tax Officer who completed the assessment to another Income Tax Officer, then obviously the former officer will have no concern with the appeal. But if there has been no? such transfer then it cannot be skid that be alone is concerned with the appeal. The Income Tax Officers can have con- current jurisdiction over some matters. One illustration of this is provided by s. 64(4). [325F-H; 327D] Commissioner of Income Tax. West Bengal, Calcutta v. S.
 Sarkar & Co. A.I.R. 1954 Cal. 613. approved.
 Sardar Baldev Singh v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Delhi 40 I.T.R. 605, followed.
 R.B. L. Benarsi Dass v. C.I.T. East Punjab, 42 I.T.R. 363, disapproved.
 The High Court exceeded its jurisdiction under s.66 of the Income Tax Act in finding new facts. If it felt any difficulty in answering the question. it should have called for a supplementary statement of the case. [325C]
