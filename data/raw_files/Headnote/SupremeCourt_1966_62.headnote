 In 1910, the Ruler of Cochin issued a Proclamation publishing Ruler. -to secure the better administration of Devaswoms. Clause 9 of the Proclamation authorised the Diwan of the State to make Rules to carry out the main object and scheme of the Proclamation. In exercise of the authority conferred upon him, the Diwan published rules on March 21, 1910 regulating the procedure in the matter of collection Paattam, Michavaram, renewal fee and other dues payable to Devaswoms. These Rules applied to all tenants--ordinary as well as Kanam. In 1955, the legislature of the Part B State of Travancore Cochin enacted the Travancare-Cochin Kanam Tenancy Act conferring full proprietary rights on Kanam tenants in the Cochin area of the State, subject only to the payment of Janimikaram as a result of which, the Kanam-tenant was declared proprietor of the land and the right of the Jemni was only to receive the Jamnikaram. After the enactment of the Act, the Cochin Devaswom Board claimed to recover michavaram from the Kanam tenants at the rates settled under the Rules made under the Proclamation of 1910. The Kanam-tenants petitioned the High Court for an appropriate writ quashing the notices of demand issued by the Board, and the High Court allowed the petitions and directed the Board not to proceed to enforce the notices. In appeal to this Court, it was contended that; (i) the Act applied only to land held under a contract of tenancy and not to, Devaswom lands in respect of which the michavaram and renewal fee, were governed by Rules framed under the Proclamation (ii) the Act was discriminatory and void.
 
HELD : (i) The Travancore-Cochin Kanom Tenancy Act governs lands held from Devaswoms in the Cochin region of the State Kerala.
 The Scheme of the Rules published by the Diwan under the Proclamation was that an offer of Pattah on the terms specified in a 'tough draft was to be made to the tenant and after the terms were settled a final Pattah was to be given and the Kanam-tenant had to execute a Kychit (undertaking) in favour of the State. Though the quantum of Michavaram and the renewal fee was determined by-the Rules under the proclamation the terms of the Pattah and Kychit evidenced the contract which determined the rights of the Kanam tenant and the Devaswom. Therefore, the definitions of 'holding', 'michavaram', 'Kanam', 'Renewal fee' and 'Janmikaram' in s.
 2 of the Act applied to all lands held by Kanamtenants whether they were Devaswom or non-Devasom. Further, though the Rules under the Proclamation are not expressly repealed by the Act, the Act must be deemed to have partially superseded the Proclamaton and the Rules in so far as the latter related to the rights and obligations of the Kanam- tenants in the three religions, the Act is not discriminatory. Board. [732 B-D; 733 A-B] 725 (ii)The Act does not infringe the guarantee of equal protection of the laws in Art. 14 of the Constitution.
 Though the Act only applies to the Cochin area of the State of Kerala which consists of the three regions of Travancore, Cochin and Malabar, since there is a difference between the relations governing the Jenmies and the Kanam-tenants in the three religions, the Act is not discriminatory.
