 A father and son were charged with committing seven murders.
 K, an eye witness, narrated the incident in the committal court and stated that the two accused armed with a pistol and sword respectively entered the house of the deceased, the son attacked the victims and the father fired when his son was caught by M. R stated that the son made a confession to him with regard to the murder. In the sessions court K turned hostile, and the public prosecutor read to K the whole of her statement and asked whether it was her statement. She admitted that it was a true record of what she stated before the committal court, but stated that it was a false statement given under 'police pressure. The same was the case with R. Both the statements of K and R before the committal court were brought on record of the Sessions trial as Exhibits, and the defence did not then object to their being read. The Sessions Court convicted the father and son relying on the statements of K and M before the committal court, of another eye witness, and of S who had heard the report of pistol shot and saw the accused armed with their respective weapons coming out of the deceased's house. The High Court, on appeal, affirmed the- conviction of the son, but rejecting the testimony of K, R and S acquitted the father holding that he had taken no share in the affair. In appeals, by the State against the father's acquittal, and by the son against his conviction this Court 
HELD : The High Court was in error in not reading the statements. The objection taken to the admissibility of the statement of K was that every single passage which differed from her testimony in the Court of Session was not put to her with a view to affording her an opportunity of explaining why she had made- a contrary statement. No doubt, if there were some passages here and there which differed from her later version, that procedure would have been necessary. Here the witness admitted that her statement was truly recorded in the Committal Court. She only denied that it was a true statement because she said that she was made to depose that way by the police. It would have been useless to point out the discrepancies between the two,statements because her explanation would have been the same. In these circumstances, the requirements of s. 145 of the Indian Evidence Act were fully complied with and-the earlier statement could be read as evidence in the Sessions Trial. [61-C-E] The same was the case with R. These two witnesses also made a statement under s. 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
 These statements were, of course, not evidence but were corroborative of what had been stated earlier in the Committal Court. The attention of the witnesses was drawn to the passages from those statements also and their explanation only was that they were made under police pressure. The 57 High Court should have accepted the evidence of S. because there was sufficient corroboration of this evidence. There was, thus, enough evidence on record to convict the father also.
