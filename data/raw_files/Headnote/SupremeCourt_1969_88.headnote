 By a settlement deed of 1935, the owner of certain properties settled three items of property on his wife and two sons, the first appellant and respondent one item for each. Mutations were effected of the properties so settled in favour of the donees. Thereafter, he had executed three wills. In his last will and testament, there are two recitals that he had cancelled the previous settlement deed and wills and that the last will was to be the only document which should govern the disposition of his properties. The testator, by that will, also purported to give to the respondent five items of property. Those five items did not include the item settled on the respondent in 1935, but included certain properties which had been settled in 1935 on the wife and the first appellant. The testator further stated that the entire residue was bequeathed to the first appellant, but did not state specifically that he was giving away to the first appellant the property which he had settled on the respondent in 1935. After the death of the testator the respondent filed a suit claiming the item settled on him in 1935, on the basis that he had a -right under the will to get the five items bequeathed to him thereby, in addition to the item settled on him in 1935, because, by reason of the. settlement in his favour it could not form the subject matter of the bequest in favour of the first appellant.
 On the question whether by accepting the benefit under the will by taking the five items bequeathed to him thereby, the respondent exercised his right of election and precluded himself from asserting any right to the item settled on him in 1935.
 
HELD : Under s. 180 of the Indian Succession Act, if a legatee has been given any benefit under a will and his own property has also been disposed of by that very will, the legatee must elect either to confirm such disposition or to dissent from it, and in the latter case, he must relinquish all his claims under the will if he choose to retain his own property. The presumption being that a testator intends to dispose of only his own property, general words will not usually be construed so as to include a particular property over which he had no disposing power, unless, such an intention appears on the face of the will either by express words or by necessary implication. [78 B-C] In the present case, the terms of the will indicate, that the testator thought he could revoke the settlement deed and treat it as -non-existent, and that he meant to dispose of the entire estate including the properties which had been the subject matter of the settlement of 1935. The respon- dent, therefore, was put to election and could not claim the property settled on him in 1935, if he wished' to take the benefit under the will. [76 C-D, 77 A-C, 79 G] Miller v.
