 The appellants who were adversely affected by the Rice (Southern Zone) Movement Control Order 1957, the Southern States (Regulation of Exports of Rice) Order, 1964, and the Andhra Pradesh Rice and Paddy (Restriction of Movement) Order 1965, moved petitions under Art. 226 of the Constitution of India in the High Court of Andhra Pradesh challenging the validity of these orders. The petitions were dismissed by the High Court. In appeal before this Court by special leave as well as in a writ petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution the following contentions were advanced before this Court : (i) The said Control Orders offended Art. 303 of the Constitution in as much as they suffered from the vice of discrimination between one State and another and of preference to one State over an other;
 (ii) the orders were in the nature of executive instructions and did not fall within the meaning of subordinate legislation; (iii) even if they could be regarded as subordinate legislation they could not be saved under s.
 303(2) in the absence of the declaration contemplated thereby; (iv) the requisite opinion of the Central Government within s. 3(1) of the Essential Supplies Act was not found in any of the orders; (v) the Control Orders imposed unreasonable restrictions on the right of the petitioners to carry on trade, as arbitrary powers had been conferred in the matter of issuing or withholding permits and there were no provisions for appeal or revision against refusal to grant a permit; (vi) S. 3 (2) (d) suffers from excessive delegation.
 
HELD : (i) The first three contentions could not be entertained since no firm foundation had been laid in respect of them in the pleadings. [875 G-876 B] (ii)There was no necessity of reciting the requisite opinion within s. 3 (1) of the Act in the Control Orders.
 it is implicit in the recital in the Control Orders that they were being made under s. 3 of the Act, that the Cent- rat Government had formed the requisite opinion within subs- s. (1) of that section. [876B-C] (iii)The permit could be granted either by the State Government or by responsible officers of the rank of the District Collector or the Deputy Commissioner of Civil Supplies. If the State Government alone 872 had the powers to issue the permits the challenge on the ground of unreasonableness of the restrictions would admittedly not be available. There is no bar to any of the aggrieved parties approaching the State Government by means of a representation for a final decision even if the matter has been dealt with by the District Collector or the Deputy Commissioner of Civil Supplies in the first instance and the permit has been refused or wrongly withheld by those officers. In these circumstances the absence of a provision for appeal or revision can be of no consequence. It has been pointed out in more than one decision of this Court that when the power has to be exercised by one of the highest officers the fact that, no appeal has been provided for is a matter of no moment.

[1968] 1, S.C.R. 274, 297 and Pannalal Biniraj v. Union of India, [1956] INSC 86; [1957] S.C.R. 233, 257. referred to.
 (iv)The question whether s. 3 (2) (d) suffers from the vice of excessive delegation was no longer at large. In Bhana Mal Gulzari Mal's case the attack on s. 3 of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946 which was similar in terms to s. 3 of the Act on the ground of excessive delegation was repelled. it was held that the Central Government had been given sufficient and proper guidance for exercising its powers in effectuating the policy of the statute. [877D-E] Union of India & Ors. v. M/s. Bhana Mal Gulzari Mal & Ors., [1959] INSC 156; [1960] 2 S.C.R. 627, applied.
