 The first appellant Gollaleshwar Dev is an ancient temple situate in village Golgeri in the district of Bijapur which formed part of the erstwhile State of Bombay prior to the reorganisation of the States. Consequent upon the enactment of the Bombay Public Trust Act, 1950, the temple was registered as a public trust. The district of Bijapur became part of the new State of Karnataka on the appointed day i. e. November 1st, 1956 under the States Reorganisation Act, 1956. The Bombay Public Trust Act continued to remain in force in the areas which formed part of the erstwhile State of Bombay. Appellant No.2 is the present trustee of the temple and appellant No. 3 the grandson of ex-trustee Mariyappa the elder brother of appellant No.2 is a beneficiary.
 it had been customary for the trustees to permit persons rendering services to the temple to reside in suit premises on leave and license basis. The respondents Shantayya and Smt. Shankarawa, who were taken in the service of the temple and allowed to reside in the suit premises free of rent on condition that they were to occupy the said premises so long as their services to the temple were required, started creating trouble in the year 1957 with the result the father of appellant No.2 terminated their services and asked them to vacate the suit premises.
 On their failure to do so, he brought two suits being Civil Suits Nos. 244 and 255 of 1937 in the name of the idol Shree Gollaleshwar Dev as plaintiff No.1 with himself being 647 trustee as plaintiff No. 2. The respondents contested the claim on various grounds and pleaded inter alia, (i) that the temple had no right to title to the suit premises which belonged to them by virtue of a registered gift deed dated February 19, 1917 executed by Mariyappa Lingappa the grandfather of appellant No. 3 in favour of their Predecessor-in- title Balalochanayya Hiremath, the first license of the suit premises; (ii) that the suits brought under section 50 (11) of the Act were not maintainable for want of consent in writing given by Charity Commissioner under section 51; ant (iii) that the Court of the Civil Judge, Senior Division, Bijapur had no jurisdiction to entertain the suits. The suits Mysore High Court in Marikamba Temple and Hanumant Temple, Sirsi, by its Manager, S.S. Dhakappa v. Subraya Venkataramanappa Barkur reported in I.L.R. 1958 Mysore 736. Thereafter a Fresh Civil suit No. 2 of 1962 was instituted before the District Judge Bijapur after obtaining the consent in writing of the Charity Commissioner by the appellant No. 2's father as plaintiff No. 2 and the idol as plaintiff No. 1. Later Appellant No. 3 in the capacity of a beneficiary and Appellant No. 2 in the capacity of the present trustee were impleaded as plaintiffs Nos. 2 and 3 as "persons interested in the trust." The High Court in the meanwhile had reversed the decision in Marikamba's case in Ganapathi Ram Naik & ANR. V. Kusta Shri Venkataraman Dev in 1964 I Mysore LJ 172. Following the said D.B. decision in the District Judge held that, although a suit for recovery of property belonging to the idol could be brought either by the idol represented by section 50 (ii) of the act and was therefore not maintainable and that such a suit would be a governed by the ordinary law and would not lie in the District Court, but either in the Court of the Civil Judge , Junior Division or the court of the Civil Judge, Senior Division according to the valuation of the subject matter of the suit." Aggrieved by the said Judgment the appellants preferred an appeal before the High Court. A Division Bench which heard the appeal felt that the decision in Ganapathi Ram's case required reconsideration and referred the matter for the opinion of the Full Bench. The Full Bench upon the hypothesis that section 50 of the Act is in pari materia with section 92 of the Code of Civil Procedure expressed that the well- settled principles governing section 92 of the Code are equally applicable to section 50 of the Act. It accordingly held: (1) that the suit contemplated by section 50 of the Act was one of a representative character; (ii) that a suit by a deity for possession being a suit for vindicating its own personal rights 648 was not governed by section 50 of the Act that persons who institute suits in their capacity as trustees do so not in their representative capacity representing the interests of the public but in their own individual or personal capacity to vindicate their own rights or that of the idol that is to say, merely because trustees . were persons having interest in the trust the provision of section 50(ii) of the Act would not be attracted to a suit of this kind. Upon that view the full Bench answered the question referred to it as follows: (i) the expression "persons having interest in the trust" occurring in section 2(10) and section 50 of the Act does not include the trustees when they institute the suits in their capacity as trustees for vindicating their private rights; and (ii) consequently two or more trustees or a public trust cannot file a suit under section 50(11) of the Act for a declaration that the property belongs to the public trust and for possession of the same from a person holding it adversely to the trust. In accordance with the opinion of the Full Bench, the Division Bench dismissed the appeal filed by the appellants. Hence the appeal by special leave.
 Allowing the appeal, the Court ^ 
 HELD : 1.1 The expression "person having interest" in a trust occurring in section 2(10) and section 50 of the Bombay Public Trust Act cannot be given a restrictive construction. The definition of the expression "person having interest" in section - 2 (10) being an inclusive one, there is no Lawful justification to exclude the suit brought by two or more trustees in the name of the idol, to recover possession of its property against a person holding it adversely to the trust from the purview of section 50(ii) of the Act. The definition of the words person having interest" in section 2 (10) of the Bombay Public Trust Act, as amended in 1953 was made inclusive to set at rest all doubts and difficulties as to the meaning of these words, which were intended and meant to be used in a generic sense so as to include not only the trustees but also the beneficiaries and other persons interested in the trust.
 The definition of the expression person having interest in section 2(10) is wide enough to include not merely the beneficiaries of a temple, math, wakf etc. but also the trustees. Therefore appellants Nos. 2 and 3 who undoubtedly are members of the founder's family i.e. beneficiaries, are entitled to attend at performance of worship or service in the Distribution of offering to the also entitled to partake in the distribution of offering to the deity and thus answer the description "person having inter" as defined in Section 2 (10) of the Act.

 1.2 Provisions contained in sections 50 to 52 of the Bombay by Trust Act make it clear that the Act created and regulated a right to institute a suit by the Charity Commissioner or by two or more persons interested in the trust, in the form of supplementary statutory provisions without defeasance of the right of manager or a trustee or a shebait of an idol to bring suit in the use idol to recover the property of the trust in the usual way.
 Further, although although sub-section (1) of section 52 makes sections 92 and 93 of the Code of Civil Procedure inapplicable to public trust registered under the Act, it has made provision by section 50 for institution of such suits the Charity Commissioner or by two or more persons interested in the trust and having obtained the contest in writing of the Charity Commissioner under section 50 of the Act. Therefore, any two or more persons interested in the trust should not deprived of the right to bring a suit as contemplated by section 50 (ii) (a) of the Act. 1658 D- F] 
 1.3 section 50 of the Bombay Trust Act is not in pari materia with section 92 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
 Although section 50 of the Act is structured upon the pattern of section 92 of the Code of Civil Procedure, there is no provision in section 92 of the Code analogous to clause (ii) or relief (a ) of section 50 of the Act.
 Section 50 authorises the institution of a suit by the Charity Commissioner or two or more persons interested in the trust only in the District Court having jurisdiction to try it. The scope of section 50 of the Act is wider than that of section 92 of the Code of Civil Procedure. It applies to a case so long as the relief claimed falls within the scope of the section. One of the reliefs that can be claimed in a suit brought under section 50 of the Act is that covered by relief (a) set out in clause (ii) namely for a declaration that a certain property belongs to a public trust and for possession thereof from person holding it adversely to the trust viz. suit brought by the Charity Commissioner or two or more persons interested and in the trust with his consent in writing as provided in section 51 of the Act.
 Section 50 of the Bombay Trust act contemplated not only suits of a representative character but also suit by two or yore trustees for preservation of the property of the trust.
 Therefore, in a suit filed the Idol to enforce it private rights, the provision of section 92 of the Code of civil Procedure are not attracted.[659 D-H] Bisimannath & Anr. v. Shri Thakur Radhaballabhji & ors.[1967] 2 S.C.R.. 618 distinguished.
