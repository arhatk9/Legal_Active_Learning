 Appellant No. 1 sold certain soft wood trees standing on his lands consisting partly of Bane lands for a consideration and asked the Divisional Forest Officer for the issue of a permit in the name of the buyer permitting him to cut and remove the timber. The Divisional Forest Officer informed appellant no. 1 that the Bane lands held by him were not redeemed and that no permission could be granted for cutting and removing the timber unless the timber value was paid.
 In a petition under Art 226 of the Constitution the appellant challenged the constitutional validity of rule 137 of Mysore Forest Rules, 1969 and contended that the rule was inconsistent with provisions of s. 75(1) of the Mysore Land Revenue Act, 1964. The High Court upheld the validity of the rule but held that the appellant was liable to pay timber value of only such trees as were in existence at the time of the Survey Settlement of 1910. It further held that rule 10 of the rules for classifiers contains an express reservation of the trees standing on Bane lands in favour of the State Government.
 On the question whether rule 10 of the Rules for Classifiers contains ,in express reservation of trees standing on Bane lands in favour of the State Government.
 
HELD : Rule 10 of the Rules for Classifiers does not contain an express order reserving the right of the State Government to the trees growing on Bane lands within the meaning of s.
 75(1) of the Mysore Land Revenue Act, 1964. Rule 10 is a part of the rules meant for the guidance of classifiers for implementing the impending survey settlement. The rules called "Rules for Classifiers" contain instructions as to how the classifiers should conduct themselves in making the survey settlement. [426F-H] The second paragraph of the explanation to rule 10 by its very language refers to a state of affairs that,is assumed to exist and does not contain any express order or declaration regarding the reservation of trees in favour of the Government. The very nature and context of. the Rules for Classifiers would show that they could not possibly concern themselves with a matter regulating ',he vesting of a substantive right like the right of the State Government to the trees upon Bane lands. At best rule 10 could be said to refer to a historical fact. [427C-D] [Rule 137 was deleted during the pendency of the appeal.
 The question as regards the validity of the rule is now academic.] [428C-D]
