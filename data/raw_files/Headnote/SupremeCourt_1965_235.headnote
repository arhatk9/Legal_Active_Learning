 The respondent was a multi-agency concern. The principal of one of the agencies terminated that agency and paid the respondent certain amounts. When the amounts were sought to be assessed to Income-tax, the respondent objected on the ground that the amounts represented only compensation received for termination of the agency business and as consideration for the restrictive covenant not to do business in the same line for a prescribed period. The Income-tax Officer, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner.
 and the Appellate Tribunal held against the respondent, but the High Court on a reference, held that by the termination of the agency, the respondent lost an earning asset and that the compensation paid for the destruction of such an asset was a capital receipt not liable to tax.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : While the income-tax authorities have to gather the relevant material to establish that the compensation given for the loss of the agency was a taxable income, an adverse inference could be drawn against the assessee if he had not produced evidence which was in his exclusive knowledge and keeping. The 'respondent gave up one of its innumerable agencies in different lines without any protest presumably because it was in the normal course of its business, and continued to do business without any mishap. it did not place any material before the Department to establish the relative importance of the said agency in the frame work of the earning apparatus of its business. The loss of - the agency would therefore only be -a normal trading loss, and the amount of compensation attributable to it would be a revenue receipt assessable under S. 10 of the Income-tax Act, 1922. [486 H; 487 A, C; 488 B-C] The restrictive covenant was one of the terms of the agreement relating to consideration, and therefore the compensation paid was not only in lieu of the giving up of the agency but also for the respondent accepting a restrictive covenant for a specific period. Since the covenant was an independent obligation which came into operation only after the agency was terminated and was wholly unconnected with it, that part of the compensation attributable to the restrictive covenant was a capital receipt not assessable, to tax.

Chari and Chari [1965] 3 S.C.R.
 692, followed.
 The apportionment of the compensation has to be made on a reasonable basis between the loss of the agency in the usual course of business and the restrictive covenant by the assessing authority. The compensation was severable and any difficulty in apportionment cannot be a 481 ground for rejecting the claim by the revenue and the assessee for apportionment. [492 B-D] Wales (H. M.
