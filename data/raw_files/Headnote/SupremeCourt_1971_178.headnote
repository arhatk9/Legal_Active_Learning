 The assessee had granted a prospecting lease of his land to a company in 1941 for a period of one year. In 1944 he granted a lease, of mining rights to the same company in respect of a part of the land for a period of 30 years. The assessee took a large amount by way of premium but charged a slightly lesser amount than what he had charged in the prospecting lease, by way of royalty. The assessee had also granted other leases and the premium per acre in the case of those leases was very much less than the premium per acre in the 1944 lease.
 On the question whether the premium or a part of it was in the nature of a revenue receipt., the High Court on reference, held against the assessee.
 in appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) When the interest of the lessor is parted for a price, the price paid is premium or salami but the periodical payments made for the continuous enjoyment of the benefits under the lease are in the nature of rent. The former is capital receipt and the latter a revenue receipt.
 In finding the real nature of the transaction it is not the nomenclature or form but the circumstances of the transaction that matter. 'The onus. however, is upon the Income-tax authorities to show that there exist facts and circumstances which would make payment of what has been called salami, income. [39E-H] Commissioner of Income-tax, Assam v. The Panbari Tea Co.
 Ltd. [1965] 3S.C.R. 81 1, followed.
 (2)The terms of 1941 lease which was only for one year and which was for the entirely different purpose of prospecting would not afford any reasonable basis for holding that the terms of 1944 lease, which was a mining lease for 30 years, were fixed in such a manner that part of the proceeds of the royalty were included in the figure of the salami. 'When the lessor creates a lease for a long period it is legitimate for him to charge more amount by way of premium as he is transferring possession of the demised land and he may charge royalty at a slightly lesser rate. The mere fact that the amount taken on account of premium was substantial and on the face of it looked considerably large would not justify the,view that the amount represented capitalised royalty. [40H, 41 A-E] (3)The fact that the premium was approximately equal to the difference between the total amounts of royalty calculated at the rates in the 1941-lease and the 1944- lease, would not justify an inference that 37 The amount was taken was taken in exchange of royalty because, the assessee Could not have known how Much mineral Could be extracted from the areas it the time of granting the 1944-lease. [43A-C] (4)It was open to the Departmental authorities to have examined lie assessee or his representative and discovered all the reasons for the terms in the various leases being different. The Department Could also have ascertained the details of the quantity of mineral which could be extracted from the areas covered by the other leases and discharged the onus which lay on the Revenue to show that the payment of premium was in fact of royalty. But the same was not done.[ 42E-G]
