 The appellant who was born in India left for Pakistan in 1951 at the age of 13. He stayed there till 1955, when he came to India as a Pakistani citizen with a Pakistani passport. In 1963, he was deported to Pakistan. In 1964, he again came to India with a Pakistani passport. In order to determine his nationality for the purpose of deporting him, the Government of India issued notice to him to make representations, if any. The appellant made two representations, and though in both of them he urged that he had not voluntarily acquired the citizenship of Pakistan, he did not raise any plea, at any stage, that he had not voluntarily obtained the passport on the two occasions be came to India, or, that he was compelled to apply for Pakistani passports. There was no plea that he tried to obtain a permit for temporary stay when going to Pakistan nor was there any suggestion that he tried to obtain a repatriation certificate which he could have obtained if he had retained his Indian citizenship. The Government of India considered the representations and passed an order that he had voluntarily acquired Pakistani citizenship, under s. 9(2) of the Citizenship Act, 1955.
 HELD:The order did not suffer from any infirmity.
 On the representations made by the appellant the Government was not called upon to make any detailed enquiry, when the provisions of part 3 of Schedule III of the Citizenship Rules, namely, that the authority must regard obtaining of a foreign passport on a particular date as conclusive proof that the Indian citizen had voluntarily acquired the citizenship of another country before that date, were clearly applicable. It was only when a plea was raised that a citizen had not voluntarily obtained the passport that he should be afforded opportunity to prove that fact. [404 F-H] Mohd. Ayub Khan v. Commissioner of Police, Madras, [1965] 2 S.C.R. 884, referred to.
