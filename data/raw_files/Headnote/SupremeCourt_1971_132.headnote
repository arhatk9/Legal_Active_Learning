 The appellant joined the Indian Army as a Commissioned Officer in 1942. He became a Major in 1945. The appellant's services were lent to the State of West Bengal and accordingly on 10-1-1949 the appellant was posted as Commandant of the Special Police Battalion, a post corresponding to a senior post in the Indian Police Service The appellant with his consent, was appointed to the West Bengal State Police Service on 1-7-1953. On 8th September 1954 the Indian Police Service (Recruitment) Rules, 1954, Indian Police Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954 and the Indian Police Service (Regulation of Seniority) Rules 1954 were framed by the Government of India under s. 3 of the All India Services Act 61 of 1951. On 6th June 1955 the Indian Police Service (Appointment by Promotion) Regulations 1955 were also issued under which 25% of the senior posts were allotted to the Indian Police Service cadre in each State.
 The appointment of the appellant was outside this quota. On 31st July 1958 the appellant was appointed on probation in the State Cadre of West Bengal. In December 1959 he was substantively appointed to a senior post in the Indian Police Service and confirmed thereon with effect from 21st July 1958. In December 1958 the Ministry of Home Affairs conveyed to the Government of West Bengal its decision to fix the pay of the appellant in the senior scale of the Indian Police Service nationally from 10-1-1949, the date from which he held an Indian Police Service Cadre post continuously. On 19th January 1960 the Indian Police Service (Seniority of Special Recruits) Regulations 1960 were framed pursuant to r. 5-A of the Seniority Rules. On 11-10-1960 the Government of India in consultation with the Union Public Service Commission decided to allot to the appellant the year 1948. The year of allotment was subsequently changed to 1947 on the basis that the officiation of the appellant as well as that of the junior most direct recruit, in a senior scale did not start be-fore 19th May 1951. The appellant filed a writ petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution. The Single Judge, allowing his petition, held that the date from which the appellant continuously officiated was 10-1-1949 and that accordingly the year 1943 allotted to D the Junior most direct recruit, should also be allotted to the appellant. The learned Judge also held that the first and second provisos to r. 3(3) (b) of the Seniority Rules were not applicable to the appellant.
 The Division Bench in appeal agreed with the Single Judge, that the date of continuous officiation of the appellant was 10-1-1949. But the High Court thought that the year 1947 allotted to the appellant on the basis of his officiation from 19th May 1951 could not be sustained because the latter date had been held by this Court to be irrelevant in Nim's case. Non-the-less the year of allotment 1948 575 ;assigned to the appellant in the order of 11th October 1960 was sustained because it was on an ad hoc basis. Against the High Court's order the appellant appealed to this Court by certificate. His contentions were: (i) that under the main clause of r. 3(3) (b) of the Seniority Rules the year 1943 should be allotted to him as the said year had been allotted to D the junior most direct recruit; (ii) that the first proviso to r. 3(3)(b) did not apply to him as it applied only to those in the joint cadre; (iii) that this Court should deduct the 'P' factor from the date of officiation which as held by the High Court was 10th January 1949 and allot to him the year 1943 as the year of allotment. Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD: (i) D was an Indian Police Officer recruited in 1945. He became a member of the Indian Police Service under sub-r. (1) of r. 3 of the Indian Police Service (Recruitment) Rules 1954 on the date when the said Rules came into force in 1954, and was not an officer recruited to the service in accordance with r. 7 of those Rules. The year of allotment assigned to D was not therefore available to the appellant under the main part of r. 3(3) (b).
 (ii) The first proviso to r. 3 nowhere refers or even remotely indicates "that it is only applicable to the persons in the joint cadre. In fact r. 2(1) of the Seniority Rules and the words 'State cadre' and 'joint cadre' have been defined as having the meaning respectively assigned to them in the Indian Police Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954. By reference to r. 7 of the Cadre 'Rules it is apparent that what is to be determined is the authority which is to appoint, to the respective cadres i.e. in the case of State Cadre it is the State Government and in the case of Joint Cadre it is the State Government concerned. The first proviso does not refer to any appointment to any cadre; it only deals with Regulation of Seniority and the reference to State Government concerned is for the purpose of fixing the date of officiation ad hoc in consultation with the Central Government. When there are several State Governments the consultation by the Central Government must necessarily be with the State Government concerned in relation to the officer who is appointed to the cadre of that State. Whether the first proviso applies or the second proviso applies, it is the Central Government that has to determine ad hoc, the year of allotment after approving the period of officiation in consultation with the Public Service Commission.
 (iii) In view of the judgment in Nim's case the order assigning 1947 as the year of allotment to the appellant on the basis of an arbitrary date of officiation namely 19th May, 1951 was bad and had been quite properly struck down by the High Court. The High Court however had no power 'to direct the year 1948 to be fixed as the year of allotment for the determination of the seniority of the appellant on the basis that was fixed on an ad hoc basis in an earlier occasion by the Government of India. Once the Government of India had on a memorial presented by the Appellant decided finally in supersession of its previous decision that his year of allotment was 1947, the previous decision fixed on ad hoc basis could not be revived. It was for the Government of India in consultation with the Commission to determine ad hoc the year of allotment to be assigned to the appellant in relation to the date of his continuous officiation. This Court would not trespass upon the jurisdiction of the Government of India to determine ad hoc in consultation with the Commission, on a consideration of the relevant materials, the date of the appellant's continuous officiation and assign him an year of allotment.
