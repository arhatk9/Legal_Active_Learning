 The Vegetable Oils and Oilseeds (Forward Contracts Prohibition) Order. 1119 M.E. prohibiting inter alia forward trading in cocoanut oil, was promulgated by the Maharaja of Cochin State in 1944. The Order continued in force under various Cochin Laws including Proclamation 5 of 1122 and Act 8 of 1122. When the State of Cochin acceded to India and the combined State Of Travancore-Cochin was formed, the said proclamation 5 of 1122 and Act 8 of 1122 as also the orders etc. passed thereunder were continued by the Travancore- Cochin Administration an Application of Laws Act 6 of 1125.
 In exercise of the powers under these laws the Travancore- Cochin Government promulgated on 8th March 1950, the Travancore-Cochin Vegetable Oils and Oilcakes (Forward Contracts Prohibition) Order, 1950, whereby the prohibition against forward trading in certain oils including cocoanut oil was continued. Then came the Travancore-Cochin Public Safety Measures Act 5 of 1950, which with effect from 30th March 1950 repealed a number of enactments including Proclamation 5 of 1112 and Act 8 of 1112, but by s. 73(2) continued the orders etc. passed under the repealed Acts as if they had been passed under its s. 3. The Bill relating to Act 5 of 1950 was introduced in the State Legislature before the passing of the Constitution, but thereafter it was amended by the Select Committee, and the amended Bill was moved in and passed by the Legislature in the post- Constitution period. By Amending Act 52 of 1950, the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act 24 of 1946 was extended to Part B States, and became effective in Cochin area from August 17, 1950. Section 17(4) of the last mentioned Act replealed Act 5 of 1950, but continued the orders etc passed thereunder.
 In 1952 the appellant entered into contracts for the purchase of cocoanut oil on one month's 'vaida' through the agency of the respondent who was a Pakka Adatia. The contracts were entered into in territory which formerly formed part of the State of Cochin. On the due date the appellant failed to take delivery of the goods or to pay the difference in price whereupon the respondent filed a suit for damages. The appellant's defence was that the contracts in question, being forward contracts were in contravention of the Prohibition Order of 1950 and therefore void and unenforceable. The trial court -and High Court rejected this contention and decreed the suit. The High Court took the view that the earlier laws under which the Prohibition Order of 1950 was passed were repealed by Act 5 of 1950 and the Orders thereunder could not be deemed to continue under s. 3 of the latter Act because that section Was void for non-compliance with the proviso to Art. 304(b) of the Constitution. In appeal by certificate to this Court the questions that fell for 41 consideration were : (i) whether the Prohibition Order of 1950 was void on the -round that it dealt with future markets on which Parliament had the, exclusive power to legislate; (ii) whether s. 3 of Act 5 of 1950 fell within the scope of Art. 304(b) of the Constitution; (iii) whether sanction of the President was required under the proviso to Art. 304(b) when the Bill relating to Act 5 of 1950 was moved in the Legislature after having been amended by the Select Committee.
 
HELD : (i) In the present case it was not necessary to express any opinion on the question whether the Prohibition Order of 1950 was void for want of legislative competence, for if it was void it would have to be treated as non est and the earlier Prohibition Order of 1119 would continue in force right up to 30th March 1950. Consequently on the 30th March 1950 either the Prohibition Order 1119 or the Prohibition Order of 1950 must be held to have been in force in Travancore-Cochin and to have continued in force under Act 5 of 1950.

 Firm A. T. B. Mehtal Majid & Co. v. State of Madras & Anr., [1963] Supp. 2 S.C.R. 435, distinguished (ii) An order prohibiting Forward contracts would clearly be an order prohibiting a class of commercial transactions relating to an essential article which in the present case was cocoanut oil. The conferment of power on a State Government to prohibit such transactions clearly permits imposition of restrictions on the freedom of trade or commerce and therefore falls within the scope of cl. (b) of Art. 304 of the Constitution. [49 E-F] (iii) The High Court was wrong in holding that the Bill relating to Act 5 of 1950 was again introduced and moved in the legislature after being amended by the Select Committee.
 Once the Bill was introduced was referred to the Select Committee. There was therefore no question of the Bill being introduced again after the Select Committee had sub- mitted its report. [50 C-H] The High Court was also wrong in holding that a Bill within the purview of Art. 304(b) cannot be moved without the prior sanction of the President. In the relevant articles of the Constitution whatever prohibition is laid down relates to the introduction of a Bill in the Legislature. There is no reference at any stage to a Bill being moved in a House.
 The language thus used in the Constitution clearly points to the interpretation that in the proviso to Art. 304 the word 'introduced' refers to the Bill, while the word 'moved' refers to the amendment. [52 B-C] The proviso to Art. 304(b) will have to be complied with at the initial stage of the introduction of the Bill if it is applicable at that stage, whereas compliance will be required either at the stage when amendments are moved in the Select Committee, or when the Bill with amendments as reported by the Select Committee is moved in the House for consideration, it any amendment is covered by Art. 304, because of the requirement that no amendment can be moved without the previous sanction of the President. [54 D] (iv) In the present case the original introduction of the Bill was valid because at that stage the proviso to Art. 304 was not in force at all as Sup CI/69- -4 42 the Constitution had, not yet come into force; while subsequently when the Bill was pending in the State Legislature no amendment was moved in respect of which sanction of the President was required under the proviso.
 Section 3 of Act 5 of 1950 was passed by the House as it was contained originally in the validly introduced Bill and cannot, therefore, be held to be void for non-compliance with the proviso to Art. 304. This section being valid either the Prohibition Order of 1119 or the Prohibition Order of 1950, must be held to be validly continued in force by this Act 5 of 1950 and to have continued to remain in force thereafter under the proviso to s. 17(4) of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act 24 of 1946. Under either of these orders the transactions entered into between the appellant and the respondent were prohibited and having been entered into against the provisions of law, no party could claim any rights in respect of the contracts in the suit.
