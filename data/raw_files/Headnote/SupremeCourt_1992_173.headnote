 An order of detention under the provisions of the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974 was passed by the appellant-State against the respondent's uncle. The detenu filed a writ petition in the High Court at Calcutta challenging the detention order. The High Court passed an order granting temporary injuction restraining the appellant from detaining the detenu but upon consideration of the counter-affidavit filed by the appellant vacated the order of injunction.
 Thereafter the respondent, a nephew of the detenu, filed a writ petition before the High Court at Madras, which allowed the same on the ground that there had been inordinate and unexplained delay in the implementation of the detention order.
 In the appeal before this Court on behalf of the appellant-State, it was contended that the High Court was not justified in exercising its extraordinary powers to restrain the execution of the detention order.
 On behalf of the respondent, it was contended that between the date of passing the order and the filing of the writ petition before the High Court at Calcutta, the detenu had regularly appeared before the concerned Magistrate and there was no satisfactory explanation for the failure of the authorities to detain him under the detention order and that the live and proximate link between the grounds and purpose of detention had been snapped by the undue and unreasonable delay.
 Allowing the appeal, this Court 588 
 HELD: The delay in the execution of the detention order passed against the detenu, upon which the High Court at Madras founded the relief it gave, had already taken place by the date writ petition was filed by the detenu at Calcutta. That the delay had taken place was, obviously, known to the detenu, who himself was the writ petitioner in Calcutta. Nonetheless, the point of delay was not taken in Calcutta. It was taken only after the High Court at Calcutta had vacated the interim injuction restraining the appellant from executing the detention order when the writ petition was filed by the respondent in the High Court at Madras subsequently. That a writ petition had been filed in Calcutta challenging the detention order was mentioned, both in the writ petition at Madras and in the reply filed thereto. In these circumstances, the High Court was not justified in exercising its discretion to issue the high prerogative writ of mandamus to direct the appellant to forbear from executing the detention order passed by it.[591 B-D] The Additional Secretary to the Government of India & Ors. v.
