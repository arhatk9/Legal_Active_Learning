 The Appellants were allotted 18,000 fully paid up shares in a company in consideration of transferring 6,000 acres of agricultural land to the company for cultivation of sugar-cane. After a petition was filed for winding up the company, two joint Liquidators were appointed and they took steps to settle the list of contributories. 'While these proceedings were pending an application was filed by Respondent No. 1 praying that an enquiry be made in respect of the price paid by the Appellant for the 6,000 acres of land. It was urged that such enquiry would show the value of the land to be well below the consideration for which the shares were allotted and that the Appellants would therefore be liable as contributories in respect of -the difference.
 The company Judge held that in a proceeding for winding up and while settling the list of contributories it was not open to go behind the transaction entered into at the time of the formation of the company and that the consideration which had been freely accepted by The company could not be challenged as being inadequate in the absence of any allegation of fraud However, the Division Bench, in appeal, held that an inquiry would be necessary as there was an indication that the allottees of the shares had paid only a fraction of the nominal value.
 On appeal to this Court, 
 HELD:Allowing the appeal, It cannot he disputed that a shareholder of fully paid up shares will not be placed on the list of contributories or made to contribute towards the assets of the company unless the register is rectified and it is determined in appropriate proceedings that he is not a fully paid up shareholder. No steps were taken by the liquidators to have the register rectified or the contract entered into by the company with the appellants avoided by means of appropriate proceedings. Even in the application filed by respondent No. 1 there was Do allegation of fraud. The facts stated related more to inadequacy of price or consideration and not to its being illusory or the like. The learned single judge was therefore right and the Division Bench was in error in directing an inquiry into the question whether the appellants bad paid consideration which was inadequate.
