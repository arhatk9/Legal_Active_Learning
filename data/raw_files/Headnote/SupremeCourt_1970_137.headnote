 The appellants filed a suit for demages in respect of defamatory statements alleged to have been made by the respondents, who were members of Parliament, on the floor of the Lok Sabha during a calling attention motion. The High Court dismissed the suit holding that no proceedings could be taken in a court of law in respect of what was said on the floor of Parliament in view of Art. 105(2) of the Constitution. However, it certified the case as fit for appeal to this Court under Art. 133 (1) (a) of the Constitution.
 It was contended on behalf of the appellants by reference to the observations of this Court in Special reference No. 1 of 1964 dealing with the provisions of Art. 212, that the immunity under 'that Article was against an alleged irregularity of procedure but not against an illlegality, and contended that the same principle should be applied in the present case to determine whether what was said was outside the discusion on a calling attention motion; that the immunity granted by Art. 105(2) was to what was relevant to the business of Parliament and not to something which was irrelevant.
 
HELD : The Articleconfers immunity inter alia in respect of "anything said..........in Parliament". The word "anything" is of the widest import and is equivalent to 'everything'.
 The only limitation arises from the words 'in Parliament' which means during the siting of Parliament and in the course of the business of Parliament.. Once it was proved that Parliament was sitting and its business was being transacted, anything said during the course of that business was immune from proceedings in any court. [615 E] Obiter : Under the Rules of this Court an appeal has to be lodged after the certificate is granted and a notice of lodgment of the appeal is taken out by the appellants to inform the respondents so that they may take action considered appropriate or necessary. After service of notice this Court treates the appeal as properly lodged and can proceed to hear it when time can be found for hearing.
 The notice which is issued is not a summons to appear before the Court; it is only an intimation of the fact of the lodgment of the appeal. It is for the party informed to choose whether to appear or not. Summonses issue to defendants, to witnesses and to persons against whom complaints are filed in a criminal court. If a summons issues to a defendant and he does not appear the court may take the action to be undefended and proceeding ex parte may even regard the claim of the plaintiff to be admitted. This consequence does not flow from the notice of the lodgment of the appeal 613 in this Court. The Court has to proceed with the appeal albeit ex parte against the absent respondent. If a summons is. issued to a witness or to a person complained against under-the law relating to crimes, and the witness or the person summoned remains absent after service a warrant for his arrest may issue.
