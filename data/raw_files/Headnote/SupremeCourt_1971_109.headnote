 The appellant imported consignments of contraband and prohibited goods. He was prosecuted for an offence under s.
 167, item 81. of the Sea Customs Act, 1878, on a complaint by the appropriate authority under s. 187A, and was convicted.
 On the question whether s. 187-A violated Art. 14 of the Constitution on the grounds; (1) that the Customs authorities had an absolute discretion to proceed either under s. 167(8); in which case there would be only an imposition of a fiscal penalty and confiscator of goods; or to file a complaint in the criminal court, under s. 187A for the offence under s. 167 item 81, in which case there could also be a sentence of imprisonment up to two years. and (2) the customs officials have a wide latitude in choosing cases for criminal prosecution, 
HELD (1) the proceedings under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act. 1947,unlike under the sea customs Act could be taken in the alternative and the punishment could also be imposed in the alternative' Any person guilty of contravention of s. 23(1)(a) of that Act could not be made liable for a penalty under s. 23(1) (b) also to prosecution and imprisonment under s. 23(1) (b)Therefore s. 23D, which empowers the Director of Enforcement of file complaint instead of imposing a penalty under s. 23(1)(a) only if he was satisfied that in, the circumstances of a case a penalty under s. 23(1)(a)a would be inadequate, was necessary to prevent arbitrary exercise of discretion by the Director under. that Act. Such a provision however, is not necessary under the Sea Customs Act, because, if a person is found guilty under s. 167, item 8, and if his case is also covered by item 81, there is no choice in the matter of imposing penalty or punishment. A penalty can be, imposed under item 8, and he will also be liable to criminal prosecution under item 81. [3-63B-F; 364X-B] Reyala Corporation (P) Ltd. v. Director of Enforcement, New Delhi, [1971] 1 S.C.R. 639, referred to.
 (2) It cannot be said that s. 187A confers an unguided power on the customs' authorities for not filing a complaint against a person although he was liable to a criminal prosecution under s. 167, item 81.
 While deciding whether a complaint should be instituted for an offence which is covered both by items 8 and 81 of a.
 167, a customs officer must take into *count the enormity and magnitude of the contravention, the evidence which is available , and whether the evidence is sufficient to take the matter to a criminal court: The officers who are authorised to make a complaint under s. 187A are senior officials holding responsible positions 360 and they have to act in a reasonable and bonafide manner.
 They cannot discriminate between similar cases according to their whim and fancy. The power conferred by the section is to be exercised for effectuating the object and purpose of the Act keeping in view the entire scheme of the Act to ensure that goods do not escape the levy of duty and that the prohibitions and restrictions imposed on importation and exportation are rigidly en forced.
