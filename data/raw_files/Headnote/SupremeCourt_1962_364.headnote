 In 1930 the respondent assessee was employed as an officer- assistant in a partnership concern on the basis of a contract for three years. The agreement provided that the firm might terminate the contract after giving the assessee one calendar month's notice of its intention to do so.
 Subject to his work being satisfactory. the assessee, like other assistants employed in the firm, expected to become a partner of the firm one day. The assessee continued in the employment of the firm and his contract of service was renewed from time to time. In 1947 the firm decided to re- organise its business and with that end in view two limited companies were floated, Killick Industries Ltd. which was a public limited company, and Killick Nixon and Company, a private limited company, which was to take over the business previously carried on by the partnership. On December 29,1947, the respondent received a notice from the firm stating that in view of the changes proposed the assessee's employment with the firm would terminate as from January 31, 1948. The new company Killick Industries Ltd., agreed to take over the services of the assessee and on February 1,1948, he entered their employment. The partnership firm transferred their assets to the new companies and received shares of the new companies in lieu thereof. All the members of the covenanted staff in the partnership firm were given shares of Killick Industries Ltd., free of payment, and the assessee received an allotment of 1,700 shares of the face value of Rs. 2,21,000/-. The assessee's case was that the shares were given by the partnership to the members of the staff as compensation for loss of employment resulting from premature termination of their services. The Income-tax Officer, however, sought to bring the shares of the value of Rs. 2,21,000/- to tax on the footing 164 that the shares were allotted to the assessee in consideration of past services. The Appellate Tribunal held on the evidence before it that the payment was made solely as compensation for loss of employment, and was not liable to tax in view of Explanation 2 to s. 7 (1) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922. It was contended for the Commissioner of Income-tax that under the Explanation, the word "compensation" meant what was payable or compellable at law as compensation, and any payment received by an assessee from his employer or former employer was profit received in lieu of salary, and that judged from that point of view, the payment of Rs. 2,21,000/- to the assessee was not compensation solely for loss of employment.
 Held (Raghubar Dayal, J., dissenting), that the expression "compensation for loss of employment" in Explanation 2 to s.
 7 (1) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, referred to any payment made, whether under a legal liability or voluntarily, to compensate or act as a Solatium for the loss of employment suffered by the employee, and was not restricted to compensation which was payable or compellable at law; and that the payment of Rs. 2,21,000/., found by the Tribunal to be a payment made solely as compensation for loss of employment was not liable to tax, because the Explanation excepted such payment from being treated as a profit received in lieu of salary.

 Per Das, Kapur and Sarkar,JJ.-No distinction could be made between compensation for loss of employment and compensation for loss of prospects rooted in that employment. if e object of the payments was unrelated to the relation between the employer and employee, it would not fall within the expression "profit received in lieu of salary" in Explanation 2.
 Per Raghubar Dayal,J.-(1) Any sum paid by an employer or former employer to an employee at the termination of his services would be a "payment made solely as compensation for loss of employment" only when it was made in consideration of what the employee could claim as such compensation under law or the terms of the contract of service. In the present 165 case, the assessee's services were terminated by giving one months's notice in accordance with the service contract. He had no claim for compensation. The payment of Rs.
 2,21,000/by his employer firm could not therefore be said to have been made as compensation for loss of employment.
 (2)The payment was made by the firm as employer to the assessee as employee and was received by the latter a day before termination of his services. The sum therefore came within the language of the first part of Explanation 2 to s.
 7 (1) and amounted to "profits in lieu of service."
