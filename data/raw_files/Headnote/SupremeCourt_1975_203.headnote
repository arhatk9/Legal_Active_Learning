 The first appellant was a partnership firm constituted under a deed of partnership dated December 3, 1953. The firm was registered as a dealer under the Bombay Sales Tax Acts of 1953. and 1959. The firm consisted of five partners appellants two to five and one other who died in 1965. The firm used to carry on business at Bombay as importers and commission agents and also. as wholesale dealers in chemicals, dyes and various other goods. It had been assessed by the Sales Tax authorities form the period from July, 1953 to March 31, 1958 on the basis of the returns filed by it. On November 10, 1960, the Sales Tax officer seized a number of documents from the office of the firm. on May 20 1962, the firm was dissolved. On June 26, 1962 the Sales Tax officer canceled the firm's registration certificate under the Central Sales Tax Act as well as the registration certificate, authorisation and licence under the Bombay Sales Tax Act which the partners of the firm had surrendered. On November 20 1963, the Sales Tax officer issued two notices to the firm, one asking for elucidation of certain items in the books of accounts seized, and the other under sec. 15 of the 1953 Act calling upon the firm to show cause why the assessment already made for the period April 1, 1957 to March 31, 1958 should not be opened. On August 31, 1965, the Sales Tax officer passed five orders, all against the dissolved firm: the first was a re- assessment order for the year April 1. 1957 to March 31, 1958 on the ground that certain sales and purchases during that period had been concealed and the other four were assessment orders for subsequent years covering the period from April 1, 1958 to March, 1961. on these five orders a total sum of Rs. 6,56,365/47p. was found due from the firm.
 On October 22, 1965, the demand notices issued upon these assessment orders all in the name of the dissolved firm, were affixed to the premises in which the firm had its office before it was dissolved.
 On November 24, 1965, the appellants filed a writ petition in the High Court of Bombay challenging the orders of re-assessment and assessment on various grounds. In view of the fact that the appeals filed by the firm before the Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax were pending, the High Court did not decide the question whether the Procedure prescribed by law was followed in the assessment proceedings and whether the orders were justified on merits. The only question which the High Court considered was whether the impugned orders were without jurisdiction as having been passed against a dissolved firm. By its judgment dated December 8, 1969, the High Court rejected the contention of the firm and held that in view of the provisions contained in the Bombay Sales Tax Acts of 1953 and 1959, it was permissible to assess a dissolved firm.
 Dismissing the appeal by special leave, ^ 
 HELD: (per Chandrachud and Sarkaria, JJ.) (i) In Jullunder Vegetables Syndicate case[1965] INSC 233; , [1966] 2 S.C.R. 457 this Court held: (1) A dissolved firm cannot be assessed to sales tax unless the statute under which the assessment is made authorises the assessment either expressly or by necessary implication; (2) If, by definition, a firm is a dealer under an Act, it becomes a legal entity or an independent assessable unit for the purposes of that Act. If that be so, the firm ceases to be a legal entity on dissolution 690 and thereafter, on principle it cannot be assessed to sales tax unless the statute so authorises expressly or by necessary implication. (3) Neither a provision requiring a dealer to inform the authorities if it discontinues its business, nor a provision imposing a joint and several liability on the dealer and its partners for the payment of tax, penalty or any other amount due under the Act or rules can be interpreted as conferring jurisdiction to assess a dissolved firm. and (4) In interpreting a fiscal statute the court cannot proceed to make good the deficiencies, if any, in the statute: it shall interpret it in a manner favourable to the tax payer. The language of a taxing Act cannot be strained in order to hold a subject liable to tax. 1694 D, 695 C-E] Khushi Ram Behari Lal & Cd. v The Assessing Authority, Sangrur and Another, (1967) 19 S.T.C. 381; Additional Tahsildar, Raipur and Ors. v. GendalaI,(1968) 21 S.T.C. 263, and Lalji v. The Assistant Commissioner, Sales Tax, Raju.
 (1958) 9 S.T.C. 571 referred to.
 (ii) The provisions of the Bombay General Clauses Act apply to the interpretation of the Bombay Acts unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context of the Act of 1953. There is no repugnancy between the definition of dealer in section 2(6) which is defined to mean any 'person' who carries on the business of selling or buying goods and definition of 'person' in s.3(35) of the Bombay General Clauses Act, 1904 and, therefore, the word 'person' in s.
 2(6) must be taken to include a 'body of individuals' that a firm is. S. 24 of the Act which provides that every dealer who is liable to pay tax and who is an individual Hindu family, an association or a club. society, firm of company, shall send to the prescribed authority a declaration stating the name or the person who shall be deemed to be the manager of such dealer's business furnishes a strong indication for saying that the framers of the Act intended to recognise the firm as a legal entity. This section will be meaningless in its reference to a firm, unless the fundamental assumption of the provision was that a firm as distinct' from its partners is an independent assessable entity.[696 C-Fl (iii) Since the Act of 1953 considers a partnership firm to be a legal entity, on the dissolution of the firm its legal personality would cease to exist. On the firm ceasing to have existence in the eye of law, there can be no assessment of the firm as such for, in the absence of an express statutory provision or a clear statutory intendment, a dead person cannot be assessed.

 (iv)S. 5(3) shows that if a firm has incurred the liability to pay sales-tax, that liability continues until the cancellation of the registration. Again, it is a clear and necessary implication of s. 15(1) of the Act of 1953 that even a dissolved firm can be assessed or re-assessed within the period mentioned therein. S. 15(1) contains an important clause that action thereunder can be taken by the.
 Collector after giving a notice to the assessee under s.
 14(3) of the Act within the prescribed period. Once such a notice is given, the Collector gets the jurisdiction to assess or re-assess the amount of tax due from the dealer and all the provisions of the Act "shall apply accordingly as if the notice were a notice served under s. 14(3)" S. 15A conferring analogous powers to assess or re-assess a dealer for taxes due prior to November 21, 1956 when the States were recognised if any turnover had escaped assessment and provisions of sub-sections 3(i) and 3(ii) of S. 26 providing that when a firm liable to pay the tax is dissolved. it shall be liable to pay the tax on the goods allotted to any partner "as if" the goods had been sold to such partner unless he holds a certificate of registration or obtains it within the prescribed period are in the scheme of the Act that the assessment of a dissolved firm is within the clear intendment of the statute. [697 H, 639 C, E, 700 A-B, F] (v) Though equitable construction may be admissible in relation to other statutes or other provisions of a taxing statute, such a construction is not admissible in the interpretation of a charging or taxing provision in a taxing statute.

 (vi) Under the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1959 also provisions of section 2(11) and 2(9) respectively containing the definition of "dealer" and "person" make it clear that a firm is a distinct assessable entity. The joint and several liability Of the partners in respect of taxes which the firm is liable to pay is provided by s.18. The purpose of s.
 19(3) is to make the parners jointly and severally liable, even if the firm is assessed to sale tax after its dissolution. S. 15(3) would otherwise be otiose. S. 19(3) of the 1959 Act makes explicit what was implict in the Act of 1953. The Act of 1959 contains provisions in sections 35, 35A and 62 which are similar to those provisions which are contained in sections 15, 15A and 35 of 1953 Act. [703 H, 704 A, D, 705 B-C] The Sales Tax officer (XIX) Enforcement Branch Bombay v. K.M.S. Mari Chettiar (1975) 35 S.T.C. 148 approved.
 Per Gupta J. (Dissenting) (1) A firm is a seperate legal entity and a distinct assessable unit under the Acts of 1953 and 1959. Neither the 1953 Act nor the 1959 Act contains any provision permitting assessment or recovery proceedings being taken against a dissolved firm. It is open to the Legislature by a legal fiction to keep alive a dissolved firm for some definite purpose, but here the legislature has not chosen to do so.
 No provision similar to that contained in s. 189(1) of the Income-Tax Act, 1961 is to be found in either of these two Acts. [708 H, 711 G, 713 & 714 A] (ii) 'Dealer' has been defined in the Acts as a person who carries on the business of selling or buying goods. S.
 15 o the 1953 Act which deals with escaped assessment or under-assessment requires the collector to serve a notice on the dealer concerned before proceeding against him but where the dealer was a firm dissolved before the notice was issued, there is no person carrying on the business of selling or buying goods on whom, notice can be served. S. 35 of the 19591 Act is similar to s. 15 of the 1953 Act. A dissolved firm may be equated with a dead person both cease to be assessable units. [706 H, 709 D-H. 710 A, 714 B] (iii) S.19 (3) of the 1959 Act which makes the erstwhile partners jointly and severally liable for the tax due from a dissolved firm does not say that assessment or recovery proceedings may be initiated or continued against a firm as such even after its dissolution. It is not permissible to read in this provision the additional words "as if the firm exists". To provide that the tax due from a.
 firm may be assessed or collected after its dissolution is not the same thing as allowing the assessment or recovery proceeding to be started or continued against the dissolved firm. The power of assessing a dissolved firm is no to be mixed up with the liability of the partners. [710 E-F, 711- B] The provisions relating to the assessment or recovery of the lax including provisions requiring service of notice on the assessee would, in the case of a dissolved firm, apply to the erstwhile partners and all proceedings intended against the firm most be taken against them.
