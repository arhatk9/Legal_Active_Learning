 K.and his wife purchased the house in dispute. K died in 1936 leaving behind him S and R, his son. In 1951, R mortgaged the house to the appellant. The. appellant obtained a preliminary decree for foreclosure and also the final decree In the meantime, S. gifted the entire house to Prakash Chandra son of R. He thereafter, frustrated several attempts of the appellant to execute the decree and in 1956, instituted a suit against the appellant and another for a declaration that the preliminary and final decree of foreclosure were not binding on him and prayed for a perpetual injunction against the appellant. The suit was dismissed but he appealed. The appeal court partly allowed his appeal holding that he was the owner of half share in the house by virtue of the gift and issued all injunction in his favour. The appellant filed a second appeal in the High Court and Prakash Chandra also filed a cross-objection in respect of his half share. Both the appeal and the cross- objection were dismissed by the High Court The fourth execution application filed by the appellant was dismissed on June 23,1956. The fifth execution application was filed by the appellant on July 28, 1964 for possession of half of the house. The respondent objected to this application on the ground of limitation. the objection was disallowed by the execution court and by the appeal court.It was however held by the High Court and the application was dismissed as time barred. Hence this appeal. 3 points were raised by the appellant before this Court-(1) Limitation is saved by cis. 1, 2 & 4 of Art. 182 (ii) Limitation is saved by cl. 5 of Art. 182 and (iii) the fifth application for execution was really an application to revive the fourth execution proceeding and therefore, it was not time dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) It is plain that neither the decree of the appeal court nor the decree of the High Court reversed, varied or amended in any manner the final foreclosure decree of the appellant. The foreclosure decree remained intact and fully alive. It could be executed against the respondent according to its tenor. He could be ejected from the whole house. But it could never have any effect against Prakash Chandra's (the respondent's son) paramount title to a half share in the house. Prakash Chandra's appeal and the High Court decree passed in his appeal would not fail within cls.
 2 & 4 of Art. 1 82 and would not furnish a fresh starting point of limitation for executing !the foreclosure decree against the respondent-judgment debtor. Bkawanipur Banking Corporation Ltd. v. Gori Shanker Sarma [1950] SCR 25 referred to. [498 A-B, C] (ii)In order to get the advantage of Cl. 5 of Art. 182, the appellant has to satisfy 3 conditions:- (a)the written statement filed in respondent-son's suit and in were appeal were an "application" (b) the Court where respondent-son's case and appeal, and wherein the appellant's second appeal was file were the proper court, and (c) Proceedings specified in (a) are a step in aid of execution of the decree sought to be executed by the appellant. [498 D-F] (iii)To oppose Prakash Chandra's suit, the appellant had filed a written statement. The written statement ordinarily does not include any request to the court and it is not an 'application' within the meaning of Cl. 5 of Art.
 182. [499 C-D] 495 (PannaLalv.Smt.Saraswati Devi AIR 1960 Ali 572 and Kartar Singh v. Sultan Singh Partap Singh A.I.R. 1967 Punjab 375, distinguished.) (iv) Further, even if the suit and appeal was instituted in the proper court, the written statement filed by the appellant was not an application and therefore, he cannot take advantage of Cl. 5 of Art. 182. As the appellant's appeal in the High Court was not an application to the Proper Court it is unnecessary to decide whether in the suit and in the appeal filed by Prakash Chandra the written statement of the appellant and his resistance to the appeal and his second appeal in the High Court amounted to a step- in-aid in execution of the decree sought to be executed by him. [500 A-D, 503H-504 A] (v)The fifth application for execution was not a continuation of the previous application because the previous application was dismissed for not paying the process fee etc. and it was not a pending application. (504 D-E] Dissenting per Goswami J.-The appellant was faced with resistance from the respondent and his relations. The appellant made abortive attempts to execute tile mortgage decree in order to obtain possession of the suit property.
 Having failed to obtain Possession by usual civil process the appellant applied for police kelp which was rejected.
 Further, the respondents' son dragged the appellant to a suit which became, another obstacle to the execution of the decree for possession of the suit property. Further, the partly accepted appeal of the judgment debtors son by the appellate Court changed the character of the original foreclosure decree which the appellant could execute.
 Further. because of injunctions restraining the appellant from executing the fore closure' decree in full the original foreclosure decree in the form it was, was not capable of execution. [517 C-E, 518 D] Maharaja Sir Rameshwar Singh Bahadur v. Homeshwar Singh (1921) 40 Madras Law Journal 116, referred to.
 Therefore, the decree the Civil suit No. 75A of 1957 had a direct and immediate connection with and effect upon the decree in suit No. 27A of 1952 sought to be executed. The nexus between the two is manifestly clear. It was obvious that the appellants' successive ecphractic actions in defending the foreclosure decree in different ways until its final determination in the High Court were all "Steps in aid of execution" of his foreclosure decree and therefore, the appellants' fifth execution application was within time, being within 3 years from the date of the final order in the High Court on January 1, 1962.
