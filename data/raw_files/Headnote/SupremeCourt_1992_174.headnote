 The respondent in the appeal was tried for the murder of his wife and also for stealing his mother-in-law's property. The prosecution alleged that the respondent accused used to demand money from his mother-in-law through his wife and he had executed two promissory notes for Rs.
 2,000 and Rs.3,000 in favour of his mother-in-law towards the money he had borrowed from her. He became disgruntled when his mother-in-law refused to comply with his demands, and his wife declined to help him in getting more money. As a consequence he started abusing, ill-treating and assaulting his wife. A few months before the occurrence the mother-in-law brought her daughter and her children to her house. After sometime the accused also came to reside at the house of his mother-in-law.
 On January 12, 1979, a close relation of the mother-in- law came to their house at 4 p.m. On that day apart from the accused, his wife and two children, the mother-in-law and her younger daughter were present in the house. The accused gave Rs. 30 to his wife which she further gave to her mother for buying clothes for the children so that they could wear the same on the ensuing `Sankranti' festival.
 The mother-in-law and her younger daughter went to the market to buy clothes for the children. Thereafter, the accused gave Rs. 2 to the relative and sent him to the market to bring `heralikayi'-a vegetable. Therefore the accused was left alone in the house with his wife and two small children. When his mother-in-law and her younger daughter came back from the market they found the two children crying outside the house. On entering the house they did not find anybody 580 inside, and on further search they found the dead-body of the wife in the bathroom, her head ducked in the bucket full of water.
 A case was registered with the police. The accused was found absconding, and was arrested on January 16, 1979. The accused was put up for trial. There was no direct evidence.
 The prosecution relied on the motive as disclosed by P.W.26, the mother-in-law, P.W.27 her younger daughter, and PWs 24 and 25. The presence of the deceased and the accused in the house of P.W. 26 on the evening of January 12, 1979 as deposed by P.W.17 the relative and P.W. 26 and P.W.27. The accused sending P.W.17, P.W.26 and P.W.27 to the market for purchasing of clothes and vegetable and the deceased being left alone with the two small children. The accused going towards the bus stop holding his suit-case in his hand on the evening of January 12, 1979 as seen by P.W.14 and corroborated by P.W. 20 and P.W.22, and the conduct of the accused in absconding from the evening of January 12, 1979 till he was apprehended on the night of January 16, 1979.
 The Trial Court relying on the evidence of P.W.25, P.W.
 26 and P.W.27 came to the conclusion that the accused used to maltreat and assault his wife because she refused to get money for him from her mother, and that the evidence of P.W.17, P.W.26 and P.W.27 proved the circumstance that the accused manipulated to send the three witnesses out of the house on the pretext of buying clothes and vegetable from the market. Accordingly, the Trial Court convicted the accused under Section 302 IPC and sentenced him to imprisonment for life, but acquitted him of the charge under Section 380 IPC.
 The accused appealed to the High Court and a Division Bench set aside the order of conviction, and acquitted the accused. It held that there was variance in the evidence of P.W.26 and P.W. 27, and found contradiction in the statement of P.W. 26 and the F.I.R. Ex. P1, and concluded that the prosecution has not succeeded beyond reasonable doubt to establish that the accused had managed to send P.W.26 and P.W.27 out of the house at that point of time.
 Allowing the State's appeal, reversing the High Court judgment and restoring the Trial Court judgment, this Court, 
 HELD : 1. The High Court fell into patent error in rejecting the 581 testimony of P.W.26 and P.W.27. Even if there is any contradiction on a non-material point that is no ground to reject the whole of the testimony of the witnesses. The High Court did not make any effort to read the statements of P.W.26 and P.W.27 and appreciate the same. [585E] 
 2. According to the High Court the discrepancy in regard to the number of `Heralikayis' was sufficient to reject the testimony of P.W.17. The material part of the testimony of P.W.17 is that he was sent to the market to buy `Heralikayis' whether they were two, three or six was not material. In any case the discrepancy is so minor that it cannot render the testimony of P.W.17 unworthy of acceptance. The High Court was therefore not justified in rejecting the evidence of P.W.17 on a flimsy ground. [585F] 
 3. The trial court relying upon the testimony of P.W.14, P.W.20 and P.W.22 came to the conclusion that the circumstance relied upon by the prosecution to the effect that the respondent was going towards bus stand holding suit-case in his hand at about 6.30 p.m. on January 12, 1979 was proved. There is no discussion, not even mention.
 [585H] 
 4. The High Court has also not discussed the circumstance that the respondent was absconding till the night of January 16, 1979 when he was arrested which is surely a link in the chain of circumstances to establish that the respondent alone had committed the offence of murder of his wife.
 [586B] 
 5. The High Court judgment is patently perverse and is set aside. The judgment of the trial court is restored.
 The respondent is convicted under Section 302 IPC and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life. [586C]
