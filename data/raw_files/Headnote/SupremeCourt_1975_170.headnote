 On the question, whether when a domestic inquiry held by an employer was found by the labour court as violative of the principles of natural justice there Was any duty cast upon that court to give an opportunity to the employer to adduce evidence afresh before it and whether failure to do so would vitiate its ^ 
 HELD: When a case of dismissal or discharge of an employee is referred for industrial adjudication the labour court should first decide as a preliminary issue whether the domestic enquiry has violated the principles of natural justice. When there was no domestic enquiry or defective enquiry is admitted by the employer, there will be no difficulty. But when the matter is in controversy between the parties that question must be decided as a preliminary issue.On that decision being pronounced it will be for the management to decide wether it will adduce any evidence before the labour court. If it chooses not to adduce any evidence, it will not be thereafter permissible in any proceeding to raise the issue. Three will be no justification for any party to stall the final adjudication of the dispute by the labour court by questioning it, decision with regard to the preliminary issue when the matter, if worthy, can be agitated even after the final award. It will be legitimate for the High Court to refuse to intervene at this stage. [368C-E] Workmen of Motipur Sugar Factory (private) Limited v.
