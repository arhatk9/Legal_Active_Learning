 A gift of immovable property under s. 10 of the Estate Duty Act, 1953, will be dutiable unless the donee assumes immediate exclusive and bona fide possession and enjoyment of the subject-matter of the gift, and there is no beneficial interest reserved to the donor by contract or otherwise, that is, (1) the donee must have bona fide assumed possession and enjoyment of the property which is the subject matter of the gift to the exclusion of the donor, immediately upon the gift, and (2) the donee must have retained such possession and enjoyment of the property to the entire exclusion of the donor or of any benefit to him by contract or otherwise. The two conditions are uncumulative and unless each of these conditions is satisfied the property would be liable to estate duty. The second part of the section has two limbs, namely, that the deceased must be entirely excluded (a) from the property, and (b) from any benefit by contract or otherwise. The word 'otherwise' should be construed ejusdem generis and should be interpreted to mean some kind of legal obligation or some transaction enforceable at law or in equity which, though not in the form of contract may confer a benefit on the donor. The words 'by contract or otherwise' however, do not control the words 'to the entire exclusion of the donor'.
 In order to attract the section, consequently, it is not necessary that the possession of the donor of the gifted property must be referable to some contractual or other arrangement enforceable at law or in equity. Even if the donor is content to rely upon the mere filial affection of his sons with a view to enable him to continue to reside in the house, where the subject matter of gift is a house, it cannot be said that he was 'entirely excluded from possession and enjoyment' within the meaning of the first limb of the section and, therefore, the property will be deemed to pass on the death to the donor and will be subject to levy of estate duty. [691C-692A] In the present case, the deceased owned two buildings and some agricultural land. He was carrying on the business of boarding and lodging in one of the buildings. In March, 1955, he executed a document, described as a partition deed, whereby he gave possession of that building to his sons and retained for himself the other house and agricultural land.
 In June, 1955 he entered into an agreement with his sons by which they ]eased to their father their house, wherein, as before, he continued to carry on his business of boarding and lodging. The rent fixed however was not paid in cash but only entries in books were made. The deceased died on April 6, 1957. The Assistant Controller under the Act held that the house in which the business was carried on was liable to be taken into account for assessing the estate duty and included it in the estate of the deceased. On appeal to the Board of Direct Taxes it was held that the document of March 1955 was not a partition deed; that the house was gifted by the deceased to his sons; that the deceased continued to be in undisputed possession of the building, that the donor (deceased) had not been excluded from the enjoyment and possession of the property; and that therefore, estate duty was payable in respect of that property under s. 10. On reference to the High Court on the question whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the entire value of the building or any portion of its value was liable to be included in the estate of the de- ceased as property deemed to have passed on his death, the High Court proceeded on the assumption that the document was a gift deed, that possession and enjoyment of the building were not retained by the sons of the deceased, and held that therefore it followed that only the value of the right to possession and enjoyment in the bands of the deceased, as a lessee, that would pass on his_death and would attract duty.
 686 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The entire value of the property was liable to be included in the estate of the deceased as property deemed to have passed on his death. [701F] (1) Section 10 would have to be construed for the purpose of this case as it stood before its amendment by the Finance Act, 1965, that is, without the second proviso. [691B-C] (2) If a gift comprises the full ownership of the property not shorn of any right including tenancy right in favour of third parties, immediate bona fide physical possession and enjoyment of the gifted property must ordinarily be assumed by the donee and retained thereafter to the exclusion of the donor. in order to prevent the incidence of estate duty. In case, however, the subject matter of the gift is property shorn of certain rights in the property, the residue of the rights in the property would be the subject-matter of gift, and, in such an event it may not sometimes in the very nature of things, be possible for the donee to assume Physical possession and enjoyment of the property. In such cases, the possession and enjoyment of the gifted property which may be assumed by the donee would only be such as is possible under the circumstances. [697D-F].
 In the present case, the property which was the subject matter of the gift was the entire building with all the rights. The gift was not subject to any claim or reservation. The donees had assumed possession and enjoyment of the entirety of the gifted property, but such possession and enjoyment of the building was not, subsequent to the gift, retained by the donees 'to the entire exclusion of the donor or of any benefit to him by the contract or otherwise'.

 [1973] 89 ITR 251 referred to, (3) Section 10 does contain the words 'to the extent' which are not found in the corresponding section of the New South Wales Act. The words 'to the extent' connote that if the donee does not assume immediate bona fide possession and enjoyment of a part or fraction of the gifted property and thenceforward retain it to the entire exclusion of the donor or of any benefit to him by contract or otherwise, it shall be that part or fraction of the gifted property which shall be deemed to pass on the death of the donor. [699F-G] In the present case, it was the ownership of the entire property which constituted the bundle of rights and the view urged on behalf of the respondent and accepted by the High Court that the estate duty was payable only in respect of the value of the right to possession and enjoyment in the hands of the deceased as a lessee of the building runs counter to the plain language of the section.

 (4) The basis on which the High Court and Board of Direct Taxes proceeded makes it unnecessary to remand the case for finding whether the deed of March 1955, constituted a deed of partition. [701D-E]
