 Section 17-B of the Industrial Disputes Act 1947 came into force with effect from August 21, 1984. It provided that where in any case, a Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal by its award directs reinstatement of a workman and the employer prefers any proceedings against such award in a High Court or the Supreme Court the employer shall be liable to pay such workman during the pendency of such proceedings in the High Court or the Supreme Court, full wages last drawn by him, if the workman had not been employed in any establishment during such period.
 The Labour Court in its award dated September 28, 1983 held that the termination of services of the appellant, was wrongful and illegal and that he was entitled to be reinstated with continuity of service. It directed that the appellant would be entitled to back wages at the rate at which he was drawing them when his services were terminated.
 The management challenged the award on January 31, 1984 by filing a writ petition before the High Court. On December 12, 1984 the appellant moved an application under s. 17-B of the Act for a direction to the management to pay him full wages last drawn by him during the pendency of the writ petition. The High Court held that the section was applicable only to cases where the awards were passed after its commencement, and since the award in this case was passed prior to August 21, 1984 the section had no application.
 170 In this appeal by special leave it was contended on behalf of the management that a section which imposes an obligation for the first time cannot be made retrospective.
 Such sections should always be considered prospective.
 Allowing the appeal, the Court, ^ 
 HELD : 1. Section 17-B applies even to awards passed prior to August 21, 1984 if they have not become final. It gives a mandate to the courts to award wages where the following three ingredients are present: (i) the Labour Court has directed reinstatement of the workman, (ii) the employer has preferred proceedings against such award in the High Court or the Supreme Court, (iii) the workman has not been employed in any establishment during such period.[181 E; 176 A; 174 E] 
 2. Section 17-B is a progressive social beneficial legislation. It codifies in a statutory form a right available to the workmen to get wages. There are no words in the section to compel the court to hold that it cannot operate retrospectively. The section on its terms does not say that it would bind awards passed prior to the date when it came into force. Before s. 17-B was introduced there was no bar on courts for awarding wages. The workmen, of course, had no right to claim it. The section recognises such a right.[176 D; 181 C-D; 176 C; 181 D] 3.(i) The objects and reasons of the Industrial Disputes (Amendment) Act, 1982 clearly spell out that the delay in implementation of awards was due to the contests by employers which consequently caused hardship to workmen. The enactment intended to do away with this hardship by providing for the payment of wages to the workman from the date of the award till the final disposal of the case. If that be the object then it would be inconsistent with the progressive social philosophy of our laws to deny to the workman the benefits of s. 17-B simply because the award was passed, for example, just a day or two before it came into force. It would be not only defeating the rights of the workmen but also going against the spirit of the enactment.[175 F; 176 G; 175 D-E, F-G] (ii) The Court has to evolve the concept of purposive interpretation. Though objects and reasons cannot be the ultimate guide in interpretation of statutes, it often times aids in finding out what really persuaded the legislature to 171 enact a particular provision. The Court should give such construction to a statute as would promote the purpose or object of the Act. [176 D; 175 E-F; 176 F] (iii) Where the words of a statute are plain and unambiguous, effect must be given to them, but where the intention of the legislature is not clear from the words or where two constructions are possible, it is the court's duty to discern the intention in the context of the background in which a particular section is enacted. Once such an intention is ascertained, the Courts have necessarily to give the statute a purposeful or a functional interpretation. [176 E-F] 
 4. Section 11-A confers a jurisdiction on the Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal to act in a particular manner which jurisdiction it did not have prior to the coming into force of s. 11-A. The conferment of a new Jurisdiction can take effect only prospectively except when a contrary intention appears on the face of the statute.
 That is not the case with s. 17-B. It does not confer a new jurisdiction. [181 A-C] Workmen of Firestone Tyre & Rubber Co. of India Pvt.
