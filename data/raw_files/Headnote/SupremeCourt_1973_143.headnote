 Under the Standing Order for the Watch and Ward staff of the appellant, a permanent workman' is one 'who has completed a probationary period of two months as such and is employed on a permanent post;' and 'a probationer' is a workman 'who is provisionally employed to fill a permanent vacancy and has not completed two months service.' A watchman was appointed by the appellant on probation for a period of 6 months. His period of probation was extended, and during the extended period, his services were terminated. 'Mere was an industrial dispute and the questions, (1) whether the termination was legal or justified. and (2) to what relief the workman was entitled, were referred to the Labour Court. The Labour Court held that. the order of discharge was neither mala fide nor an act of victimisation; but set aside the order of discharge and directed reinstatement of the employee on the view that the term regarding 6 months probation in the employee's letter of appointment was in contravention of the Standing Order and was invalid.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court.
 
HELD : (1) The Labour Court has not travelled beyond the terms of reference, because, the validity or invalidity of the discharge depends on the validity of the term regarding 6 months' probation. [437D-E] (2) Since, according to the Standing Order, a workman s all not be kept on probation for more than 2 months, the letter of appointment (or special agreement) is inconsistent with the Standing Order to the extent of the additional 4 months' probation. [437E-G] (3) The inconsistent part of the agreement is ineffective and unenforceable. [439F] (a) To uphold the special agreement Would mean giving a go- by to the principle of three party participation. in the settlement of the terms of employment, incorporated in the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946. The 'Act gives effect to the new thinking that Society has also an interest in the settlement of the terms of employment of industrial labour. While formerly there were two parties at the negotiating table-the employer and the workman it is now thought that there should also be present a third party, namely the State', representing society. The Certifying Officer tinder the Act, as the statutory representative of society, adjudges on the fairness or reasonableness of Standing Orders after considering and weighing the social interest in the 435 Claims of the employer and, the demands of the workmen. The special agreement, in the instant case, in, so far as it provides for additional 4 months of Probation, contravenes the Standing Order. [439A-E] (b) The terms of employment specified in the Standing Order would prevail over the corresponding terms in the contract of service in existence on the enforcement of the Standing Order. If a prior agreement inconsistent with the Standing Orders will not survive, an agreement posterior to and inconsistent with the Standing Order should also not prevail.

 (c) Section 6B(1) of the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act deals with a settlement arrived at by agreement between the employer and workmen otherwise than in the Course of conciliation proceeding. Sub-section (2) provides that after the settlement is arrived at, the parties to the settlement or any one of them may' apply to the Conciliation Officer for registration of the settlement. In the context of sub-s. (3) the word 'may' should be read is 'shall'.
 Subsection (3) provides that while considering the question of the registration of a settlement, the conciliation officer shall examine whether it is inexpedient to do so on public ground affecting social justice or whether the settlement has been brought about as result of collusion, fraud or misrepresentation. In the present case, the Conciliation Officer having had no say in the making of the special agreement the consent of the employee is meaningless.[439F440A] (4) It is true that a Labour Court may determine terms and conditions of employment which may be inconsistent with a Standing Order; but in the present case, the reference did not give any such jurisdiction to the Labour Court to determine the terms and conditions of employment of the workman. [44OB-C] (5) (a) The appellant did not plead in its written statement before the Labour Court that the work of the discharged employee was unsatisfactory during the probationary period, not did it lead any evidence in proof of the unsatisfactory work. The argument was also not raised in the Special leave petition. Therefore, the appellant could not be permitted to raise the contention that since the discharge was occasioned by the unsatisfactory work of the employee the Labour Court should not have ordered reinstatement. [440E-F] (b) The Labour Court may interfere with an order of discharge not only when it was made mala fide or as a.
 measure of victimisation, but also when it finds that it was arbitrary or capricious or so unreasonable as to lead to the inference that it was not, made bona fide. In the present case as there was no plea and no evidence to show that the work of the employee was unsatisfactory, the conclusion is obvious that the order of discharge is arbitrary.
