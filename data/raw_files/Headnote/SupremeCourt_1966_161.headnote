 The second appellant purchased from the Himachal Pradesh Government the right to extract and collect certain medicinal herbs from the forests of Chamba District. The period of agreement was one year from September 1, 1960.
 Under an arbitration clause in the agreement all disputes between the parties were to be referred to the Deputy Commissioner, Mandi District Himachal Pradesh. The second appellant transferred all his rights under the agreement to the first appellant with the consent of the State of Himachal Pradesh. Disputes arose between the parties in October 1950. On May 30, 1952 the appellants addressed a letter to the Chief Conservator of Forests Himachal Pradesh requiring that officer to submit the matters in difference to the arbitration of the Deputy Commissioner, Mandi District. By his reply dated June 23,,1952, the Chief Conservator declined to agree to a reference contending that the matters desired to be referred were outside the arbitration clause. On June 22, 1955 the appellants applied to the District Court of Chamba for an order that the agreement be filed in Court and that the disputes between them and the State be referred to the sole arbitration of the Deputy Commissioner, Mandi District. The State of Himachal Pradesh contended, inter alia that the application for filing the arbitration agreement was barred by the law of limitation as the right to apply if any arose in the year 1950 and not on June 23, 1952 as alleged. The Court of First Instance held in favour of the appellants. In appeal the Judicial Commissioner reversed the order of the trial court. In the view of the Judicial Commissioner an application for filing an arbitration agreement under s. 20 of the Arbitration Act was governed by Art. 181 of the Limitation Act 1908, and since the period of three years prescribed thereby commenced to run from the date on which the differences arose between the parties i.e., about the month of September October 1950, and in any case on September 1, 1951, the application for references filed by the appellants was barred.
 
HELD: The Judicial Commissioner was in error in rejecting the application of the appellants for filing the arbitration agreement as barred under Art. 181 of the Limitation Act, 1908.
 (i) The terms of Aft. 181, though general and apparently not restricted to applications under the Code of Civil Procedure have always been interpreted as so restricted.
 There is a catenate of authorities holding that in Art. 181 the expression "under the Code of Civil Procedure" must be deemed to be necessarily implied. [305 H] Hansraj Gupta and Ors. v. Official Liquidators of the Dehradun Mussoorie Electric Tramway Co. Ltd., L.R. 60 I.A.

 304 If Art. 181 of the Limitation Act, 1908 only governs applications under the Code if Civil Procedure for which no period of limitation is provided in the schedule an application under the Arbitration Act, 1940 not being an application under the Code of Civil Procedure, unless there is Some provision, which by express enactment or plain intendment to the contrary-in the Arbitration Act, will not be governed by that Article. [307 E] (ii) Section 37(1) of the Arbitration Act, 1940 which makes the provisions of the Indian Limitation Act, 1908 applicable to arbitrations as they apply to proceedings in court, does not govern an application for filing an arbitration agreement under s. 20 of the Arbitration Act. The section deals only with the authority of the arbitrator to deal with and decide any dispute referred to him : it has no concern with an application made to the court to file an arbitration agreement to refer a dispute to the arbitrator.
