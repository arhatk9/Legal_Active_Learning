 The appellant-company was appointed as 'Managing Agent' and Secretary & Treasurer' respectively by two independent and separate public limited jute mills companies. These jute mills had their registered office at Calcutta and additional places of business in several parts of the country including Kendupatna in the State of Orissa and were registered as 'dealers' under the orissa Taxation (on Goods carried by Road and Inland Waterways) Act, 1959. The appellant-company did not do any business nor had any place of its business in any part of the State of Orissa. . But the appellant-company looked after the work of storing jute of the two jute mills in their godowns at Kendupatna in the State of Orissa. The Assistant Tax-officer passed ex-parte assessment orders against the appellant-company on the business of stocking, storing and carrying jute by boats of the jute mills in the State of Orissa on the basis that the appellant-company was a `dealer' (as agent of both the jute mills) within the meaning of s. 2(5) read with the Explanation thereto of the Act. The Assistant Commissioner of Taxes dismissed the appeal and Commissioner of Taxes dismissed the revision petition filed by the appellant-company against the assessment orders. In a writ petition, the High Court negatived the contention of the appellant-company that it was not a dealer. In this appeal, the appellant- company contended: (I) that in order to be deemed to be a dealer under s. 2(5) read with Explanation thereto a manager or an agent of a dealer must reside or have a place of business in the State of Orissa and since the appellant-company did not have any such place of business in the State of Orissa it was not a dealer under that section, and (2) that the jute companies (Principals) were not non-resident dealers' as required by the Explanation to s. 2(5) since each one had a place of business of its own in the State of Orissa.
 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: The appellant-company was a dealer within the meaning of s. 2(S) read with the Explanation thereto of the Orissa Taxation (on Goods carried by Road and Inland Waterways) Act, 1959. [876 E] 866 Under the Explanation to s. 2(5) of the Act, the manager or agent of a 'dealer' who resides outside the State is also deemed to be a 'dealer' for the purpose of the Act irrespective of whether he resides inside or outside the State. The artificial definition of a 'dealer' under the Explanation is merely an enabling provision which facilitates the assessment against a non-resident dealer but the provision does not require that the manager of the agent should have either a residence or a place of business within the State of Orissa. There is nothing either in the main definition or in the Explanation to suggest that the manager or agent of the dealer (Principal) should have his own business within the State of Orissa before he could be proceeded against or assessed under the Act. All that the Explanation requires is that the manager or the agent should store such goods of the non-resident `dealer' within the State of orissa but that does not mean that for such purpose the manager or the agent either reside or have a place of business within the State of orissa; even if he carries out the operation of storing the goods and carrying the same by.
 motor boats within the State of Orissa from outside the State it would suffice. [871 G-H; F; 872 B-C] In the instant case, it is true that during the relevant period it was the jute companies (the Principals) who carried on their jute business at Kendupatna within the State of Orissa and that the appellant-company had n business of its own anywhere in that State but it was looking after the business of the Principals as their agent at Kendupatna and such business included the operation of stocking or storing of jute in their godowns at Kendupatna and carrying the same by motor boats. [871 C-D] In respect of an artificial person like a company the test to determine its residence will have to be considered in the context of the law prescribing the criteria in that behalf. So far as law of taxation is concerned, ordinarily the residence of a company will be at the place where the actual management of the company is carried on and that if this is done at several places it may have a dual residence but in that case at least some part of the superior and directing authority of the company must be present at the place where its residence is sought to be established. [873 A; 874 F-G] Palmer's Company Law (23rd-Ed.) Vol. I at pages 101 to 103, referred to.
 The test of residence is not registration, but where the company docs its real business, where the central management and control abides. It is the actual place of management of the company and not the place where it ought to be managed which fixes its residence. [875 B] Buckley on the Companies Act (14th Edn.), Vol. I at pages 299; Egyptian Delta and Investment Co. v. Todd., [1929] A. C. I and De Beers Consolidated Mines v. Howe, [1906] A. C. 455 referred to.
 In the instant case both the principals (the jute companies) had their registered offices in Calcutta (West Bengal), that their principal businesses were carried on in Calcutta (West Bengal) and that the Central management and 867 control of the businesses was done from Calcutta. It is true that these two Jute companies had storage equipment and godowns at Kendupatna in the States of Orissa but on their own showing (vide Certificates of Registration) at Kendupatna they had 'additional places of businesses'. As the central management and control of the two companies' businesses obtained in Calcutta (West Bengal), the two jute companies would be non-resident dealers in the State of orissa. [876 A-D]
