 According to s. 2(2) of the Finance Act, 1964, where the total income of an assessee includes. any income chargeable under the head 'salaries' income-tax and super-tax payable by the assessee on the salary portion shall be the proportionate amount payable according to the rates provided in the Finance Act, 1963. Under s. 2 of the Finance Act, 1963, income-tax was to be charged at the rates specified in Part I of the First Schedule and super-tax at the rates specified in Part 11 of that Schedule. The income-tax was to be increased, in certain cases mentioned, by a surcharge and additional surcharge for the purpose of the Union and a special surcharge.
 The assessee's main source of income was salary. For the previous year 1963-64 the Income-tax Officer levied surcharge and additional surcharge in accordance with the rates prescribed by the Finance Act, 1963. The assessee contended that under s. 2(2) of the Finance Act, 1964 there was no mention of surcharge and hence only income-tax, which was to, be worked out at the rates applicable under the Finance Act, 1963, was payable. The Department and the Tribunal held that 'income-tax' included ,surcharge. On reference, the High Court held that the words 'income-tax' in s. 2(2) of the Finance Act, 1964, would not include 'surcharge" and 'additional surcharge' and held in favour of the assessee.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) Surcharge was levied for the first time by the Indian Finance Act, 1940. It was omitted in some later Finance Acts but was reintroduced in the Finance Act of 1951 and continued thereafter. The phraseology employed in the various Finance Acts showed that the word ,surcharge' has been used to either increase the rates of income-tax and super-tax or to increase those taxes. Under s. 2 of the Finance Act, 1971, the provisions of s. 2 and of the First Schedule to the Act, 1970, shall apply in relation to income-tax for the assessment year commencing on the first day of April 1971. Section 2 of the Finance, Act 1971, speaks only of income-tax and not of any surcharge and, it is only in the modifications made in the Schedule to the Finance Act, 1970, that there is pro-vision for a surcharge.
 Thus, the legislative history of the Finance Acts, as also the practice, indicates that the term 'income-tax' as employed in s. 2 of the Finance Act, 1964, includes 'surcharge' as also 'the special and the additional surcharge' whenever provided. [312G-H; 313A-H; 314 A-B] (2) One of the meanings of surcharge is to charge in addition or to subject to an additional or extra charge. If that meaning is applied to s. 2 of the Finance Act, 1963, it would lead to the result that income-tax and super-tax were to be charged. in four different ways or at 4 different rates which may be described as, (a) the basic charge or rate, (b) surcharge, (c) special surcharge, and (d) additional surcharge calculated in the manner provided in the Schedule. Rest in that way the additional charges formed a part of the income-tax and super-tax. According to Art 271 notwithstanding anything in Arts. 269 and 270 Parliament may at any time increase any of the duties or taxes referred to in those 310 Articles by a surcharge for the purpose of the Union and the whole proceeds of any such surcharge shall form part of the Consolidated Fund of India. The word 'surcharge' has been used in this Article only for the purposeof separating it from the basic charge of tax or duty, for the purpose of distributing the proceeds of the same between the Union and the States. [315 A-E] (3) Obiter. The legislative power of Parliament to levy taxes and duties is contained in Arts. 245 and 246(1), read with the relevant countries in List I of the Seventh Schedule. Entry 82 in List relates to taxes on income other than agricultural income. Income-tax, super-tax and sur- charge would all fall under this entry. It is in exercise of this legislative power that Parliament enacts the provisions relating to them in the Finance Act of each year.
 Sections 4 and 95 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, only provide that where any Central Act enacts that income-tax and super -tax shall be charged for any assessment year at any rate or rates income-tax and super-tax at those rates shall be charged in accordance thereto and subject to the provisions of the Act. The therefore, the distinction made by the High Court that surcharges are levied only under the Finance Act and income-tax under the Income-tax Act may not hold good.
