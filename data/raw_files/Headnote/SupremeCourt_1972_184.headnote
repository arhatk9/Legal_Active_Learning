 Six persons, three of whom were partners of B-firm having a selling agency of S-company, and three others who were partners of J-firm having quota rights in the S-company, formed a partnership the BJ-firm. There was, no deed of partnership and the partnership of the BJ-firm was terminable at will. The B-firm continued to exist carrying on various other business activities. The BJ-firm was appointed as managing agents of the S-company. Later, the three persons belonging to B-firm went out of the BJ-firm and for doing so, they were paid a sum of money which included compensation as per the terms of an agreement between the B and J groups. The BJ-firm continued as ,he managing agents of the S-company. The appellant, B-firm, in appeal to this Court, while admitting that the portion of the compensation which represented profits was a revenue receipt, contended, that the remaining portion purporting to be made up of compensation for giving up (a) its mianaging agency rights, (b) its selling agency rights, and (c) its, goodwill, was not a revenue receipt but a capital receipt.
 
HELD : The entire sum reecived by the appellant was a revenue receipt assessable under s. 10 of the Income Tax Act, 1922. [938F-G].
 (1) The question whether a particular receipt is capital or revenue is largely a question of fact. [935A] (2 ) (a) The BJ-firm was not a partnership of two firms because two firms cannot join in a partnership, but was really a partnership consisting of six partners. The appellant-firm had various business activities one of which was to join the BJ-firm to carry on certain business activities. The appellant's representatives by entering into the partnerG; 937D-E ship were merely carrying on a trading activity. [935F-H; 937A-D-E] (b) The managing agency rights as well as any goodwill vested with the BJ-firm. By going out of the BJ-firm the partners representing the appellant-firm had surrendered their rights in the partnership to the remaining partners and obtained payments for surrendering their rights. it was a case of cancellation of a contract which had been entered into the ordinary course of business, and not one of parting with any managing agency right. The payment received in settlement as a result of the termination, of the contract represents the profits which the assessee would have made had the contract been performed.

 929 (c) It was not a case of the only trading activity of the appellantfirm coming to an end. Only one of its trading activities had been put an end to and hence, the amount received could not be considered as compensation for stopping its business. [937E-F] Therefore, the compensation paid for the termination of the contract is not a capital receipt. [937F] (3) (a) The selling agency of the appellant firm bad been transferred to the BJ-firm even at the time when the BJ-firm was formed. On the day when the partners of the B-firm left the BJ-firm it was an asset of the BJ-firm and hence the compensation paid could only relate to the termination of the contract of partnership and not to the transfer of sell- ing agency. [937F-G] (b) Assuming that indirectly the selling agency right of the appellant firm was affected, it was only one of several trading activities of the appellant firm and the trading structure of the assessee-firm was not at all affected. The appellant-firm merely replaced one trading activity by another by utilising the compensation for acquiring controlling shares in two other companies. In such cases.
 the amount received for the cancellation of an agency, does not represent the price paid for the lose of a capital asset, but is in the nature of income. [937G-H; 938A] Gillanders Arbuthnot and Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income- tax, Calcutta, 53 I.T.R. 28B, and Kettlewell Bullen and Co.
