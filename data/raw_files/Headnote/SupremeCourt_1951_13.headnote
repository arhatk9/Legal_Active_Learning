 The revisional jurisdiction conferred on the High Court under s. 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not to be lightly exercised when it is invoked by a private complain- ant against an.order of acquittal, against which the Govern- ment has a right of appeal under s. 417. It could be exer- cised only in exceptional cases where the interests of public justice require interference for the correction of a manifest illegality or the prevention of a gross miscarriage of justice. This jurisdiction is not ordinarily invoked or used merely because the lower Court has taken a wrong view of the law or misappreciated the evidence on the record.
 Shipowners had an organisation in Calcutta called the Calcutta Liners' Conference and the seamen had an organisa- tion 285 called the Joint Supply Office. As a result of a collective agreement between the owners of the ships and the sea- men's representatives, the Calcutta Maritime Board which contained an equal number of members representing the Cal- cutta Liners' Conference and the Joint Supply Office was established. The seamen presented themselves before this Board and were given muster cards which permitted them to appear at the musters where the captains of the ships en- gaged seamen. For meeting the office expenses of the Board the owners used to pay Rs. 2 per seaman engaged and after engagement each seaman paid Re. 1 to the owner as his con- tribution towards these expenses. The accused was the secretary of the Liners' Conference and an ex officio honor- ary joint secretary of the Maritime Board, and a seaman filed a complaint against him that, as he had collected Re.
 1 from him for the issue of a muster card he had committed an offence under s. 26 (2) of the Indian Merchant Shipping Act:
 Held, that the seamen to whom the master cards were given by the Maritime Board were not "engaged or supplied" by the Board or by any of its officers, nor was the sum of Re. 1 which was levied out of the seaman's wages after he signed an agreement of employment, remuneration received for providing the man with employment, and the accused was not guilty of any offence under s. 25 or s. 26 of the Act.
