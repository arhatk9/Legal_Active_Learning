 The petitioner in his three writ petitions under Art.
 32 challenged the detention orders made against his father, sister and brother under the Conservation of Foreign exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act 1974.
 On the basis of intelligence reports, the customs officials searched the room of the Hotel where father and daughter-Venilal D. Mehta and Pragna Mehta were staying. The search led to the recovery of 60 gold biscuits of foreign origin from the suit case belonging to the daughter. Since both of them had no valid document to prove the nature Or import of the gold biscuits to..
 698 India and for their legal possession, there was contravention of the Customs Act, 1962 and the Gold Control Act, 1960, and, therefore, liable for confiscation. Both were arrested and statements recorded.
 In the meanwhile Bharat Mehta, another son of the father, -detenu who had come from Calcutta to arrange for bail was arrested on 4th May 1984 by the Central Excise and Customs Officials after his room in the Hotel, was searched and Indian currency notes amounting to Rs. 24,865 were seized, which he allegedly had brought for meeting the legal expenses for securing release of his father and sister on bail. All the three were remanded to jail custody. They retracted their statements made before the Central Excise and Customs Officers alleging that they were made at the dictates of the customs officers.
 Pragna Mehta was served with a detention order under the Conservation of foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act 1974 under s. 3(1) (iii) on 20th June 1984 and was served with the grounds of detention in English language. Hindi translation of the grounds of detention was served on 30th June, 1984. Venilal Mehta and his son Bharat Mehta were served with detention orders under s. 3(1) (iii) and (iv) of the Act on 20th June, 1984 and on 1) 25th June, 1984 the grounds of detention were also served on them. The grounds of detention were in English language while some of the accompanying documents were in Malayalam.
 The detenus made representations for the revocation of their detention. They appeared before the Advisory Board on 6th August, 1984. The advisory Board reported that there was sufficient cause for detention of the detenus and accordingly the Govt. confirmed their detention Orders on 13th August, 1984.
 All the three detention orders have been challenged contending: (1) that the grounds were not communicated to the detenus in a language understood by them, (2) that the retraction of the confessions or statements made under s.
 108 of the Customs Act, 1962 had not been taken into consideration, (3) that there was delay in serving the grounds upon the detenus, (4) that the detenus were not allowed to be represented properly before the Advisory Board, (5) that the fact of retraction of the confessions having not been taken into consideration the proceedings were vitiated, and (6) that the detaining authority did not independently consider the representations of the detenus but mechanically followed the advice of the Advisory Board.
 Dismissing the Petitions, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The procedural safeguards have been complied with as far as practicable. There are no merits in the fancied grievances of the detenus .[732] 
 2. Article 22 of the Constitution ensures protection against arrest and detention except in certain prescribed circumstances and conditions. Art. 22(4) 699 stipulates that no law providing for preventive detention shall authorise the detention of a person for a longer period than three months unless (a) Advisory Board has reported before the expiration of the said period of three months that there is in its opinion sufficient cause for such detention and (b) such person is detained in accordance with the provision of any law made by the Parliament under sub-cls. (a) and (b) of cl. (7). [618D-G] Clause (5) of Art. 22 provides that the grounds of detention must be communicated to the detenu as soon as may be and that he should be afforded the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order. There. fore, it must follow as an imperative that the grounds must be communicated in a language understood by the person so that he can make an effective representation. [719; 72013-C] Harikisan v. The State of Maharashtra & Others, [1962] 2 Supp. SCR 918. C In the instant case, the facts revealed that the detenu Vanilal Mehta was constantly accompanied and was in the company of his daughter as well as his son-both of whom knew English very well. The father signed his mercy petition in Gujrati which was written in English, accepting the guilt of his involvement in smuggling. There is no rule of law that common sense should be put in cold storage while considering constitutional provisions for safeguards against misuse of powers by authorities though these constitutional previsions should be strictly construed. He was in any event given by 30th June 1984 the Hindi translation of the grounds of which he claimed ignorance. The gist of annexures which were given in Malayalam language had been stated in the grounds. That he does not know anything except Gujrati merely ipse dixit of father -detenu and is not the last word and the Court is not denuded to its powers to examine the truth The Court is not the place where one can sell all tales. The detaining authority came to the conclusion that he knew both Hindi and English. It has been stated so in the counter-affidavit.
 The circumstances indicate that father -detenu was merely feigning ignorance of English [720C-H; 720 A-B] In the instant case, the grounds were given on 20th June, 1984 following the search and seizure of gold biscuits from room of detenu Venilal Mehta in the Hotel in his presence and in the background Or the mercy petition, he was in constant touch with his daughter and sons and there is no evidence that these people did not know Hindi or English.
 Indeed they knew English as well as Hindi. It is difficult to accept the position that in the peculiar facts of this case, the grounds were not communicated in this sense the grounds of detention were not conveyed to the detenu Venilal. Whether grounds were communicated or not detenu upon the fact and circumstances of each case. [712 D-F] Hadibandhu Das v. District Magistrate, Cuttack & Anr.

 700 4 Article 22(5) of the Constitution has two elements (i) communication of the grounds on which the order of detention has been made and (ii) opportunity of making representation against the order of detention. Communication of the grounds pre-supposes the formulation of the grounds and formulation of the ground requires and ensures the application of the mind of the detaining authority to the facts and materials before it that is to say to pertinent and proximate matters in regard to each individual case and excludes the element of arbitrariness and automatism. [725E- G] 
 5. The "ground." under Art 22(S) of the Constitution do not mean mere factual inferences but mean factual inferences plus factual material which led to such factual inferences The concept of'grounds'., therefore' has to receive an interpretation which will keep it meaningfully in tune with the contemporary notions of the realities of the society and the purpose of the Act in question in the light of concepts of liberty and fundamental freedom guaranteed by Art. 19(1) 21 and 22 of the Constitution[725-H; 726 A-B] Smt.

 6. A democratic Constitution is not to be interpreted merely from a lexicographer's angle but with a realisation that it is an embodiment of the living thoughts and aspiration of a free people. The concept of "grounds" used in the context of detention in Art. 22(5) of the Constitution and in sub s. (3) of s.3 of COFEPOSA therefore has to receive an interpretation which will keep it meaningfully in tune with a contemporary notion. While the expression "grounds" for that matter includes not only conclusion of facts but also all the "basic facts" on which those conclusions were founded, they are different from subsidiary facts or further particulars or the basic facts.[726C-E] Hasmukh S/o Bhagwanji M. Patel v. The State Of Gujarat 
 In the instant ease the grounds of detention is the satisfaction of the detaining authority that with a view to preventing the detenu from acting in any manner prejudicial to the conservation or augmentation of foreign exchange or with a view to preventing the detenu from inter alia, dealing in smuggled goods otherwise then by engaging in transporting or concealing or keeping the smuggled goods or engaging in transporting or concealing or keeping smuggled goods the detention of the detenu us necessary This satisfaction was arrived at an inferences from several factors. One of them is that the retraction from the statements made in the confession or statements under s. 108 of the Customs Act had not been taken into consideration by the detaining authority while passing detention order. The question is whether even if the facts stated in the confession are completely ignored then the inferences can still be drawn from other independent and objective facts mentioned in this 701 case , namely , the fact of seizure of 60 gold biscuits from the suitcase of the daughter in the presence of the father which indubitably belonged to the father and admitted by him to belong to him for which no explanation has been given and secondly the seizure of the papers connected with other groups and organisations to whom gold has been sold by the father are relevant grounds from which an inference can reasonably be drawn for the satisfaction of the detaining authority for detaining the detenus for the purpose of Sec.
 3(1) (iii) and 3(1)(iv) The impugned order cannot be challenged merely by the rejection of the inference drawn from confession. [726E-H; 727A-C] 7.(i) The Court is not concerned with the sufficiency of the grounds. It is concerned whether there arc relevant materials on which a reasonable belief or conviction could have been entertained by the detaining authority on the grounds mentioned in s. 3(1) of the Act. Whether other grounds should have been taken into consideration or not is not relevant at the stage of the passing of the detention order. If that in the position then in view of s. 5A of the Act there was sufficient material to sustain this ground of detention. [727D-E] (ii) When detention under s. 3 Or the Act is only for the purpose of prevention of smuggling and all the grounds , whether there are one or more , would be relatable only to various activities of smuggling and no other separate ground which could deal with matters other than smuggling could be conceived of because the act of smuggling covered several activities each forming a separate ground of detention and the Act dealt with no other act except smuggling , Whenever allegations of smuggling were made against a person who was sought to be detained for preventing further smuggling there is bound to be one act or several acts with the common object of smuggling goods which was sought to be prevented by the Act.' It would , therefore , not be correct to say 1 that the object of the Act constituted the ground for detention. In the instant case , however , the authorities concerned came to the conclusion that the detenus were engaged in smuggling , in support of the same they relied on several factors namely: (1) the search and seizure and recovery of 60 gold biscuits , (2) the fact that the importation of the 60 gold biscuits could not be explained by the detenu Venilal , (3) the secretive manner in which the said gold biscuits were kept and (4) the connection with the various dealers and the statements of the employees of the dealers that the father and the sons used to come with gold bars. These materials were in addition to the statements and concessions made under s. 108 of the Customs Act by the father , the sons and the daughter. So even if the statements made by the n are ignored and obliterated , the other facts remain and these are- good enough materials to come to prima facie belief that detention of the detenus was necessary.
 State Or Gujrat v. Chamanlal Manjibhai Soni [1981] INSC 5; [1981] 2 SCR 500 followed.
 In the instant case , there was no request for consultation with the Advocate. There is no case of non- production of the detenu in spite of intimation by the Advocate to the Customs Officers before a Magistrate. The confessional statement was not the only fact upon which the detaining authority had passed an order. In the premises even if the confessional statements which were ret- 702 racted as such could not be taken into consideration , there are other facts independent of the confessional statement which can reasonably lead to the satisfaction that the authorities had come to.
