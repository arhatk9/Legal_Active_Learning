 The petitioners who were Appraisers in the Customs Department filed a writ petition under Art. 32, challenging the validity of the 'rotational system as applied in fixing the seniority of Appraisers and Principal ap. praisers. The system, as laid down in the relevant departmental circulars was that vacancies occurring in the cadre of Appraisers were to go alternatively to 'promotees' and 'direct recruits'.
 According to the petitioners this resulted in inequality, especially in view of the fact that the number of direct recruits over the years was very low. Promotion to the grade of Principal Appraisers was from the cadre of Appraisers; only those who had served as Appraisers for five years were entitled to be promoted to the higher grade Since the direct recruits had to wait for five years before they could become Principal Appraiser the promotees below them who had put in five years as Appriasers became' Principal Appraiser,%. In order to restore the seniority of the direct recruits thus-lost, -the rotational system was applied to the cadre of Principal Appraisers also Ie. one vacancy was to go to a promotee and the other to a direct recruit. The plea of inequality in violation of Art. 16(1) of the Constitution was raised by the petitioners in respect of this also.
 
HELD : (i) There is no inherent vice in the principle of fixing seniority by rotation in a case when a service is composed in fixed proportion of direct recruits and promotees. Any anomalies that may have resulted on account of insufficient recruitment of direct recruits in the past could not be a ground for striking down the system itself.

 (ii) The same however, cannot be said when the rotational system is applied to the recruitment of Principal Appraisers. The source of recruitment for these is one only, namely, the grade of Appraisers. There is no question of any quota being reserved from two sources in their case.
 In so far therefore as the Government was doing what it called restoration of seniority of direct recruits in Appraisers grade on their promotion to the higher grade it was clearly denying equality of opportunity. [605 C-G]
