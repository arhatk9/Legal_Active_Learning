 The respondents were convicted and sentenced under 8.
 302 read with s. 34 I.P.C. for having caused the death of one Rajinder Kumar by assaulting him with knives and ballams (spears). The F.I.R. was lodged within an hour of the occurrence and the Investigating officer reached the spot within three hours of the lodging of the F.I.R. and immediately thereafter examined, among others, PWs 1 and 2 who were eye witnesses to the occurrence. According to the post-mortem report the deceased had sustained one stab wound, one incised wound, two lacerated wounds and two abrasions. The central evidence against the respondents consisted of the statements of PWs 1, 2 and 3 which was accepted by the trial court.
 The respondents preferred an appeal to tho High Court which acquitted them inter alia on the ground that there was inconsistency between medical and ocular evidence inasmuch as the respondents who were alleged to have been armed with sharp cutting weapons like knives and ballams could not have caused the lacerated wounds and abrasions; that the explanation given by PWs 1,2 and 3 in their statements that the lacerated wounds and abrasions had been caused by the deceased having been struck by the lathi portion of the ballams was an after thought since there was no mention in the F.I.R. of the fact that ballams had been used like lathis; that the evidence of witnesses PWs 1 and 3 could not be relied upon as they were interested witnesses; and that the circular, stance that PW 2 was called from the house of his uncle three hours after the occurrence indicated that he was not present at the scene of the crime and therefore his evidence also could not be relied upon.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: 1. An F.I.R. is not supposed to contain minute details of an incident; it is merely meant to narrate in brief the facts which led to the incident, viz., the place of occurrence, the names of assailants, etc. [891 C-D] In the instant case the High Court was not justified in coming to the conclusion that the statements of eye witnesses regarding the deceased having 886 been assaulted with the lathi portions of the ballams was an afterthought just because there was no mention in the F.I.R.
 Of the fact that ballams had been used like lathis. There was no occasion for the complainant to have mentioned such detailed facts as to how the various arms were wielded and in what manner and to what extent. The witnesses had clearly explained in their statements that the accused had plied and struck the deceased with the lathi portions of the ballams on the front side and this was fully corroborated by the medical evidence which showed that the two lacerated wounds were on the right side of the front portion of the head.
 Thus far from being inconsistent the ocular evidence fully corroborated the medical evidence. It can safely be presumed that the copies of statements recorded by the Investigating officer had been supplied to the respondents long before the trial started. If there was any omission in their statements regarding the fact that ballams were used as lathis, it is inconceivable that the defence would not have drawn the attention of the witnesses to this omission which would have disclosed a manifest defect in the prosecution evidence.
 Further, the Investigating officer had categorically denied the suggestion that the statements of witnesses had been recorded after the receipt of the post-mortem report. [891 H, 892 A, 890 F-H, 891 A-B] 
 2. The mere fact that witnesses are interested is. no ground for throwing out their evidence overboard. All that is necessary is that in such cases, the evidence of the witnesses should be examined with caution and, having done that, if the court feels that the evidence does not suffer from any other legal or factual infirmity, there is no reason to distrust the evidence of such a witness. The evidence of an interested witness is not like the evidence of an approver which would need corroboration and the rule of caution cannot be confirmed in a straitjacket. [894 F-G] In the instant case the High Court rejected the evidence of PWs 1 and 3 on the sole ground that they were interested and did not enter into the intrinsic merits of their evidence. [889 E] The High Court was also not justified in rejecting the evidence of PW 2 who was an independent witness. lt is not disputed that PW 2 used to remain at his fodder shop and sleep there and he was therefore the most competent witness to see the occurrence. There is no inherent improbability in the statement of PW 2 that, being terrified by the incident, he had gone to the house of his uncle from where he was called by the Investigating officer. The circumstances that he was called from the house of his uncle three hours after the occurrence and was not found to be present at his shop cannot lead to the conclusion that he could not be present there at the time of the occurrence.
