 The appellant had made a contract with its Italian suppliers for 200,000 lbs. of cotton fibre for August, 1950, shipment and another for 300,000 lbs. for Novermber/December, 950, shipment. On July 22, 1950, the appellant entered into a contract with the respondent for the sale Of 40,000 lbs. of fibre, August shipment. On August 9, 950, it entered into another contract with the respondent for sale of 50,000 lbs.
 of fibre, "I October/November 1950 shipment ". In the remarks column of the second contract it was mentioned: " This contract is subject to import licence and therefore the shipment date is not guranteed ". In October, 1950, 50,000 lbs. out of the first contract with the Italian suppliers arrived; Out Of this 40,000 was delivered to the respon-, dent against his first contract and 10,000 against the second The balance Of 40,000, lbs. against the second contract was not 846 supplied. The respondent filed a suit for damages for breach of contract. The appellant contended that it was not liable as. the date of shipment was not guaranteed and as it had adequate contracts with its suppliers to cover the contract with the respondent but was unable to fulfil it as the supplier failed to make the deliveries.
 Held, that the appellant was liable for breach of contract as the date of shipment was guaranteed and as the appellant had no adequate contracts with its suppliers to cover the contract with the respondent. In commercial contracts time is ordinarily of the essence of the contract. The words in the remarks column meant that the date of shipment was not guaranteed only to the extent that delay in obtaining the import licence stood in the way of keeping to the shipment date. As there was no delay in obtaining the licence the shipment date October/November, 1950, was guaranteed. The other terms of the contract also showed that the date of shipment was guaranteed. The appellant had to show that on the date of the breach i.e. on December 15, 1950, it had a contract under which it could, provided the contract was not broken, obtain the goods to honour its agreement to sell October/November shipment of goods. The first contract with the suppliers was cancelled at the end of September and the appellant was not entitled to receive any goods under it on the relevant date. Under the second contract it could not be said that the suppliers were bound to deliver the goods by instalments or to supply at least 40,000 lbs. before December 15, as the contract with the suppliers was not produced before the Court. The appellant had failed to establish that it had an adequate contract to cover the contract in suit. It was not enough for the appellant to show that there was a chance of it fulfilling its contract with the respondent.
