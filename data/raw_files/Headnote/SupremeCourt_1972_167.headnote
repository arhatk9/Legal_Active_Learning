 The-respondent submitted an application to the Regional Transport Authority for the grant of a stage carriage permit on an inter-regional and inter-state route. The Regional Transport Authority declined to consider the application, because, by a resolution of the State Transport Authority, the State Transport Authority took over the functions of the Regional Transport Authority with regard to inter-state routes. In a writ petition filed by the respondent the High Court held, (1) that under s. 44(3) (b) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, the State Transport Authority was entitled to perform the duties of a Regional Transport Authority in only two cases, namely, (a) where there is no Regional Transport Authority in a region and the State Transport Authority thinks it fit to perform the duties of the Regional Transport Authority and (b) when the Regional Transport Authority is functioning only in respect of inter- regional routes and on the request of the Regional Transport Authority; and (2) that the resolution of the State Transport Authority taking over the functions of the Regional Transport Authority was contrary to the direction given by the State under s. 43 the High Court therefore, directed the Regional Transport Authority to dispose of the application of the respondent.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : ( 1) Under s. 44(3) (b) the State Transport Authority is entitled to perform the duties of the Regional Transport Authority in three contingencies, namely (a) where there is no Regional Transport Authority functioning, (b) when the State Transport Authority thinks, it fit to perform the duties of the Regional transport Authority in respect of any route common to two or more regions, and (c) where the State Transport Authority is requested by the Regional Transport Authority to perform those duties in respect of an inter- regional route. [845H-846A] There is no limitation in the case of the first contingency.
 When a Regional Transport Authority is not functioning. the State Transport Authority shall perform the duties of a Regional Transport Authority, The provisions of the Act with regard to issue of permits are in the public interest, and it will lead to great public inconvenience if in the absence of the Regional Transport Authority the public is left entirely to the mercy of the State Transport Authority whether it will exercise its discretion to perform the duties of the Regional Transport Authority or not. The other two contingencies however limited in their 'scope.
 Since the State Transport Authority is for the whole State and has wider jurisdiction than the separate regional authorities it may in a fit case take over the functions of the Regional Transport Authority with regard to any route common to two or more region-, and similarly, when a request is made by the Regional Transport Authority the State Transport Authority would be entitled to perform the duties of the Regional Transport Authority in respect of an inter- regional route. Since two types of contingencies-one unlimited in 842 scope and the other limited-are combined in One Place the word 'and' has been used after the first contingency. The High Court's construction of the section that there are only two contingencies as mentioned by it is erroneous. [846C-H];
 847A-C] Poonam Chand v. State of Rajasthan, I.L.R. 11 Raj. 1031, approved.
 (2) But this power under el. (b) could only be discharged by the State Transport Authority, (i) subject to any directions given to it under S. 43 of the Act by the State Government, and (ii) save as otherwise expressly provided by or under the Act. [847D-E] (a) It cannot be contended that since the Regional Transport Authority is a separate authority on which duties referred to in el. (b) have been imposed by other provisions of the Act there is express provision by or under the Act and that therefore the State Transport Authority would be disentitled to take over these functions. If the expression is so construed the very object of the clause providing for the exercise by the State Transport Authority of the powers of the Regional Transport Authority would be frustrated.
 Therefore, the expression "save as otherwise, expressly pro- vided by or under the-Act." would, in the context, mean "save as expressly barred by or under the Act." Since there is no express provision which bars the performance by the State Transport Authority of the duties referred to in el.
 (b), the State Transport Authority would not, be barred from performing those duties. [847F-H; 848A-C] (b) However, s. 44(3) provides that the State Transport Authority is required to give effect to any direction issued by the State Government. The section gives the State Government power to control road transport and to that end is entitled, from time to time, by notification in the Official Gazette, to issue directions to the State Transport Authority in four specified cases. One of them is contained in el. (iv) of sub-s. (1), and, in the present case, the State Government has, by notification, issued directions under that sub-section to the State Transport Authority to the effect that the Regional Transport Authority was to invite applications for grant of permits on inter-state routes or to select applicants for the grant of permits.
 This direction is binding on the State Transport Authority and since it has to give effect to the direction, it cannot 'function contrary to it. Therefore, the resolution of the State Transport Authority taking over the functions of the Regional Transport Authority with regard to inter-state routes was contrary to the direction and hence invalid.
