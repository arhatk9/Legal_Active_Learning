 The respondent was granted the lease of a public ferry by the State of Uttar Pradesh for a period of three years.
 Under s. 10 of the Northern India Ferries Act, 1878 the State Government Was empowered to cancel such a lease on the expiry of six months notice in writing to the lessee of its intention to, cancel the lease. Before the expiry of the full term of his lease the respondent's lease was ordered to be terminated, the notice under s. 10 having been given by the Executive Engineer. In a suit for permanent injunction restraining the State Government from terminating his lease and taking possession of the ferry, the respondent challenged the validity of the notice under s. 10 given by the Executive Engineer. The suit was decreed by the trial court, and the trial court's decree was affirmed in second appeal by the High Court. The State appealed by special leave to this Court. The requirements of a notice under s.
 10 of the Act fell for consideration.
 
HELD : (i) In construing s. 10 of the Act it has to be borne in mind that it deals with the cancellation of a lease of tolls of a public ferry. In other words, once the notice is effective valuable rights of the lessee come to an end.
 'Ibis is recognised by the Legislature by providing a six months' notice. This period is given so that he can wind up this particular business. In this context the notice of intention to cancel the lease cannot be an empty formality.
 The notice must be such that, the lessee can safely act upon it and regulate his affairs; he must not speculate at his peril as to what is the true position. Therefore a notice under s. 10 of the Act must on its face show that what is being conveyed is Government's intention to cancel a lease and that it is being conveyed either by the Government itself or an officer duly authorised on its behalf. [200 E- 201 A] In the present case the body of the notice did not fulfil the above requirement of s. 10. Merely because the notice was signed by the Executive Engineer and mentioned s. 10 it could not be said that the. Executive Engineer was expressing the intention of the Government. An officer of the Government has no general authority to act on its behalf. Even if he holds out on behalf of the Government that he has the right to do a particular thing, the right must in fact exist. [200 G-H] (ii) When the validity of the notice was challenged in the plaint it was not necessary that every legal, ground of challenge should have been stated therein.. [201 B-C]
