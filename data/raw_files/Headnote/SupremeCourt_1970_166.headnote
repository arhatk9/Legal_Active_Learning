 The appellants were excise contractors. In purported exercise of its powers under cls. (d) and (h) of s.62(2) of the Madhya Pradesh Excise Act 9 1915, which confers power on the State Government to make rules, the State Government introduced a condition in the licences of the appellants prescribing the minimum quantity of liquor which the appellants should purchase from the Government and the compulsory payment of excise duty on the quantity of liquor which they failed to take delivery of. The State Government issued notices demanding the duty.
 On the question of their validity, 
HELD : Assuming the power to tax can be delegated to the executive, no tax can be imposed by any bye-law or rule or regulation unless the statute under which the subordinate legislation is made specially authorises its imposition.
 [850 C-D] In the present case, the Legislature has levied excise duty or countervailing duty only on the excisable articles which have been either imported, exported, transported, manufactured, cultivated or collected under any licence granted under s.13, or manufactured in any distillery or brewery established or licensed under the Act; and the State Government has not been empowered to levy any duty on liquor which the contractors failed to lift. Therefore, the State Government was exercising a power which it did not possess and hence the rule imposing the, condition in the licences and the demand notices are invalid. [849 H; A-C]
