 The Advocate General of the Appellant State issued notification under section 94 read with clause (u) of section 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure published on 25th of September, 1974, directing that three categories of various law officers of the Government including the Deputy Govt. Advocate shall have the authority to act and, plead and argue in all matters covered by the Code.
 The High Court held that the Deputy Govt. Advocate had no locus standi under the Code of Criminal Procedure to prefer an application under section 378 thereof for leave to appeal against an order of acquittal recorded by a lower Court in a murder ease. The respondent contended that an application under Section 378 would be incompetent unless its contents disclosed that it was being presented by a Public Prosecutor.
 Accepting the appeals ^ 
 HELD : (1) The High Court was not justified in throwing out the application presented to it as one having been filed by a person incompetent to do so. For the application to be treated as incompetent, the High Court was bound to enquire into the status of the person presenting it and could throw it out only if it was found as a fact that he did not enjoy the status of a Public Prosecutor. Such a status is for all practical purposes settled by the notification dated 25th September, 1974, of which after its publication in the Government Gazette, the High Court could take judicial notice. [211 G, 212 B-C] 2(i) The Advocate General being admittedly a Public Prosecutor for the State High Court, he had the authority by virtue of the provisions of clause (u) of section 2 of the Code to issue directions authorising other persons to act;
 and once a person was so authorised, he would be Public Prosecutor for the purpose of the Code. [211E-F] (ii) A Deputy Government Advocate being a person so authorised under the notification dated 25th September, 1974, is thus a Public Prosecutor having full competence to present an application under section 378 of the Code.
