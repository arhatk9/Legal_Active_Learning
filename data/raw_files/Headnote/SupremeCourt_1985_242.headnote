 The respondent-assessee, a dealer in stationery and drawing material, sells ammonia paper and ferro paper. In assessment proceedings under the U.P. Sales Tax Act, 1948 for the assessment year 1966-67 the assessee claimed that ammonia paper and ferro paper were liable to tax as unclassified goods at the rate of two per cent prescribed by 
8.3 of the Act. The Sales Tax Officer rejected the claim holding that ammonia paper and ferro paper fell under the entry "paper other than hand made paper" included in notification no.ST-3124/X-1012(4) - 1965 dated July 1, 1966 and its turnover was, therefore, liable to tax at six per cent.
 The appeal as well as the revision petition of the assessee were dismissed.
 At the instance of the assessee a reference was made to the High Court, which held that "ammonia paper and ferro paper do not fall within the category of paper".
 Dismissing the Appeal of the Commissioner of Sales Tax, ^ 
 HELD: 1. Ammonia paper and ferro paper do not fall within the entry "paper other than hand made paper" in the notification dated July 1, 1966 issued under the U.P. Sales Tax Act, 1948. [743 D] 
 2. Ammonia paper and ferro paper are used for preparing prints and sketches of site plans. An impression of the print or sketch is made on the paper, and it is then exposed to light for a period of time during which the chemical evaporates resulting in the emergence of the print or sketch of the site plan. Therefore, ammonia paper and ferro paper cannot be regarded as paper in the popular sense of that term. Paper is used for 740 printing or writing or for packing. Ammonia paper and ferro paper are not employed for any of the purposes and subjected to any of the processes for which paper, as commonly understood, is generally used.
