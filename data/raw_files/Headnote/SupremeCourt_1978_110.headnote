 The respondent who was arraigned as accused No. 2 in a prosecution for offences u/Ss. 120B r/w Ss. 409, 435 and 201 I.P.C. instituted by the Central Bureau of Investigation in the Court of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi was granted anticipatory bail, by the High Court of Delhi. When the Committal Proceedings commenced in the Court of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi on February 20, 1978 as per the time schedule fixed by this Court, the two approvers in the case turned hostile, resiled from their statements made to the police u/s 161 of Crl.P.C., and retracted the confessions made to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate. An application filed for cancellation of the respondents bail was dismissed by a learned single Judge of the Delhi High Court on 11-4-1978.
 Allowing the appeal in part, the Court 
HELD : 1. In an appeal by special leave against an order rejecting ax application for cancellation of bail, no new material which was not available to the High Court will normally be allowed to be relied upon by the State, it would be unfair to the respondent to make use of that material without giving him an adequate opportunity to meet it on the ground that the additional data came into existence after the High Court gave its judgment. Though, in appropriate cases, the Court has the power to take additional evidence, that power has to be exercised sparingly, particularly in appeals brought under Article 136 of the Constitution. [956 D-E] 
2. In an appeal by special leave against an order rejecting an application for cancellation of the bail, the High Court's findings are normally treated by this Court as binding on issues like : whether the prosecution has succeeded in proving its case that the respondent has tampered with its witnesses and that 951 there is a reasonable apprehension that he will continue to indulge in that course of Conduct, if he is allowed to remain at large. If two views of the evidence are reasonably possible and the High Court has taken one view, this Court will be disinclined to interfere therewith in an appeal under Art. 136 of the Constitution. (958 E-F) In the instant case :-(a) the High Court has rejected incontrovertible -evidence on hypertechnical considerationsthough it points in one direction only, leaving no manner of doubt that therespondent has misused the facility afforded to him by that Court by granting anticipatory bail to him(b) Even excluding the last incident in regard to Charan Singh which is really first in point of time and though it is corroborated by an entry in the General Diary, the other evidence viz., (i) Yadav's complaint of the 14th February, (ii) Khedkar's complaint of even date, (iii) Yadav's admission in his evidence that he did make the written complaint in spite of the fact that he had turned hostile, (iv) the affidavits of Sat Pal Singh, Ganpat Singh and Digambar Das in regard to the incident of the 17th and (v) the affidavit of Sarup Singh regarding the incident of February 28. furnish satisfactory proof that the respondent has abused his liberty by attempting to suborn the prosecution witness. He has therefore forfeited his right to remain free. [960 G-H 961 A) 3.Section 439(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure confers jurisdiction on the High Court or Court of Sessions to direct that any person who has between released on bail under Chapter XXXIII be arrested and committed to custody.
 The power to take back in custody an accused who has been enlarged on bail has to be exercised with care and circumspection. But the power, though of an extra-ordinary nature, is meant to be exercised in appropriate cases when, by a preponderance of probabilities, it is clear that the accused is interfering with the course of justice by tampering with witnesses. Refusal to exercise that wholesome power in such cases, few though they may be, will reduce it to a dead letter and will suffer the courts to be silent spectators to the subversion of the judicial process.

 4.Rejection of bail when bail is applied for is one thing; cancellation of bail already granted is quite another. It is easier to reject a bail application in a non-bailable case than to cancel a bail granted in such a case. Cancellation of bail necessarily involves the review of a decision already made and can by and large be permitted only if, by reason of supervening circumstances, it would be no longer conducive to a fair trial to allow the accused to retain his freedom during the trial. The fact that prosecution witnesses have turned hostile cannot by itself justify the inference that the accused has won them over.
 The objective fact that witnesses have turned hostile must be shown to bear a causal connection with the subjective involvement therein of the respondent. Without such proof, a bail once granted cannot be cancelled on the off chance or on the supposition that witnesses have been won over by the accused. Inconsistent testimony can no more be ascribed by itself to the influence of the accused than consistent testimony, by itself, can be ascribed to the pressure of the prosecution. It is therefore necessary for the prosecution to show some act or conduct on the part of the respondent from which a reasonable inference may arise that the witnesses have gone back on their statements as a result of an intervention by or on behalf of the respondent. [957 AF] 5.It is not necessary for the prosecution to prove by a mathematical certainty or even beyond a reasonable doubt that the witnesses have turned hostile because they are won over by the accused. The issue of cancellation of bail can only arise in criminal cases, but that does not mean that every incidental matter in a criminal case must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt like the guilt of the accused.
 Indeed, proof of facts by preponderance 952 of probabilities as in a civil case is not foreign to criminal jurisprudence because, in cases where the statute raises a presumption of guilt as, for, example, the Prevention of Corruption Act, the accused is entitled to rebut that presumption by proving his defence by a balance of probabilities. He does not have to establish his case beyond a reasonable doubt. The same standard of proof as in a civil case applies to proof of incidental issues involved in a criminal trial like the cancellation of bail of an accused. The prosecution, therefore, can establish its case in an application for cancellation of bail by showing on a preponderance of probabilities that the accused has attempted to tamper or has tampered with its witnesses.
 Proving by the test of balance of probabilities that the accused has abused his liberty or that there is a reasonable apprehension that he will interfere with the course of justice is all that is necessary for the prosecution to do in order to succeed in an application for cancellation of bail.
