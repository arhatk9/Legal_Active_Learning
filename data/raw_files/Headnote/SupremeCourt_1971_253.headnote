 The first respondent was a Money Tester in the appellant bank and was deputed to supervise the remittance of unissuable notes from the branch of the appellant to the Notes Cancellation and Verification Section of the branch of the Reserve Bank of India for destruction. On the allegation that, in order to-avoid liability, he deliberately tore off the label containing his initials, on a packet of notes in which there was a shortage, the appellant ordered an inquiry. At the inquiry, the respon- dent examined two defence witnesses who were cashiers of the appellant from different branches. Some officers of Reserve Bank of India who gave evidence for the appellant refused to be cross examined and did not answer any question put to them in cross-examination. Notwithstanding the irregularity, the inquiry proceeded and the inquiry officer submitted his report finding the respondent guilty. The appellant however, ordered a de novo inquiry by another officer. During that inquiry, in which the first respondent took part under protest, he requested the inquiry officer to summon his two defence witnesses who were examined at the earlier enquiry and three others all employees of the appellant. The inquiry officer rejected the request regarding the three new witnesses on the ground that their evidence would not be relevant, and as regards the other two, he informed the respondent that he should arrange for producing them at the inquiry at his own expense, The respondent pleaded that he already incurred a considerable expense in that regard, that the second inquiry was being held due to no fault of his, and therefore, he regretted his inability to have the witnesses summoned at his expense He also requested that in case the two witnesses were not summoned on his behalf their evidence in the earlier enquiry may be treated as evidence in the second inquiry. But his plea was not accepted and the proceedings were conducted without those witnesses being examined on behalf of the res- pondent. The enquiry officer submitted his report finding the respondent guilty. The respondent was asked to show cause why the proposed punishment of discharge from service without notice in terms of para. 521(10)(c) of the Sastri Award should not be imposed. After considering his reply the appellant discharged him from service.
 The Central Government referred the dispute as to whether the appellant was justified in discharging the respondent from its service, to the Industrial Tribunal.
 The Industrial Tribunal held that the respondent was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to produce evidence in his defence during the second inquiry and that the management was not justified in terminating his services on the basis of the report of the inquiry officer.
 In appeal to this Court, it was contended that (1) the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to set aside the order of the management discharging the 756 workman from service when there was no finding that the appellant acted mala fide or with a view to victimise the employee; (2) even if it was held that the evidence was not sufficient to justify the order of discharge nevertheless, under the last part of the para. 521 (10) (c) of the Sastri Award the appellant had jurisdiction to pass the order of discharge; and (3) even assuming that the domestic inquiry conducted by the appellant was in any manner vitiated, the Tribunal erred in law in not giving an opportunity to the management to adduce evidence before the Tribunal to establish the validity of the order of discharge.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) The order terminating the services of a workman can be set aside when there has been a violation of the principles of natural justice. Though normally it may be the duty of a workman to have his witnesses produced before the inquiry officer, in the particular circumstances of this case the position was different. The workmen had incurred heavy expenses in the previous inquiry, which inquiry was abandoned by the management not because of any fault of the workman but because of the unreasonable attitude adopted by the employees of the Reserve Bank who gave evidence. For their conduct the workman should not be punished by making him incur expenses over again, especially when the second inquiry was conducted by the management of its own volition and in spite of the protests made by the workman. The request made by the workman was a reasonable and modest one.
 The Tribunal was, therefore, justified in holding that the workman was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to place his evidence before the inquiry officer, that there has been a violation of principles of natural justice in the conduct of the domestic inquiry and consequently, the order' of discharge could not be sustained.

 (2)Under para. 521(10)(c) of the Sastri Award even if the evidence on record is sufficient to hold a workman guilty of the charges framed against him the bank had ample power and jurisdiction to discharge him from its service if it does not consider it expedient to retain the employee. But in the present case, the management never sought to place any reliance on that part of sub-cl. (c). The finding of the inquiry officer was that on the evidence adduced the workman was guilty of the charges levelled against him and that the charges had been proved beyond all doubt. The show cause notice proceeded on the same basis and the final order of discharge was also to the same effect. Therefore, the appellant never proceeded on the basis that the service of the respondent was being dispensed with on the ground that the management did not think it expedient to retain the workman in its service notwithstanding the fact that the evidence had been found to be insufficient to sustain the charges levelled against him. [774 D-H] (3)When an order of punishment by way of dismissal or termination of services is effected by the management the issue that is referred by the Industrial Tribunal is whether the management was justified in discharging and terminating the services of the workman concerned and whether the workman was entitled to any relief. Under those circumstances it is the right of the workman to plead all infirmities in the domestic inquiry if one has been held, and also to attack the order on all grounds available to him in law and on facts. Similarly the management has also a right to defend the action taken by it on the ground that a proper domestic inquiry had been held by it on the basis of 757 which the impugned order had been passed. It is also open to the management to justify on facts that the order passed by it was proper. If the management &fends its action solely on the basis that the domestic inquiry held by it is proper and valid and if the Tribunal holds against the management on that point, the management will fail. It is open to the Tribunal to accept the evidence adduced by the management to justify its action and hold in its favour even if its finding is against the management regarding the validity of the domestic inquiry. It is however essentially a matter for the management to decide about the stand that it proposes to take before the Tribunal. The inquiry that is conducted by the Tribunal is 'a composite inquiry, and there is no justification for the view that the inquiry before the Tribunal has to be conducted in two parts first, an investigation into the validity of the domestic inquiry and if the decision is against the management on the point, then to conduct a further inquiry regarding the evidence that may be adduced by the parties about the validity of the action taken by the management. [776F-H; 777A-D; 778 C-D] In the present case, the to justify the legality of the domestic inquiry held was passed. It never to produce any evidence before the Tribunal apart from the inquiry proceedings. No opportunity for justifying its action was asked for by the management nor availed of.
