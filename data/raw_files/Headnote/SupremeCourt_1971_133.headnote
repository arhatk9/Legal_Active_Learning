 The respondents were bus operators who applied for renewal of permits. which were to expire on different dates between February 28, 1966 and September 30, 1966. The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (appellant herein) applied for grant of substantive permits in lieu of the renewal applications made by the respondents. On account of litigation the applications of the parties could not be decided for several years. At the meeting of the Regional Transport Authority on July 29, 1970 when all the applications were placed for consideration on merits, a preliminary issue was raised on behalf of the appellant to the effect that in view of the unusually long time which had elapsed since the making of the applications in 1965-66 it had become necessary to call for and consider up to date information about all the applicants. The Regional Transport Authority directed all the applicants to file additional information relating to matters covered by columns 10 to 16 and 19 of the prescribed form of the application by August 21, 1970 and directed their publication and invitation of objections thereon. All the applicants including the respondents tendered additional up to date information about their operations in terms of the order of the Regional Transport Authority. The additional information was published and objections thereto were received. The Authority posted all the applications for consideration on merit at a meeting due to be held on November 26, 1970. The respondents meanwhile moved the High Court for an order on the Regional Transport Authority to forbear from taking into account up to date information while judging the merits of the contending operators and to enjoin the said Authority to consider the applications only on the basis of the information originally filed in the year 1965-66. In appeal by special leave to this Court the questions for consideration were (i) whether the Regional Transport Authority had power to call for additional information as it did; (ii) whether such additional information could be ordered to be published; and (iii) whether the Regional Transport Authority was bound to decide the applications on the basis of the qualifications of the applicants originally given therein.
 
HELD: (i) In deciding the question of power of the Regional Transport Authority to call for further information it has to be borne in mind that the Regional Transport Authority shall, in considering an application for permit, have regard among other matters to the interests of the public generally, the advantages to the public of the services to be provided, the adequacy of other passenger transport services, the operation 36-1 S.C. India/71 562 by the applicant of other transport services including those in respect of which applications from him for permits are pending, the benefit to any particular locality or location, likely to be afforded by the service. Therefore in considering public interest if the Regional Transport Authority would find that the answers furnished by any applicant are not full and complete, it will be constricting the exercise of the power of the Regional Transport Authority by denying it authority to ask for additional information for full and detailed consideration of the applications in the interest of the public. No hard and fast rule can be laid down as to how the Regional Transport Authority will act or what the limitations of its powers will be. It is a statutory body. It is to exercise its powers in the public interest. Such public interest will have to be considered with regard to particular matters enumerated in s. 47 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 and the particulars of an application are to be judged with reference to ss. 46 and 47 in particular of the Act. Rule 68(6) of the. Bombay Motor Vehicles Rules, 1959 also enables the State or the Regional Transport Authority, as the case may be, to require an applicant to appear before it and to withhold the consideration of the application for the permit until the applicant has so appeared in person if so required or by any recognised agent if so permitted, and until the applicant has furnished such information as may be required by the Regional Transport Authority in connection with the application. The words 'in connection with the application' are important. These words indicate that the Regional Transport Authority will have power to ask for further information. In the absence of the Regional Transport Authority acting under corrupt motive or malafide or for any oblique purpose the discretion which is conferred on the Regional Transport Authority should not be undermined or restricted.
 (ii) Under s. 57 of the Act the application is to be published in order to enable parties to submit representation in connection therewith. In the present case in view of the fact that information was asked for with regard to specific columns of the application it could not be denied that the information was in connection with the application. It was therefore within the competence of the Regional Transport Authority under s. 57 of the Act to publish the application or the substance thereof in order to enable the persons affected thereby to send their representations to the Regional Transport Authority. It would be in fulfillment of the objects and purposes of the Act and advancement of public interest to ensure that the permit is granted to the most meritorious applicant.
 Therefore it is all the more necessary to publish additional information in order to have the fullest materials on record for proper assessment and evaluation of the merits and demerits.
 (iii) The High Court was in error in holding that the Regional Transport Authority would have to consider the respective qualifications of the applicants as on the date of their applications and not as on the date of the actual consideration by the Regional Transport Authority of the applications for the grant of permit. Normally the Regional Transport Authority would consider the applications for the grant of permits within a short time of the submission of the applications. If for any reason a long time has elapsed as in the present appeal, the Regional Transport Authority will have to consider the various matters enumerated in cls.
 (a) to (f) of s. 46 of the Act at the time of the consideration of the applications. The death or insolvency of an applicant since the filing of the application cannot be ignored. The public interest stands in the forefront.
