 The Oil and Natural Gas Commission, the Industrial Finance Corporation and the Life Insurance Corporation are created by statutes. The Oil and Natural Gas Commission is owned by the Government, the management is by the Government and it could be dissolved only by the Government. The provisions of the Oil and Natural Gas Commission Act, 1954, creating it.
 show that it acts as an agency of the Central Government.
 The Provisions of the Industrial Finance Corporation Act, 1948, creating the Industrial Finance Corporation show that the Corporation is under the complete control and management of the Central Government. Provisions of the Life Insurance Act, 1956, which creates the Life Insurance Corporation.
 show that this Corporation is also an agency of the Government carrying on the exclusive business of Life- Insurance. The Corporation. is owned and managed by the Government and it can be dissolved only by the Government.
 All the three statutes constituting the three statutory corporations enabled them to make regulations which provide, inter alia, for the terms and conditions of employment and services of their employees.
 On the question whether, (i) the regulations have the force of law, and (ii) whether the statutory corporations are 'State' within the meaning of Art. 12 of the Constitution, HELD : (Per A. N. Ray, C.J., Y. V. Chandrachud and A. C.
 Gupta, JJ.) The regulations have the force of law and the employees are entitled to the declaration of being in employment when their dismissal or removal is in contravention of the regulations. [642E-F] (a) Regulations under an Act are framed in exercise of a specific power conferred by the statue to make regulations. The authority making the regulations must specify the sources of its specific power. The essence of law is that it is made by the law makers in exercise of specific authority. The vires of such of law is capable of being Challenged if the power is absent or has been exceeded by the authority making rules or regulations. The manner and procedure adopted in making the regulations in the instant case, by the 'three statutory corporations, have this characteristic of law. [629G-A] (b) Another characteristic of law is its content. Law is a rule of general conduct while administrative instructions relate to a particular person.[630A] (c) Broadly stated the distinction between rules and regulations on one hand, and administrative instructions on the other, is that rules and regulations can be made only after reciting the source of power whereas administrative instructions are not issued after reciting the source of power. There is, however, no substantial difference between rules and regulations inasmuch as 'both are subordinate legislation under powers conferred by the statute. A regulation framed under statute applies uniform treatment to everyone or to all members of some group of class. [630G;
 633G] (d) The regulations in the present case are, inter alia, for the purpose of defining the duties, conduct and conditions of service of officers and other 620 employees. They contain the terms and conditions of appointment which are imperative. The form and content of the contract with a particular employee is prescriptive and statutory. The notable feature is that these statutory bodies have no free hand in framing the conditions and terms of service of their employees. They are bound to apply the terms and conditions as laid down in the regulations. These regulations are not only binding on the authority but also on the public. They imposed obligations on the statutory authorities. The statutory authorities cannot deviate from the conditions of service. Any deviation will be enforced by legal sanction of courts to invalidate actions in violation of rules and regulations. The existence of rules and regulations under the statute is to ensure regular conduct with a distinctive attitude to that conduct as a standard. The statutory regulations in the instant case give the employees a statutory status and impose restrictions on the employer and the employee with no option to vary the conditions. An ordinary individual, in the case of master and servant contractual relationship, enforces breach of contract. the remedy being damages because personal service is not capable of enforcement. In the case of statutory bodies, however, there is no personal element whatsoever because of the impersonal character of the bodies. In their case the element of public employment and service and the support of statute require observance of rules and regulations. Failure to observe requirements of the regulation by statutory bodies is enforced by courts by declaring the dismissal in violation of rules and regulations to be void. Whenever a man's rights are affected by a decision under statutory powers the court would resume the existence of a duty to observe the rules of natural justice and compliance with rules and regulations imposed by statute. [630C-D; 633H; 634A-D] (e) Further the executive power of a 'state' is not authorised to frame rules under Art. 162. [630G] (f) The rules and regulations in the present case cannot be equated to the regulation framed by a company incorporated under the Companies Act. A company incorporated under the Companies Act is not created by the Companies Act but comes into existence in accordance with 'the provisions of that Act. It is not a statute body because it is not created by statute itself. A company makes rules and regulations in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act whereas the source of the power for making rules and regulations the case of corporations created by statute is the statute itself. A statutory body when it makes rules and regulations does so under the powers conferred by statute creating it. [631B-D] (g) In U.P. State Warehousing Corporation Case [1969] INSC 221; [1970] 2 S.C.R. 250 and Indian Airlines Corporation Case [1971] INSC 129; [1971] 2 S.C.C. 192 the terms of the regulations were treated as terms and conditions of relationship between the corporation and its empolyees. But that could not lead to the conclusion that they are of the same nature and quality as the terms and conditions laid down in a contract of employment. Those terms and conditions not being contractual are imposed by one kind of subordinate legislation, viz., regulations made in exercise of the power conferred by the statute which constitute the corporation.
 Terms of the regulation are not terms of contract. A corporation had no power to alter or modify or rescind the provisions of the regulations at it's discretion which it could do in respect of the terms of contract that it may wish to enter with its employees independent of these regulations. So far as the terms of the regulations are concerned the actions of the corporation are controlled by the Central Government. The decisions, therefore, in U.P.
 Warehousing Corporation and Indian Airlines Corporation are in direct conflict with the decision of this Court in Naraindas Barot Divisional Controller S.T.C.[1965] INSC 294; , [1966] 3 S.C.R. 40 and are wrongly decided. [633B-D] The Sirsi Municipality v. Cecelia Kom Francis, [1973] INSC 12; [1973] 1 S.C.C. 409, followed.
 (2) The statutory bodies are authorities within the meaning of Art. 12 of the Constitution though their employees are not the servants of the Union or of a State. [642F] 621 (a) The State undertakes commercial functions in combination with governmental functions in a welfare State. It must be able to impose decisions by or under law with authority. An clement of authority is of binding character. The rules and regulations are authoritative because these rules and regulations direct and control not only the exercise of the powers by the corporation but also of persons who deal with these corporations. The State itself is envisaged under Art. 298 as having the right to carry on trade and business.
 The State as defined in Art. 12 comprehended bodies created for the purpose of promoting economic interests of the people. The circumstance that the statutory bodies required to carry on some activities of the nature of trade or commerce does not indicate that it must be excluded from the scope of the word 'State'. A public authority is a body which has public or statutory duties to perform and which performs those duties and carries out its transactions for the benefit of the public and not for private profit. Such an authority is not precluded from making a profit for the public benefit. [634F; H; 635A-B & G] (b) The power to give directions, the disobedience of which would be punishable as criminal offences would furnish one of the reasons for characterising the body as an authority within the meaning of Art. 12. The Oil and Natural Gas Commission Act confers Power of entry on employees of the Commission upon any land or premises for the purposes of lawfully carrying out works by the commission. The members and employees of the Commission are public servants within the meaning of s. 21 'of the Indian Penal Code. The Commission enjoys protection of action taken under the Act.
 The Life Insurance Act provides that if any person wilfully withholds or fails to deliver to the corporation any property which has been transferred and vested in the corporation and wilfully applies them to purposes other than those expressed or authorised by the Act. he shall, on the complaint of the Corporation, be punishable with imprisonment. The Corporation also enjoys protection of action taken under the Act. The Industrial Finance Corporation Act states that whoever in any bill of lading, warehouse, receipt or other instrument given to the Corpora- tion whereby security is given to the Corporation for accommodation granted by it wilfully makes any false statement or knowingly permits any false statement to be made shall be punishable with imprisonment. Further, whoever, without the consent in writing of the Corporation, uses its name in any prospectus or advertisements shall also be punishable with imprisonment. The corporation also enjoys protection of action taken under the Act. A company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act does not enjoy these privileges. [641F; 642A-D] (c) The fact that a statutory corporation is not granted immunity from taxation and therefore is under liability to be taxed would not indicate that the corporation is not a state authority. Art. 289 of the Constitution empowers the Union of India to impose a tax in respect of trade or business carried on by on behalf of the State. [641G-H] Per Mathew J. (Concurring) The concept of State has undergone drastic changes in recent years. Today State cannot be conceived of simply as a coercive machinery wielding the thunderbolt of authority.
 It has to be viewed mainly as a service Corporation. A State is an abstract entity. It, can only act through the instrumentality or agency of natural or juridical persons.
 There is nothing strange in the notion of the State acting through a Corporation and making it an agency or instru- mentality of the State. With the advent of a welfare State the framework of civil service administration became increasingly insufficient for handling the new tasks which were often of a specialised and highly technical character.
 The distrust of Government by civil service was a powerful factor in the development of a policy of public administration through separate Corporations which would operate largely according to business principles and be separately accountable. The Public Corporation, therefore, became a third arm of the Government. The employees of public Corporation are not civil servants. in so far as public corporations fulfil public tasks on behalf of government, they are public authorities and as such, subject to control by Government, The public Corporation being a creation of the State is subject to the constitutional imitation as the State itself. The governing power wherever located must be 622 subject to the fundamental constitutional limitations. The ultimate question which is relevant for our purpose is whether the Corporation is an agency or instrumentality of the Government for carrying on a business for the benefit of the public. [644E; 645B; G; 646C; 647B] A finding of State financial support plus an unusual degree of control over the management and policies might lead one to characterize an operation as state action. Another factor which might be. considered is whether the operation is an important public function. In America corporations or associations, private in character, but dealing with public rights, have been held subject to constitutional standards.
 Activities which are too fundamental to the society are by definition too important not to be considered government function. The State today has an affirmative duty of seeing that all essentials of life are made available to all persons. [650B-C; 651D-G] It is clear from these provisions of the statutes in question that the Central Government has contributed the original capital of the Corporation. that part of the profit of the Corporation goes to that, Government, that the Central Government exercises control over the policy of the Corporation that the Corporation carries on a business having great public importance and that it enjoys a monopoly in the business. These corporations are agencies or instrumentalities of the 'state' and are, therefore, 'state' within the meaning of Art. 12. The fact that these corporations have independent personalities in the eye of law does not mean that they are not subject to the control of government or that they are not instrumentalities of the government. These corporations are instrumentalities or agencies of the state for carrying on businesses which otherwise would have been run by the state departmentally.
 If the state had chosen to carry On these businesses through the medium of government departments, there would have been no question that actions of these departments be 'state actions'. Why then should be actions of corporations be not state actions ? [653H; 654A-C] The ultimate question which is relevant for our purpose is whether such a corporation is an agency or instrumentality of the government for carrying on a business for the benefit of the public. In other words, the question is, for whose benefit was the corporation carrying on the business ? When it is seen from the provisions of that Act that on liquidation of the Corporation, its assets should be devided among the shareholders, namely' the Central and State governments and others, if any, the implication is clear that the benefit of the accumulated income would go to the Central and State governments. Nobody will deny that an agent has a legal personality different from that of the principal. The fact that the agent is subject to the direction of the principal does not mean that he has no legal personality of his own. Likewise, merely because a corporation has legal personality of its own, it does not follow that the Corporation cannot be an agent or instrumentality of the state, if, it is subject to control of government in all important matters of policy. No doubt, there might be some distinction between the nature of control exercised by principal over agent and the control exercised by government over public corporation. That, I think is only a distinction in degree. The crux of the matter is that public corporation is a new type of institution which has sprung from the new social and economic functions of government and that it therefore does not neatly fit into old legal categories Instead of forcing it into them, the latter should be adopted to the needs of changing times and conditions. [654F-H] (ii) The learned Chief Justice has dealt with the question in his judgment whether the regulations framed by the corporations have the force of law and he has arrived at the conclusion that the regulations being framed under statutory provisions would have the force of law. I agree with that conclusion. Even assuming that the regulations have no force of law, I think since the employment under these corporations is public employment" an employee would get a status which would enable him to obtain declaration for cent nuance in service if he was dismissed or discharged contrary to the regulations. [655E-F] (iii) If a job is regarded as analogous to property, it ought to be recognized that a man is entitled to a particular job just as the courts of Equity acknowledged his right to a particular piece of property. Where a public authority is 623 concerned, this can be implemented by a declaration. In the case of private employment English law has devised no suitable remedy. That this is possible is shown by the example of other countries. The Court must, therefore, adopt the attitude that declaration is the normal remedy for a wrongful dismissal in case of public employees which will only be refused in exceptional circumstances. The remedy of declaration should be a ready-made instrument to provide reinstatement in public sector. Once it is accepted that a man's job is like his property of which he can be deprived of for specific reasons, this remedy becomes the primary one though it will need to be reinforced where private individuals are being sued. The law of master and servant has not kept pace with the modern conditions and the mandate of equality embodied in the Constitution. The law still attaches to the servant a status of inferiority and subjection to his master. Though fundamental reforms can only emanate from the legislature, the principles fashioned by public law if applied to master servant relationship can bring about a change in law to accord with the social conditions of the 20th century. [658D-G] [Per Alagiriswami, J. (Dissenting)] (i) In order that an Institution must be an "authority" it should exercise part of the sovereign power or authority of the State. Port Trust is given the power to make regulations and to provide that breach of its regulations would be punishable. In such a case, it is undoubtedly exercising part of the power of the State. The whole purpose of the Part III of the Constitution is to confer fundamental rights on the citizen, as against the power of the State or those exercising the power of the State. In the present case none of the Corporations exercise the power of the State and, therefore, cannot be the State or Autho- rity. The regulations framed by these Corporations have no force of law. The employees of these statutory bodies have no statutory status and they are not entitled to declaration of being in employment when their dismissal or removal is in contravention of statutory provisions. [670A; 671A-C] (ii) Under the Indian Legislative practice Governments make the rules and regulations are made by any institution or Organisation established by a Statute and where it is intended that the regulation should have effect as law, the Statute itself says so. Administrative instructions are not necessarily in relation to the particular persons. They may relate to a whole class of persons even as rules and regulations do. To say that because the regulations contained the terms and conditions of appointment they are statutory is to beg the question. An institution like the L.I.C. the country has necessarily got to have a standard set of conditions of service for its various classes of employees. It is not correct to say that the statutory bodies have no free hand in framing the conditions and terms of service of their employees. They are the authorities to make the regulations and, therefore, can make any regulations regarding the conditions and terms of service of their employees and also change them as they please. It cannot, therefore, be said that they are bound by these terms and conditions of service. [668E-H; 669H] (iii) There is no fallacy in equating-rules and regulations of a Company with rules and regulations framed by a statutory body. Where an institution or Organisation is established by a Statute or under a Statute in principle there is no difference between their powers. [670-F] (iv) While rules are generally made by the Government, the regulations are made by a body which is a creature of the statute itself with its powers limited by the statute.
 While rules apply to all matters covered by the statute, the scope of the regulations is narrower being usually confined to internal matters of the statutory body such as the conditions of service of its employees. When regulations standardise the conditions of service of the employees or purport to formulate them. their character is further diluted by the nature of the subjectmatter. For, service or employment is basically a contract which is deeply rooted in private law. A mere standardisation or enumeration of the terms of a service contract is not, therefore, ordinarily sufficient to convert it into a statutory status. [669B-D] , 624
