 The appellant was charged for offences punishable under sections 302, 325 and 323 read with sec. 34 of the I.P.C.
 along with three others. The Sessions Court acquitted the appellant. The High Court set aside the acquittal and convicted the appellant upon the, plea of, the appellant that the High Court had erred in its appreciation of ,evidence. The Court went through the entire record for itself as the appellant had approached the Court under the Criminal Jurisdiction newly created.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) That, the conviction by the High Court was not based on complete cr comprehensive appreciation of all features of the case, which, taken together cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution version. There was considerable uncertainty about the time and the place at which the incident took place. The evidence of the witnesses that there was considerable bleeding from the injury of the deceased was inconsistent with total absence of blood at the place of occurrence. The prosecution tried to prove that there were 3 blows struck on the head of the deceased, but this was not supported by the medical evidence. [606C; B] (II) Held further that the High Court failed to attach due weight to the assessment of evidence by the trial court which had the additional advantage of seeing the ,witnesses depose in the witness box.
