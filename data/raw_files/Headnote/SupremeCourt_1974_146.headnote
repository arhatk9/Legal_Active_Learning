 The four respondents were charged with the murder of three persons. The evidence in the case was circumstantial. The trial Court found them guilty relying on the facts : (a) that the accused wanted to grab the shares of the deceased in a property hence had a motive to commit the murder; (b) that three of the accused made extra judicial confessions confessing to the murders; (c) that two dead bodies were recovered as a result of a statement of the fourth accused from a place in front of his house where they were buried and (d) that there was evidence of association of one of the accused and the third person alleged to have been murdered.
 On appeal, the High Court acquitted all the accused, on the grounds that the identity of the dead bodies was not established, that it was not established that the death was homicidal, that the extra judicial confessions did not inspire confidence, and that the evidence of association was not acceptable.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : In an appeal to this Court, against acquittal by the High Court, this Court does not interfere with the appraisement of the evidence by the High Court unless that appraisement is vitiated by some glaring infirmity. No such infirmity has been established in the present case. The circumstantial evidence adduced is far from satisfactory and suffers from a number of infirmities. [752 B-C] (a) There was no evidence to show that the two dead bodies were those of two of the deceased and that the death was homicidal. The medical evidence shows that the features were unrecognizable, and that the cause of their death could not be found out. May be the doctor who Performed the post morterm should have sent the dead bodies to an anatomy expert who might have been able to give an opinion as to the cause of death and thus established that it was a case of homicide, but it would be contrary to all accepted principles of criminal jurisprudence to give the benefit of that omission to the prosecution. [75OF-751 B] (b) An extra judicial confession, in the very nature of things, is a weak piece of evidence. In the present case, the evidence adduced regarding the making of the confession also lacks plausibility and does not inspire confidence.
 [751 F] (c) The date on which the witness stated to the police as having seen one of the accused and the third deceased together was about 15 days thereafter. On the evidence on record, it is not possible to fix the date of the association and consequently, the prosecution cannot derive much benefit from such evidence. [751G-H] (d) Even if it be assumed that the dead bodies were those of two of the deceased and that the death was homicidal, it is difficult to say whether the crime was the act of one or more culprits. In any case, it is difficult to fix the identity of the culprits. [752A-B] (e) The circumstances of the case undoubtedly create suspicion against the accused, but suspicion by itself, however strong, is not sufficient to take the place of proof of guilt. [751 H]
