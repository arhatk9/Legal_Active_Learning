 Against an order imposing penalty under s. 46(1) of the Indian Income-tax Act on account of failure to pay an instalment of Income-tax, an appeal was preferred. Though the memorandum of appeal was presented with the period of limitation, the tax was paid after the period of limitation prescribed for presenting the appeal had expired.
 Held, that the expression " No appeal shall lie " in the proviso to S. 30(2) of the Indian Income-tax Act means that the appeal cannot be held to be properly filed until the tax is paid, and not that no memorandum of appeal may be presented.
 The effect of proviso to s. 30, sub-s. (1) read with sub-s.
 (2) of the Act is that the appeal will be deemed to be filed on the date when the tax due is paid and the question will then have to be decided whether there is sufficient cause for condonation of delay.
