 The appellant, who was the President of a Panchayat Board, was charged with an offence under s. 409, I.P.C. for not bringing to 'account in the book of the Panchayat Board a sum of Rs. 4,000, belonging to the Board. The trial court was not satisfied that the prosecution had proved the charge and therefore acquitted the appellant but, on appeal, the High Court accepted the prosecution evidence and convicted him.
 It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the prosecution against him was not maintainable for want of sanction by the State Government tinder s. 106 of the Madras Village Parnchayats Act (Mad. Act X of 1960); but the High Court rejected this contention.
 On appeal to this Court.
 
HELD : Sanction of the State Government was not necessary for the prosecution of the appellant under s. 409, Indian Penal Code.
 As in the case of s. 197(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, which is in similar language to s. 106 of the Madras Act, it is not every offence committed by a public servant that requires sanction for prosecution; nor even every act done by him while he is actually engaged in the performance of his official duties; but if the act complained of is directly concerned with his official duties so that, if questioned, it could be claimed to have been done by virtue of the office, then sanction Would be necessary. It is the quality of the act that is important and if it falls within the scope and range of his official duties the protection contemplated by s. 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code will be attracted. An offence may be entirely unconnected with the official duty as such or it may be committed within the scope of the official duty. Where it is unconnected with the official duty there can be no protection. It is only when it is either within the scope of the official duty or in excess of it that the protection is claimable.
