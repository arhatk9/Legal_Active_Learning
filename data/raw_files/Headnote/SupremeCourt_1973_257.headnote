 Sec. 8(2)(b) of the Central Sales Tax Act 1956, provides that the tax payable by any dealer on his turnover, in so far as it relates to the sale of goods the course of inter-state trade or commerce, not falling within sub-sec. (1) in, case of goods other than declared goods, shall be calculated at the rate of ` per cent or at the rate applicable to the safe or purchase, of such goods inside the appropriate state, whichever is higher. etc.
 The short question which arose for determination in these four appeals was whether the provisions of sec. 8(2)(b) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 suffer from the vice of excessive delegation because the parliament, in not fixing the rate itself and in adopting the rate applicable to the gate or purchase of goods inside the appropriate State had not laid down any legislative policy and thus abdicated its legislative function. The High Court answered this question in the live and upheld the constitutional validity of those provisions.
 Dismissing the appeals, 
HELD : (I) There is clear legislative policy which can be found in the provisions of Sec. 8 (2) (b) of the Central Sales Tax. Act 1956. The ' Policy of the law in this respect is that in case the rate of local sales tax be less than 10 per cent in such ,in event, the dealer, if the case does not fall within Sec. 8(1) of the Act ' should pay Central Sales Tax at the rate of 10 per cent. If, however the rate of , local sales tax for the goods concerned be more than 10 per cent, in that event, the policy is that the rate of the Central Sales Tax shall also be the same as (bat of the local sales tax for the said goods. The object of the law thus is that the rate of the Central Sales tax shall in no event be less than the rate of local sales tax for the goods in question though it may exceed the local rate in case that rate be less than 10 per cent. [984 A] For example, if the local rate of tax in the appropriate State for the non-declared goods be 6 per cent, in such an event a dealer, whose case is not covered by sec. 8(1) of the Act, would have to pay Central Sales Tax at a rate of 10 per cent. In case, however, the rate of local sales tax for such goods be 12 per cent the rate of Central Sales tax would also be 12 per cent because otherwise if the rate of Central Sales Tax were only 10 per cent, the unregistered dealer who purchases goods in the course of inter-State trade would be in a better position than an intrastate purchases and there would be no disincentive to the- dealers to desist from selling goods to unregistered purchasers in course of inter-State trade. The object of' the law apparently is to deter inter-State sales to unregistered dealers as such inter--State Sales would facilitate evasion of tax. [984 C] (2) It is also not possible to fix the maximum rate under or Sec. 8(2) (b) because the local sales tax varies from State to State. The rate of local sales tax can also be changed by the State legislatures from time to time. It is not within the competence of the parliament to fix the maximum rate of local Sales tax. The fixation of the rate of local Sales tax is essentially a matter for the State legislatures and the parliament does not have any control in the matter.
 The parliament has therefore necessarily, if it wants to prevent evasion of payment of Central Sales Tax, to tack the rate of such tax with that of local sales tax, in case the rate of local sales tax exceeds t particular limit. [984 E] State of Madras V. N.K. Nataraja Mudaliar, [1968] 3 S.C.R.

 (3) The growth of the legislative power of the executive is a significant development of the twentieth century. The theory of laissez-faire has been given a go-by and large and comprehensive powers are being assumed by the State with a view to improve social and economic well-being of the people. Most of the modern socioeconomic legislations passed by the legislature Jay down the guiding principles and the legislative policy. The legislatures because of limitation imposed upon by the time factor hardly go into matters of detail.
 Provision is, therefore made for delegated legislation to obtain flexibility, elasticity, expedition and opportunity for experimentation.
 The practice of empowering the Executive to make subordinate legislation within a prescribed sphere has evolved out of practical necessity and pragmatic needs of a modern welfare state. [890 D] (4) In questions of delegated legislation, the principle which has been well established is that the legislature must lay down the guidelines, principles or policy for the authority to whom power to make subordinate legislation is entrusted.
 The correct position of law thus is that an "unlimited right of delegation is not inherent in the legislative power itself. This is not warranted by the provisions of the Constitution and the legitimacy of delegation depends entirely upon its being used is in ancillary measure which the legislature considers to be necessary for the purpose of exercising its legislative powers effectively and completely. The legislatures must retain in its own hands the essential legislative functions which consist in declaring the legislative policy and laying down the stand which is to be enacted into a rule of law, and what can be delegated is the task of subordinate legislation which by its very nature is ancillary to the statute which delegates the power to make it provided the legislative policy is enunciated with sufficient clearness or a standard laid down. The courts cannot and should not interfere with the discretion that undoubtedly rests with the legislature itself in determining the extent of delegation necessary in a particular case."

 It is not possible to subscribe to the view that if the legislature can repeal an enactment, as it normally can, it retains enough control over the authority making the subordinate legislation and, as such, it is not necessary for the legislature to lay down legislative policy, standard or guidelines in the statute. The acceptance of this view would lead to startling results. Supposing the Parliament tomorrow enacts that as the crime situation in the country has deteriorated, criminal law to be enforced in the country from a particular date would be such as is framed by an officer mentioned in the enactment. Can it be said that there has been no excessive delegation of legislative power even though the Parliament omits to lay down in the statute any guideline or legislative policy for the making of such criminal law ? The vice of such an enactment cannot be ignored or lost sight of on the ground that if the Parliament does not approve the law made by the officer concerned, it can repeal the enactment by which that officer was autborised to make the law, [894 H-895 C] (per C.J. and Mathew J :) (1) Delegation is not handing over or transference of a power from one person or body of persons to another. Delegation may be defined as the entrusting, by a person or body of persons, of the exercise of a power residing in that person or body of persons, to another person or body of persons, with complete power of revocation or amendment, remaining in the grantor or delegator. [899-G] (2) Delegation often involves the granting of discretionary authority to another, but such authority is purely derivative. The ultimate power always remains in the delegator and is never renounced. [900 A] Wills J in Huth v. Clarke, [1890] 25, Q.B.D. 391, 395 and Hodge v. The Queen [1883] 9 A.C. 117.
 881 (3)What is prohibited, is the conferment of arbitrary power by the legislature upon a subordinate body without reserving to itself control over that body and the self-efacement of legislative power in favour of another agency either in whole or in part. In other words, the legislature should not abdicate its essential function. [904 C] Devi Das Gopal Krshan v. State of Punjab [1967] 3 S.C.R.

 (4)The concept of 'abdication' seems no less vague, fluctuating and uncertain than the "transfer to others of the essential legislative functions". Some writers think that a legislature does not 'abdicate' unless it withdraws from the field and surrenders its responsibility therefor;
 and to some, there seems to be 'abdication' whenever a legislature while remaining in the field and retaining its responsibility therefore entrusts to others the formulation of policy, otherwise than with a definite standard or purpose laid down by it.

 (5) The crucial point is, whether the legislature preserved its capacity intact and retained perfect control over the delegate inasmuch as it could at any time repeal the legislation and withdraw the authority and discretion it bid vested on the delegate. [906 B] (6) Delegation of 'law making' power is the dynamo of modem government. Delegation by the legislature is necessary in order that the exertion of legislative power does not become a futility. Today, while theory still affirms legislative supremacy, power floats back increasingly to the Executive.
 One must not take lightly and say that there can be transfer of legislative power under the guise of delegation which would tentamount to abdication. At the same time, one must be aware of the practical reality that the parliament cannot go into details of all legislative matters. (906 D-E] (7) The making of law is only a means to achieve a purpose.
 It is not a end in itself. That end can be attained by the legislature making the law. But many topics or subjects of legislation are such that they require expertise, technical knowledge and a degree of adaptability to changing situations etc., which parliament might not possess and, therefore this end is better secured by extensive delegation of legislative power. The legislative process would frequently bog down if a legislature were required to appraise before hand the myriad situations to which it wishes a particular policy to be applied and to formulate specific rules for each situation. [906 G] (8)In the present case, by Sec. 8 (2) (b) of the Act, parliament has not delegated any power to the State legislatures. Therefore, the question was whether parliament had abdicated its legislative function when it chose to adopt the rate to be fixed by the state legislatures for local sales. In the present case, parliament bad fixed the rate of tax on inter-state sales of the description specified in s. 8(2)(b) of the Act at the rate fixed by the appropriate state legislature is respect of intra-state-sales with a purpose, namely to chech evation and to prevent discrimination between residents of different states. Further, in the instant case. parliament can repeal the provisions of s. 8(2)(b) adopting a higher rate of tax fixed by the appropriate state legislature in respect of intrastate sales. If parliament can repeal the provision, there can be no objection on the score that parliament has abdicated its legislative function. It retains its control over the fixation of the rate itself.

 Therefore there is no excessive delegation of legislative power as contended by the petitioner.
