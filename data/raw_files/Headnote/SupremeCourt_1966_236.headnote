 The Executive Committee of Mizo District Council refused to further renew the temporary licence issued to the appellant, a non-trader, for trading in Mizo District. The licence could be issued for one year only and the appellant was trading after applying and obtaining its renewal from time to time. The appellant filed a writ petition, contending, that the order was mala fide in the sense that though the reason given for refusal was that the number of non-Tribal traders had reached the maximum, the Committee had in fact granted licences to new traders, and that the said order and s. 3 of the Lushai Hills District (Trading by non-Tribals) Regulation, 1953 was invalid being violative of Art. 19(1) (g) of the Constitution. The High Court maintained the order. In appeal to this Court.
 
HELD : (Per Subba Rao, C. J. and Shelat, J.) : Section 3 of the Regulation is violative of Art. 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.
 Even if the Sixth Schedule can be said to contain a policy and the Regulation may be said to have been enacted in pursuance of such a policy an analysis of the Regulation shows that that is not sufficient. Even if a statute lays down' a policy it is conceivable that its implementation may be left in such an arbitrary manner that the statute providing for such implementation would -amount to an unreasonable restriction. A provision which leaves an unbridled power to an authority cannot in any sense be characterised as reasonable. Section 3 of the Regulation is one such provision'.
 The Regulation contains no principle or criterion on which the Executive Committee should grant or refuse to grant a licence or its renewal; nor does it provide any machinery under which an applicant can show cause why his application for a licence or its renewal should not be rejected; nor does it provide any superior authority before whom such an applicant can establish that the refusal by the Committee is arbitrary or without any proper cause; and it leaves the trader not only at the mercy of the Committee but also without any remedy.
 In the present case, the Committee had given the reason for refusal to renew the licence, but the order did not state what that maximum was or who prescribed such a number and under what authority or what was the criterion for fixing any particular maximum. [1020 D; 1021 A-F] (Per Bachawat, J. dissenting) : Section 3 of the Regulation is not violative of Arts. 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.
 If paragraph 10 of the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution cannot be regarded as violative of any provision in the Constitution, it is impossible to say that s. 3 of the Regulation which is in strict conformity with paragraph 10 is violative of Arts. 14 and 19(1)(g). The protection of the 1013.
 interests of the Scheduled Tribes is to be the guiding policy regulating the exercise of the discretion of the District Council. in. the matter of granting or withholding trading licences to non-tribal traders.
 In the present case, the Executive Committee found that the maximum limit of non-tribal traders had been reached, and in the interest of the tribal it was not desirable to issue licence to more non-tribal traders. It was neither alleged nor shown that the Committee discriminated between similarly situated persons. [1023 G; 1024 C-D; 1025 H ],
