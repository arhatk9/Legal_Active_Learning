 Under the Cement Control Order, 1961 passed by the Government of India in exercise of powers under s. 18(g) of the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act of 1951, producers of cement were obliged to sell all the cement produced by them to the State Trading Corporation ,at the prices laid down in the order. Subseqently in order to provide an incentive to the producers to increase their output it was provided in the order that if a producer's output was in excess of a certain specified quantity, then the payment for such excess would be made at a higher rate.
 The workers of the appellant companies asked for a share in the incentive payment on the contention that they had contributed to the excess in production. The Industrial Tribunal in its award held that the companies and their workmen were entitled to share the incentive payment on a fifty-fifty basis. In appeal by special leave, 
HELD : There is nothing in law which prevents a buyer and seller fromagreeing that whatever the seller can offer upto a (certain quantity willbe paid for at a particular rate and any quantity over and above that , figure will be for at a higher rate.The total amount which the seller would receive can only be called price even if the contract of sale was so 'worded as to show that the excess amount was to be treated as an incentive payment. Therefore the argument that the workers were entitled to a share of the extra payment de hors the question of any profit could not be accepted. Under the Industrial Law as propounded by this Court the workers can lay no such claim. r685F, 686D] New Maneck Chowk Spg. & Wvg. Co. Ltd. v.

 Cement Control Order even if it offered some inducement to the producers to step up their production, the terms thereof did not entitle the Tribunal to treat it as and by way of incentive bonus in which the workmen could share. It was certainly up to the producer to intimate the workmen that under the terms of the Control Order an extra amount of money would come to the till of the company if production was increased and the producers could have settled what incentive should 'be offered to the workmen, but merely because an extra amount of money which was as and by way of price would find its way into the till of the company because the production target was exceeded, the workmen did 675 not become entitled ipso facto to lay a claim to the excess amount and the Industrial Tribunal was not entitled to take the view that because an increase in production can only come about with the cooperation of the workmen they automatically became entitled to a share thereof. An industrial court can only award what the law allows. In the absence of legislation on the subject and in the absence of a scheme for incentive payment introduced by the management, in the particular facts and circumstances of the case, the claim on the part of the workmen had to be negatived.
