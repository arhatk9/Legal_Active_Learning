 The appellants were charged with offences under s. 5(2) & 5(1) (c) and 5(1) (d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 as well as under ss. 467 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code by the Special Judge, Gauhati. The appellants filed revision petitions in the High Court of Assam & Nagaland.
 On difference of opinion arising between the two Judges of the Division Bench reference was made to a third Judge under s. 429 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Before the third Judge a new plea was advanced on behalf of the appellants, namely that the Magistrate at Delhi had no jurisdiction to accord sanction to an Inspector of the Delhi Special Police Establishment to investigate the case in Assam. The third Judge held that an order of a Magistrate of the local jurisdiction was necessary and excepting a Magistrate of the District where the crime was committed no other Magistrate outside the jurisdiction could make an order for investi- gation. In the result the proceedings before the Special Judge were quashed. In appeal by certificate to this Court, 
HELD:(i) The contention that the third learned Judge could only deal with the difference between the two learned Judges and not with the whole case could not be accepted.
 The language of s. 429 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is explicit that the case with the opinion of the Judges comprising the court of appeal shall be laid before another Judge of the same court. The other noticeable feature in s.
 429 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is that the judgment or order shall follow the opinion of the third learned Judge. Further more, the appeal is from the order of the third learned Judge as it must be by reason of the divided opinion of the Bench. [463D] Hethuba & Ors. v. State of Gujarat, Cr. A. No. 100/67 dt.

 (ii)Section 12 of the Code of Criminal Procedure empowers the State Government to appoint besides the District Magistrate, Magistrates of the first, second or third class in any district and the State Government may from time to time define local areas within which such Magistrate may exercise all or any of the powers with which they may be invested under the Code. Section 12(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure enacts that except as otherwise provided the jurisdiction and powers of such Magistrates shall extend throughout such district. It therefore follows that the Magistrates of the first class of a district have powers within defined local areas within the district and their jurisdiction and powers may in certain 461 cases extend throughout such district. The Magistrate at Delhi can in certain cases exercise jurisdiction and power throughout the district where he is appointed. [464E-G] It will not be' in consonance with the jurisdiction and structure of courts of Magistrates to allow an order of investigation to be made by a Magistrate of Delhi for investigation of a case in the State of Assam. The reason is that a Magistrate orders investigation in a case which he has power to inquire into or try. The real import of s. 5A of the Prevention of Corruption Act is that investigation is to be done by Police Officers of a certain rank to ensure protection against frivolous, prosecution, and it is only with the order of Presidency Magistrate or a Magistrate of the first class that Police Officers below the rank mentioned in the section are allowed to investigate. It is therefore appropriate that Magistrates in Presidency towns or District will order investigation of cases within their respective jurisdiction. The effect of s. 5A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, is that it is a special Act which confers power on Presidency Magistrates throughout the Presidency town and Magistrates of the first class through- out the District when they exercise powers under the Code of Criminal Procedure. Therefore in cases governed by s. 5A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Magistrates of the first class will exercise jurisdiction throughout the district irrespective of defined areas of their jurisdiction within the district by reason of s. 12(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. [465A-E] In the present appeals, the order of investigation made by the Magistrate at Delhi for investigation of cases in the State of Assam was not a valid and competent order within the powers of the Magistrate at Delhi. Ile orders of investigation were therefore rightly quashed by the High Court. [465E-F]
