 The order of detention passed under s. 3(2) (1) of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971 against the petitioner stated that with a view to preventing him from acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order, it was necessary to detain him. The grounds of detention set out one incident of dacoity in a third class compartment of a running train where cash money was stolen by him. in his affidavit the District Magistrate stated that he was also satisfied that the petitioner was likely to act in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community. In a petition under art. 32 of the Constitution it was contended that there was no nexus between the grounds of detention communicated to him and the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority.
 Allowing the petition.
 
HELD : The order of detention must be held to be invalid since the incident of dacoity in a third class compartment of a running train for committing theft of money which constituted the solitary ground of detention was wholly irrelevant and the subjective satisfaction of the District Magistrate that the petitioner would be likely to act in a manner prejudicial to maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community could not be founded upon it and was therefore colourable and no satisfaction at all. [592B- C] (2) The contention that the averment in the affidavit in reply had crept in through a mistake cannot be accepted as correct. The affidavit in reply had been made by the District Magistrate himself and it must be presumed that he made the statements with the sense of responsibility which his high office necessarily carried. If the District Magistrate was also not subjectively satisfied in regard to the likelihood of the petitioner to act in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community, he would not have made such an averment in the affidavit in reply.
