 The appellant-tenant had advanced a sum of Rs.2,000 to the landlord in order to secure the tenancy under an agreement which provided that loan amount was to be adjusted against the rent which accrued subsequently. The respondent- landlord filed a suit against the appellant-tenant for eviction on the ground of arrears of rent. The lower appellate court dismissed the suit holding that the tenant was not in arrears of rent since the amount advanced by the tenant was sufficient to cover the landlord's claim of arrears. But, the High Court in appeal by the respondent- landlord set aside the judgment of the lower appellate court holding that the loan advanced by the tenant was in violation of the prohibition contained in s.3 of the Bihar Buildings (Lease, Rent & Eviction) Control Act and therefore he was in arrears of rent and liable to be evicted.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD : 1.(i) The tenant was not in arrears of rent. The judgment and decree passed by the High Court are set aside and the judgment and decree of the lower appellate court are restored. [626 G] 1(ii) A greater judicial sin than the sin of treating the 'oppressor' and the 'oppressed' on a par, or that of rewarding the oppressor and punishing the oppressed, whilst 623 administering the law designed to protect the oppressed cannot be conceived. The Court would be guilty of committing this sin if it upholds the view that the tenant who advances a loan to the landlord in order to secure the tenancy (in violation of the prohibition to do so embodied in the statute enacted for his benefit) is in pari delicto. [624 B] In the instant case, the parties to the contract were unequal. It was the landlord, who was in the position of an oppressor, who wanted to exploit the situation obtaining in the context of the acute housing shortage which prevailed.
 The tenant had either to yield to the unlawful demand of the landlord, or go without a roof, for otherwise, the landlord would not have granted the lease. The relevant provision prohibiting the payment of rent in advance embodied in the Rent Act was enacted precisely to protect the tenant from such exploitation. To deny access to justice to a tenant who is obliged to yield to the unlawful demands of the landlord in this scenerio by invoking the doctrine of pari-delicto is to add insult to injury, and to negate the very purpose of the provision designed for his protection. The doctrine of pari delicto embodying the rule that a party to a transaction prohibited by law cannot enforce his claim in a court of law is not attracted in a situation like the present. [624 H; 625 A-D] 
 2. The doctrine of pari-delicto is not designed to reward the 'wrong-doer' or to penalize the 'wronged', by denying to the victim of exploitation access to justice. The doctrine is attracted only when none of the parties is a victim of such exploitation and both parties have voluntarily and by their free will joined hands to flout the law for their mutual gain.
