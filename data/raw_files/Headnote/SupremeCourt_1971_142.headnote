 The Arya Samaj is a reformist movement, believes in one God and in the Vedas as. the books of true knowledge, It has a distinct Organisation the membership of which is open to all those who subscribe to its aims and objects. It admits to membership only those Hindus who Subscribe to the decalogue and its beliefs in the cannons of Vedic interpretation laid down by its founder, but, all outsiders who are non-Hindus must undergo a ceremony of purification or Shudhi, Under bye-law 32 of the Constitution of the Arya Samaj the proceedings of all meetings and sub-committees will have to be written in Arya Bhasha-In Hindi language and Devnagari character.
 The Dayanand Anglo Vedic College Trust, formed to perpetuate the memory of the founder of the Arya Samaj runs various institutions in the Country. The petitioners-colleges managed and administered by the Trust and the Managing Society were, before the Punjab Reorganisation Act, affi- liated to the Punjab University constituted under East Punjab Act 7 of 1947. After the reorganisation of the State of Punjab in 1969, the Punjab Legislature passed the Guru Nanak University (Amritsar) Act (21 of 1969) establishing a University. In exercise of the powers conferred by s. 5 the first respondent specified the districts in the State of Punjab over which the University was to exercise its power and notified the date on which the colleges in the areas so specified ceased to be affiliated to the Punjab University and were to be associated with and admitted to the privileges of the new university. Sub-section (2) of s. 4 of the Act enacted that the University "shall make provision for study and research on the life and teachings of Guru Nanak and their cultural and religious impact in the context of Indian and World Civilisation; and sub-s. (3) enjoined the University "to promote studies to provide for research in Punjabi language and literature and to undertake measures for the development of Punjabi language, literature and culture". By cl. 2(1) (a) of the Statutes in Ch. V, framed under the Act, the colleges were required to have a regularly constituted governing body consisting of not more than 20 persons approved by the senate including, among others, two representatives of the University and the principal of the College, ex officio. Under Cl. (1) (3) if these requirements were not complied with the affiliation was liable to be withdrawn. By cl. 18 the staff initially appointed were to be approved by the Vice Chancellor and subsequent changes had to be reported to the University for the Vice-Chancellor's approval. And by cl. 18 non- government colleges were to comply with the requirements laid down in the ordinance governing service and conduct of teachers.
 689 In petitions filed under Art. 32 of the Constitution it was contended that the main object of the Act was to propagate Sikh religion and to promote Punjabi language in Gurumukhi script and that since the petitioners institutions belonged to a minority based on religion and language their compulsory affiliation violated Arts. 29(1) and 30(1) of the Constitution. In support of this it was submitted that s.
 5(3) of the Act and also cls. 2(1)(a), 17 and 18 of the statutes in Ch. V. interfered with the management of minority institutions and therefore violated the guarantee under Art. 30; that the statutory affiliation being compulsory affected the petitioners freedom of association guaranteed under Art. 19(1) (c); and that ss. 4(2) and 4(3) contravened Arts. 29(1) & 30(1) and was discriminatory. The petitioners further contended that in view of s. 72 of the Reorganisation Act the State Legislature was not competent to enact s. 5 which empowered the State Government by notification to compulsorily disaffiliate from the Punjab University all colleges including the colleges of minorities and affiliate them to the new University. The respondents contended inter alia, that education being a State subject, the state legislature alone was competent to legislate in respect of universities and that in any case in a petition under Art. 32 this Court could not go into the question of legislative competence if the law that was impugned did not in any way affect the fundamental rights of the petitioners.
 
HELD:(1) Whether or not ultimately any fundamental right in fact is threatened or violated so long as a prima facie case of such a threat or violation is made out a petition under Art. 32 must be entertained. So long as the petitioner makes out a prima facie case that his fundamental rights are affected or threatened he cannot be prevented from challenging that the law complained of, which affects or invades those rights, is invalid because of want of legislative competence.. But the proposition that once the petition is entertained, irrespective of whether it is found ultimately that the law has infringed the fundamental rights of the petitioners, the vires of the legislation or the competence of the legislature to enact the impugned legislation must be gone into and determined, is not valid.
 If in fact, the law does not, even on the assumption that it is valid, infringe any fundamental rights this Court will not decide that question in a petition under Art. 32. The reason is that no petition under Art. 32 will be entertained if fundamental rights are not affected and if the impugned law does not affect the fundamental rights it would be contrary to this principle to determine whether that law in fact has legislative competence or not. In the present case none of the provisions of the Act offend any of the fundamental rights of the petitioners. Therefore, it is not necessary to go into the question of legislative competence or to decide upon the validity of s. 5. [713A-B ; 714H] Mohammad Yasin v. The Town Area Committee, Jalatabad z Anr.

 (2)A reading of Arts. 29(1) and 30(1)would lead to the conclusion that a religious or linguistic minority has a right to establish and administer educational institutions of its choice for effectively conserving its distinctive language script or culture subject to the regulatory power of the State and cl. (2) of Art. 29. While this is so, these two articles are not inter-linked nor does it permit of their being always read together. [695F] Rev. Father W. Proost & Ors. v.

 44-1 S.C. India/71 690 (3)Religious or linguistic minorities are to be determined only in relation to the particular legislation which is sought to be impugned; if it is State Legislature these minorities have to be determined in relation to the population of the State. A linguistic minority for the purpose of Art 30(1) is one which must at least have a separate spoken language; it is not necessary that the language should also have distinct script. [697B] Re: Kerala Education Bill, 1957, [1959] S.C.R. 995, referred to.
 (4)(a) The Arya Samaj, by "rejecting the manifold absurdities found in Smriti and in tradition and in seeking a basis in the early literature for a purer and more rational faith" can be considered to be a religious mino- rity, at any rate, as part of the Hindu religious minority in the State of Punjab. [700D] (b)The Arya Samajis have a distinct script of their own, namely Devnagri. [701B] (5)The Arya Samajis are entitled to invoke the right guaranteed by Art. 29(1), because, they are a section of citizens having a distinct script; they are entitled to invoke Art. 30(1), because they are a religious minority.
 [701B] [In view of the holding that Arya Samajis are a religious minority the Court did not find it necessary to consider whether they are a linguistic minority or whether they are a religious denomination.] [698G] (6)Clauses 2(1) (a) and 17 of Ch. V of the Statutes interfere with the right of the religious minority to administer their educational institutions. These provisions cannot be made as conditions of affiliation non compliance with which would involve disaffiliation; consequently, they have to be struck down as offending Art. 30(1).

 Clause 18 does not suffer from the same vice as cl. 17, because, that provision empowers the University to make ordinances prescribing regulations governing the conditions of service and conduct of teachers and these are enacted in the larger interest of the institution to ensure their efficiency and excellence. While the power to make ordinances in respect of the matters referred to is unexceptional the nature of the infringement of the right, if any, under Art. 30(1) will depend on the actual purpose and import of the ordinance when made, and the manner in which it is likely to affect the administration of the educational institution. [709C] (7)Assuming that the Punjab Legislature has the competence to enact the Act, sub-ss. (2) and (3) of s. 4 do not offend, by themselves, any of the rights under Arts. 29(1) & 30(1).
 [702A] (a)Sub-section (2) merely indicates that the University can institute courses of study or provide research facilities for any student of the University whether he belongs to the majority or the minority community to engage himself in such study or research; but, this study and research on the life and teachings of Guru Nanak must be a study in relation to their culture and religious impact in the context of Indian and World civilizations. To provide for academic study of life and teaching or the 691 philosophy or culture of any great saint of India in relation to or the impact on the Indian and World civilizations cannot be considered as making provision for religious instructions. [703G] (b)While the State or the University has every right to provide for the education of the, majority in the regional medium, it is subject to the restrictions contained in Arts.
 25 to 30. Neither the University nor the State can provide for imparting education in a medium of instruction in a language and script which stifles the language and script of any section ,of the citizens. But sub-s. (3) does not lend itself to the interpretation ,that the medium of instruction of all affiliated colleges has to be Punjabi. The provision is for the promotion of Punjabi language, literature and culture. Therefore, sub-section (3) does not transgress the guarantee under Art. 29(1). [704A-D] (c)The facts of the case do not attract Art. 14. The State of Punjab is created as a unilingual state with Punjabi as its language and if provision is made for study of punjabi language that does not furnish a ground .for discrimination nor can the provision for the study of the life and teaching of Guru Nanak afford any cause for complaint, since, in neither case there is any compulsion on any person to undertake such studies; nor is .any of the communities prohibited from pursuing studies in respect of either Hindi or the life and teachings of any Hindu saint.
 [704F] (8)The notification under s. 5(3) compulsorily affiliating the colleges to the University does not contravene the right of freedom of Association ,guaranteed under Art. 19(1) (c).
 Section 5 does not interfere with the D.A.V. College Trust and Management Society by any attempt to form an Association with the University. [706B] All India Bank Employees Association v.
