 The appellant, a grocer, sold compounded asafoetida in sealed tins received from a licenced manufacturer. The appellant stored it properly and sold it in the same slate as he purchased it. The Food Inspector took sample of 100 gms., instead of 200 gms. as provided by rule 22. On analysis it was found that alcoholic content was less than the minimum prescribed and therefore, the compounded asafoetida was adulterated.
 The Trial Court acquitted the appellant. On appeal by the State. the High ,Court convicted the appellant and sentenced him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one year and to pay a fine of Rs. 1,000/-.
 On appeal to this Court the appellant contended that he was protected by section 19(2) (a) (i) because he purchased the compounded asafoetida from a duly licensed manufacturer and sold it in the same state as he purchased it. The appellant contended that the words "written warranty in the prescribed form" attached only to section 19 (2) (a) (ii) and not s. 19 (2) (a) (i). The appellant also ,contended that since instead of 200 gms. as required by rule 22 the Food Ins- pector took only 100 gms. as the sample he was entitled to be acquitted.
 
HELD : (i) It follows from rule 12A that the manufacturer has to print a label containing a warranty. Warranty is required by cases covered under section 19(2)(a)(i) and 19(2)(a)(ii). Otherwise adulterated goods could be sold with impunity. These salutary provisions are designed for the health of the nation. No laxity should be permitted.

 (ii) The Public Analyst did not have the quantities mentioned in the rules for analysis. The non-compliance with the quantity to be supplied caused not only infraction of the provisions but also injustice. The shortage in quantity for analysis is not permitted by the statute. The High Court was in error in convicting the appellant on analysis which was not in compliance with the provisions of the Statute. [889F-H]
