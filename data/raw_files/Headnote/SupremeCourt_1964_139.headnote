 The appellant was a tenant of the ground floor of a house owned by respondent. The respondent sued for ejectment of the appellant on the ground that he required the entire house including the portion occupied by appellant, for his residential purpose. The defence of the appeRant was that respondent did not reasonably and bona fide require the premises for his occupation and for carrying out repairs.
 The trial court decreed the suit of the respondent on the ground that respondent bona fide required the premises for his occupation. Ile appeal of the appellant was dismissed, His revision petition was -also dismissed by High Court.
 The appellant came to this Court by special leave. The only question for decision before this Court was whether the case of respon'dent came within the provisions of s. 13 ( I ) (g) or s. 13 (1) (hh), Dismissing the appeal, HELI):-The case of respondent fell under cl. (g) as he required the premises for his own occupation. The mere fact that he intended to, make alterations in the house either on account of his sweet will or on account of absolute necessity in view of the condition of the house, did not affect the question of his requiring the house bonafide and reasonably for his occupation, when he had proved his need for occupying the house. There was no such prohibition either in the language of cl. (g) or in any other provision of the Act to the effect that the landlord must occupy the house for residence without making any alteration in it, There could be no logical reason for such a prohibition.
 The provisions of s. 13 are for the benefit of the landlord and the various grounds for ejectment mentioned in that section are such which reasonably justify the ejectment of the tenant in the exercise of the landlord's general right to eject his tenant. There is no reason why restrictions not mentioned in the grounds be read into them. The provisions of cl. (hh) cannot possibly apply to a case where a landlord reasonably and bona fide requires the premises for his own occupation even if he had to demolish the premises and erect a new building on them. The provisions of cl. (hh) apply to cases where the landlord does not require the premises for his own occupation but requires them for erecting a new building which is to be let out to tenants.
