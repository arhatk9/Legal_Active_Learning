 The appellant was tried by the Sessions Judge with the aid of assessors for an offence under s. 409, I.P.C. for misappropriating certain sums of money received as promoter of a Company from three ,different persons for the purpose of allotment of shares and omitted to be brought into the Company after it was formed, and also for an offence under s. 477-A, I.P.C. by the same Sessions Judge with the aid of a jury for the offence of falsifying a minute book, the same persons acting both as assessors and jurors. They returned a verdict of not guilty in respect of both the charges. The Sessions Judge, disagreeing with the verdict of the jury under s. 477-A, referred the matter to the High Court under s. 307 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Disagreeing also with the opinion of the assessors in respect of the charge under s. 409, I.P.C. he held the appellant guilty and sentenced him to 4 years' rigorous imprisonment. Against this conviction the appellant appealed to the High Court.
 Both the reference under s. 307 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the appeal were heard together by the High Court which confirmed the appellant's conviction under s.
 409 and the sentence passed by the Sessions Judge and disagreeing with the verdict of the jury it held him guilty under s. 477-A and sentenced him to two years' rigorous imprisonment. On appeal by special leave to the Supreme Court:- Held (i) that the contention that when the Sessions Judge disagreed with the verdict of the jury and the opinion of the assessors, 1036 he should have referred the whole case under s. 307 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to the High Court and not merely that part of it which related to the charge under s. 477-A, I.P.C. was without force because the Sessions Judge had contravened no provision of law and committed no illegality in deciding the case which related to the charge under s.
 409, I.P.C. That s. 307, Code of Criminal Procedure applies in terms only to trials by a jury and the Sessions Judge had no power under that section to refer cases tried with the aid of assessors for the decision of the High Court. In the present case there was the further fact that both the appeal against the conviction under s. 409, I.P.C. and the reference under s. 307 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in respect of the charge under s. 477-A were disposed of by the same judgment;
 (ii)that the contention that the appellant's true status was that of a servant and not that of an agent and that he should have been tried not under s. 409, I.P.C. but under s.
 408, I.P.C. was also without force inasmuch as his status was that of an agent and not that of a servant in view of his duties as Secretary of the Society. The distinction between the two is this a servant acts under the direct control and supervision of the master, and is bound to con- form to all reasonable orders given to him in the course of his work. An agent though bound to exercise his authority in accordance with all lawful instructions which may be given to him from time to time by his principal, is not subject in its exercise to the direct control or supervision of the principal;
 (iii)that the contention that there had been violation of s.
 234 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in that the appellant had been charged with three offences under s. 409, I.P.C.
 and one under s. 477-A was also without force as the case was governed by s. 235 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as the several offences under s. 409, I.P.C. and s. 477-A, I.P.C. arose out of the same acts and formed part of the same transaction.
