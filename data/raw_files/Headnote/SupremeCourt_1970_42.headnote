 The appellant-landlord applied to the Rent Control & Eviction Officer under s. 3 of the U.P. (Temporary) Control of Rent &*Eviction Art, 1947 for permission to file a suit for a decree in ejectment against the respondent-tenant.
 The officer granted the permission, holding that the need of the appellant to occupy the premises was bona fide and genuine. This order was confirmed in a 'revision application by the Additional Commissioner. 'Me appellant then terminated the tenancy by notice and filed suits in the Civil Court for ejectment and arrears of rent. The trial court decreed the suits, which were confirmed by the appellate court. But in second appeal, the High Court observed that it was incumbent on the Rent Control and Eviction Officer to consider the needs of the tenant, and since he refused to consider the tenant's needs the permission was invalid, and the appellant's suits were liable to be dismissed. In appeal, this Court, 
HELD:The decision of the Rent Control and Eviction Officer was not in the suits filed by the appellant open to objection.
 The proceeding under s. 3(2) before the District Magistrate or before the Rent Control & Eviction Officer, who exercises his powers as delegated under the Act, and before the Commissioner under s. 3(3) of the U.P. (Temporary) Control of Rent and Eviction Act are quasi-judicial in character.
 By sub-section (4) of s. 3 of the Act the decision of the Commissioner under sub-s. (3) of s. 3, subject to any order passed by the State Government under s. 7-F of the Act, is declared final. The -respondent did not prefer any petition before the State Government under s. 7-F of the Act and on that -account the order passed by the Additional Commis- sioner, exercising powers of the Commissioner under s. 3(3), became final. Finality of the order declared by s. 3(4) and s. 16 of the Act does not exclude the jurisdiction under Art. 226 of the Constitution to issue an appropriate writ quashing the order. But subject to interference by the High Court, the decision must be deemed final and is not liable to be challenged in any collateral proceeding. [817 B-D] Even granting that the Additional Commissioner reached a wrong conclusion, the decision was not without jurisdiction and the only avenue for correction is the one provided by the Act, i.e. by approaching the State Government under s.
 7-F. [817 H] Asa Singh v. B. D. Sanwal & Ors. A.I.R. 1969 All. 474, held inapplicable.
