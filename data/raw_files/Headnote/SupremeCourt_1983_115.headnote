 The petitioners opened video parlour by installing electronic machine with video screen and permitted persons to enter the premises without any charge to view a show on the video which consisted mainly of sports, games etc.
 played on the screen of the video. The show lasting upto 30 seconds was operated by inserting SO paise coin into the video machine by an operator from the audience who wanted to operate the video machine. While one High Court was of the view that-the video games were included in the definition of entertainment and were liable to entertainment tax, two other High Courts were of the opposite view. The petitioners filed the present writ petitions contending that in view of the manner in which the video games were shown and also in view of the fact that these games, sports etc. involved a great amount of skill for the operator, the video games would not be an entertainment within the meaning of sub-sec, (3) of sec. 2.
 Dismissing the petitions, ^ HELD: The video show is an entertainment under soc.
 2(1) and therefore exigible to tax under sec. 3. [821 A-B] A perusal of the various shades, aspects, forms and implications of the word 'entertainment as defined in different books and dictionaries clearly leads to an irresistible inference that the word `entertainment' has been used in a very wide sense so as to include within its ambit, entertainment of any kind including one which may be purely educative. Sub-sec. (3) of sec. 2 itself by using the word 'entertainment as "any exhibitional, performance, amusement, game or sport to which persons are admitted for payment" has extended the scope of entertainment to expressly include any kind of amusement, game or sport. When a number of people without any admission fee enter a hall for entertainment and enjoy the games it becomes a public show and the hall where the video is played becomes a public hall and amounts therefore to a 813 public exhibition which is squarely covered by the first limb (exhibitional) of the definition of entertainment in sub-sec. (3) of sec. 2. [817 A-B, E-E] Porritts & Spencer (Asia) Ltd. v. State of Haryana, [1978] INSC 156; [1979] 1 S.C.R. 545; Stroud's Judicial Dictionary (4th Edn;

 In the present case by operating the video, the operator of the video pays 50 paise per 30 seconds for playing the games, sports and other kind of performances which are shown on the machine and which can be watched by interested spectators. The circumstances that no admission fee is charged from viewers seeing the video by itself, however, cannot defuse or alter the kind of entertainment deprived by the person who pays for playing the games. The operator of video would deprive pleasure and be entertained regardless of whether the possesses skill or not. If he possesses skill he may derive more pleasure on less payment otherwise he will have to pay but he will derive pleasure all the same. That he would not pay money if it did not thrill, amuse, and entertain him, is obvious. Besides, the game brings a substantial return for the person who makes available these facilities.
