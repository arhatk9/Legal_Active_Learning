 The respondent was temporarily appointed as Professor (Junior Scale) in the Department of Irrigation and Hydraulics, Punjab. Subsequently, he was selected as Professor (Junior Scale) on regular basis in the Civil Engineering Department of the Punjab Engineering College. In view of the fact that the post of professor (Junior Scale) was not vacant in the Civil Engineering Department, he was adjusted on ad hoc basis against the vacant post of Professor (P.G. Course) in the Department of Irrigaion and Hydraulics in his own grade from 28.6.1969 to 14.2.1971 and thereafter from 15.2.1971 to 29.9.1973 against the post of Professor (Senior Scale) in the Civil Engineering Department. From 29.9.1973 he was selected as Professor (Senior Scale) on regular basis.
 The respondent was not paid his pay and allowances for the period for which he worked against the post of Professor (P.G. Course) or (Senior Scale) on ad hoc basis from 28.6.1969 to 29.9.1973. He filed an application before the Central Administrative Tribunal Chandigarh claiming pay and allowances for the aforesaid period which was allowed. In accordance with the judgment of the Tribunal he was sanctioned pay and allowances but the period for which he worked on ad hoc basis was not reckoned for the purposes of seniority. He filed an application before the Tribunal claiming seniority on the post of Professor (Senior Scale) counting the entire period of his continuous ad hoc appointment from 28.6.1969 to 29.9.1973. The Tribunal held that the respondent was given ad hoc appointment on the post of Professor (Senior Scale) from 1969 to 1973 after consultation with 460 the Union Public Service Commission and as such he was entitled to claim his seniority from 28.6.1969. Against the order of the Tribunal an appeal was filed in this Court.
 Allowing the appeal and setting aside the order of the Tribunal, this Court, 
 HELD : 1. The respondent was not entitled to claim his seniority on the post of Professor (Senior scale) from 28.6.1969 and the appellants had rightly counted his seniority from 29.9.1973 when he was regularly selected in accordance with rules on the said post. [465C] 
 2. The order of the Tribunal granting pay and allowances cannot confer any right on the respondent to claim seniority on the post of Professor (Senior Scale). The approval of U.P.S.C. for the continuation of the respondent on the post of Professor (Senior scale) on ad hoc basis was merely for the purpose of granting pay and allowances and it cannot be considered as a regular appointment of the respondent on the post of Professor (Senior scale).
 Therefore, the Tribunal was totally wrong in granting seniority to the respondent for the period of ad hoc appointment on the post of Professor (Senior scale). [463-H, 464A] Narender Chadha and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors., [1986] INSC 14; [1986] 2 S.C.C. 157, distinguished.
