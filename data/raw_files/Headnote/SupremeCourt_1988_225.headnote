 The Superintendent of Central Excise issued a show cause notice on November 15, 1981 to the respondent for recovery of `excess production' rebate erroneously granted under Notification No. 108/78. The Assistant Collector, however, on July 31, 1982 held that there was no excess Production because of wilful incorrect statement or suppression of facts and so held that the notice was barred by lapse of time and dropped the demand.
 The Collector of Central Excise exercising powers under Section 35A(2) of the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944 issued a review show cause notice on October 6, 1982 and adjudicated the case thereafter.
 The Central Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal having allowed the appeal of the respondent, the Revenue challenged the said order in this Court.
 Dismissing the Appeal, 
 HELD: 1. Section IIA of the Act would come into operation only when the demand is on account of Central Excise duty short levied or not levied or refunded erroneously. The issue in the instant case, was not any of the said reasons. [460E] PG NO 458 PG NO 459 
 2. Where the duty has been levied without the authority of Law or without reference to any statutory authority or the specific provisions of the Act and the Rules framed thereunder have no application, the decision will be guided by the general Law and the date of Limitation would be the starting point when the mistake or the error would come into light. [460F] 
 3. In making claims for refund before the departmental authority as assessee is bound within the four corners of the Statute and the period of limitation prescribed in the Central Excise Act and the Rules framed thereunder must be adhered to. The authority functioning under the Act are bound by the provisions of the Act. If the proceedings are taken under the Act by the department the provisions of limitation prescribed in the Act will prevail. [460G1 
 4. It may, however, be open to the department to initiate proceedings in the Civil Court for recovery of the amount due to the department in case such a remedy is open on the ground that the money received by the assessee was 2not in the nature of refund.
