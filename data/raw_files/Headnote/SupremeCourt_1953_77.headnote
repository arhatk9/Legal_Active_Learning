 The word "consent" in s. 30(2) of the Indian Sale of Goods Act means "agreeing on the same thing in the same sense" as defined in s. 13 of the Indian Contract Act and does not mean "free consent" as defined in s. 14. Therefore, possession of goods which is obtained by a person from another person who has agreed to sell them to him, would be possession obtained "with the consent of the seller" within the meaning of s. 30(2) of the Sale of Goods Act, even though it was obtained by fraud, except where the fraud committed is of such a character as would prevent there being consent at all.
 The fact that the fraud or deception practised by the person obtaining possession is of such a character as to make him guilty of a criminal offence would not make any difference in the application of this principle.
 A agreed to sell certain shares to B and sent the share certificates and blank transfer deeds to the defendant bank to deliver them to B on receiving payment of the price. The bank 392 sent one of its clerks to B's office with these papers. The clerk placed them on the table and allowed B to scrutinise then but insisted on payment of the price before B took them. B left his office with these documents saying that he was going out to bring the money but disappeared and subsequently pledged them with the plaintiff Held, that in these circumstances B obtained possession of the shares without the consent of A and that the plaintiff did not acquire any title against the defendant bank or A.
