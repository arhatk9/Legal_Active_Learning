 Rule 6(3) of the Delhi Higher Judicial Service Rules, 1970, provides that the seniority of the candidates appointed at the initial constitution of the service shall be in accordance with the "length of service rendered by them in the cadre to which they belong" at the time of their initial recruitment to the service. Under Rule 6(1) the appointment is to be made substantially from amongst District Judges and Additional District Judges, functioning as such in the union territory of Delhi on deputation from other States and those recommended by their respective States.
 Respondents 2, 3 and 4 were appointed prior to the appellant as temporary Additional District and Sessions Judges in the Cadre of District and Additional District and Sessions Judge in their respective States. The appellant was confirmed against permanent post in his parent State, before respondent 3, while respondents 2 and 4 were not confirmed.
 When the appellant and the respondents were appointed substantively, in May 1971, to the Delhi Higher Judicial Service the respondents were given seniority over the appellant since the length of service rendered by the respondents in the cadre of District and Additional District to Sessions Judges to which they belonged at the time of initial recruitment was longer than that of the appellant.
 The High Court rejected a writ petition by the appellant against the fixation of seniority.
 In the appeal to this Court the appellant contended that the expression "the length of service rendered by them in the cadres to which they belong" meant the length of service in substantive appointment to permanent posts, and that for purpose of seniority what was relevant was the date of confirmation and not the date of appointment in an officiating or temporary capacity.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : that the respondents had been rightly treated as senior to the appellant.
 (1) The words "in the cadre to which they belong" in rule 6(3) cover the cases of permanent as well as temporary Additional District and Sessions Judges at the time of initial recruitment. The Rules were framed for those who were functioning as Additional District and Sessions Judges at Delhi and the Delhi Higher Judicial Service was constituted with persons who rendered service as Additional District and Sessions Judges in temporary posts or in temporary capacity against permanent posts. The word "cadre" includes both temporary and permanent posts. To confine cadre to permanent posts would render the rules totally unworkable and impracticable, because at the time of initial recruitment the persons came on deputation from States mostly in their temporary capacity as Addition,-it District and Sessions Judges. [983 C; A; 984 E--F] (ii) The important yardstick in the determination of seniority is the length of service rendered in a cadre.
 Where confirmation is the decisive factor to determine the seniority, rules state so. Confirmation depends on the accident of permanent posts failing vacant. To determine seniority according to confirmation is to wipe out the length of service. The criterion for the determination of seniority under the Delhi rules is the length of service.
