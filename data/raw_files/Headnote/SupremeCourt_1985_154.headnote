 The State of Tamil Nadu enacted the Tamil Nadu Slum Areas (Improvement and Clearance) Act, 1971 in order to eradicate slums which are likely to become a source of danger to public health or sanitation. Acting in pursuance of the provisions of the said Act, about 450 huts situated on the Canal Bank Road adjoining the Loyola College were demolished on November 17, 1981. On the following day, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu made a statement that the Government had decided to demolish slums which had come into existence after June 1977. On November 19, 1981 the Chairman of the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board made a statement that alternative accommodation had been provided to persons who were evicted from the slums situated on the Canal Bank Road.
 The petitioner in these two writ petitions for the issuance of a writ of mandamus have prayed for two reliefs namely, (1) to restrain the respondent's State from evicting slum dwellers and pavement dwellers in the city of Madras, without providing alternative accommodation to them and (ii) to direct the respondent's State to provide basic amenities like water, drainage and electricity to the slum dwellers.
 In the Counter-affidavit filed by the State on behalf of the respondents the allegation that 450 slums were demolished without offering alternate accommodation to persons evicted thereby was denied. While asserting that alternate accommodation 101 is always provided before the slums are removed and that the provisions contained in section 11(a) of the Tamil Nadu Slum Areas (Improvement and Clearance) Act, 1971 regarding the principles of national justice are followed, it was explained how and why the hutments near the Loyola College and Choolaimedu were removed by providing alternate accommodation.
 On a careful consideration of the statements contained in the counter-affidavits filed on behalf of the respondents, that the Government of Tamil Nadu has adopted a benevolent and sympathetic policy in regard to the slum dwellers and finding that steps are being taken for the purpose of improving the slums and wherever they cannot be improved alternate accommodation is provided to the slum dwellers before they are evicted, the Court considered it necessary not to issue any writ or direction to the respondents.
 Expressing the confidence that the Government will continue to evince the same dynamic interest in the welfare of the pavement dwellers and slum dwellers and thus disposing of the petitions, the Court, ^ 
 HELD: The right to life includes the right to livelihood. The sweep of the right to life conferred by Article 21 is wide and far reaching. It does not mean merely that life cannot be extinguished or taken away as, for example, by the imposition and execution of the death sentence, except according to procedure established by law.
 That is but one aspect of the right to life. An equally important facet of that right is the right to livelihood because, no person can live without the means of living, that is, the means of livelihood. If the right to livelihood is not treated as a part of the constitutional right to life, the easiest way of depriving a person of his right to life would be depriving a person of his means of livelihood to the point of abrogation. Such deprivation would not only denude the life of its effective content and meaningfulness but it would make life impossible to live. And yet, such deprivation would not have to be in accordance with the procedure established by law, if the right to livelihood is not regarded as a part of the right to life. That, which alone makes it possible to live, leave aside what makes life livable, must be deemed to be an integral component of the right to life. Deprive a person of his right to livelihood and you shall have deprived him of his life. Indeed, that explains the massive migration of the rural population to big cities. They migrate because they have no means of livelihood 102 in the villages. The motive force which propels their desertion of their hearth and homes in the village is the struggle for survival, that is, the struggle for life. So unimpeachable is the evidence of the nexus between life and the means of livelihood. They have to eat to live: only a handful can afford the luxury of living to eat. That they can do, namely, eat, only if they have the means of livelihood. It is in this context, it is said that the right to work is the most precious liberty that man possesses. It is the most precious liberty because, it sustains and enables a man to live and the right to life is a precious freedom. Since the right to life under Article 21 includes the right to livelihood and since the right to life and the right to work being integrated and interdependent, the eviction of a person from a Slum or a pavement under the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Slum Areas (Improvement and Clearance) Act, 1971 read with provisions of the Tamil Nadu Land Encroachment Act, 1905 the Madras City Municipal Corporation Act, 1919 and the Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act, 1971 there by putting his very right to life in jeopardy, is violative of Article 21 and 19(1)(e) and (g) of the constitution. [79 D,F-H, 80 A-B, 103 D,F, 108 C] Olga Tellis & Ors. v. Bombay Municipal Corporation & Ors. etc. [1985] Supp. 2 S.C.R. p.51 applied.
 (The Court directed: (1) Since Madras has a late monsoon, the pavement dwellers in the city will not be evicted before December 31, 1985: (ii) The State Government will do its best to provide alternative accommodation to those amongst them who are able to show that they were living on pavements before June 30, 1977;(iii) In so far as the slum dwellers are concerned the counter-affidavits filed on behalf of the respondent's State contain an assurance that it is the policy of the State Government not to evict such of them as were living in the slums prior to June 30, 1977, without providing alternate accommodation to them.
 That assurance will bind the Government; and (iv) In so far as the other slum dwellers are concerned, they too will not be evicted before December 31, 1985 unless the land on which any slum stands is required by the State Government for an urgent public purpose. In the event that it becomes necessary to evict any of the slum dwellers belonging to this category prior to December 31, 1985, the State Government will have liberty to apply to this Court.)
