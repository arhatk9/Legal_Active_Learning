 The appellant and four other accused who were charged with an offence under s. 302 IPC were acquitted of the charge but the appellant alone was convicted and sentenced under s. 304 read with s. 34 IPC. Rejecting the view of the trial court that since some of the accused had injuries on their bodies it was a case of mutual assault and that there was no intention to cause murder, the High Court convicted the appellant under s. 302 IPC and sentenced him to life imprisonment.
 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD : The High Court was right in pointing out that the findings of the Sessions Judge were not based on a proper appreciation of evidence. The injuries on the persons of the accused were extremely superficial and could be easily explained. The accused had not established that the injuries on their bodies were sustained in the course of altercation which resulted in the death of the deceased, so as to lay the burden on the prosecution to explain the presence of the injuries. Before this obligation is placed on the prosecution two conditions must be satisfied viz., (i) that the injuries on the person of the accused were very serious and severe and not superficial and (ii) that the injuries had been caused at the time of the occurrence in question. [429 A-H] In the present case neither condition is satisfied. The injuries were extremely superficial and there was nothing to show that they were caused during altercation which resulted in the death of the deceasd. [430 A-B]
