 At the election for the office of Vice-President held in 1969 the nomination paper of one 'S' was sent by post. The Returning Officer rejected it forthwith on the ground that it did not comply with the requirements of r. 4(1) of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Rules, 1952 inasmuch as it had not been presented by the candidate or his proposer or seconder. in person. The said nomination paper was not put up for scrutiny under r. 6. The respondent won the election. The petitioner who was one of the losing candidates filed an. election petition under Art. 71 of the Constitution and s. 14 of the Presidential and Vice- Presidential Elections Act. 1952 and prayed that the election of the respondent be declared void under s. 18 of the Act. The questions that fell for consideration were :
 (i) whether the nomination of S had been wrongly rejected on the ground given; (ii) whether the Returning Officer had power to reject the nomination before the date of scrutiny;
 (iii) whether r. 4(l) was directory or mandatory.
 
HELD:(i) Rule 4(1) provides only one method of presentation i.e. delivery either in person by the candidate or by his proposer or seconder. Further it mentions the time within which the nomination paper can be delivered i.e.
 between the hours of eleven in the forenoon and three in the afternoon. Therefore, if the nomination paper is not presented in person either by the candidate or by the proposer or seconder it cannot be deemed to have been presented at all. There is good reason for making this rule because otherwise not only the authenticity of the person sending the nomination paper but also the time of delivery of the nomination paper would be in doubt. Since the rule provides only one method of presentation that method must be followed. The provisions of rr. 4(2), 5 and 6 support the above conclusion.
 The nomination paper of 'S' could be rejected on the ground that it had not been presented in person and received before 3 O'clock in the afternoon on the last date appointed under cl. (a) of sub-Jr. (1) of r. 4. Such a nomination paper could not be treated to have been 'received' within the meaning of sub-r. (2) or r. 4 and the Returning Officer was entitled to reject it. [340 F-341 C, HI (ii)There was no force in the submission that the Returning Officer should have waited till the date of the scrutiny.
 As soon as the Returning Officer finds that a nomination paper has not been duly presented and received he must reject it outright at the time it is handed over to him.
 [341 H-342 Al 335 (iii)Rule 4(l) is mandatory. To hold otherwise would lead to utter confusion and delay in the completion of the election. The Returning Officer would not know who and where to inform about the date of scrutiny, he would not be certain whether it is genuine, and would have to take evidence as to whether it is a genuine nomination paper or a forged paper.
