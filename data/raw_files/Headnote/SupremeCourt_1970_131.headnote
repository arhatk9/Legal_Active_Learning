 Two kinds of rights have been conferred on lessees under tenancies 'falling within the scope of the Madras City Tenants' Protection Act, 1921, as amended by the Amendment Act of 1055. The first is a right to be paid compensation under s.3 for 'buildings erected by the tenants on the leased land before they are evicted, and- the second, a, right under s. 9 to the tenant entitled to compensation under s. 3, to exercise the option to require the landlord to sell to him the land covered by the lease for a price to be computed in accordance with that section. Under s. 12, nothing in any contract made by the tenant shall take away or limit his rights under the Act, provided that, nothing herein contained shall affect any stipulations made by the tenant, in writing 'registered, as to the erection of buildings in relation to buildings erected after the date of the contract. The first part of s. 12 protects a tenant against the deprivation or limitation of his rights under the Act, and the fights conferred by the Act do not directly relate to covenants relating to, erection of buildings.
 The respondent took the appellant's vacant land on lease for ten years. The registered lease deed provided that the lessee could put up a building whose cost should not exceed Rs. 10,000, that the plan of the proposed building was to be approved by the directors of the appellant, ,that the construction should be in accordance with the approved plan, that the lessee should surrender possession with the construction at the end of the lease period and that the lessor would pay the valuation of the construction then current, or Rs. 5,000 whichever is less. The respondent put ,up a building. On the question, whether on the expiry of the lease period, the respondent was entitled to the rights under ss. 3 and 9, or the stipulations in the lease deed were covered by the proviso in s. 12.
 
HELD:In Vajrapani Naidu v. New Theatre Carnatic Talkies, [1964] INSC 54; [1964] 6 S.C.R. 1015, it was held that the object of the Act was to protect tenants against any contractual engagements entered into by them expressly or by implication depriving themselves wholly or partially of the rights conferred by the statute; that the only class of cases in which the protection becomes ineffective is when the tenant had made a stipulation as per the proviso in s. 12; that a stipulation to vacate and deliver possession of the land after demolishing the building constructed by the tenant, really amounted to the tenant giving up his right under s. 9, and that the stipulation was not one as to erection of building, and hence, would not come under the proviso in s. 12.
 Stipulations regarding restrictions about size, nature of the building constructed the building materials to be used therein, and the purpose for which the building is to be- utilized, are given in the decision as some illustrative examples of stipulations covered by the proviso in s. 12.
 [558 F-H; 559 A-B] (1) In the present case although the stipulations do not expressly refer to the size and nature of the building add the building materials to be used therein, they are all implicit in the stipulations which fix the upper limit of the cost of the building to be constructed and require the approval ,of the plan of the building by the directors of the appellant. Therefore, 547 the stipulations are as to the erection of the buildings and attract the proviso in s. 12. [560 A-C] (2) In V. S. Mudaliar v. N. A. Raghava Chary, [1969] 2 S.C.R. 158, it was held that a stipulation that the tenant shall not erect any permanent structures so as to entitle him to claim their value was a stipulation under the proviso in s. 12 as to the erection of buildings- and disentitled the tenant from claiming compensation under s. 3, in respect of buildings put up by him in contravention of the stipulation. Therefore, the stipulation in the present case under which the respondent agreed to limit the quantum of compensation payable in respect of the building constructed by him was also a stipulation as to the erection of buildings attracting the proviso in s. 12. [561 G-H-, 562 A] R. V. Naidu v. Naraindas, [1966] 1 S.C.R. 110, 'referred to.
 (3) Since the stipulation prevails and overrides the tenant's rights under s. 3, he was not entitled to compensation under that section, and therefore, could not claim the benefit under s. 9. [562 A-B]
