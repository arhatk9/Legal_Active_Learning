 The plaintiff who was a member of the armed forces of the Union had retired from service in 1967. The suit property was a part of the property gifted by his mother-in- law to his wife in 1976, which in turn had been gifted in his favour in 1977, probably with the object of taking advantage of s. 13A1 of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947 which had been introduced in the Act by way of an amendment made in 1975. The plaintiff filed the suit under s.13A1 for recovery of possession of the suit property from the defendant who had been occupying the same for a number of years and in the course of the suit produced a certificate issued by the Army Officer concerned as required by that section The suit was decreed by the trial court and the defendant's appeal against the same was turned down by the District Judge whereupon the defendant filed a petition under Arts. 226 and 227 of the Constitution which was allowed. The High Court dismissed the suit for eviction holding that the plaintiff was not entitled to file the suit under s.13A1 as he had acquired the premises long after he had retired from service and that his requirement was not bona fide even for purposes of granting relief under s. 13(1) (g).
 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: Section 13A1 of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947 has been introduced in the Act to enable members of the armed forces who have leased out their buildings when they are in service to recover quickly possession of such buildings without the restrictions contained in the other parts of the Act, either when they are still in service, or on their retirement, for their use and occupation or for the use and occupation of the members of their family. An analysis of cl. (a) of s.13A1 shows that the person who wishes to claim the benefit of that section should be a landlord of the premises while he is a member of the armed forces of the Union and that he may recover possession of the premises on the ground that the premises are bona fide required by him for occupation by himself or any member of his family on the production of the required certificate either while he is still in service or after his retirement. The essential requirement is that he should have leased out the building while he was a member of the armed forces. His 1006 widow can also recover the premises of which she is or has become the landlord under cl. (b) subject to fulfillment of the conditions. Having regard to the object and purposes of the Act and in particular of s.13A1 it is difficult to hold that s. 13A1 can be availed of by an ex-member of the armed forces to recover from a tenant possession of a building which he acquires after his retirement. [1011B-D] A liberal construction of s.13A1 would enable unscrupulous landlords who cannot get rid of tenants to transfer their premises to ex-military men, as it has been done in this case, in order to avil of the benefit of the provision with a private arrangement between them. Since such an interpretation is likely to expose the provision to a successful challenge under Art. 14 of the Constitution it has to be read down as conferring benefit only on those members of the armed forces who were landlords of the premises in question while they were in service even though they may avail of it after their retirement. [1012B; 1014G- H] [The Court refrained from expressing any opinion on the question whether a member or a retired member of the armed forces who acquire title to a building which is already in the occupation of a tenant by inheritance, partition, transfer or otherwise and thus becomes the landlord of the building while he is a member of the armed forces, can avail of the remedy against such tenant under s. 13A1.] [1015C-D] Sushila Bai Vasudev Jaeel v.

 In the instant case, the plaintiff was not entitled to succeed even on the basis of s. 13(1) (g) of the Act. The High Court was right in arriving at the finding that the plaintiff had not established that he was really in need of the building. [1015 D]
