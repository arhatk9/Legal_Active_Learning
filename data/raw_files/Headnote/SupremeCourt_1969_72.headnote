 In a lease of land, it was covenanted that in the event of default of payment of rent for two consecutive years, the tenancy rights will stand forfeited. As the rent remain due and in arrears for two years, the landlord filed a suit for the eviction of the tenants and for payment of the arrears of rent and compensation. The tenants claimed relief against forfeiture of their tenancy rights under s. 114 of the Transfer of Property Act and deposited in Court an amount less than the amount due. The Trial Court decreed the suit holding that the conditions relating to deposit in Court of rent in arrear, interest thereon, and costs of the suit were not complied with. The tenants appealed and offered to pay balance of rent due together with costs of the suit and the appeal and interest, and deposited an amount much larger than due. The appellate court allowed the appeal holding that the tenants were entitled to the benefit of s. 114 when they were willing and ready to pay more than what was due, and there were valuable constructions on the plots and the respondent's dispossession would put them to a great loss. The High Court dismissed the appeal against this decision. In appeal before this Court, the landlord contended that the jurisdiction under s. '114 to relieve against forfeiture could only be exercised by the Court of First Instance; that the tenants having failed to avail of the opportunity given by the Trial Court to pay the amount due with interests and costs, the appellate court had no jurisdiction to grant another opportunity; and that the discretion was not properly exercised in this case. Repelling the contentions, this Court :- 
HELD : The covenant of 'forfeiture of tenancy for non- payment of rent is regarded by the Courts as merely a clause for securing payment of rent, and unless the tenant has by his conduct disentitled himself to equitable relief the Courts grant relief against forefeiture of tenancy on the tenant paying the rent due, interest thereon and costs of the suit. Jurisdiction to relieve against forefeiture for non-payment of rent may be exercised by the Court if the tenant in a suit in ejectment at the hearing of the suit pays the arrears of rent together with interest thereon and full costs of the suit. In terms s. 114 makes payment of rent at the hearing of the suit in ejectment a condition of the exercise of the Court's jurisdiction but an appeal being a rehearing of the suit, in appropriate cases, it is open to the Appellate Court at the hearing of the appeal to relieve the tenant in default against forfeiture. Passing of a decree in ejectment against the tenant by the Court of First Instance does not take away the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court to grant equitable relief. [953 C] Failure to avail themselves of the opportunity does not operate as a bar to the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court.
 The Appellate Court may, having regard to the conduct of the tenant, decline to exercise its discretion to grant him relief against forfeiture. [954 A] 951 Chilukuri Tripura Sundaramma v.

 Having regard to the circumstances that valuable constructions were put up on the land and that the tenants had deposited much larger amount than due, the discretion was rightly exercised in favour of the tenant In an appeal with special leave, this Court will not ordinarily interfere with an order made in exercise of the discretion of the Courts below, specially when there was evidence that the tenants were guilty of conduct disentitling them to relief against forfeiture for non-payment of rent.
