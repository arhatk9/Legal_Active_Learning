 By a notification issued by the Central Government under s.
 1 (3) (b) of the Employees' Provident Funds Act, 1952 the petitioners' restaurant was brought under the Act. By a further notification under s. 5 read with s. 7 (1) of the Act, the Employees' Provident Fund (Second Amendment) Scheme, 1961, was introduced. The petitioners challenged the constitutional validity of the said scheme and the sections under which it was made and applied to their restaurant. It was urged that s. 1 (3) (b) of the Act conferred uncontrolled and uncanalised, power on the Government, that the Act had application only to wage- earners and not to salaried employees as those, employed in the petitioners' restaurant and that the scheme was discriminatory and therefore hit by Art. 14 of the Constitution.
 Held, that whether or not a particular piece of legislation suffers from excessive delegation has to be judged on a consideration of the facts and circumstances that led to the enactment of the impugned statute. If the Act and its preamble do not clearly indicate the underlying principles or the criteria for its application, the inevitable conclusion must be that the delegate is entrusted not merely with the function of applying the law, but substantially with the legislative power itself. So judged, it could not be said that the power entrusted to Central Government to bring by notification such establishments as it thought fit within the purview of the impugned Act was uncontrolled or uncanalised.
 The Edward Mills Co. Ltd. Beawar v. The State of Ajmer, [1954] INSC 91; [1955] 1 S. C. R. 735, Vasantlal Maganbhai Sanjanwala, [1951) 1 S. C. R. 341 and Hamdard Dawakhana Wakf) Lal Kuan, Delhi v. Union of India, [1960] 2 S. C. R(W. 671, referred to.
 994 The Act makes no distinction between wages and salary. In principle there is no difference between the two and it was not correct to say that the Act was not intended to apply to salaried employees, if by salary was meant fortnightly or monthly wages running into hundreds per month.
 The Act was not discriminatory and did not infringe Art. 14.
 It applied to all establishments since s. 16 was amended by Act 46 of 1960 except .those registered under the Co- operative Societies Act, 1912, and those newly set up till the expiry of three or five years. As was held by this Court co-operative societies stood on a different footing from other establishments. Exemption under s. 17 also could not be said to be discriminatory. The petitioners' establishment, which came within the notification, was not therefore, discriminated against.
