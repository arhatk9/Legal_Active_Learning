 J owned certain inherited properties and his son predeceased him leaving the appellant his widow as his heir and legal representative. After the son's death, J married B in 1948.
 J himself died in 1950 and after his death the first respondent claimed the properties by virtue of a gift deed.
 On this basis he obtained possession of the properties from the appellant under s. 145 Cr.P.C. in December 1962.The appellant, together with J's widow B instituted a suit for declarations respect of her tights and for possession of the properties. During the pendency of the suit B entered into a compromise with the first respondent giving up all her claims. The Trial Court found that the appellant was in possession until dispossessed by the first respondent under s.145 Cr. P.C and that the respondent had illegally occupied the properties. However, the Court non-suited the appellant on the ground that since her husband had died in the life-time of J, the latter's assets devolved on his widow B who would be his only heir. Although the District Judge allowed the first appeal and remanded the case, a further appeal by the first respondent was allowed by the High Court on the view that the appellant could have no interest in the properties left by J and she could not take advantage of the provisions of s. 3(2) of the Hindu Women's Right to Properties Act, 1937 which conferred certain rights on the widow of a predeceased son. It further held that the rightful claimant of the properties of J was B alone and owing to the compromise entered into by her, the first respondent was '.clothed with the same rights which were possessed by her".
 On appeal to this Court, 
HELD : Allowing the appeal : The High Court's decision must be reversed and that of the District Judge restored.
 It could not be disputed that the appellant who was the widow of the predeceased son of J was entitled to receive maintenance, so long as she did not remarry, out of the' estate of her father-in4aw. Although her claim for maintenance was not a charge upon the estate until it had been fixed and specifically charged thereupon, her right was not liable to be defeated except by transfer to a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of a claim or even with notice of the claim unless the transfer was made with the intention of defeating her right. [793 B] The appellant was presumably in possession of the properties in lieu of her right of maintenance and could not be deprived of them even by B without first securing proper maintenance for heir out of the properties.
 Rachawa & others v. Shivayogappa, I.L.R. 18 Bom, 679 and Yellawa Ors, v. Bhimangavda, I.L.R. 18 Bom. 452; referred to, 790 The High Court was in error in holding that the first respondent was clothed with the very same rights which were possessed" by B. If the Trial Court's finding that the first respondent was a mere trespasser was right, it was not possible to see how B could effect the transfer of all her rights by merely filing a petition to the effect that she did not wish to prosecute a suit as a plaintiff.
