 The appellant prayed for the issue of a writ of mandamus and a writ of prohibition against the respondent-State in a writ application filed in the High Court, on the ground that his liability as surety for some contractors stood discharged on account of a particular action of the State. no High Court dismissed the petition on merits after full contest. He thereupon filed a suit against the respondent and raised the same plea that he was discharged from liability as surety on the same grounds. The trial court, the first appellate Court and the High Court Held that the suit was barred by res judicata in view of the judgment of the High Court on the writ petition. In appeal to the Supreme Court, 
HELD (Per Sarkar, Raghubar Dayal, Rajagopala Ayyangar and Mudholkar JJ.) : On general principles of res judicata, the decision of the High Court on a writ petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution, on the merits, on a matter, after full contest, will operate as res judicata in a subsequent regular suit between the same parties with respect to the same matter. [574 E-F] The provisions of s. 11, Civil Procedure Code, 1908, are not exhaustive with respect to an earlier decision operating as res judicata between the same parties on the same matter in controversy in a subsequent regular suit and, on the general principle of res judicata, any previous decision on a matter in controversy decided after full contest or after affording fair opportunity to the parties to prove their case by a court competent to decide it, will operate as res judicata in a subsequent regular suit. It is not necessary that the court deciding the matter formerly be competent to decide the subsequent suit or that the former proceeding and the subsequent suit have the same subject matter. The nature of the former proceeding is immaterial. There is, therefore, no good reason to preclude such decisions on matters in controversy in writ proceedings under Arts. 226 or 32 from operating as res judicata in subsequent regular suits on the same matters in controversy, between the same parties, and thus to give limited effect to the principle of finality of decisions after full contest [573 B-E] Case law reviewed.
 Per Subba Rao, J. (dissenting) : The decision given by the High Court in the writ petition would not preclude the court, before which the suit was filed, from deciding the same question an merits in the suit. [576 F] This view, while it does not make s. 11 of the Code an unnecessary provision, does not lead to any practical difficulties, for, the decision of the High Court on a question of law will be binding as an authority on Subordinate Courts and its decision on a question of fact will rarely be differed from by the said courts. [576 E-F] Case law considered.
