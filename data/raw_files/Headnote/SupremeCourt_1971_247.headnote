 The assessee was an association of persons and held various properties for the purposes set out in its constitution.
 One of the purposes was the management of the movable and immovable properties of the Rana community of the City of Ahmedabad, doing acts to improve education in the community and to give medical help to the community, etc. The de- finition of Rana community comprised two classes-one class consisting of those who are natives of Ahmedabad while the other consists of such persons who are admitted by the Rana caste according to the old custom or the usage of the community.
 On the question whether the income of the assessee-trust was exempt under s. 4(3)(1) of the Income-tax Act, 1922, or s.
 11 of the Incometax Act, 1961, the High Court held that since the second class of persons consisted-of those who had been accepted by the caste according its old custom or usage, all the beneficiaries were not united by a common characteristic or attribute of an impersonal nature and therefore, the beneficiaries did not constitute a community or a section of the Community Allowing the appeal to this Court, Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : An object beneficial to a section of the public is an object of general public utility. But the section of the community sought to be benefitted must be sufficiently defined and identifiable by some common quality of a public or impersonal nature. The common quality, in the present case, uniting the potential beneficiaries consists of being members of the Rana caste or community of Ahmedabad whether as natives or as being admitted to that caste or community under custom or usage. The mere fact that a person of the Rana community who is not an original native of Ahmedabad has to prove his credentials and according to the custom and usage of that community cannot introduce a personal element.
 Whenever a question arises whether a person belongs to a particular community or caste the custom or usage prevailing in that community must play a decisive and vital part. The personal element or personal relationship which takes a group out of a section of the community is their personal relationship to a single propositus or to several propo- sition or a relationship of a similar nature. Therefore, the members of the Rana caste who are not natives of Ahmedabad but who come to reside there and are accepted as members of that caste according to its usage and customs could be said to have a relationship of an impersonal nature.
