 The Judges of the High Court and of the Supreme Court will be entitled to the pensionary benefits under the amended Act of 1976 irrespective of the dates of their retirement. They will be so entitled with effect from 1.10.1974. Arrears of pension calculated under the provisions of the new Act will be paid to those to whom it is due within four months. In the case of Judges who have died after 1.10.1974 the amounts due will be paid to the legal heirs of the Judges within four months. The family pension due to the widows will be calculated under the provisions of the 1976 Amending Act and paid to them. Ad-hoc payments made, if any, will be adjusted while making such payments.
