 Clause (2) of the Goa, Daman and Diu (Citizenship) Order, 1962 states that every person who or either of whose parents was born before the 20th day of December, 1961 in the territories now comprised in the union territory of Goa, Daman and Diu shall be deemed to have become a citizen of India- on that day. The proviso to that clause says that any such person shall not be deemed to have become a citizen of India as aforesaid if within one month, from the date of publication of the order that person makes a declaration in writing that he chooses to retain the citizenship or nationality which he had: immediately before the 20th day of December, 1961. In December 1962 clause (3A) was,inserted in Schedule 3 to the Citizenship Rules which states that where a person who has become an Indian citizen by virtue of the 1962 Citizenship Order holds a passport issued by the Government of any other country the fact that he has not surrendered the said passport on or before January 19, 1963 shall be conclusive proof of his having voluntarily acquired the citizenship of that country before that date.
 In his election petition the appellant alleged. that the respondent chose to maintain his Portuguese nationality and citizenship by making a declaration in writing on April 27, 1962. Thereafter, he proceeded on foreign travel as an alien on the basis of the Portuguese passport issued to him by the former Portuguese administration. which was renewed upto July 17, 1964 in London. It was further alleged that the respondent obtained his alien residential permit in India and that he deliberately failed to surrender his Portuguese passport before January 19,1963 as required by cl. 3A of the Amending Rules, 1962. It was also alleged that the communication of the Goa administration that the respondent had prima facie become a citizen of India by virtue of the Citizenship, Order was not correct and contrary to the documentary evidence.
 The Judicial Commissioner held (i) that the respondent was entrusted with, a secret mission on behalf of the Government of India and it was in that connection that he was made to sign the declaration dated April 27, 1962 and that the declaration was not made voluntarily; (ii) that the renewal of the Portuguese passport did not imply loss of Indian citizenship; (iii) that the retention of the Portuguese passport after January 19, 1963 was due to compelling reasons and that the Government of India must be deemed to have given its decision that the respondent was an Indian citizen.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) According to the Special Adviser to the Military Governor who later became Special Adviser to the Lt.
 Governor, the declaration of the respondent dated April 27, 1962 that he chose to retain the Portuguese citizenship and nationality was signed by him only by way of formality in view of the fact that the Special Adviser had decided to use the respondent in a top secret matter relating to the security of India. The respondent was involved with a Portuguese lady and that fact provided a cover for carrying out the assignment. The respondent retained his Portuguese passport and obtained residential permits to stay in Goa as a foreigner till January. 1964 426 at the instance of the Special Adviser so that he could carry out the assignment entrusted to him. He had gone abroad in 1963 in connection with the assignment on a Portuguese passport under the instructions of the Special Adviser. The respondent renewed the Portuguese passport in London under instructions of the 'Special Adviser. On respondents return he was asked by the Special Adviser to retain his passport till such time as it was decided to use him again or asked him to relinquish it. The Special Adviser was competent to ask the respondent to retain his Portuguese passport and to proceed on top secret assignment.[431 E-H] (2) The words "as agreed" appearing on the letter dated April 27, 1962 addressed by the respondent to the Special Adviser go to show that it was in pursuance of some arrangement between the Special Adviser and the respondent ,that the latter was retaining his Portuguese passport and visiting Portugal. The note made by the Special Adviser expressly refers to the fact that the respondent after returning from his foreign trip was to take over an Indian passport and renounce Portuguese nationality. No express reference to the secret mission, in the very nature of things, could be expected either in the letter or in the note. it was obviously essential for the success of the secret mission that things should not be divulged by making them explicit. [433G-H] (3) No question of sharing of the expenses of the respondent would arise if the respondent was not undertaking a trip for reasons connected with the affairs the State.
 [434A] (4) The evidence on record proves that the respondent was entrusted with a secret mission on behalf of the Government of India and it was in that connection that he was made to sign the declaration dated April 27, 1962. The intention of the respondent at the time he signed the declaration was not to become a Portuguese national but to acquire Indian nationality. [434D] (5) The declaration dated April 27, 1962 and the retention of the passport by the respondent after January, 1963 could not have the effect of depriving the respondent of the benefit of Indian citizenship. But for the declaration dated April 27, 1962 the respondent according to cl. (2) of the Citizenship Order would be deemed to have become a citizen of India on December 20, 1961. The declaration was signed by him because of the secret mission which had 'been entrusted to him in connection with the affairs of the State. It cannot, therefore be said that the choice to retain Portuguese nationality as expressed ,in his declaration dated April 27, 1962 and January 19, 1963 represented his real choice exercised by him voluntarily.
 [435D; 434H; 435A-B] (6) The Judicial Commissioner was right in considering the declaration dated April 27, 1962 and the letter dated July 
27. 1970 from the Ministry of Home Affairs that he had become prima facie a citizen of India as a certificate issued by the Central Government under s. 13 of the Citizenship Act. It is also plain that the' Central Government reaffirmed its decision that the respondent had prima facie become a citizen of India in spite of the fact that the Central Government was informed about the making of declaration dated April 27, 1962. Letters dated July 26, 1970 and July 27, 1970 though they did not profess to be certificates issued under s. 13 and though the latter of these two letters recites that there was no necessity of a certificate, clearly incorporate the view of the Government of India that the respondent was an Indian citizen.
