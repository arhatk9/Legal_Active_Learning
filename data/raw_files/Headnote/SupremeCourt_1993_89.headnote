 The appellant/landlord filed a suit against the respondent- tenant for recovery of possession of the suit-premises on the grounds contained in Sections 12(3)(a), (e) and (g) of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947. viz., nonpayment of rent for a period of over six months in spite of notice of demand; nuisance and bona fide personal use.
 In his written statement, the tenant pleaded that the rent charged was excessive; lie was not in arrears of rent, as alleged; the landlord did not require the suit premises reasonably and bona fide; the tenant had a large family; and he did not cause any nuisance, as alleged, and greater hardship would be caused to the tenant if the decree for possession was passed against him than it would be to the landlord if the decree was not passed.
 1114 The trial court framed the issues, but the parties presented consent terms before the court for passing decree in those terms. Accordingly, the court passed a compromise decree making an order below the consent terms that the parties were present and admitted the terms.
 On the failure of the tenant to deliver possession of the premises by the due date, as agreed, the appellant-landlord filed an application for execution. The tenant filed objections to the executability of the decree and, contended that an the eviction decree was not executable, as it was a nullity, and that there was no material before the court which passed the decree to show the availability of the various grounds of eviction alleged against the tenant.
 The executing court held that the decree was not a nullity and was executable. This was affirmed by the first appellate court. However, a Single Judge of the High Court, in further revision filed by the tenant, held that the decree was not executable as it was a nullity.
 On analysis of the compromise, the High Court held that the time was given on concession to the tenant to vacate the premises ie. at the most it could be said that the tenant may have agreed to handover possession as the landlord required the premises reasonably and bona fide for personal use and occupation, but on the basis of this implied admission, the provisions of Section 13(2) of the Act were not satisfied; that the condition to be satisfied for attraction of Section 12(3) (a) was that the tenant had neglected to make payment of rent until the expiration of the period of one month after notice as contemplated under sub-section (2) of Section 12, and though the notice was given by the landlord to the tenant claiming the total arrears of rent of Rs.372 and the notice was served on the tenant in about 8 days, there was no material in the consent terms, to show that the tenant had given up the contention that he had not neglected to pay, and that it was for the landlord to prove that greater hardship would be caused to him, rather than to the tenant, before he could get decree for possession on the ground of bona_fide personal requirement and the landlord had not pleaded in the plaint to that effect.
 Allowing the appeal, preferred by the landlord, this Court, 
HELD:1. A decree is said to be a nullity if it is passed by a court having no inherent jurisdiction. Merely because a court erroneously pas- 1115 ses a decree or there is an error while passing the decree, the decree cannot be called a nullity. The decree to be called a nullity is to be understood in the sense that it is entry vires the powers of the court passing the decree and not merely voidable decree. [112 1 F] 2.1.Whenever there is any lawful agreement, the court is bound lo record the agreement or compromise. There is no provision in the Act which made Rule 3 of Order 23 of the Code of Civil procedure inapplicable to proceedings contemplated by the Act. Nor there is any provision in the Act which prohibits parties entering into a compromise in the suit for eviction filed under the Act. [1125B-C] 2.2.There is no doubt that if there is a contest, the court can pass a decree for eviction only if the court is satisfied about the existence of grounds mentioned in Sections 12(3)(a), 13(1)(g) and 13(2). But the satisfaction can also be interred impliedly. [1123F] K.K. Chari' v. R.M. Sheshadhri, [1973] INSC 52; A.I.R. 1973 S.C. 1311;

 2.3.In the instant case, it is clear from the consent terms that the tenant agreed about the claim of the arrears of rent and stated that lie had deposited it partly in the court. No doubt, in the written statement the tenant had taken the plea that the landlord was avoiding to take tile rent and he was not neglecting to pay, but by the admission in the compromise terms, the tenant gave up the plea of tender of rent before the filing of the suit. There was no material of any tender by money order or otherwise on the record when the compromise was filed. The burden was on the tenant to prove the tender of rent before the suit, after service of notice of demand. The admission contained in the compromise shows complete admission of the tenant about the arrears of rent read with the allegation of the landlord in the petition about the existence of arrears of rent after service of notice of demand. In the written statement, the notice of demand had been admitted, but the plea was of tender of rent. Even a reply was sent to the notice of demand. Thus, in the absence of any material on the record of previous tender it can safety be assumed that there was sufficient material in the light of the agreed terms that the tenant had made himself liable to be evicted on the ground contained in Section 12(3) (a) 1116 of the Act [1123G-H, 1124A-C] 2A. The very fact that the tenant asked for accommodation of time shows that the claim of the landlord for eviction of the tenant on the ground of his bona fide personal requirement was impliedly admitted by the tenant Again there is implied admission of comparative hardship as contemplated by Section 13(2) of the Act by the tenant. Order 23 Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure was applicable to the proceedings. [1124D] 2.5.It is thus clear from the terms of the compromise that there was an Implied admission by the tenant of the grounds contained in Section 12(3)(a) as well as Section 13(1)(g) of the Act. [1128G] 3.1.The executing court gave elaborate opportunity to the tenant while substantiating his objection to the validity of the decree by permitting him to lead documentary evidence which is not ordinarily granted. This permission to a tenant to lead evidence in execution Is totally unwarranted in the instant case. The executing court is supposed to have examined the nullity of the decree on the basis of the record on which It is based. It cannot permit the parties to lead fresh evidence. [1128H, 1129A-B] 3.2.The High Court was also in error in assuming that the landlord In a suit for eviction on the ground of bonafide personal requirement is supposed to have pleaded his own comparative hardship in the plaint itself Section 13(2) comes into play at the stage when the court is satisfied that the ground contained in clause (g) of sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Act has been made out. It is at the stage that the court has to examine the question of comparative hardship. It was thus not necessary to plead In the plaint itself Often the parties at the stage of recording of evidence of bonafide personal requirement also lead evidence as to the comparative hardship of the landlord or the tenant But such averments are not required to be pleaded in the plaint itself to give cause of action to the landlord to enable him to file a suit for eviction of the tenant on the ground of his bona fide personal requirement.
 [1129C-D] 3.3.The High Court was not right in going into the question of neglect by the tenant of the demanded arrears of rent Once the arrears are admitted, it is implied that the tenant gave up the plea of tender. Surely, the executing court could not be justified to permit the tenant to lead evidence of tender by him before the filing of the suit in compliance 1117 of the notice of demand as contemplated by Section 12(3)(a) of the Act after the decree.
