 In May 1956, the respondent gave a notice under s. 14 of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948, to the appellants, who were his tenants, terminating the tenancy on the grounds of non-payment of rent. In December 1956, he gave another notice to the appellants, under a. 31, terminating the tenancy on the ground that he wanted to personally cultivate the lands. In March 1957, he filed an application before the Mamlatdar, on the basis of the notice under s. 31 for recovery of possession of the land. In July 1957, he filed another application for the same relief on the basis of the notice under s. 14. On September 28, 1957, s. 32 of the Act was amended by Act 38 of 1957 as a result of which, in certain circumstances, a tenant would be deemed to have purchased, on 1st April 1957, the lands held by him, from the landlord. In December 1957, the Mamlatdar allowed the respondent's application based on s. 14. In March 1958, he withdrew his application based on s. 31. The appellants did not file an appeal against the order of the Mamlatdar of December 1957, but applied to the Collector in August 1958, for revision of that order under s. 76A. The Collector called for the records, but before the receipt of the records, rejected the application. The appellants again applied and the Collector again rejected the application.
 The orders of rejection were passed in October 1958. In November 1.958, the appellants once again applied to the Collector. In December 1958, the Collector received the records. He gave notice to the parties, heard them and on 17th February 1959 passed an order setting aside the Mamlatdar's order of December 1957. The respondent moved the Revenue Tribunal but without success. He then applied to the High Court under Art. 227 of the Constitution. The High Court held that the Collector had power to make the order of 17th February 1959, but that the amended S. 32 gave no rights to the appellants, as it could not affect the eviction application filed in July 1957 and pending when the Amending Act came into force, and therefore decided in favour of the respondent-landlord. In appeal to the Supreme Court by the tenants, the appellants contended that the High Court's view as to the applicability of s. 32 was erroneous.
 The respondent, while supporting the High Court's decision on s. 32, contended that the High Court's view of s. 76A was wrong and that the Collector had no power to review his earlier orders of October 1958 by his order of February 1959.
 
HELD (Per Ayyangar and Bachawat, JJ.) 32(1)(b)(i), (ii) and (iii) do not lay down alternative conditions on the satisfaction of any one of which, the appellant could be deemed to have purchased the land on 1st April 1957. The word "or" between sub-ss. (ii) and (iii), in conjunction with the succeeding negatives is equivalent to, and should be read as "nor". Therefore, under the section, the appel- lants, who were not permanent tenants but were cultivating the land personally, could become purchasers of the lands on 1st April 1957, if 329 on that date, neither an application based on s. 31, nor an application based on s. 14 was pending. If an application of either type was pending on that date, the tenants could not become purchasers on that date, though, if the application were rejected later, they could become pur- chasers on such postponed date under the proviso to the section. Since, on 31st March 1957, the respondent's application based on s. 31 was pending, the appellants could not be deemed to have purchased the land on April 1, 1957.
 L343 F-G, H; 344 A] But the respondent's application based on s. 14 was not maintainable as it was filed after 31st March 1957. Section 32, as amended, saves all application pending on 31st March 1957 and by necessary implication it bars all applications filed after that date. The fact that the application under s. 31 was pending, and the appellants continued to be tenants would not make any difference. The High Court was therefore in error in quashing the Collector's order on the ground that the amended s. 32 had no effect on pending applications for eviction. However, since the Mamlatdar allowed the application, the appellants had ceased to be tenants and so, even though the respondent withdrew his application under s. 31, and such withdrawal amounted to rejection in law, the appellants could not claim the benefit of the proviso to s. 32 and become purchasers of the lands on the postponed date. [344 B; 345 B, D-E, H; 349 C] The Collector's order of February 1959 under s. 76A, reversing the Mamlatdar's order, did not affect the position because, that order was illegal, ultra vires and without jurisdiction. 'Me Collector could pass the earlier orders rejecting the applications for revision in October 1958 on the materials before him and without calling for the record.
 Having called for the record, he should have waited for its arrival, but his orders passed before such arrival were not without jurisdiction. The mere fact that he called for the record is no ground for saying that he could not thereafter examine the materials before him and pass an order refusing to interfere with the Mamlatdar's order, without notice to the parties. 'nose orders passed by the Collector in the exercise of his revisional powers were quasi-judicial and final. Even if the order calling for the record is not of a quasi-judicial nature, the Collector having called for the record and then determined that there was no ground for interference, his order would be quasi-judicial. Since the Act does not empower the Collector to review such an order passed by him, his earlier orders dismissing the applications for revision were final and could not be repened by him subsequently. [346 B-C; 347 F-H; 348 D-H] Per Sarkar, J. (dissenting) : The conditions laid down in s.
 32(1) (b) (i). (ii) and (iii) are not in the alternative and fulfilment of any one of them would not entitle a tenant to claim to be a purchaser. In order to become a purchaser a tenant has to satisfy all the conditions laid down in cls.
 (i), (ii) and (iii). Therefore, when an application for ejectment filed before 31st March 1957 on the basis of a notice under s. 31 was pending when the Amending Act came into force, the tenant had not become a purchaser on the specified date. This however does not lead to the conclusion that in such a case an application for ejectment on the basis of a notice unders. 14, filed after 31st March 1957 remained maintainable after the Amending Act and that an order for ejectment could Properly be made on it.
 On the coming into force of the Amending Act, the landlord's application for ejectment filed in July 1957 on the strength of a notice under s. 14 became incompetent and had to be rejected. The order of ejectment passed by the Mamlatdar would be wholly illegal, and the order of the Collector of 19th February 1959, setting aside that order was valid and proper. Under s. 76A sending for the record is a preliminary step to the judicial act concerning the right of the parties which is to follow 330 upon the perusal of the record when it arrives. By sending for the record, the Collector decided that the merits of the case required looking into. Having sent for the record his only power was to wait for its arrival and decide the merits of the case on it. The section does not contemplate that an order can be made before the Collector had received the record and looked into it. As the record had not arrived by the time he rejected the applications in October 1958, be had not made any order under the section. It follows that the only order made by the Collector under the section was that of 19th February 1959. [333 C-D, G; 334 C, E; 336 G-H;
