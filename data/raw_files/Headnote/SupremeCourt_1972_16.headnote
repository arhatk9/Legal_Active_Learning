 In furtherance of the policy of the appellant-State to nationalise textbooks for schools, directions were issued to District Collectors and Local Board authorities that they should intimate publishers of the text-books which were prescribed for the year 1969-70, that, after the end of the school year they will no longer be prescribed. The publishers challenged the validity of the directions. Th High Court allowed the petitions on the ground that though the Madras Educational Rules and the Text-Book Committee Rules-under which lists of approved text-books are published in the Gazette-are administrative instructions and are not framed for the benefit of publishers, nonetheless, under those rules, a publisher of text-books could proceed on the basis that he ha,% an assurance that once his books had been selected and prescribed as text-books, they will continue to be prescribed for 3 years.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) The Rules are in the nature of Departmental Instructions and do not confer any right on the publishers, nor are they designed to safeguard the interest of publishers. They are conceived in public interest and the Government is at liberty to change the textbooks and delete from and add to the list of approved text-books or even prescribe books which are not in the list. Therefore, the impugned directions have been issued by the Government in exercise of the power,,. reserved to it by the Rules themselves. [108C-E F-G ] (2) There is no warrant for concluding that the Rules held out any kind of representation or assurance to the publishers, or that the Rules envisaged their participation in the scheme and as such the Government was estopped from resiling from the representation that the period of 3 years will not be altered. [107D-F] The selection of text books by the Text-Book- Committee does not involve any assurance to the publishers that their text- books will be prescribed. The selection only implied that the books have been approved. It any of the schools prescribed any of the approved text-books there is no assurance as to the number of books that may be required.
 The period during which a text book once prescribed is to continue, is an injunction to the Managers of schools to avoid hardship to failed candidates or to poor students intending to buy second band books. It is not an assurance to the publishers, because, the Managers can change the text-books within the specified period with the approval of the prescribed authority.
