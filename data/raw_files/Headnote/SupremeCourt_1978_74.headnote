 In each of the two years of 1971 and 1972 there were six vacancies in the Punjab Civil Service (Executive Branch).
 To select eligible candidates for these 12 vacancies in the Punjab Civil Service and other vacancies in the allied services, after completion of the requisite formalities the State Service Commission held the competitive examination called the Punjab Civil Service and Allied Services Examination in December 1972-January, 1973. In the said examination, the appellant secured third place in the merit list of Scheduled Castes candidates. Since only two posts, one each for the years 1971 and 1972 on the basis of 20% quota reservation for Scheduled Castes candidates,were available in the Punjab Civil Service (Executive Branch) the appellant could not be appointed. In June, 1974 when one of the selected candidates bad resigned his post, the appellant on the basis of the State Government circular dated March 6, 1961, laid claim for being appointed against the resultant vacancy. But the State Government rejected his claim.
 The High Court dismissed his petition under Art. 226 on the ground that the State Government did not choose to fill up the vacancy on an ad hoc basis and since the merit list for the years 1971 and 1972 stood exhausted and a fresh competitive examination was held to fill up the vacancies available for the years 1973 and 1974, persons borne on the previous years' lists had no right to be appointed against the vacancy occurring thereafter.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : 1. The resultant vacancy caused by the resignation of one of the Scheduled Castes candidates should have gone to the appellant who was entitled to it both on the basis of merit and the policy statement contained in the Government circular as well as on the fact that no competitive examination had been held by the Commission between 1972 and the end of 1974. [557 (G-H, 52 A] 
2. The statutory rules relating to reservation of vacancies cannot operate as impediment in the way of the appointment of the appellant as it would by no means increase the number of the two posts reserved by the Government itself for members of Scheduled Castes during the relevant year. The instructions contained in the circular not only deprecate the then existing practice according to which in cases of termination of the services of a Government servant belonging to Scheduled Castes/Tribes and backward classes, the resultant vacancy was included in the normal pool of vacancies to be filled up in accordance with the block system and characterise it as repugnant to the dominant idea of giving due representation to the members of Scheduled Castes/ Tribes are terminated, the resultant vacancy should not be included in the normal pool of vacancies to be filled up in accordance with the block system but should be filled up on an ad hoc basis from the candidates belonging to those castes. The intention of the Government was that the posts vacated should remain earmarked and be filled up by the members belonging to those castes only. [551 D-F]
