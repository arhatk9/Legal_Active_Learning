 There is a basic difference between want of jurisdiction and an illegal or irregular exercise of jurisdiction, and mere noncompliance with rules of procedure (e.g., misjoinder of charges) cannot be made a ground for granting a writ under Art. 32 of the Constitution. The defect, if any, can, according to the procedure established by law, be corrected only by a court of appeal or revision, and if the appellate court which was competent to deal with the matter has con- sidered the matter and pronounced its judgment, it cannot be reopened in a proceeding under Art. 32 of the Constitution.
 Where, some time after the pronouncement of a sentence of death by hanging by a Special Tribunal of the Hyderabad State and pending confirmation of the sentence by the High Court of Hyderabad, a Regulation was passed to the effect that notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force any sentence of death passed by a Spe- cial Tribunal shall. be carried into execution by hanging:
 Held, that the Regulation 345 must be taken to have retrospective effect, as the mode of execution of a sentence cannot be regarded as a matter of substantive law, and the sentence for hanging cannot be held to be illegal even assuming that under the law which was in force in Hyderabad at the time the sentence was passed by the Special Tribunal, sentences to death could be carried out only by decapitation. In any event, as the High Court which upheld the conviction had the power to impose the sentence of death by hanging under the Regulation, no relief could be granted to the accused under Art. 32 of the Consti- tution.
 Section 7(2) of the Special Tribunals Regulation passed by the Military Governor of Hyderabad covered all those cases where manzuri and tashih were contemplated under the old law and sentences of death passed by a Special Tribunal could therefore be executed without the assent or approval of H.E.H. the Nizam.
 The result of s. 271 of the Hyderabad Criminal Procedure Code, (which corresponds to s.340 of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code) read along with the Rules and Circular Orders issued by the Hyderabad High Court is: (i) that it cannot be laid' down as a rule of law that in every capital sentence where the accused is unrepresented the trial should be held to be vitiated;and (ii) that a court of appeal or revision is not powerless to interfere if it is found that the accused was so handicapped for want of legal aid that the proceeding against him may be said to amount to negation of a fair trial.
 The writs referred to in Art. 32 must obviously be correlated to one or more of the fundamental rights con- ferred by Part III of the Constitution and can be made only for the enforcement of such rights.
 The petitioners who were convicted by a Special Tribunal of Hyderabad of murder and other offences and sentenced to death by hanging and whose convictions and sentences had been confirmed by the Hyderabad High Court before the 26th January, 1950, applied to the Supreme Court under Art. 32 of the new Constitution for the following reliefs: (i) a writ in the nature of certiorari calling upon the Government of Hyderabad and the Special Judge to produce the records of the case and show cause why the convictions and sentences should not be quashed, (ii) for a writ of prohibition directing the Government and Special Judge not to execute the petitioners, and (ill) for a writ of habeas corpus:
 Held, (i)that the writs of certiorari and prohibition could not be granted as at the date when the High Court dealt with the case and confirmed the conviction and sen- tences of the petitioners, the Supreme Court was not in existence and the Hyderabad Court could not by any stretch of reasoning be said to have been subordinate to the Supreme Court:
 45 346 (ii) the writ of habeas corpus could not be granted inasmuch as a return that the person is in detention in execution of a sentence on indictment on a criminal charge is a sufficient answer to an application for such a writ;
 (iii) assuming that it is open even in such cases to investigate the jurisdiction of the court which convicted the petitioners, the mere fact that the trial court had acted without jurisdiction would not justify interference, if the conviction and sentence had been upheld on appeal by a court of competent jurisdiction; for, the appellate court in a case which properly comes before it on appeal, is fully competent to decide whether the trial was with or without jurisdiction and it has jurisdiction to decide the matter rightly as well as wrongly; and as the High Court at Hydera- bad had jurisdiction to hear and decide the appeal, the detention of the petitioners could not be held to be in- valid;
 (iv) as the judgment of the High Court was pronounced before the 26th January, 1950, and it had acquired a finali- ty in the fullest sense of the term before that date, the Supreme Court had no power to re-open that judgment under the provisions of the new Constitution;
 (v) the fact that the petitioners had lost their right of appeal to the Judicial Committee of Hyderabad by a sudden change in the law and by the delay on the part of the High Court in the disposal of their application for leave to appeal to the said Committee was a matter for the executive authorities to consider; it could not widen the scope of the existing remedial laws beyond legitimate bounds.
 Quaere: Whether an application under Art. 32 is main- tainable after a similar application under Art. 226 has been dismissed by the High Court.
