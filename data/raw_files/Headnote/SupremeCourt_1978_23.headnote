 The respondents are the legal representatives of one Surajmal, who had purchased suit shop by a registered sale deed dated 17-5-1965, from one Bhurdas to whom the petitioner had executed two rent notes, Exhibit 8 and Exhibit 10, specifically mentioning the name of Bhurdas, as the owner of the shop. The petitioner was notified of the said sale deed by a registered letter dated 25-6-1965 which was received by him on 29-6-1965. Surajmal terminated the tenancy of the petitioner by a registered notice in July 1965, coupled with the demand for arrears of rent. Upon the failure to comply with the notice to quit, a suit was filed against the petitioner on 23-11-65. The petitioner contested the suit denying the execution of any rent note in favour of Bhurdas and pleaded having taken the shop from another individual, Mahant Ram Ratan Das. In the course of litigation, the petitioner prayed for an issue to be framed on the question whether there was legal necessity for the transfer in favour of the plaintiff by Bhurdas, which was refused. In revision against the said interlocutory order, the High Court refused to interfere taking the view that the petitioner was estopped from questioning the title of Bhurdas as his landlord by reason of the principle laid down in Section 116 of the Evidence Act.
 Ultimately, upon the decree of eviction by the trial Court and affirmed by the First Appellate Court, the defendant- petitioner again challenged the view that he was estopped from questioning the title of Bhurdas, by way of second appeal before the High Court. The High Court dismissed the appeal quoting a recital in Exhibit 10 wherein the petitioner has admitted the ownership of the shop by Bhurdas to whom he would pay rent. The petitioner thereafter filed special leave petition and obtained ex-parte ad-interim stay of eviction by alleging in Ground No. 7 that the rent note, Exhibit 10, no where stated that Bhurdas was the owner of the shop and, therefore, there was no proper appreciation of the said Exhibit.
 The respondent filed an application for revocation of the special leave petition. Revoking the special leave and dismissing it the Court.
 
HELD : In dealing with application for special leave, the Court naturally takes statements of facts and grounds of fact contained in the petitions at their face value and it would be unfair to betray the confidence of the Court by making statements, which are untrue and misleading. Supreme Court cannot permit abuse of the process of law and of law courts. [812 BC] Hari Narain v. Badri Das, [1963] INSC 46; [1964] 2 SCR 203 @ 209 and Rajabhal Abdul Rehman Munshi v.

 Observation:
 Supreme Court cannot mitigate possible rigours of any law by permitting defaulting tenants to hold up their evictions indefinitely or for inordinately long periods on flimsy or unsustainable grounds. [813 B-C] 810
