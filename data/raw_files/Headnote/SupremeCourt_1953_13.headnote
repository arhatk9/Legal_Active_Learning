 An order for transfer of a suit, made under clause 13 of the Letters Patent of the Calcutta High Court is not a "judgment" within the meaning of clause 15 of the Letters Patent and no appeal lies therefrom under the Letters Patent, as it neither affects the merits of the controversy between the parties in the suit itself, nor terminates or disposes of the suit on any ground.
 [Meaning of the word "judgment" discussed].
