 The four respondents made two applications to the Settlement Officer Consolidation, for permission under sub-s. (1) of s.
 16A for the U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act 1953 for transfer by way of exchange of certain plots in 11 villages.
 The proceedings for consolidation were in progress in all the 11 villages. The settlement officer refused the permission under sub-section (2) of s. 16A of the Act and the same was confirmed by the. Deputy Director of Consolidation. The respondents challeng the said orders of Consolidation authorities in a writ petition filed before the High Court. The learned single judge dismissed the petition but the respondents succeeded in a special appeal before the division bench. The Division Bench held that s.
 16A(2) of the Act was mandatory. Under it the Settlement Officer is bound to grant permission torespondents as the exchange was not likely to defeat the scheme of consolidation and they directed the Settlement Officer to passan order keeping in view the aforesaid principles. The DeputyDirector of Consolidation preferred this appeal with Special leave.
 Held : (1) that where an application for transfer fell within the terms of s. 16A(1) i.e., where it was filed at the stage referred to in it, the settlement officer is enjoined to allow the application unless the proposed transfer is likely to defeat the scheme of consolidation.
 (2)that if there happened to be conflict between "a principle" as formulated under s. 18 or a concrete "proposal" as confirmed under s. 23 on the one hand and the transfer prayed for on the other, the settlement officer would be entitled to refuse the permission to transfer under section 16A(2) of the Act but otherwise the application for transfer would be allowed if it satisfied the conditions laid down under s. 16A(1) and 16A(2) of the Act. It is for the settlement officer to decide whether such conflicts exist or not.
 (3)that the direction of the learned Judges of Division Bench to the Settlement Officer was not in accordance with the provision of s. 16A(2) read with other relevant provisions of the Act.
