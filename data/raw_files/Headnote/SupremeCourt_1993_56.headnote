 The respondents in this Civil Appeal were working as Agragamies. They riled Writ Petitions before the High Court, claiming that, since they were similarly placed to the Firemen and Leaders in the West Bengal Fire Service, they must be given the same pay scale as was admissible to the said Firemen and Leaders. The State Government denied the claim on the ground that the duties and functions performed by the respondents and the Firemen and leaders were totally different and distinct.
 The Writ Petition was allowed by a Single Judge. The Government preferred an appeal before the Division Bench of the High Court The Division Bench, on a comparison of the academic qualifications and physical requirements found that the Agragamies were in no way differently situated from the Firemen/Leaders in the West Bengal Fire Service and that the Agragamies performed more onerous duties and thus their claim for higher pay Scale was perfectly just and proper.
 Affirming the decision of the Learned Single Judge, the Division Bench dismissed the Writ Appeal.
 The State filed the present Appeal by Special Leave challenging the Judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court, contending that the Agragmies and Firemen/Leaders in The Fire Service Department of West Bengal were not similarly situated in the matter of recruitment, conditions of service and duties and responsibilities discharged, that the Fire-fighting 398 training given to the Agragamies was in no way similar to the one Imparted to Firemen/Leaders. That the Services of Agragamies were indented upon by the Fire Services Department only in times of emergency or acute need and as such they could not be equalled with other categories In these departments that the Pay Commission had prescribed a lower pay Scale for the Agragamies which was neither discriminatory nor it amounted to treating equals unequally.
 Respondents submitted that in fact Agragamies performed more onerous duties than firemen/leaders and they do not lag behind in the matter of academic qualification or physical requirements for recruitment, that having regard to the nature of duties and responsibilities performed by them the Agragamies were justly entitled to the higher scale granted to them by the High Court.
 Allowing the appeal, this court, 
HELD : 1.01. It would be evident from a comparison of the nature of duties, responsibilities and functions of the Agragamies and Firemen/Leaders of Fire Service Department that they are neither same or similar. The firemen and leaders are the members of the Fire Service Department whereas the Agragamies are members of West Bengal Civil Emergency Force meant as an auxiliary force to assist the various Government departments and agencies in times of emergency and acute need. No doubt they are also members of a Government Service and they too have to report to their office and be available for such duties as they may be called upon to perform, but it would not be correct to say that they perform the same or similar duties as that of Firemen or Leaders of the Fire Service Department. [403G-H, 404A] 1.02. There is bound to be a difference in the quality of Fire righting job of both of them. Firemen and leaders are a specialised fire righting force while the Agragamies are, so to speak 'jacks of all trades' having been given elementary training in various fields. When called upon to assist, Agragamies assist fire fighting personnel including firemen and leaders just as they assist personnel of other department. It is idle to contend that they perform the same duties and functions as firemen/leaders. 1404B-C] 1.03. Merely because the academic qualification and physical requirement of both are similar or that the Agragamies are also given a 399 certain fire-fighting training alongwith other training, it cannot be said that they perform similar duties, functions and responsibilities as the firemen/leaders. [404E] 1.04. The respondents have failed to establish the crucial facts entitling them to the higher pay-scale. They have also failed to prove that they are discriminated in any manner in the matter of pay. [404F]
