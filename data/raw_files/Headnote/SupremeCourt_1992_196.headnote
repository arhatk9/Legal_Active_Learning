 The appellant, a lineal male descendant of one of the Generals of a former ruler was holding 294.61 acres of land, which was the subject-matter of a grant made by the former ruler at the time of his daughter's marriage. The appellant filed return under Section 12 of the Maharashtra Agricultural Lands (Ceiling on Holdings) Act, 1961 without prejudice to his claim that the lands were covered by a sovereign legislative grant flowing from the sovereign authority of the ruler of the erstwhile princely State, and as such did not come within the purview of the Act. The Special Deputy Collector (Land Reforms) declared 176.91 acres of the land as surplus. The land owner preferred appeal before the State Revenue Tribunal under Section 33 of the Act. The Tribunal dismissed the appeal. The appellant challenged the order of the Special Deputy Collector and of the Tribunal before the High Court. The High Court also dismised the writ petition. Hence the appeal, by special leave.
 On behalf of the appellant, it was contended that the grant in question was sovereign legislative grant made by a sovereign ruler; it was recognised and continued by the British Government; it was thus a special law in favour of General's family, and as this law was existing on the date of the commencement of the Constitution of India, it was protected by Article 372 of the Constitution and should be deemed to be in force and could not be abrogated except by an Act of the legislature specially made in that respect.
 Dismissing the appeal, by Special Leave, this Court 
 HELD : The High Court was right in holding that even in the case 930 of a ruler who combined in himself both executive and legislative powers of his Government and was undisputed head of the State, the jurisprudential distinction between legislative enactment and executive action had not been obliterated and the question, whether a particular grant was a legislative grant or not, depended on the facts and circumstances of each case, and that the grant in question was a gift pure and simple and was not a legislative Act on the part of the ruler.
