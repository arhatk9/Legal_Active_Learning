 Disputes having arisen between the appellant and the respondent, they were referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement entered into between the parties. The arbitrator gave his award. The appellant applied for filing of the award into Court and for making it a rule of Court.
 The validity of the award was challenged by the respondent, and the trial Court and the High Court set it aside on the grounds (1) that the award was made after the prescribed period and (2) that theagreement for arbitration was defective on account of vagueness and uncertainty.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court and remanding the matter to the High Court for disposal.
 
HELD : (1) Under cl. (3) of the Schedule to the Arbitration Act, 1940,the arbitrator is expected to make his award within four months of his entering on the reference or on his being called upon to act or within such extended time as the Court may allow. Reading the clause with s. 28 of the Act the power to enlarge the time for making the award is vested, in the Court and not in the arbitrator. Section 28(2), however, indicates an exception. namely when the parties agree to such enlargement after the arbitrator enters on the arbitration. But the section does not require that the parties should stipulate in the arbitration agreement itself, for such enlargement of time by a, subsequent agreement. Even in a case where there is no such stipulation in the original agreement the arbitrator is entitled to enlarge the time if after entering on the reference the parties to the arbitration consent to such enlargement.[261G-H; 262A-D] In the present case the enlargement of time for making the award wason the request and mutual consent of the parties during arbitration, and therefore, the award made within the extended time must be deemed to be valid. [263A-C] (2) A perusal of the agreement in the background of the disputes that had arisen shows that the agreement was neither vague nor uncertain. In fact,the parties never complained before the arbitrator of any such vagueness or uncertainty.
