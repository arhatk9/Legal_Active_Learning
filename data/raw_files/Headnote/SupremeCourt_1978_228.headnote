 The U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 was enacted for the abolition of zamindari system which involved intermediaries between the tiller or the soil and the State. The Act provides for the acquisition of the rights, title and interest of intermediaries and to reform the law relating to land tenure consequent upon such abolition. Chapter II makes provision for acquisition of the interest of intermediaries and the consequences flowing therefrom. As from the date to be specified in a notification to be issued by the State Government all estates situate in the State shall vest in the State and all such estates shall stand transferred and vest, with certain exceptions, in the State free from all encumbrances.
 Section 20 confers the status of adhivasi on certain classes of tenants, sub tenants and occupants. Section 20(a)(i) which seeks to confer on a tenant of sir the status of adhivasi provides that every person who is a tenant of sir would become an adhivasi of the land, unless he has become a bhumidar of the land under 8. 18(2) or asami under s. 21 (h) and shall be entitled to take or retain possession thereof. Section 20(b) (i) provides that every person who was recorded as occupant of any land in the khasra or Khatauni of 1356F shall become adhivasi except in certain cases. Section 21(h) provides that every person who, on. the date preceding the date of vesting occupied or held land as a tenant of sir a sub-tenant or occupant, shall be deemed to be an asami thereof.
 The plaintiff was an intermediary who held the land in dispute as sir under s. 18 of the Abolition Act and became a bhumidar of the land.
 In three different suits filed against the defendants the plaintiff claimed that she was entitled to recover possession from the defendants, who were tenants of sir on the ground that she was holding the suit lands as an intermediary and held the land as sir. She claimed that (i) she had become a bhumidar under s. 18 of the Act and (ii) she being a disabled person within the meaning of s. 157 of the Act and the defendant in each case being an occupant had become an asami by the combined operation of s. 20(b)(i) and s. 21(h) and, therefore, she was entitled to recover possession from the defendant in each suit. The defendants, in each suit on the other hand, claim ed that he had become an adhivasi and therefore, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover possession.
 The plaintiff's suits were dismissed by the lower court. Appeals to the District Judge and the High Court were also dismissed.
 297 In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the plaintiffs that A if the tenant of sir who falls under s. 20(a)(i) is also recorded as occupant under s. 20(b)(i) in the khasra of 1356F he would become an occupant aud would acquire the status of adhivasi under s. 20(b)(i) and in that event if the landholder of such occupant is a disabled person within the meaning of s. 157, such occupant would not be an adhivasi but shall be deemed to be an asami thereof in view of the provisions contained in s. 21(h).
 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: (1) If the defendant in each case was a tenant of sir in respect of land of which possession is sought by the plaintiff and no one else was shown as the occupant of such land in 1356F obviously the defendant in each case would become adhivasi under s. 20(a) (i). Therefore, s. 21 (h) would not be attracted because the third clause of s. 21(h) refers to an occupant as envisaged in s. 20(b)(i) and therefore the defendant would not become an asami as therein contemplated. [305D-E] (2) Although the expression "occupant" is not defined in the Abolition Act it has been interpreted to mean a person holding the land in possession or actual enjoyment.
 If a person was a tenant of sir on the date immediately preceding the date of vesting but was not recorded as an occupant in Khasra or Khatauni of 1356F he became an adhivasi and not an asami under s. 20(a)(i). If on the other hand he is not only a tenant of sir and is also recorded as an occupant in the khasra or khatauni of 1356F meaning thereby that if on the relevant date he was in possession and actual enjoyment of the land, he would become adhivasi under s. 20(b)(i) and would be exposed to the further exception enacted in 8. 21(h) which, if attracted, would make him asami. Therefore, a tenant of sir not being in possession on the relevant date would be in a more favorable position than one who would be in continuous undisturbed possession being recorded as occupant in khasra or Khatauni of 1356F. Such could not be the intention of the legislature. [302H; 303A-B] Amba Prasad v. Abdul Noor Khan & Ors., [1964] INSC 128; [1964] 7 SCR 800; referred to.
 Kumari Radha Kishori v. Joint Director of Consolidation, U.P., 1972 All. L.J. 738; approved.
 (3) Section 20(a)(i) and (ii) provide for conferring the status of adhivasi on a tenant of sir or sub-tenant as the case may be, but it also comprehends the situation that such a tenant of sir or a sub-tenant may not be in possession and there may be someone else recorded as occupant in khasra or khatauni of 1356 which would mean that someone other than the tenant of sir, or a sub-tenant was in possession or actual enjoyment of the land. It is such an occupant who is in actual possession and enjoyment of land being the tiller of soil, was to be adhivasi in preference to tenant of Sir or sub-tenant of such land. Such class of occupant envisaged in s. 20(b)(i) is taken out of the operation of 9. 20(a)(i) or (ii) by engrafting an exception except as provided in s. 20(b) (i). That is why s. 20(a) (i) and (ii) open with an exception, namely, except as provided in sub-clause (i) of clause (b) which would mean that except where there is an occupant recorded in 1356 F on the land of which there is tenant of sir or sub-tenant the latter would become adhivasi, but where there is an occupant on land recorded in 1356 F such occupant would be adhivasi. [303F-H] 298 With a view to extinguishing feudal overlordship and removing all intermediaries so as to establish direct relationship between the State and the tiller of the soil, a bold attempt was made by the Act to remove all intermediaries. This laudable object in enacting the statute must inform interpretative process and where the language is ambiguous or capable of two interpretations, the court should so interpret the provision as to advance the legislative intendment.
