 There was a clash between the parties of the accused and complainant over the possession of certain land; in which the appellant inflicted a fatal spear injury on the chest of the deceased. in a prosecution for offences under s. 302 and s. 302/149, I.P.C., the trial court and the High Court found that the party of the complainant had deliberately come to forcibly prevent or obstruct the possession of the accused persons, and that such forcible obstruction and prevention were unlawful. But while the trial Court acquitted all the accused on the ground that the accused were exercising their tight of private defence, the High Court held that the ,appellant exceeded his right of private defence on the sole ground that he had used his spear with greater force than was necessary, that he had given a dangerous blow with considerable force with a spear on the chest of the deceased though he himself had only received a superficial lathi blow on his head, and convicted him for an offence under s. 304.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court.
 
HELD:The High Court erred in convicting the appellant on the g round that he exceeded his right of private defence. [60D-E] To say that the appellant could only claim the right to use force after he had sustained a serious injury by an aggressive wrongful assault is a complete misunderstanding of the law embodied in s. 102, I.P.C. According to that section the right of private defence of the body commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body arises from an attempt or threat to commit the offence, though the offence may not have been committed, and such right continues so long as such apprehension of danger to the body continues. The threat, however, must reasonably give rise to the present and imminent, and not to remote or distant, danger. This right rests on the principle that where a crime is endeavored to be committed by force, it is lawful to repel that force in self-defence. The right of private defence is available for protection against apprehended unlawful aggression and not for punishing the aggressor for the offence Committed by him.. It is a preventive and not a punitive right. If, after sustaining a serious injury there is no apprehension of further danger to the body then obviously the right of private defence would not be available. [60D-H, 61A] Therefore, as soon as the appellant reasonably apprehended danger to his body even from a threat (which is real) on the part of the complainant's party to assault him for the purpose of forcibly taking possession of the land in dispute or of obstructing their cultivation, he got the right of private defence and to use adequate force against the wrongful aggressor in exercise of that right. [61A-B] (b)The approach of the High Court that merely because the complainant's party had used lathis, the appellant was not justified in using his spear is equally misconceived aid cannot be supported under s. 100, 58 I.P.C. During the course of malee, like the present, the use of a lathi on the head may very well give rise to a reasonable apprehension that death or grievous hurt would result from an injury caused thereby. It cannot be laid down as a general rule that the use of a lathi as dis- tinguished from the use of a spear must always be held to result only in milder injury, because, a blow by a lathi on the head may prove instantaneously fatal. Therefore, if a- blow with a lathi is aimed at a vulnerable part like the head it cannot be laid down as a sound proposition of law that in such cases the victim is not justified in using his spear in defending himself. In such moments of excitement or disturbed mental equilibrium it is difficult to expect parties facing grave aggression to coolly weigh, as if in golden scales, and calmly determine with a composed mind as to what precise kind and severity of blow would be legally sufficient for effectively meeting the unlawful aggression.
 The view of the High Court is not only unrealistic and unpractical but also contrary to law and in conflict with its own observations, while acquiting the other accused, that in such cases the matter cannot be weighed in scales of gold. [61D-H, 62A-B]
