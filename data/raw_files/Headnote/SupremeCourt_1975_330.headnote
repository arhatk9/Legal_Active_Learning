 On March 21, 1963, the trustees of the Gorakhpur Town Improvement Trust were appointed by a notification under s.
 4 of the U.P. Town Improvement Act, 1919. The Trust notified a Housing Scheme on March 13, 1965, under s. 36. The 1919 Act was repealed by the U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad Adhiniyam 1966, and, the Housing Scheme was finally sanctioned under s. 32(1) of the The appellant challenged in the High Court the validity of the Housing Scheme, but, the High Court dismissed the writ petition.
 On appeal to this Court, it was contended (1) that the trust was never properly constituted because the commencement of the terms of office of first trustees took place only after the repeal of the 1919 Act; (ii) that, the scheme. as sanctioned by the Trust, not being the same as the one which was first notified under the 1919-Act, could not be continued under the provisions of s. 97 of the 1966- Act. and (iii) that, the notification under s. 32(1) of 1966-Act, which was to be equated with a notification under s. 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, was invalid because it was not published within two years after the commencement of the Land Acquisition (Amendment and Validation) Act, 1967.
 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: (1) (a) Section 100 of the 1919-Act which deals with validation of acts and proceedings, completely refutes the argument based upon a specious distinction between the appointment of members of the Trust and the constitution of the Trust and upon an unwarranted condition sought to be imposed upon the competence of members of the Trust to act.
 [5D-E] (b) A Trust duly incorporated by the terms of a statute cannot be lacking in power or competence to act at all simply because s. 8 meant to notify the commencement of office of the first trustees only under the Act, has not been complied with simultaneously with or soon after the appointment of the first trustees. [5E-G] (c) The whole object of s. 8 is only to determine the date of commencement of the term of office of the members of the Trust in order to fix the date of its expiry so as to enable fresh appointments to be made in time. Assuming that the Gorakhpur Improvement Trust was first constituted in 1963, there is no provision indicating that the constitution of the Trust was not complete as a soon as it was declared by statute and a Chairman and Trustees took charge of their offices by reason of their appointment as trustees. This had been done by notification under s. 4(2). Therefore, the need for a notification under s. 8 had not been felt till the expiry of the term of office of the first trustees drew near. This explains why the subsequent notification which was really a corollary of a notification under s. 4(2) took place so late when the three years' period of tion proceedings. [10G-H; 11B-C] (d) Even assuming that the date of the coming into force of the 1966-Act Was subsequent to February 21, 1966, absence of a notification under s. 8 could not invalidate any proceeding of the Trust. Even if a notification under s.
 8 should have followed soon after the notification under s.
 4(2) of the 1919-Act, 2 yet, s. 100 prevents any such technical irregularity from invalidating any proceeding of the Trust, including the framing and implementation of the scheme. [6B-D] (2) The appellant has not shown how any feature of the originally framed scheme, apart from an acquisition by it of a new Hindi appellation, was altered so that it could not be continued under s. 97(3) of the 1966-Act. The argument is based on speculation about the changed character of the two supposedly separate and different schemes. The scheme had been referred to by the same name in sd far as the locality to which it related was concerned. The plots involved were admitted to be the same both in the initial and the final notification. [6E-G] (3 (a) The object of the notification under s. 6 of the Land Acquisition Act is to ensure that the Government is duly satisfied after an enquiry that the land under consideration was really needed for a public purpose and that the declaration was to operate as conclusive evidence to show that this was so. The conclusiveness of this declaration could not be questioned anywhere if the procedure dealing with its making has been observed. [10D-E] (b) Under s. 4(2) of the Land acquisition (Amendment and Validation) Act, 1967, it is the declaration which has to take place within two years of the expiry of the commencement of the ordinance. If an unreasonable delay between declaration and its notification is shown to exist it may raise a suspicion about the existence of the declaration itself or about the bona fides of acquisition proceedings. [10G-H; 11B- C] In the instant case neither the existence nor the bona fides of the declaration had been questioned. The appellant had neither asserted nor shown that no declaration was made within the period of time fixed for it. [11C-D]
