 The assessee was a registered firm. The partners applied to the Income-tax Officer for renewal of registration. To that application they appended a certificate that the profits of the previous year were divided or credited as shown. While the application was pending, the partners fell out and the Income-tax Officer found, that the firm had earned considerable black market profits which had not been credited in the account books and had not been distributed among the partners in accordance with the instrument of partnership. The Department, Tribunal and the High Court, on reference, held that the firm was not entitled to renewal.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : Under s. 26A of the Income-tax Act, 1922, one of the conditions for registration and renewal is that the application should contain such particulars as are prescribed in the Rules under the Act.. Rule 6(3) provides that the partners should append a certificate to the application for renewal that the profits (or loss if any) of the previous year or period up to the date of dissolution were divided or credited as shown. So long as the divisible profits had in fact been divided or had been credited to the accounts of the partners, the requirements of the provision must be held to have been complied with. But the certificate is not a mere formality because, a registered firm is not taxable, but only the partner and, if a portion of the profits earned by the firm was not actually divided amongst the partners or credited to their accounts, to that extent the assessee firm had evaded tax. In such a case the only course open to the Income-tax Officer is not to register the firm but to tax the partners of the firm as an association of persons. [506 B, G; 507 C-G] Since, in the present case, the application for renewal of registration did not comply with the prescribed conditions, under r. 6A, the Income-tax Officer was justified in refusing renewal of registration. [507 F-G] Agarwal & Co. v. C. 1. T., U. P., 77 I. T. R. 110 (S.C.), followed.
