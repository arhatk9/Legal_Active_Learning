 One `B' filed an Election Petition challenging the appellant's election as M.L.A. On the death of `B' the Election Petition abated, and the same was published in accordance with Section 112 (2) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. Upon the said publication, four applications including those of the Respondents were filed before the High Court for substitution in place of the deceased petitioner. The High Court allowed the two applications by the Respondents and dismissed the other two applications.
 The appellant-M.L.A. has preferred the present appeal by special leave, against the High Court's order substituting the Respondents in the Election Petition.
 On behalf of the appellant, it was contended that the High Court was wrong in holding that the question of providing security deposit for costs would arise only after an order for substitution is made; and that the respondent could have been directed to be substituted only after they had actually deposited the amount of security.
 On behalf of the respondents, it was contended that when four applications had been made for substitution an order had first to be passed indicating the names of the applicants who were to be substituted and only thereafter the security amount could be deposited Dismissing the appeal, this Court 
 HELD : 1. The High Court was right in holding that simulatane- 32 ous deposit of any amount as security for costs at the time of presentation of the applications for substitution was not necessary. On a plain reading of Section 117 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 the said requirement is applicable at the time of presenting an Election Petition. An application for substitution made under sub- section (3) of Section 112 consequent upon the Death of the election petitioner cannot be put at par with the presentation of an election petition. [34FG] 
 2. The right to apply to be substituted accrues on fulfilment of two conditions, viz. that the person making the application should be one who might himself have been a petitioner and that the application is made within fourteen days of the publication made under sub-section (2) of Section 112. He, however, becomes entitled to be substituted only upon compliance with the conditions, if any, as to security. The applications made by the respondents could not, therefore, be dismissed on the ground that no amount was deposited as security for costs at the time of presenting the said applications. [35A-C] 
 3. While considering an application for substitution court has to consider as to whether any deposit is to be made or not as security for costs and if it is to be made what is the amount which has to be deposited. If the Court comes to the conclusion on the facts of a given case that no amount is to be deposited as security for costs an order of subscription simpliciter would be sufficient. The fact that no deposit as security is to be made with reason therefore would, however, have to be simultaneously stated in the order of substitution. On the other hand, if the Court comes to the conclusion that some amount has to be deposited by the applicants who are proposed to be substituted, as security for costs, the amount should be simultaneously specified in the order of substitution and the entitlement of such applicant to be substituted should be made subject to compliance with the condition of depositing the amount so specified. [35E-G] 
 4. In the instant case, the respondents were directed to deposit the security amount, in the same order permitting their substitution, and it was deposited the very next day.
 In view of this circumstance, even though the order appealed against may not be said to be in strict compliance with the requirements of sub-section (3) of Section 112 of the Act, the order is not interfered with. [35H; 36A, B]
