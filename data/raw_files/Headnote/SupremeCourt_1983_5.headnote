 Sub s. (2A) of s. 8 of the Administration of Evacuee Property Act, 1950 states that all property which under any law repealed by the Act purports to have vested as evacuee property in any person exercising the powers of Custodian in any State shall, notwithstanding any defect in, or the invalidity of such law or any judgment, decree or order of any Court be deemed for all purposes to have validly vested in that person, as if the provisions of such law had been enacted by Parliament and such property shall, on the commencement of the Act, be deemed to have been evacuee property declared as such within the meaning of the Act and accordingly, any order made or other action taken by the Custodian or, any other authority in relation to such property shall be deemed to have been validly and lawfully made or taken.
 The properties which were the subject matter of the suit from which this appeal arose were situate in the erstwhile State of Junagadh and belonged to one Haji Umar Kasam who had sailed from Bombay on October 8, 1947 on a pilgrimage to Mecca. On May 1, 1948 a notice in respect of these properties was issued under the Junagadh State Evacuee (Administration of Property) Act XII of 1948 but it was withdrawn on May 31, 1948 on receipt of a reply from his son that he had not gone away from Junagadh out of fear of civil disturbances but in fact had gone on Haj and was expected to return shortly. Since he did not return till September, 1948 the Custodian took possession of the suit properties.
 Thereafter the territory of Junagadh became integrated with the United States of Saurashtra and the Junagadh Act was repealed by a Saurashtra Ordinance which in turn was repealed by a Central Ordinance. The Administration of Evacuee Property Act, 1950 replaced the Central Ordinance.
 An order declaring Haji Umar Kasam as an evacuee was issued on May 20, 1949 by the Custodian purporting to act under the Junagadh Act. The appeal filed against this order before the District Judge, Junagadh was transferred by him to the High Court of Saurashtra which in turn sent the same to the Custodian of Saurashtra for disposal. Haji Umar Kasam returned to India 250 during the pendency of that appeal and filed a petition under the provisions of the Central Ordinance-which had come into force by then-before the Custodian General requesting him to transfer the appeal to his file for disposal. Before this petition could be heard, the appeal was dismissed by the Custodian of Saurashtra on June 2, 1950. A revision filed against this order was dismissed on August 9, 1950 by the Custodian General along with the petition for transfer of the appeal which had been filed earlier. Haji Umar Kasam's application under s. 16 of the Central Ordinance for restoration of his property was also turned down when the Central Government declined to grant the certificate contemplated under the proviso to sub-s. (1) thereof on the ground that, contrary to his claim that he had gone to Mecca and stayed there, there was evidence suggesting that he must have been in Karachi for a major part of the period during which he was away from India. A notification was also issued in respect of the suit properties under s. 12 of the Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act, 1954.
 The heirs and legal representatives of Haji Umar Kasam filed the suit contending that he was not an evacuee; that the taking over of possession of the properties after the withdrawal of the notice on May 31, 1948 without issuing further notice was illegal; that an order directing restoration of the properties to Haji Umar Kasam had been passed on March 1, 1949 and therefore the order of May 20, 1949 declaring him an evacuee without issuing notice or holding an inquiry was illegal; and that the orders passed by the Custodian and the Custodian General on June 2, 1950 and August 9, 1950 respectively as well as the refusal by the Government of India to grant the certificate under s. 16 were all contrary to law.
 The Union of India which contested the suit did not deny that an order was made on March 1, 1949 as stated above but pleaded that the order dated May 20, 1949 had been passed in accordance with law after making necessary inquiry at which the plaintiffs had been given sufficient opportunity to prove that Haji Umar Kasam was not an evacuee. Ii placed reliance on the order passed on the application made under s. 16 and the notification issued under s. 12 of the Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act, 1954 and on s. 46 which barred the jurisdiction of the civil court to decide the questions raised in the suit.
 The trial court dismissed the suit and the appeal against its dismissal was rejected by the High Court. On the question relating to the existence of the order of March 1, 1949 directing the restoration of properties of Haji Umar Kasam, while the trial court was of the view that there was no such order, the High Court held that such an order had been made;
 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD :Sub-s. (2A) of s. 8 operates even if there is no defect in any previous law under which action is taken and cures all defects, if any, in the taking over of the properties as evacuee properties. The words "notwithstanding any defect in or the invalidity of, such law or any judgment, decree or order of any 251 Court" found in this sub-section do not cut down the operation of the clear words of the sub-section which validate the vesting of any property which purports to have vested as evacuee property even if there was any irregularity in the procedure. The non-obstante clause referred to above is not intended to whittle down the operation of sub-s (2A) of s. 8. It is introduced only out of abundant caution. In the context in which this sub- section appears it is not correct to hold that it would operate only where there is any defect in or invalidity of any previous law or where there is any judgment, decree or order of any court to the contrary.

 In the instant case it cannot be disputed that the suit properties had been taken over under the Junagadh Act as evacuee properties in September, 1948 and had continued to be in the possession of the Custodian till the Act was passed and therefore it is not possible to hold that they were not evacuee properties. [268 H, 269 A] (ii) Whereas under s. 7 of the Act an enquiry had to precede the declaration that a property was an evacuee property, under the Junagadh Act no such enquiry was contemplated. The Custodian was required by s. 7 of that Act to take possession of any property which had been left in Junagadh by an evacuee. The suit properties had been taken over as evacuee properties in September, 1948 because Haji Umar Kasam had not returned to Junagadh for over one year.
 Such taking over was an administrative act. By reason of the combined effect of ss. 4 and 16 (1) of the Junagadh Act the properties continued to be vested in the Custodian. The order dated March 1, 1949 under which it is claimed that the properties were ordered to be returned has not been produced. Even if such an order was there unless it is shown that such an order had been passed by the State Government and published in the Official Gazette, the suit properties would not cease to be evacuee properties. By virtue of s. 5 of the Saurashtra Ordinance they became vested in the Custodian of Saurashtra and by virtue of s. 8 (2) of the Central Ordinance they became vested in the Custodian appointed under that Ordinance. All properties vested under the Central Ordinance became evacuee property in the hands of the Custodian appointed under the Act by virtue of sub- ss. (2) and (2A) of s. 8. Any doubt that existed about the vesting of the properties in the Custodian under the Act as evacuee property was removed by enacting sub-s; (2A) of s. 8 with retrospective effect. [261 E-H, 262 A-E, 266 E-F] (iii) It is only after the Central Ordinance came into force that Haji Umar Kasam preferred his petition for restoration of his properties under s. 16 (1) of 252 that Ordinance, and also applied for a certificate as per proviso to that sub-section to the Government of India.
 Again it is only after the Act came into force replacing the Central Ordinance that the Custodian General disposed of the petition for transfer of the appeal pending before the Custodian of Saurashtra and the revision petition filed against his order dated June 2, 1950. The effect of these proceedings have to be considered in the light of the provisions of the Act. [263 G-H, 264 A-B] (iv) Section 28 bars the jurisdiction of any court to entertain any suit or proceeding with respect to any order passed by the authorities mentioned therein. Section 46 which is worded very widely bars the jurisdiction of civil or revenue courts in regard to matters mentioned therein. No such court can entertain any suit or proceeding in which the question whether any property is or is not evacuee property arises or in which the legality of any action taken by the Custodian General or the Custodian under the Act is questioned. Any matter which the Custodian General or the Custodian is empowered to determine by or under the Act is also outside the jurisdiction of any such court. In view of these provisions it was not open to the civil court to decide whether the suit properties were evacuee properties or not. It was also not open to it to decide the correctness of the order of the Custodian General dated August 9, 1950 declining to interfere with the order of the Custodian dated June 2, 1950. The question whether a certificate should have been issued by the Central Government also was by implication barred as it was the Custodian who had to restore the property after holding an inquiry into the title of the evacuee when an application was made to him along with a certificate issued by the Central Government and a certificate of that nature by itself would be of no use.
 Neither Haji Umar Kasam, nor after his death, his heirs and legal representatives, questioned these orders before the High Court under Art. 226 or before this Court under Art. 32 or Art. 136. Thus they became final and were beyond the jurisdiction of the civil court. [269 C-H, 270 A] Custodian of Evacuee Property, Punjab & Ors. v.

 (v) On the publication of the notification under s. 12 of the Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act, 1954 the right, title or interest of Haji Umar Kasam in the suit properties became extinguished and they vested absolutely in the Central Government free from all encumbrances by virtue of s. 12 (2) of that Act.
