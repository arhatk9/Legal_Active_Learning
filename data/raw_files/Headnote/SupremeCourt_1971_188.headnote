 The assessee held the managing agency of a public limited company Under the agreement the assessee was to continue as managing agents for a minimum period of 21 years. On April 23, 1951 the Directors of the managed company passed a resolution terminating the services of the assessee as managing agents. This resolution was affirmed by the shareholders at their extraordinary general meeting held on May 23, 1951. There was dispute about the compensation payable to the assessee. In a suit filed by the latter the trial judge as well as the Appellate Bench of the Bombay High Court held that under the terms of the agreement the assessee was only entitled to liquidated damages at the rate of Rs. 6000 per month for the unexpired period of the agency namely 3 years 2 months and 7 days. The suit was decreed for Rs. 2,34,000 on November 17, 1955 and the assessee received the amount in December 1955. The assessee contended before the Income-tax Officer that as it maintained accounts on the mercantile system and the amount had become due in 1951 the same could not be taxed in the assessment year 1956-57 under s. 10,(5A) of the Income-tax Act, 1922. Before the said section was introduced into the Act by the Finance Act, 1955 compensation received on termination of a managing agency was treated as a capital receipt; after its enactment such compensation became taxable as income. The section was not retrospective, so that if the assessee's plea that the compensation amount accrued in 1951 was accepted it could not be treated as income at all. The Income-tax Officer and the Appellate Assistant Commissioner rejected the plea. The Tribunal however held that on the facts and circumstances of the case the compensation became due to the assessee on April 23, 1951 and therefore it could not be brought to tax in the assessment year 1956-57. The High Court in reference held that the amount was not taxable but the interest thereon could be taxed in 1956-57. The Revenue appealed.
 
HELD: (i) It was rightly held by the High Court that the assessee was entitled under the agreement to liquidated damages at the rate of Rs. 6,000 per month for the unexpired period of the managing agency.
 118 As such the assessee's right to get the compensation arose on April 23, 1951 when the resolution terminating the managing agency was passed. [123A-B] (ii) Section 10 (5A) refers to 'payment due or received'.
 The expression 'due to' refers to those assessees who maintain their accounts according to the mercantile system of accountancy and the expression received by' applies to those assessees who adopt the cash system of accountancy.
 Since the assessee in the present case maintained the mercantile system of accounting the relevant assessment year for the compensation accruing on April 23, 1951 was the succeeding assessment year. [123 C-D, H] Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras V. A. Gajapathy Naidu, 53 I.T.R. 114, applied.
 (iii) The plea on behalf of the Revenue that the right to get the amount arose when the quantum of compensation was determined by the High Court, could not be accepted. The fact that the assessee was claiming an exorbitant sum to which it was not entitled would not convert its right into a contingent right. [124 E-G] Thiagaraja Chettiar & Co. v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras, 51 I.T.R. 393 and F. E. Hardosstle & Co. (P) Ltd. v.
 Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay City 1, 47 I.T.R. 394, approved.
 (iv) The plain and unambiguous words of s. 10 (5A) which had become an integral part of the Act, lent no support to the plea that by a legal fiction the compensation must be deemed to have accrued to the assessee in December 1955. The fact that the assessee included the receipt in question in its profit and loss account in the year 1955 was a wholly immaterial circumstances. That circumstance did not afford any basis for the argument that for this particular receipt the assessee adopted a different system of accountancy.
 Obviously the entry was delayed because of the dispute.
 What is relevant is the method of accounting and not the actual entries. [125E-G]
