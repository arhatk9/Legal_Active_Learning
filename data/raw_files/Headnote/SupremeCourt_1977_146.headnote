 As a result of negotiations between the appellant, an Indian engineering concern and the respondent, a Hungarian State Undertaking carrying on export import trade, the parties had drawn up on April 2, 1970 (Annexure A) a, broad arrangement between them. The first four clauses of Annexure A related to the appellant being chosen to represent the respondent in the sale of their goods exclusively in certain specified States in India and the second part deals with the purchase of two specific items, namely, Counterblow Hammer Type EK 25 and EK 13A machines. On the same date two formal contracts (Annexurea B1 and B2) were entered into between the parties.
 Clause 8 of Annexures B1 and B2 states that all questions, disputes, etc. relating to the contract, shall be referred to the arbitration of Bharat Chamber of Commerce. By an agreement dated April 6, 1970 (Annexure C) the appellant was appointed as sales-representative of the respondent. Clause 14 of this agreement contained an arbitration clause. But the two arbitration clauses differed on the composition of the arbitrators as well as the substantive and processual laws to be applied.
 The appellant alleged that there was a breach of contract in that the machines supplied by the respondent did not accord with the bargain.
 Disputes having arisen between the parties as to which of the two arbitration clauses of the agreements was applicable, the High Court held that the arbitration clause in an Annexure C was the one binding on the parties.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) 'Me arbitration clause that governs the sales of the two items of machinery in these proceedings is cl. 8 of Annexure B1 and B2. Annexures B1 and B2 are self-contained and constitute a separate contract-set and they exclusively relate to the terms of purchase of EK 25 and EK 13A.
 Annexure C is futuristic and relates to sales 'agency' and later purchase. [174 D] (2)The reference by the High Court to the principle that the last deed must govern the relationship between the parties superseding the earlier ones, when there is inconsistency between the two has no room for play here.
 [175 D-E] (3)Clause 1 of Annexure A grants a right of exclusive representation to the appellant "to act as its sole agent" in certain specified territories. Clause 2 states that "the detailed text of the agreement will be air-mailed until the 7th April, 1970". Clause 5 deals with the appellant agreeing immediately to place an order for machines. Two machines had been agreed to be sold and to give effect to this agreement referred to in cl. 5 to 8 of Annexure A, two orders, each independent, namely, Annexure B1 and B2, were executed on April 2, 1970. The terms and conditions of these two sales were printed on the back of the order, the first of which stated "this order shall be the sole repository of the transaction. . . . ". If the exclusive repository of the terms of the transaction was Annexures B1 and B2, purchase of the machinery EK 25 and EK 13A was covered by this complete deed and there was no justification for travelling beyond it to ascertain the intention of the parties. [172 A-B; H] 168 (4)The totality of the terms concerning the sale of the two machines had been documented in Annexure B1 and B2, such a concluded contract could cease to be operative ordinarily only by performance or novation or in any other manner known to the law of contract. [173 C] In the instant case, cl. 8 of Annexures B 1 and B2 is valid, unless Annexure C extinguished Annexures B1 and B2. [173 D] (5)The whole of cl. 1 of Annexure C devotes itself to the appointment of the appellant as sole buyers from the respondent. The terms "hereby" and "hereinafter" mentioned in that clause postulated that while the minutes (Annexure A) projected the proposal for appointing the appellant as exclusive agents it was only under Annexure C, the actual scheme was to come into force on acceptance, and not from any anterior date. Moreover, absence of "special introduction discount" in Annexure C in contrast to such a provision in Annexures B1 and B2 only showed that Annexure C did not deal with the two sales covered by Annexures B1 and B2. [173 F] Clause 12 of Annexure C stated that "this agreement is valid from after the 7th April, 1970". The two machines in dispute were agreed to be purchased on April 2, 1970 under Annexures B1 and B2 but Annexure C became operative. only in regard to transactions from after April 7, 1970. These terms cannot be given retroactive effect since cl. 13 expressly states that "this agreement enters into force when both parties have signed it." [174 A]
