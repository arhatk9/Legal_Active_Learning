 For an offence under s. 325 read with s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code the appellants were sentenced by the Sessions Judge to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months each, apart from fine. The High Court in exercise of powers under s. 423(1A) of the Code of Criminal Procedure enhanced the sentence to rigorous imprisonment for two years On the question whether this Court should, in the circumstances of the case, interfere with the order of the High Court enhancing the sentence, 
HELD : It could not be said that- the High Court was not justified in holding that in view of the severity of the injuries caused to one of the victims the sentence passed by the trial court was lenient. It would be wrong to interfere with the sentence passed by the High Court when it was not shown to be unjust or harsh. [317 E] Surta & Ors. v. State of Haryana, C.A.
