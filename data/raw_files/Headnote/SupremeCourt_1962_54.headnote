 The assessee had received in July 1946, a sum of Rs.
 40,000/- which according to him represented a receipt of a capital nature. This fact was brought to the notice of the Income Tax Officer during the proceedings for the assessment year 1946-47 and the Income Tax Officer made a note' that the question would be considered again at the time of 1947- 48 assessment. In the return filed for the assessment year 1947-48 this amount was not shown by the assessee and the Income Tax Officer also overlooked his previous note, with the result that this item was omitted. During the pendency of the appeal by the assessee before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner the Income Tax Officer wrote a letter to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner inter alia requesting him to assess the amount of Rs. 40,000/-. The amount was assessed and included in the original assessment.
 On reference, the High Court answered, that the Appellate Assistant Commissioner was not competent to enhance the assessment. The question is whether in an appeal filed by an assessee, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner can find a new source of income not considered by the Income-tax Officer and assess it under his powers granted by s. 31 of the Act and travel beyond the record in enhancing the assessment for any year.
 Held, that in view of the provisions of ss. 34 and 33B by which escaped income can be brought to tax, the power of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner is limited ; he has no power to travel beyond the record to enhance the assessment of any year by discovering new source of income not mentioned in the return of the assessee or considered by the Income Tax Officer in the order appealed from.
 Held, further, that provisions of ss. 33B and 34 enable escaped income from new sources to be brought to tax after following special procedure. Enhancement of assessment by the discovery of new Sources of income is not contemplated 172 under s, 3 1, because if fresh sources of income are assessed under that section, the assessee will be deprived of a finding by two tribunals, and one right to appeal. The powers of remand should be exercised in such cases.
