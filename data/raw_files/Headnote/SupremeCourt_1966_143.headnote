 The appellant (husband of the respondent) obtained a decree for restitution of conjugal rights against his wife. The wife made various attempts to persuade the appellant to take her back into the marital home, but was unsuccessful. She then applied to the Court which passed the decree for an order that the decree be recorded as satisfied. There was, at that time, no pending application by the appellant for execution of the decree or for a decree for divorce.
 On the question, whether the application of the respondent was maintiable either 0. 21, r. 2 or under s. 47 of the Civil Procedure Code, 
HELD : It was maintainable under s. 47 but not under O. 21 r. 2.
 Under s. 47, which deals with the power of the Court executing the decree all questions relating to execution, discharge or satisfaction of a decree and arising between the parties to the suit in which the decree is passed, shall be determined in the Aexecution proceeding and not by a separate suit. The expression "Oourt executing the decree" in the section does not mean a "court which is seized of an application for execution of a decree at the instance of the decree holder." A question relating to execution discharge or satisfaction of a decree may be raised by the decree- holder or by the judgment-debtor in the execution department and the pendency of -an application for execution by the decree-holder is not a condition for the exercise of the Court's power. An application made by the judgment debtor in relation to execution, discharge or satisfaction of a decree. in 'a suit to which he or the person of whom he is a represenitative was a party, is an application before the court executing the decree, and must be tried in that court.

 Order 21, r. 2 deals with the procedure to be followed in a limited class of cases relating to discharge or satisfaction of decrees where there has been payment of money or adjustment or satisfaction of the decree by consensual arrangement. It contemplates 'adjustment of the decree by consent-express or implieded the parties. Where there is no such consent the rule does not apply. In the instant case there was not evidence of any consent on the part of the appellant, who was never willing to take back his wife. [149 F-H; 150 B-C]
