 The second respondent filed an election petition for the declarations (1) that the election of the appellant to the State Legislative Assembly was void, and (2) that he himself was duly elected. While the petition was pending, the appellant was appointed as a Minister in the Central Cabinet and was elected as a member of the Rajya Sabha. He, thereupon resigned his seat in the State Legislative Assembly and filed a writ petition in the High Court for the issue of a writ of mandamus to the Election Commission of India on the ground that it was incumbent upon the Election Commission under s. 150 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, to take steps forthwith to hold a bye-electicon for filling up the vacancy so caused. The petition was dismissed.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : No case was made out by the appellant for the issue of a writ of mandamus to the Election Commission as the Election Commission is not bound under s. 150 to take steps to hold a bye-election immediately after a vacancy arises.
 When the second respondent's election petition was referred to the Tribunal it had to decide whether he should be declared to have been duly elected and, the appellant could not get rid of the petition by resigning his seat for whatever reason. In a case of this description it is open to the Election Commission to await the result of the elec- tion petition, for, if the second respondent eventually got a declaration that he himself had been duly elected, there would be two candidates representing the same constituency at the same time, one declared by the Tribunal to be duly elected at the General Election and the other declared to have been duly elected at the bye-election. Further, it is also conceivable that there may be situations in which the Election Commission may not hold a bye-election at all or may hold it after a delay of 2 or 3 months after the vacancy arises.
