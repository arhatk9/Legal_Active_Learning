 The Deputy Registrar Cooperative Societies, Meerut, by order dated 14 July, 1971 suspended the President and the Committee of management of Jabangirabad Cooperative Marketing Society Ltd., and further appointed an administrator to carry on the functions of the society. A writ petition was filed by Y and others in the High Court of Allahabad under Art. 226 of the Constitution challenging the aforesaid order of the Deputy Registrar. The petition was dismissed, whereupon an appeal was filed in this Court by special leave. V, who was the President of the Jahangirabad Cooperative Marketing Society also filed a writ petition in this Court challenging the Deputy Registrar's order dated 14 July, 1971. The questions that fell for consideration in the appeal and writ petition were : (1) whether the Deputy Registrar's order suspending the President and committee of management of the Society was valid; (ii) whether the Deputy Registrar could temporarily appoint an administrator.
 
HELD : (i) The provisions in s. 35(1) of the Cooperative Societies Act, 1965 indicate the circumstances under which the Registrar has power to supersede or suspend the committee of management and to appoint an administrator.
 Section 35(2) of the" Act confers power on the Registrar to suspend the committee of management during the period of proceedings for supersession. The Registrar has also power under section 35(2) of the Act to make arrangement as he thinks proper for the management of the society till the proceedings are completed. The power to suspend the committee of management during the period of proceedings is exercisable when proceedings for supersession have commenced. Section 35(1) of the Act shows that when the Registrar is of opinion that the committee of a Cooperative Society makes default or is negligent in the performance of duties or is otherwise not functioning properly the Registrar may supersede the committee of management and has to give an opportunity to the society to be heard in that behalf. The Registrar has also to obtain the opinion of the general body of the society. Therefore the opinion of the Registrar is to be followed by some definite act which will Commence the proceedings for supersession. The provisions in the Act indicate that some definite step like the issue of notice must be taken under the provisions of section 35(1) of the Act with a view to show that proceedings for supersession of the committee are set in motion. [422A-F] It is therefore manifest that power exercisable under s.
 35(2) of the Act is confined to the time during the period of suspension proceedings. Unless the proceedings have started as indicated earlier the Registrar cannot call in aid the power exercisable under s. 35(2) of the Act. [422E- F] 419 (ii) As no proceedings had been set in motion in accordance with the provisions of' the statute, the interim suspension of the committee of management was bad. As appointment of administrator during the interim period is not ruled out of the provisions of s. 35(2) of the Act, but the prerequisite condition to the appointment of the interim administrator had not been fulfilled in the present case, because no proceeding for the supersession of the committee of management of the society had commenced. [422G-H; 423A-B] (iii) The administrator appointed by the Registrar withdrew the delegation of the petitioner appellant V to the Uttar Pradesh Provincial Cooperative Federation. Since the appoi ntment of the administrator was bad the withdrawal of the delegation of V by the administrator was also bad.
 [423C-D] Accordingly the writ petition and the appeal must be allowed and the order of the Deputy Registrar dated 14 July, 1971 must be quashed.[423D]
