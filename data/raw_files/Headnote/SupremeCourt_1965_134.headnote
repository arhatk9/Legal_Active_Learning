 The appellant, the owner of certain premises in Calcutta, leased them out and the respondent was inducted as a sub- tenant by the tenant in June 1954. In July. 1954, the appellant issued notice to the tenant determining the tenancy from the end of August 1954. In September 1954, the appellant filed a suit for ejectment of the tenant. While the suit was pending, the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1956, came into force on 31st March 1956. The respondent filed a petition under s. 16(3) of the Act, praying that the Controller may declare that the interest of the tenant had ceased, that the respondent had become a direct tenant under the appellant and for fixation of the rent. On 9th August 1956, the Controller made an order declaring the respondent as a direct tenant and adjourned the proceedings for evidence regarding the rent payable. On 22nd August 1956, the ejectment suit was decreed and so, the appellant applied to the Controller praying that the respondent's petition under s. 16(3) may be dismissed. The Controller dismissed the respondent's application on the day fixed for determining the rent. The respondent's appeal to the Court of Small Causes was allowed. The appellant then filed a petition under Art. 227 of the Constitution to the High Court, and it was dismissed except as to fixation of rent.
 In his appeal to this Court, the appellant contended that :
 (i) the order of 9th August 1956 was not a final order and therefore the Controller could rescind it, and (ii) the respondent was no, entitled to invoke s. 16(3), because the tenant had been ejected on 22nd August 1956.
 
HELD : (i) The High Court was right in holding that the Controller had no power to set aside the order that had been made on 9th August 1956, for it was right when it was made.
 [242 C-D] The word "tenant" is defined in s. 2(h) of the Act to include any person continuing in possession after the termination of his tenancy, but shall not include any person against whom any decree or order for eviction had been made by a court of competent jurisdiction. There is nothing repugnant in the subject or context of s. 16(3) to take the view that the definition of "tenant" in s. 2(h) would not apply to a case under s. 16(3). Therefore, the tenant continued to be a tenant up to 22nd August 1956, and the respondent, who became a sub-tenant in June 1954, continued :to be sub-tenant after the coming into force of the Act.
 [240 E-G] Under the first part of s. 16(3), the Controller has to declare by order that the tenant's interest in the premises sub-let has ceased and that the sub-tenant has become a direct tenant under the landlord; and under the second part, the Controller has to fix the rents payable to the landlord, by the tenant and the sub-tenant. [240 1-1-241 B] In the instant case after having made such a declaration under the first part of the section, in favour of the respondent, it was not open sup./65-16 236 to the Controller (while proceeding to fix rent under the second part) to rescind the order which had become final so far as the Controller was concerned, on some ground which supervened after the date of the order nor can the Controller's latter order be justified under s. 29(5) of the Act, which gives the Controller the powers under ss. 151 and 152 and the power of review under O. 47, of the Civil Procedure Code. [241 G-H; 242 B-C] (ii)There is nothing in the contention of the appellant that s. 16(3) would not apply to the respondent. [242 E] In the present case, the benefit of the section was given to the respondent not after 22nd August 1956, when the tenant was evicted, but before that date, that is, on 9th August 1956. That order so far as it went was final and was not open to review or cancellation by the Controller who had thereafter only to fix the rent under the second part of the section. [242 E-F]
