 Messrs Toyo Engineering Corporation, a company registered in Japan, undertook to render technical services in respect of Iraqi Storage Terminal Project Installations and engaged Toyo Engineering India Ltd., an Indian Company, for work connected with the project. Toyo Engineering India Ltd., in turn, entered into two agreements with the appellant-company to perform certain construction and related services of the project work.
 The appellant sought approval of the said agreements from the respondent--the Central Board of Direct Taxes-- under section 80-0 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 which provided for deduction from total income in respect of royalties etc. received from the Government of a foreign State or a foreign enterprise. The respondent refused to approve the said agreements on the ground that there was no privity of contract between the appellant-company and the foreign enterprise and the contract price was received by the appellant from Toyo Engineering India LTD. which was an Indian Company and could not be regarded a foreign enterprise within the meaning of section 80-0.
 The appellant filed a Writ petition before the Bombay High Court challenging the order refusing approval. The learned Single Judge dismissed the petition on the ground PG NO 1058 PG NO 1059 inter alia that the payment was not received by the appellant-company from the Government of a foreign State or a foreign enterprise. On appeal, the Division Bench held that (i) in order to attract the provision of section 80-0, the payment must be received by the Indian company from the Government of a foreign State or a foreign enterprise, (ii) the expression 'foreign enterprise' must have the colour from the words "Government of a foreign State" and must be read to mean an enterprise of a foreign national or a foreign ownership which would not include a branch of unit of an Indian Company in a foreign country.
 In this Court, it was contended by the appellant that (i) the concept of ownership for the purpose of deciding whether an enterprise was a foreign enterprise or not should not be introduced in section 80-0 and if any enterprise satisfied the test of location it should be held to be a foreign enterprise within the meaning of section 80-0; (ii) in any event, it was possible to define the expression "foreign enterprise" as an enterprise located outside India, and when two interpretations were possible the interpretation which was favourable to the assessee should be adopted; (iii) as the provision of section 80-0 was an exemption provision, it should be construed liberally and, upon such liberal construction, it should be held that Toyo India was a foreign enterprise; (iv) the appellant-company having fulfilled the objectives of sectio 80-0, it should be held that the requirement of the section was satisfied and consequently the appellant-company was entitled to deduction to Income lax: and (v) section 80-0 should be construed as permitting canalisation.
 On the other hand, the revenue contended that the plain meaning of the words "foreign enterprise" was an enterprise having a foreign nationality, and if an Indian company opened an enterprise in a foreign country but did not get the enterprise registered under the law of that country, it would remain an Indian enterprise and not become a foreign enterprise.
 Dismissing the appeal, it was 
 HELD: (I) It appears from the legislative background that in 1971 the expression "foreign company" occurring in section 80-0 was changed into "Government of a foreign State or a foreign enterprise . There can be no doubt that the expression "foreign enterprise'' is a wider term than "foreign company" and will include within it also a foreign company. [l066F-G] PG NO 1060 (2) The interpretation of a term should be such as to be consistent with the things or objects that are included within it. In other words, the meaning of the expression cannot be different for different objects included in the expression. L1067B] (3) If an Indian company having a branch, unit or establishment in a foreign country cannot be regarded a foreign company, then, for the same reason, a branch, unit or establishment of an Indian company situated in a foreign country or doing business in such foreign country cannot be included within the meaning of the expression "foreign enterprise". [1067C] (4) The test of location is one of the tests for deciding whether an enterprise is a foreign enterprise or not within the meaning of section 80-O. But that is not the only test.
 Ownership is also a creterion for deciding whether all enterprise is a foreign enterprise or not. But, again that is not the sole test. [1067D] (5) A "foreign enterprise" is an enterprise situated in a foreign country having been created or registered in accordance with the law of such country. I his view finds support from the setting in which the expression has been placed and the circumstances in which the law came to be passed. [1067G; 1068B] R.L. Arora v. State of Uttar Pradesh, [1964] INSC 34; [1964] 6 SCR 784, referred to.
 (6) The expression "foreign enterprise. admits of only one interpretation. To interpret it as an enterprise located outside India not be full and complete and will render the meaning of the expression inconsistent with the objects included within it, having regard to the change effected by the legislature.

Kulu Valley Transport Co. P.Ltd ., [1970] 77 ITR 518, distinguished.
 (7) It is true that an exemption provision should be liberally construed, but this does not mean that such liberal construction should be made doing violence to the plain meaning of such exemption provision. Liberal construction will he made whenever it is possible to be made without impairing the legislative requirement and the spirit of the provision. [1068H; 1069A] PG NO 1061 (8) Not only the objectives of a provision of a statute have to be fulfilled, but also the condition for the applicability of the provision have also to be fulfilled. In the instant case, the appellant failed to fulfil the two material conditions in so far as the income was received by it not from a foreign enterprise but from an Indian company, and the agreements entered into by it were with an Indian company and not with a foreign enterprise.

 Central Board of Direct Taxes, [1987] l65 ITR 537, referred to.
 (9) The High Court was not right in holding that section 80-O did not require that the agreement should be made with the Government of a foreign State of a foreign enterprise.
 Section 80-O refers to there-parties, namely,Government of a foreign State, foreign enterprise and the assessee. It is clear from the section that the agreement must be between the assessee on the one hand and the Government of a foreign State or a foreign enterprise on the other. [1071E-G,] (10) Whether canalisation should he permitted or not.
 is absolutely a matter for the legislature. It is not incumbent on the legislature to provide for canalisation although it has been conceded by the respondent's counsel that canalisation is desirable. In view of the plain language of the section ,it is not possible to construe the section as providing canalisation. That is not the intention of the Legislature.
