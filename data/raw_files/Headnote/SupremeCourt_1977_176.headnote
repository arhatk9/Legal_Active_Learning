 In terms of the compromise petition filed in the HighCourt in an earlierejectment suit, it was agreed by the predecessors-in-title ofthe respondent that the appellant would become "a direct tenant under the first respondent's husband and his brother who were then the owners of the property at a monthly rent of Rs. 1000/- and that the lease would be for a period of 16 years from May 19, 1954 with option to the, appellant to terminate the lease earlier on giving 60 days' notice on the lessors." No deed of lease was ever executed nor the petition of compromise containing the terms of settlement was registered and the appellant's possession from May 19, 1954 was on the basis of the compromise. Respondent No. 1 after the expiry of the said period of lease served a notice on the appellant to quit and vacate the premises and thereafter filed a title suit No. 59 of 1970 on May 22, 1970 in the Third Court of the Subordinate Judge at Alipore for recovery of possession and mesne profits. The defence of the appellant was that by payment and acceptance of rent a monthly tenancy has been created in their favour which was continuing even after the expiry of the said period. The trial court found that to be effective as a lease for 16 years the petition of compromise required registration and this not having been done it could not create any interest in favour of the appellant in the premises though they were entitled to protect their pos- session for a period of 16 years under s. 53A of the Transfer of Property Act. It also held that payment and acceptance of rent made in terms. of the unregistered, compromise petition did not give rise to a right of tenancy and on the expiry of the said period, they had no- protection against eviction and thus decreed the suit. Both the first appellate court and the High Court in second appeal affirmed the findings of the trial court.
 Dismissing the appeal by special leave, the Court, 
HELD : (1) Section 53A confers no active title on the transferee in possession. It only imposes statutory bar on the transferor. A person who is let into possession on the strength of a void lease does not acquire any interest in the property but gets under s. 53A only a right to defend his possession. In the instant case under the petition of compromise the appellant had to pay a monthly sum of Rs.
 1000/- as rent during the period of intended lease which the appellant did. These monthly payments brought the appellant under the coverage of section 53A but from this fact alone that the appellant had performed his part of the contract it is not possible to conclude that a tenancy was brought into existence. Acceptance of the payments tendered as rent is not decisive of a tenancy. [520 A-C] Probodh Kumar Das and Ors. v. Danymara Tea Co. Ltd. and Ors.
 66 I.A. 293 and State of Punjab v. British India Corporation Ltd. [1963] INSC 39; [1964] (2) SCR 114(123), referred. to.
 (2) Whether the relationship of landlord and tenant exists between the parties depends on whether the parties intended to create a tenancy and the intention has to be gathered from the facts and circumstances of the case. It is possible to find on the facts of a given case that payment made by a trans- 517 feree in possession were really not in terms of the contract but independent of it and this might justify an inference of tenancy in his favour. In the instant case the payment of a monthly sum as rent by the appellant to the plaintiff- respondent who accepted the same did not create any tenancy.
 The question is ultimately one of fact: [520 E-F] Ram Kumar Das v. Jagadish Chandra Deb & Anr. [1951] INSC 53; [1952] SCR 269, held not applicable.
 (3) Part performance in this country does not give rise to an equity as in England but to a statutory right which is comparatively a restricted right in that it is available only as a defence. Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act is only a partial importation in the statute law of India of the English doctrine of part performance. [519 H, 520 A] Sheth Maneklal Mansukhbhai v. M/s. Hormusji Jamshedii Ginwalla and sons. [1950] INSC 6; [1950] SCR 75, reiterated.
 (4) The petition of compromise seeking to create a lease for 16 years was required to be registered and not being registered it did not affect the immovable property to which it relates and could not be received as evidence of any ,transaction affecting the, property though it was admissible as evidence of- part performance of a contract for the purpose of s. 53A of the Transfer of Property Act or as evidence of any collateral transaction not required to be effected by registered instrument.
