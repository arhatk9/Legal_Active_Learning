 The respondent was a workman in the appellant company. On the ground of over-staying his leave for more than eight days the company, relying on the relevant provision in the Standing Orders, treated his services as having teen automatically terminated. The workman made an application under s. 33A of the Industrial Disputes Act before the Labour Court. The respondent's version that he had asked for extension of leave on medical grounds and had sent an application through another workman was believed by the Labour Court. That court therefore held that there was no automatic termination of the respondent's services and that he was entitled to make an application under s. 33A. The company appealed to this Court under Art. 136 of the Constitution.
 
HELD:(i) Ordinarily this Court is slow to interfere with findings of fact recorded by quasi-judicial Tribunals in an appeal under Art. 136 of the Constitution. But this Court does so if it is shown, ex facie, that the finding recorded is perverse. In the present case the respondent had been totally unable by evidence produced by him to establish that his absence beyond the period of leave origi- nally granted was due to continued illness and therefore the finding of the Labour Court in his favour in this respect was perverse. [56D-E; 57C] (ii) Standing Order (i) in Section G on which the appellant company relied in inartistically worded, but when the standing order provides that a workman will lose his lien on his appointment in case he does not join his duty within eight days of the expiry of his leave, it obviously means that his services are automatically terminated on the happening of the contingency. [57G] Where a workman's service terminates automatically under the standing order s. 33 would not apply and so an application under s. 33A would not be maintainable, as there is no question in such a case of the contravention of s. 33 of the Act.
