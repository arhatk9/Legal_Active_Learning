 The petitioner was convicted and sentenced to death by the Sessions Judge on 6. 2. 1982 . The High Court confirmed the sentence of death on 29130. 4.1982. An appeal preferred by the petitioner to this Court under Art. 136 of the Constitution was dismissed on 20. 4. 1983. The petition for review was dismissed on 12, 8. 1983. A petition for clemency was also rejected by the President of India. The petitioner filed the present writ petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution praying that in view of his tender age, his reformation in jail and the long lapse of time since the passing of the sentence of death on him the execution of the sentence of death may be stopped and the sentence may be commuted to one of imprisonment for life. On being asked by this Court, the Superintendent of the jail where the petitioner had been kept reported that so far nothing adverse to the petitioner had came to the notice of the authority.

 HELD; In T. V. Vatheeswaran v. State of Tamil Nadu, a Division Bench of this Court consisting of one of us and R.B. Misra, J. held that making all reasonable allowance for the time necessary for appeal and consideration of reprieve, delay exceeding two years in the execution of a sentence of death should be considered sufficient to entitle the person under sentence of death to invoke Art. 21 of the Constitution and demand the quashing of the sentence of death. Shortly thereafter in Sher Singh v. Stat of Punjab, another Division Bench of three learned Judges of this Court presided over by Chandrachud, C.J while expressing almost complete agreement with most of what had been said in Vatheeswaran's case dissented from the opinion expressed therein that a delay of two years and more was sufficient to entitle a person under sentence of death to invoke Art 21.
 Of the Constitution. The reason was, they said "The fixation of time limit of two years does not seem to us to accord with the 9 common experience of the time normally consumed by the litigative process and the proceedings before the executive". They also said that besides delay there were also other factors to be taken into account while considering the question whether the sentence of death should be vacated. Referred Trials and Confirmations Cases are dealt with speedily by High Courts and are never kept pending longer than two or three months. It is only when they reach this Court that the delay occurs. But surely, our inability to devise a procedure to deal expeditiously with such matters of life and death can be no justification for silencing what the learned Chief Justice has himself so eloquently described as 'the voice of justice and fairplay' which demands that 'so long as life lasts, so long shall it be the duty and endeavour of this Court to give to the provisions of our Constitution a meaning which will prevent human suffering and degradation.

 Whether a Division Bench of three Judges can purport to overrule the judgment of a Division Bench of two Judges merely because three is larger than two. The Court sits in Divisions of two and three Judges for the sake of convenience and it may be in-appropriate for a Division Bench of three Judges to purport to overrule the decision of a Division Bench of two Judges. Vide Young v. Bristol Aeroplane Co. Ltd. It may be otherwise where a Full Bench or a Constitution Bench does so. [17G-H; 18A] Young v. Bristol Aeroplane Co. Ltd., 1944 (2) All ER.

 In the instant case, an over all view of all the circumstances appears to us to entitle the petitioner to invoke the protection of Art. 21 of the Constitution. We accordingly quash the sentence of death and substitute in its place the sentence of imprisonment for life. [l8B]
