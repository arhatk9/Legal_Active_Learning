 The appellants-lessors are the sole and absolute owners of the demised premises-a cinema theatre. By a registered composite lease, they leased the land, buildings and the cinematographic equipment in it to the first respondent for a period of three years from 19th August, 1969 subject, inter alia, to recovery of possession on termination of the lease. It was the admitted case of both parties that the lease expired on 18th August, 1972, and that the case was not governed by the Madras Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act, 1960, to entitle the tenant to claim statutory protection from eviction under the Act. The appellants issued a notice dated 15th May. 1972, to the first respondent to deliver back, possession on the. expiry of the lease. On 17th June, 1972, the first respondent made an application to the licensing authority under the Madras Cinemas (Regulation) Act, 1955 (briefly, the Act) to renew the licence for resuming Cinema Theatre. The only documentary evidence produced by the respondent in regard to his possession was the expired lease. On 12th July, 1972, the appellants also made an application to grant the licence in their favour. In August. 1972. the licensing authority.
 by a common order in both the applications, renewed the licence of the respondent and rejected the application of the appellants. On 14th August, 1972, the appellants preferred as appeal to the Board of Revenue. The Board held that the respondent was not session of the leased property and set aside the order of the 16th September, 1972. The first respondent then filed on 18th September, 1972 a writ petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution. The learned single Judge of the High Court, while interpreting Rule 13 of the Madras Cinemas (Regulations) Rules, 1957 (briefly, the Rules), affirmed the finding of the Board and dismissed the writ petition 'on 8th February, 1973. The respondent thereupon preferred a Letters Patent Appeal. The Division Bench of the High Court, however, relying upon adecision- of this Court in Lalu Yeshwant Singh v. Rao Jagdish Singh and Others (infra). held that the, respondent's possession after the expiry of the lease was lawful possession within the meaning of Rule 13 and allowed the appeal on 4th July, 1973. On appeal by special leave to this Court, the appellants raised the following contentions: (i) the High Court erred in its interpretation of Rule 13 and in holding that the respondents are in lawful possession of the leased properties after expiry of the lease; and (ii) that at any rate the High Court could not interfere with the order of the Board under Art. 226 of the Constitution on the principles laid down by this Court in such matters. The respondents, on the other hand, made the following submissions: (i) that the lessor is not a person aggrieved under section 5(7) of the Act and is, therefore, not competent to appeal to the Board under that section; (ii) that Rule 13 does not apply to a case of renewal of licence;
 (iii) that "lawful possession" in Rule 13 means only juridical possession i.e. protected by law such as section 9 (old) and section 6 (new) of the Specific Relief Act and, therefore, the High Court rightly held that the respondents were in lawful possession of the property after the expiry of the lease and as such entitled to renewal-of the, licence. and (iv) that the High Court under Art. 226 has jurisdiction to quash an order of the Board if there a manifest error of law in the interpretation of r. 13.
 144 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD: (1) The appellants were themselves applicants before the competent authority for grant of a licence under the Act and the respondents sought renewal of the same licence. Therefore, the appellants are aggrieved by the order granting renewal to the respondent and refusing the appellant's prayer for the licence. [148G] (2) Rule 13 is clearly applicable to grant as well as to renewal of a licence. The rule finds place in Part 1-A of the Rules with the title "General". Under section 5(2) (a) of the Act, the licensing authority shall not grant a licence unless it is satisfied that the Rules under the Act have been substantially complied with. Therefore, there is no justification for making any distinction between :rant and renewal of a licence under the provisions of the Act read with the Rules. [153E] (3) Lawful possession is not litigious possession. It must have some foundation in a legal right to possess the property which cannot be equated with a temporary right to enforce recovery of the property which is wrongfully or forcibly dispossessed from it. Juridical possession is possession protected by law against wrongful dispossession but cannot per se always be equated with lawful possession.
 Rule 13 has got two parts. The first part deals with an applicant for the licence who is the owner of the site, building and equipment and the second part deals with an applicant who is not such an owner. On the admitted case of the parties. it is the second part of R. 13 that is material in the present case. Under the second part of the rule, the only requirement of the law is to produce to the satisfaction of the authority documentary evidence with regard to the applicant's lawful possession of the property.
 The fact, that after the expiry of the lease the tenant will be able to continue in possession of the property by resisting a suit for eviction does not establish a case in law to answer the requirement of lawful possession of the property within the meaning of Rule 13. Lawful possession cannot be established without the concomitant existence of a lawful relationship between the landlord and the tenant.
 This relationship cannot be established against the consent of the landlord unless, in 'View of a special law, his consent becomes irrelevant.
 Juridical possession of a tenant after the expiry of the lease would not be a lawful possession within the meaning of Rule 13. All that section 6 of the Specific Relief Act provides is that a person, even if he is a landlord, cannot take the law into his own hands and forcibly evict a tenant after the expiry of the lease. This section has relevance only to the wrongful act of a person, if it be by the landlord, in forcibly recovering possession of the property without recourse to law. Section 6 frowns upon forcible dispossession without recourse to law but does not at the same time declare that the possession of the evicted person is lawful possession. The question of lawful possession does not enter the issue at that stage. All that the court is then required to consider is whether an evicted person has been wrongfully dispossessed and he has come to the court within six months of the dispossession. The various civil rights between the landlord and the tenant will have to be adjudicated upon finally in a regular civil suit if filed. In the context of Rule 13, a tenant on the expiry of the lease. cannot be said to continue in "lawful possession" of the property against the wishes of the landlord if such possession is not otherwise statutorily protected against even lawful eviction through court process. such as under the Rent Control Act.
 Law in general prescribes: and insists upon a specified conduct in human relationship and even otherwise, Within the limits of the law courts strive to take note of the moral fabric of the law. In the instant case under the terms of the lease, the property had to be handed Over to the lessor Besides, under section 108(9) of the Transfer of Property Act, 1892, on the determination of the lease, the lessee is bound to put the lessor in possession of the property, The landlord has- not assented to the lessee's continuance in possession of the property. the lessee will be liable to mesne profits which can again be recovered only 145 in terms of his wrongful possession. Under Section 5(1) of the Act., the licening authority in deciding whether to grant or refuse a licence has regard amongst other things to the interest of the public generally. Public interest is.
 therefore, also involved in granting or refusing a licence.
 That being the, position the expression "lawful possession" in Rule 13 assumes a peculiar significance of its own in the, context of the Provisions of the Act. Hence in any view of the matter. Possession of the respondents on the expiry of the lease is not lawful possession within the meaning of Rule 13. [152D-153D] Lalu Yashwant Singh v.
