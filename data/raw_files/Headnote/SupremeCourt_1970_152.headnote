 The assessee was required under s. 18A(1) of the Income-tax Act, 1922, to make advance payments of tax for assessment years 1960-61 and 1961-62. The assessee made his own estimates of the tax for the two years and paid the amounts.
 But then the assessee filed returns of income for the two years, the Income-tax Officer assessed the total income of' the assessee on January 21, 1963, at much higher figures for the two years, and held that the assessee furnished inaccurate and untrue estimates if tax and imposed penalties under s. 273 of the 1961-Act. The Tribunal held that the 'Penalties could not be imposed, because, (1) the default under s. 18A of the 1922-Act could not be treated as a default under the 1961 Act; and (2) s.297(2)(g) of the 1961- Act did not save the proceedings under s.18A of the 1922- Act.
 In a reference tothis Court, under s.257 of the 1961 Act, 
HELD : Section212 of the 1961 Act corresponds to s.18A(2) of the 1922-Act and s.273 of the 1961-Act, which empowers the levy of penalty corresponds to s. 18A(9) of the 1922-Act.
 According to s. 297(2) (g) of the 1961-Act, a proceeding for the imposition of a penalty in respect of an assessment for the year ending on 31st March 1962 or any earlier year, which is completed on or after 1`st April 1962, may be initiated, and the penalty may' be imposed under the new Act. The sub-section is applicable to the present case, since the assessment was completed after 1st April 1962.
 Therefore, penalty could be imposed under the 1961-Act, that is, under s. 273, which will apply mutatis mutandis to the proceedings. [770 H; 771 A-B; 722 B-C] M/s. Jain Bros. & Ors. v. Union of India. [1970] 3 S.C.R.
