 Twelve candidates filed nomination papers for election from a double member constituency for the State Assembly, one of the seats being reserved for the Schedule Castes. The thumb impressions of the proposer and seconder of a candidate were attested by a magistrate specified in this behalf by the Election Commission. But there had been a mistake of omission of the name of the magistrate in the communication sent by the Election Commission to the local authorities.
 The returning officer rejected the nomination paper on the ground that there was no proper attestation of the thumb impressions of the proposer and seconder. An election petition was filed to set aside the election on the ground that the nomination paper had been rejected improperly and that this had materially affected the result of the election. The Election Tribunal set aside the entire election:
 Held, (1) that the magistrate having in fact been specified by the Election Commission, the attestation by him was good attestation, and the rejection of the nomination paper was improper,(2)that in the case of an improper rejection of a nomination paper there was a presumption that the result of the election had -been materially affected, and (3) that the whole election, including that of the Schedule Caste candidate, was void.
