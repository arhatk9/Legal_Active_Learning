 The appellant filed a suit against the respondent claiming a declaration that, on a proper interpretation of one of the clauses of the contract between them, the appellant was entitled to an enhancement of 20% over the tendered rates.
 The plaint stated, that work had been done under the contract and that the value of the suit for purposes of jurisdiction was Rs. 65,000, but as it was a suit for a declaration only, court fees on that basis had been paid.
 The appellant also reserved the right to sue later for the amount found due. The respondent contested the suit on the ground that the suit was not maintainable in the form in which it was framed, and disputing the correctness of the interpretation of the clause suggested by the appellant stated that it was ever ready and willing and was still willing to pay the legitimate dues of the appellant. The issue regarding maintainability of the suit was not pressed by the respondent at the hearing; and the other issue regarding the interpretation of the clause of the contract having been decided by the trial court in favour of the appellant, the suit was decreed and leave was granted under 
0. 2, r. 2, Civil Procedure Code, 1908, to sue later for the amount due. On appeal the issue as to maintainability was resuscitated and the High Court decided it in the respondent's favour because of the proviso to s. 42 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877, and also held that the trial court was not right in granting leave under 0. 2, r. 2. The High Court rejected a petition for amending the plaint by including a prayer for a decree for Rs. 65,000 or such other amount as may be found due on proper account being taken then made by the appellant on the ground that the claim for money was time-barred long before the petition for amendment was made, and because there were no special circumstances justifying the grant of the amendment.
 
HELD : (Per Sarkar and Ramaswami,JJ.) (i) If there was any case where the respondent was not entitled to the benefit of the law of limitation, the instant case was that one. It was a case in which the claim for money was in substance in the plaint from the beginning though it had not formally been made and so the respondent could not legitimately claim that the amendment would prejudicially affect his right under the law of limitation, for really he had no such right. [801 A-C] A party is not allowed to set up a new case or a new cause of action by amendment, but it is well recognised that where the amendment does not constitute the addition of a new cause of action or raise a new case,, but amounts to no more than a different or additional approach to the facts already on the record, the amendment will be allowed even after the expiry of the statutory period of limitation. The expression "new cause of action" in this context means, a new claim made on a new basis constituted by new facts, and "new case" means a new set of ideas. [799 F-H; 800 B-D] The amendment was necessary for a decision of the real dispute between the parties which was : what were their rights under the contract; and that dispute was clearly involved in the plaint as originally framed.
 7 97 It was the contract which formed the cause of action on which the suit was based and the amendment sought to introduce a claim based on the same cause of action, that is, the same contract and introduced no new case or facts.
 Indeed, the facts on which the money claim sought to be added was based, were not in dispute, and the absence of details of work was not a legitimate ground for refusing the amendment. The respondent had notice of the amount of claim, was fully aware that the ultimate object of the appellant in filing the suit was to obtain payment of that amount, and had specifically expressed in the written statement, its willingness to pay the appellants legitimate dues.

 Charan Das v. Amin Khan, L.R. 47 I.A. 255, applied.
 Per Raghubar Dayal, J. (Dissenting) : An amendment which would enable a plaintiff to make a claim which has become time barred is as a rule to be refused and the Court would exercise its special power to allow such amendment only when there are special circumstances in the case. Such special circumstances can be said to exist only when the amended claim was at least intended to be made by the plaintiff who had given in the plaint all the necessary facts I,,) establish the claim but had, due to clumsy drafting, not been able to express himself clearly in the pliaint and to couch his relief in the proper legal form. Such circum- stances justify an amendment not really as a judicial concession to the plaintiff to save him from any possible loss but on the ground that the original claim in the plaint, though defectively stated, really amounted to the claim sought to be made by the amendment, so that, it does not in reality offend against the law of limitation but serves the interests of justice. [813 H; 814 A-C] The plaint gave none of the facts which were necessary for getting a decree for Rs. 65,000 or which might justify a decree for accounting To allow the amendment of the plaint would necessity lead to a further request for furnishing details about the work done and the defendant being afforded an opportunity to put in a further written In fact it would necessitate a de novo trial on the question as to the amount due to the plaintiff. When the plaintiff could not get the relief of the amended claim on the facts mentioned in the plaint as originally filed, the cause of action for a decreefor Rs.65,000 was different from the cause of action on which thesuitordeclaration was founded. It could not be said that the plaintiff intended to sue the defendant for the recovery of Rs. 65,000 but failed to express himself clearly in the plaint and that therefore he should be allowed to make the plaint precise and clear in that regard. The fact that he reserved his right to sue for the amount indicates that he did not intend to sue for the amount; and the fact that the trial court gave him leave to sue later does not justify the amendment, because leave can be given by the court under 0. 2, r. 2 only which the plaintiff omitted to sue for a certain relief arising out of the same cause of action. [814 G; 815 B-D, F, G-H-, 816 A-B] (ii) Per Raghubar Dayal, J : The High Court was not in error in allowing the respondent to raise the objection as to the maintainability of the suit on account of the appellant not asking for further relief. [806 C] It was incumbent on the trial court not to make a declaration unless further relief had beenprayed for even if the objection was not raised by the party. Further ,it could not be said that the objection was not raised by the respondentin the trial court merely because it did riot press the contention. [805 H; 806 A-B] 798
