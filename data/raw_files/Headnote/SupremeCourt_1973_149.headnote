 On the questions, (i) whether the Government could abolish a post ill 'the service, and (ii) whats the effect of such abolition on the rights of the holder of the post at the time of abolition.
 
HELD : (1) Every sovereign government has a right to abolish a post ill government service in the interest and necessity of internal Administration. The creation and abolition of a post is dictated by policy, exigencies and administrative necessity in the interest of general public, and the power is not related to the doctrine of pleasure. [520D-E] (2) The protection afforded by Art. 311 of the Constitution is limited to the imposition of the three major penalties, namely, dismissal, removal and reduction in rank. These words are technical words. Every termination of service cannot amount to dismissal or removal. It is only in cases where there is a stigma or a loss of benefit that the removal or dismissal would come under the Article. The expression "rank" in the Article has reference to a person's classification and not to his particular place in the same cadre in the hierarchy of the service to which he belongs.
 A reduction in rank would be a punishment if it carried penal consequences with it. [521G-522B] Parshotam Lai Dhingra v. Union of India, [1957] INSC 95; [1958] S.C.R. 828;
 Satish Chandra Anand v. The Union of India [1953] INSC 21; [1953] S.C.R. 655 and Shyam Lal v. State of U.P. and the Union of India, [1954] INSC 33; [1955] 1 S.C.R. 26, referred to.
 (3) Where a person has a substantive appointment to a permanent post he has a right to hold the post until, under the rules, he attains the age of superannuation or is compulsorily retired after having put in the prescribed number of years' service or the post is abolished; and his service cannot be terminated except by way of punishment for misconduct, negligence, inefficiency or any other dis- qualification found against him on enquiry after due notice to him. An appointment to a temporary post for a certain specified period gives the servant a right to hold the post for the entire period of his tenure, and his tenure cannot be put an end to during that period unless he is, by way of punishment, dismissed or removed from the service. [522E-G] Parshotam Lai Dhingra v. Union of India, [1957] INSC 95; [1958] S.C.R. 828 and Mori Ram Deka etc. v. General Manager, N.E.F. Railways, Maligaon, Pandu, etc. [1963] INSC 239; [1964] 5 S.C.R. 683, referred to.
 (4) But a post may be abolished in good faith. The abolition of the post may have the consequence of termination of service of a government servant. Such termination however is not dismissal or removal within the meaning of Art. 311 of the Constitution. The opportunity of showing cause against the proposed penalty of dismissal or removal does not therefore arise in the case of the aboli- tion of a post. The abolition is not a personal penalty against the government servant. It is an executive policy decision. Whether after abolition of the post the government servant, who was holding the post would or could be offered any employment under the State. would therefore be a matter of policy decision of the. Government, because.
 the abolition of a post does not confer on the person holding the abolished post any right to hold the post. The order abolishing the post may however lose its effective character if it is established to have been made arbitrarily, mala fide or as a mask of some penal action within the meaning of Article 311(2). [522H; 526D-F] 516 (5) The observations in Moti Ram Dek 'a case ([1964] 5 S.C.R. 683), that a person who substantively holds a permanent post has a right to continue in service, subject to the rules of superannuation and compulsory retirement and that 'if for any other reason that right is invaded and he is asked to leave his service, the termination of his service must inevitably mean the defeat of his right to continue in service and as such it, is in the nature of a penalty and amounts to removal' are not authority for the, proposition that abolition of a post in good faith amounts to removal. The earlier observation in the judgment that a permanent servant would normally acquire a right to hold the post until under the rules he attained the age of superannuation or was compulsorily retired or the post was abolished shows that the exception of termination as a result of the abolition of a post was not being considered when the observation was made. [523A-D] Champaklal Chimanlal Shah v. The Union of. India [1964] 5 S.C.R. 190, followed.
 (6) The Moti Ram Deka case has not abolished the doctrine of pleasure as embodied in Article 310. That article has been made subject to Art. 311 where termination is by way of punishment, and in cases where a fixed term contract is made. Article 310(2) authorises 'a provision in such- contract for the payment of compensation to the government servant if before expiry of that period the post is abolished or he is required to vacate the post for reasons not connected with any misconduct. The article furnishes intrinsic evidence that the right to abolish the post is a category of the power exercisable by the Slate. The power to abolish the post is however inherent in every sovereign Government and is necessary for the proper functioning and internal administration of the State and is unaffected by these limitations on the doctrine of pleasure embodied in Art. 310. [525G-526D] (7) No estoppel could arise against the State in regard to abolition of a post. The courts exclude the operation of the doctrine of estoppel, when it is found that the authority against whom estoppel is pleaded has owed a duty to the public. [526H] (8) When the exigencies of administration required alterations in the establishment and creation of a new department, it is a governmental function' and a policy decision, and no question of mala fides arises. [527C-D] (9) The right to hold a post comes to an end on the abolition of the post which a government servant holds, and therefore, he cannot complain of a violation of Arts.
 19(1)(f) and 31 of the Constitution when the post is abolished. [527D-E] (10) Article 14 also is not attracted when the government servant cannot complain of any discrimination on the ground that other government servants, similarly situated had been allowed to remain in service. [527E. F-G]
