 The appellant filed a complaint against her husband the respondent, stating that he took a second wife during the subsistence of the appellant's marriage and that the respondent was therefore guilty of an offence 'under s. 494 I.P.C. The trial court convicted the respondent. In appeal, the Sessions Court found, that in relation to the second marriage, there was no evidence of the performance of Homo and Saptapadi, which were essential rites to be performed for solemn-isation of a marriage according to the law prevailing among the parties; and the respondent was acquitted. In the High Court, in order to prove the second marriage, the appellant sought to rely upon a statement made by the respondent in answer to an earlier complaint under s.
 494 I.P.C., filed by-the appellant, wherein the respondent had admitted that he had married a second wife because of the misconduct of the appellant. The High Court, however, held that the statement could not be relied upon for proving that the essential ceremonies had been performed and confirmed the,acquittal of the respondent.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD (1) The prosecution has. to prove that the alleged second marriage, was a valid marriage, duly performed in accordance with the essential religious rites applicable according to the law and custom of the parties. [967 E] (2) The statement in the earlier proceedings in relation to the complaint under s. 494 I.P.C., could not be relied upon because : (although strictly it was not a confession never theless, if acted upon it would tend to incriminate the respondent (who was in the position of an accused) and therefore he was entitled to be given an opportunity of offering his explanation, if any, in respect of such incriminating statement; (b) such opportunity was not given to the respondent and it was not put to him when he was examined under s. 342 Cr.P.C. and (c) such an admission cannot in law be treated as evidence of the 'second marriage having taken place in a bigamy case. [969 D-H] (3) In the present case, both the Sessions Judge and the High Court have found that there was no evidence that Homo and Saptapadi, which are essential rites for a marriage according to law governing the parties, had been performed when the respondent is said to have married a second wife, and hence the respondent was not guilty.
