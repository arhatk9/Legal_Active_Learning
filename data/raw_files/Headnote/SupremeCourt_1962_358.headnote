 The two appellants along with another were carrying on business in Electrical goods under the firm name Precious Electric Co. In 1938 this firm entered into an agreement with M/s. Phillips Electric Co. (India) Ltd. The material terms of the agreement were the following. The firm was to have an exclusive territory for sale of Phillips bulbs and undertook to sell only Phillips bulbs in the territory. The agreement allowed the firm compensation if Phillips bulbs were sold in the territory by the company. The agreement was terminable by a three months notice on either side.
 There was no stipulation in the agreement as to the quantity or quality of bulbs to be bought by the firm, neither was it agreed that the firm was to act as an agent of the company.
 The agreement continued for 16 years. In 1954 negotiations for a fresh agreement were conducted but they were not successful. Since the company was taking over the business of selling the bulbs in the territory a working scheme for the transition period following the termination of the agreement was reached. The most material term of the scheme was that the company would pay Rs. 40,000/per annum as a gesture of goodwill in quarterly instalments to each of the partners during a period of three years from the date of the expiry of the existing agreement. In the assessment year each of the partners received two quarterly payments of Rs.
 10,000/- each. This amount was taxed by the Income Tax Officer in respect of the two appellants under s. 10 (5A) of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922. The appellants appealed without success to. the Assistant Commissioner. Thereupon 950 they appealed to the Tribunal contending that the amount assessed was compensation paid for the termination of the agreement or it was an ex gratia payment. It was further contended that the payment made to the individual partners did not constitute a receipt of the firm's business.
 Alternatively it was argued that the said receipt was not liable to be included in the total income of the receipients by reason, of s. 4 (3) (VI I) of the Income Tax Act. The Tribunal did not accept any of these contentions but it referred three questions for the decision of the High Court.
 These questions were whether the receipt in question was a taxable receipt, if so whether it was liable to be not 'included in the total income under s. 4 (3) (VII) and whether the said receipt fell within s, 10 (5A) (d). The High Court answered that the receipt was a taxable receipt and s. 4(3)VII did not exempt it from liability. The third question was left unanswered. The present appeal has arisen byway of a certificate granted by the High Court.
 The contentions were that the agreement was not a trading agreement; it constituted an asset on the termination of which compensation was paid to make up for the loss of this capital asset; in the alternative that even if it was not compensation for loss of capital it was an ad hoc ex gratia payment in the nature of `solatium' as described by the Privy Council in Income-tax Commissioner v. Shaw Wallace & Co. (1932) L. R. 59 1. A. 206. For the respondent it was contended that since there was no premature termination of the agreement even if it is treated as capital, it has exhausted itself and therefore must be treated as revenue from other sources' under s. 12 of the Act.
 Held, that in determining whether a payment amounts to a return for loss of a capital asset or is income, profit or gain liable to income-tax, one must have regard to the nature and quality of the payment. If the payment was not received to compensate for loss of profits of business the receipt cannot properly be described as income, profit or gains. The size of the amount paid or the periodicity of the payments have no decisive bearing on the matter.

Jairam Yalji, [1959] 36 I.T.R. 148 and Senainam Doongar Mal v. Commissioner of Income-tax, [ 1 961] 42 I.T.R. 392, referred to.
 The payment cannot be connected with estimated loss of profits since, the terms of the agreement show that the firm 951 was not entitled to be compensated for temporary suspension of the benefits or a complete termination of those benefits.
 Glenboig Union Fireclay Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue, (1922) T.C. 472, referred to.
 In the absence of any proof that the amount paid was the likely profit it is difficult to say that the payment replaced those profits.
 The agreement in the present case was not an agreement for the purchase of bulbs. It mentioned no quantity or quality or price. It only secured to the firm a right to exclusive purchase of bulbs for sale in an exclusive territory. The agreement can only be described as an agreement which constituted a source and a monopoly and which gave an enduring advantage to a trader in his trade. The loss of such an agreement must be regarded as falling on the capital side and not in the course of his ordinary trading. If the agreement had been breached prematurely the damages would not have been calculated on the basis of outstanding contracts only but on the basis of an a vantage lost.

 Even if the payment cannot be considered as a payment for loss of capital it cannot be regarded as payment for any services rendered or likely to be rendered. It was an ad hoc payment out of gratitude and in appreciation of the personal qualities of the assessees.
 Chibbett v. Joseph Robinson & Sons, (1924) 9 T.C. 49, referred to.
 The receipt not being income profit or gain s. 4 (3) (VII) had no application.
