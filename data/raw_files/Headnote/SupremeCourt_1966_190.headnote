 For the assessment year 1951-52, the appellant did not file a return of his income under s. 22 of the Income-tax Act, 1922 but the Incometax Officer assessed the income at a certain figure. When examining the material for the assessment year 1955-56, it was discovered that the assessee made large investments and suppressed items of house property acquired by him. The Income-tax Officer, therefore, issued a notice under s. 34(1) and after examining the return assessed the income for the assessment year 1951-52 at a much higher figure. In the reference to the High Court, the appellant questioned the jurisdiction of the Officer to initiate proceedings under s. 34(1), but the High Court held against him.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (i) The Income-tax Officer had reasonable grounds for thinking that there was non-disclosure of material facts on the part of the appellant and that there was under- assessment for the assessment year 1951-52, caused by the assessee's failure to submit his return. [593 C] Two conditions must be satisfied in order to confer jurisdiction on the Income-tax Officer to issue notice under s. 34, namely, (i) the Officer must have reason to believe that the income, profits or gains chargeable to income-tax had been under-assessed; (ii) he must have reason to believe that such under-assessment had occurred by reason of the omission or failure on the part of No assessee to make a return or disclose fully all material facts necessary for assessment. The existence of the belief, and whether the reasons for -the belief have a rational connection with or relevant bearing on, the formation of the belief, are open to examination by the court. But if there are in fact some reasonable grounds for the Officer to believe that there had been a non-disclosure as regards any fact, which could have a material bearing on the question of under-assessment, that would be sufficient to give him jurisdiction to issue the notice under s.34, and their sufficiency cannot be challenged by the assessee. [592 C-H] (ii) The scheme of s. 34 is that if the conditions of the main section are satisfied a notice has to be issued to the assessee. But before issuing the notice the proviso requires that the officer should -record his reasons and obtain the sanction of the -Commissioner for initiating action under the section. But there is no requirement in the Act that the reasons which induced the Commissioner to accord sanction should also be communicated to the assessee.
