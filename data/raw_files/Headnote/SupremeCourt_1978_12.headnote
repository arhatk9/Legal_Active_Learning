 The Petitioners' special leave petition was dismissed for want of surrender certificate as required under Rule 6 of Order XXI of the Supreme Court Rules, 1966. But in fact the petitioners did surrender but the Assistant Sessions Judge refused to take them into jail custody for want of receipt of judgment from the High Court.
 Allowing the petition for restoration of the special leave petition, the Court.
 Observed :- It is unfortunate that when High Courts deliver judgments confirming the conviction and sentence, there is a long delay in communicating the fact of affirmation of the sentence to the trial courts. A sentence should not be delayed at least after it is confirmed by the High Court but when this happens on account of the indifference of the administrative side of the High Court in the mechanical process of communication to the trial court it does not speak well of the management side of our court system. [602 H, 603 A] [The Court expressed its hope that more business-like procedures in such matters would be evolved so that the rule of law would not suffer a new shock on account of messy- management of judicial business-rectifiable by a little more promptitude and attention]
