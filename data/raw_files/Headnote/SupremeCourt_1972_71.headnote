 The appellant was the owner of 100% shares in Company 'A' By an agreement dated October 30, 1956, between the appellant and the respondent, the respondent purchased 49% of the shares with an option to purchase the balance of 51 % shares. The respondent exercised his option but as the shares were not transferred to him he filed a suit. The suit was decreed and the decree for specific performance provided that the 51 % shares should be delivered to the respondent against payment by him to the appellant of their value; and an injunction was also granted Restraining the appellant from voting except in accordance with the instructions of the respondent. Except as regards the injunction, the trail court, however, stayed execution of the decree and the stay was continued by the appellate court till the appeal was dismissed in 1965.
 The appellant filed an application in 1965 praying that the respondent may be directed to pay the consideration amount within such time as the Court may direct, but the application was dismissed.
 Meanwhile, there were certain orders of attachment of the decree, whose effect was that the respondent was prohibited and restrained from alienating, transferring or charging his right, title and interest in the decree or from obtaining satisfaction thereof. Further, in February 1965, a company 'B' which bad obtained a decree against a holding company of the appellant, applied for execution and got the 51% shares of the appellant attached. The executing court ordered that those shares should be produced for delivery to the respondent against payment of the consideration mentioned in the specific performance decree.
 The 'A' Company also instituted a suit against the appellant in respect of payment made by 'A' to the Income-tax authorities on behalf of the appellant and prayed for possession and sale of the 51% shares in the 691 exercise of their lien on those shares. A receiver was appointed in respect of those shares and the Court directed that the Receiver would be at liberty deliver the 51% shares to the respondent on payment of the consideration. This order was communicated by the appellant to the respondent on January, 11, 1967, and even before that date the appellant wrote two letters to the respondent asking him to be ready with the amount to be paid by him and to take delivery of the shares. Those letters were refused by the respondent and in reply to the letter dated, January 11, 1967, the respondent raised the objection that the appellant was not in a position to give delivery of the shares and that the order of the Court was not binding on him because he was not a party to the suit in which that order was passed. By a letter dated February 11, 1967, addressed to the respondent, the appellant stated that the respondent had forfeited his right to purchase the 51% shares under the specific performance decree as he had failed to fulfil his obligation in pursuance of the notice of the appellant dated January 11, 1967. Thereafter, in March 1967, the. appellant filed an application for rescission of the agreement of sale of 1956 as also the decree for specific performance of the agreement.
 The trial court held that the respondent was not keen on paying the purchase money and get the transfer of 51% shares for the reason that the injunction granted by the Court restraining the appellant from voting except under the instructions of the respondent made the respondent virtually the owner of the 100% shares in 'A' company, with full control, that therefore, the respondent had committed breach of the contract which he was directed specifically to perform, that he created a situation which had made it impossible for him to perform his part of the obligation, and hence the decree for specific performance must be rescinded. The trail court appointed the Receiver in the suit by the 'A' company against the appellant as Receiver of the 51% shares and directed the respondent to pay the consideration money to the Receiver within a fortnight from the date of the order and directed the Receiver to hand over the shares to the respondent; and that, in default of such payment within the time specified the contract and the decree would stand rescinded, and that the appellant would be absolved from all obligations thereunder.
 The appellate court however held that the application filed by the appellant for the rescission of the contract and decree was not maintain,able under the Specific Relief Act of 1877 or of 1963.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD: (1) The Specific Relief Act, 1877 was repealed by the Specific Relief Act of 1963 and the appellant had no accrued right on the date of the repeal to file the application under s. 35 of the 1877Act read with s. 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897. [700G-H] The right to rescind the decree under s. 35 can arise only if the purchaser makes default in paying the purchase money ordered to be paid under the decree. But before the lapse of reasonable time from the date of the decree the appellant could have no right to have the decree rescinded on the ground of default. Such a default had not occurred when the Specific Relief Act, 1877, was repealed as a reasonable time for the performance of the obligation under the decree had not elapsed from the date of the decree. There was no default till 1965 in the Present case, as the execution of the decree was stayed by orders of the trial court and the appellate court. [700D-G).
 692 (2) Since s. 28 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, provides only for an application for rescission, of a decree for specific performance for sale or lease of immovable property no application to rescind a decree for specific performance of an agreement to sell movables would lie under that section. [7Ol-A-B] (3) But the Specific Relief Act, 1963, is not an exhaustive enactment, and under the law relating to specific relief a Court which passes a decree for specific performance retains control ever the decree even after the decree had been passed. Therefore, the Court, in the present case, 're- tained control over the matter despite the decree and it was open to the Court, when it was alleged that the party moved against had positively refused to complete, the contract, to entertain the application and order rescission of the decree if the allegation was proved.

 (4) The respondent had, by his conduct and letter evinced an intention not to perform his part of the contract.
 Therefore, the fact that no time had been fixed in the decree would not preclude the Court from adjudging the contract as rescinded. [7O5 E-H] (a) If a contract does not specify time for performance the law will imply under s. 46 of the Contract Act that the parties intended that the obligation under the contract should he performed within a reasonable time depending on the circumstances of the case. The Contract between the parties was not extinguished by the passing of the specific performance decree and as the contract subsisted despite the decree, and as the' decree did not abrogate or modify any of the express or implied terms of the contract it must be presumed that the parties to the contract were under the obligation to complete it within a reasonable time. [7O3E-H] (b) The respondent, by exercising his option to purchase the 51% shares became entitled to obtain a conveyance of the share from the appellant on payment of the purchase money.
 There was no provision in the agreement as to when thereafter the appellant should convey the shares.
 Therefore, it was open to either party to make time essential by intimating the other party, after a reasonable period, about it after expressing its or his readiness and willingness to. perform its or his obligation under the contract. The liberty was not taken, away because a decree had been passed for specific performance of the contract without fixing the time for its performance. [7O3H; 704A-C] Observations in Fry on Specific Performance 6th edn. p. 546 and Halsbury's Laws of England 3rd edition vol. 36, 351 to 352, explained.
 (5) As the receiver had the shares in his possession, and as there was an order of the Court directing him to deliver possession 'of the shares on payment of the purchase money, intimation regarding which was given by the appellant to the respondent, there is no substance in the objection that the appellant was not in a position to deliver the shares., [705F-G] 693 (6) When. the Court adjudges rescission of a contract or a decree it is only concerned with the question whether, the person rescinding it was justified in doing so. In the present case when the appellant came to the Court with its application for rescission there was already a rescission of the contract and the decree by its letter dated February 11, 1967. It only wanted a declaration by adjudgment by the Court that it was justified in doing so. The Court did not create any right which the parties did not possess when it made a declaration that the contract had been validly rescinded. Merely because it is necessary for the Court to pass such an order it does not follow that it is the Court that rescinds the contract. It is only deciding upon the validity of the rescission already made by the party. [7O6A- E] Therefore, the respondent could not complain that, because the appellant obtain a stay of the order passed by the trial court giving the respondent a fortnight's time to pay the purchase money the appellant prevented him from paying the purchase money, and resist the prayer for rescission. [7O6A- B] Abram Steamship Company Ltd. v. Westville Shipping Company Ltd. L.R. [1923] A.C. 781, referred to.
 (7) There is no substance in the contention of the respondent that the appellant was not in a position to give a good title to the shares because 'A' company claimed a lien in respect of the shares. [707C-D] (8) It could not be contended that the remedy of the appellant was to execute the decree for specific performance as a decree for money. [7O9B-C] A decree for specific performance is a decree in favour of both the plaintiff and defendant in the suit, but it could be executed only in the manner prescribed by 0.31, r. 32, C.P.C. The appellant could not have executed the decree against the respondent as a money decree and realised the purchase money from him. Therefore, if the respondent refused to pay the purchase money there was nothing which prevented the appellant from applying for rescission of the decree.

 1923 Bom. 26, referred to.
 (9) The only question with which the Court was concerned was whether the respondent had disabled himself from performing his part of the obligation under the decree. The fact that attachments of the decree by creditors prevented him from performing his part of the obligation under the decree or obtain satisfaction thereof would not him any the less a defaulter so far as performance of his part of the obligation under the decree is concerned. [709E-G] (10) There is no substance in the contention that the attachment, by B-company of the 51% shares made it impossible for, the appellant to deliver the shares to the respondent as the attachment order directed that the 51% shares should be produced for delivery to the respondent against payment of the consideration mentioned in the specific Performance decree.
