 The respondent-company did not file any return of the re- issued forfeited shares under s. 75 (1) of the Act and therefore the appellant-shareholdar moved 'the High Court for an order requiring it to do so.
 Held that the words ,allotment of shares" have been used in 75 to indicate the creation of shares by appropriation out 699 of the unappropriated share capital to a particular person.
 When a share is forteited and re-issued it is not allotment in the sense of appropriation of share out of the authorised and unappropriated capital so as to bring the shares into existence. A re-issue of a forfeited share is not an allotment of share within the meaning of s. 75 (1) but a sale and that being so, no question of filing any return in respect of such re-issue arises.
