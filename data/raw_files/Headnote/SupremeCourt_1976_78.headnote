 The Mining and Minerals Departments of the State of U.P. have been selling by auction from 1965 onwards as "minor minerals" the deposits left on the surface of the appellant's lands, of the sand, gravel, bajris etc. due to the fluvial action of the receding floods of the Jamuna river. In 1970, the appellants objected to the proposed auction laying claim to the deposits, contending that since he is a riparian owner of the lands or is otherwise entitled to an unrestricted user of the lands, he would be entitled to appropriate the deposits, to the exclusion of others.
 Since his objection was not accepted, the appellant challenged the order by a writ petition under Article 226 in the Allahabad High Court which was dismissed following its earlier decision in "Sultan and Anr. v. State of U.P. (Civil Misc. Writ No. 8268/71 dated 28-9-73) to the effect that the sand, gravel, boulders, bajris etc. deposited on lands abutting on rivers. as a result of fluvial action of a river vest in the State Government". The appeal to the Division Bench was also dismissed.
 Dismissing the appeal by certificate, the Court ^ 
 HELD : (i) The contention that some of the lands being still zamindari lands, the right to mines and minerals which the zamindars originally had did not cease and, therefore, the Government had no right to the mines and minerals on such lands, cannot be acceded to, since no such argument whatsoever was made in the High Court either before the single judge or before the Division Bench, though there was an averment to that effect in the writ petition. The contention in regard to a part of the property raises at best a dispute between the Zamindari and the Government which the appealing has no right to raise. It is for the zamindars, if so advised, to take an appropriate proceeding for recognition of their claims as against the Government.
 The appellant cannot be heard to say in a Writ Petition filed for the assertion of his own individual rights that the action of the Government is calculated to prejudice somebody else's rights and should therefore be struck down [871 G.H, 872 A-C] (2) The deposits in the nature of ordinary sand other than sand used for prescribed purposes, gravel, building stores and bajri squarely fall within the provision of s.
 3(e) of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act 67 of 1957 and the rules 2(5), 2(7) and 3 of the Uttar Pradesh Minor Mineral (Concession) Rules, 1963 and are, therefore, 'minor minerals'. In equity, prior to the point of time when the flood waters of the river carried the sand and gravel to private lands, the title thereto was vested in the State Government. The rivers, the river beds and the sand, bajris and building stones lying in the river water are of state ownership. Nature carries these deposits to lands abutting on rivers and what the Act and Rules provide for is to enable the Government to reclaim what is lost without any fault of its own. The sand and gravel deposits left by the receding waters of the river are truly a part of the soil of the river bed and therefore belong to the State.
 The fluvial action of the river carries them to riparian lands but such shifting cannot erase the title of the rightful owner. [872 H, 873 A, C to G] 870 Sultan and Anr. v. The State of U.P. (Civil Misc. Writ Petition No. 8268/71 decided on 28-9-73) [approved];
 Halsbury's Laws of England 3rd Edn. Vol. 39 p. 559 para 775 [quoted with approval].
 (3) In the instant case, the minor minerals while under the the river water belonged to the State and the Statute answers the question whether the natural action of the flooding river destroys the title of, the state. The 1951 Act has vested the zamindaris right to mines and minerals in the State Government rendering it of secondary relevance whether prior to flood caused migration the ownership of the minerals was vested in the State. [874 C-D] Norman S. Wear v. State of Kansas 62 Law Edn. 214 @ 219; Halsbury's Laws of England 3rd Edn. Vol. 39 para 801 (page 568); Blewett v. Trigonning (1835) 3 Adolphus and Ellis' Reports 554 (distinguished).
 (4) It is wrong to assume that mines and minerals must always be sub soil and that there can be no minerals on the surface of the earth. The definition of mining operations and minor minerals in section 3(d) and (e) of the Act of 1957 and Rule 2(5) and (7) of the Rules of 1963, states that minerals need not be subterranean and that mining operations cover every operation undertaken for the purpose of "winning" any minor minerals. Winning does not imply a hazardous or perilous activity. The words simply mean 'extracting a mineral' and is used generally to indicate any activity by which minerals is secured. Extracting in turn means drawing out or obtaining. [874 E-F] [In view of the specific concessions in the counter affidavit by the Government the Court expressed its full confidence that in cases where it becomes necessary to fix the compensation under rule 67 the State would have regard to all relevant factors particularly the length of deprivation entailed by the conduct of mining operation.] [875 A-C]
