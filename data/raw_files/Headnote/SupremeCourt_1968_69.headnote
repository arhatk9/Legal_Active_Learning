 On the acquisition of several units of land with buildings, the Land Acquisition Officer determined the compensation payable to the persons interested. at the rate of Rs. 10,000 per acre for the land and for houses standing thereon "at their break up value" The respondent, who held Kanam rights in one of the units of the land and to whom the building standing thereon belonged, raised objections to the quantum, of the compensation. The Receiver of the Estate holding Jenmi rights in the land did not object. The trial court disapproved the method adopted by the Land Acqusition Officer for determining the compensation and held that each- unit had to be valued as a composite property. He determined the market value by capitalising -the net tent received from the unit and taking into consideration the return from gilt-edged Securities at 31/2% awarded compensation for the respondens unit at j5 times the net annual rental. The High Court upheld the order of the trial court but reduced the multiple to 33-1/3. Dismissing the appeal, this Court 
HELD : By the compulsory acquisitic on of land , all outstanding interests not vested in the Government -are extinguished. It is. therefore, the duty of the Land Acquisition Officer to determine in the first instance compensation which is to be paid for extinction of those interests, and then to apportion the compensation among the persons known or believed to be interested in the land. The rule could not be departed from merely because the Receiver in whom the Jenmi rights we're vested failed to raise an objection to the quantum of compensation awarded to him.
 The respondent being a Kanamdar has an interest in the land and was entitled to appointment of compensation even in respect of the land.[461 H-462 B] The method adopted by the Land Acquisition Officer for determining compensation payable for extinction of the interest of the holder of the land and of the buildings separately was unwarranted. In determining compensation payable for respect of land with building compensation can- not be determined byt ascertainig the value of the land and the "break up value" of the building separately. The land and the building constitute one unit, and the value of the entire unit must be determined with all its advantages and its potentialities. When the property sold is land with building, it is often difficult to secure reliable evidence of instances of sale of similar lands with buildings proximate in time to the date of the notification under s.
 
4. Therefore the method which is generally resorted to in determining the value of the land with buildings especially those used for business purposes, is the method of capitalization of return actually received or which might reasonably be received from the land and the buildings.

 L7 Sup.C.I./68-5 460 It cannot be laid down as a general rule applicable to all situations and circumstances that a multiple approximately equal to the return from gilt-edged securities prevailing at the relevant time forms an adequate basis for finding out the, market value of the land. But in this case the trial court and the High Court were Of, the view that a multiple based on a return from the gilt-edged securities was the appropriate multiple for determining the value of the Property under acquisition, and no ground 'has been suggeste for not accepting the basis and the rate of capitalization adopted by them.
