 Rule 12 of O.XXXV Supreme Court Rules empowers the Supreme Court in writ petitions under Art. 32 to require the petitioner to furnish security for the costs of the respondent. The petitioner contended that the rule was invalid as it placed obstructions on the fundamental right guaranteed under Art. 32, to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of fundamental rights.
 Held, (per Sinha, C.J., Gajendragadkar, Wanchoo and Das Gupta, JJ., Shah, J., contra), that r. 12 of O.XXXV Supreme Court Rules is invalid in so far as it relates to the furnishing of security. The right to move the Supreme Court under Art. 32 is an absolute right and the content of this right cannot be circumscribed or impaired on any ground. An order for furnishing security for the respondent's costs retards the assertion or vindication of the fundamental right under Art. 32 and contravenes the said right. The fact that the rule is discretionary does not alter the position. Though Art. 142(1) empowers the Supreme Court to pass any order to do complete justice between the parties, the Court cannot make an order inconsistent with the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution. No question of inconsistency between Art.
 142.(1) and Art. 32 arises as Art. 142(1) does not confer any power on the Supreme Court to contravene the provisions of Art. 32. Nor does Art. 145 which confers power, upon the Supreme Court to make rules, empower it to contravene the provisions of Art. 32.

 Shah,J.-The impugned rules is not void. The rule does not directly place any restriction upon the right of a litigant to move the Supreme Court. It merely recognises the jurisdiction of the Court, in appropriate cases, to make an order demanding security. It is not, in substance, a rule relating to practice and procedure but it deals primarily with the jurisdiction of the Court, which has its source in Art. 142 of the Constitution, No question of conflict arises between the rule which merely declares the jurisdiction of the Court defined by Art. 142 and the right guaranteed under Art. 32. The provisions of Art. 142 and Art. 32(1) must be read harmoniously. Both being provisions in the Constitution, one cannot prevail over the other.
