 The respondent is a registered firm of two partners. Three minors were admitted to the benefits of the partnership.
 For the assessment year 1957-58, the Income-tax Officer rejected the claim of the firm to set off under s. 24(1) the loss from certain speculative transactions against profits from other business and held that since the capital contributed by the partners and minors was out of the capital of their respective Hindu undivided families to which they belonged, the profits allocate( to them should be assessed as the income of their respective families. The order was confirmed by the Commissioner. In a petition under Art. 226, the High Court set aside the direction to assess the shares of the partners and minors to their respective families, and, following the decision in Jagannath Mahadeo Prasad v. Commissioner of Income-tax, 55 I.T.R 501 held that the speculation losses were liable to be set off against the profits in other business in the year of assessment.
 in appeal to this Court, 
HELD: (1) Once the Income-tax Officer grants registration of a firm he cannot proceed to inquire whet-her the share allocated to a partner is beneficially held by some other person or entity that is, whether the partners represented other persons. He must allocate the profits in accordance with deed of partnership. Therefore, the order of the Income-tax Officer, in the present case, directing that the income of the partners and minors shall be assessed in the hands of their respective families was withOut jurisdiction.
 [420 F-H] (2) The decision relied upon by the High Court was reversed by this Court in Commissioner of Income-tax v. Jagannath Mahadeo Prasad, 71 I.T.R. 296 (S.C.), and therefore, the assessee was not entitled to set off speculation losses against profits from other business activities, [321 A-B]
