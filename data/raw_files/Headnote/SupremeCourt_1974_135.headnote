 The applicant, was convicted and sentenced for an offence under ss. 302/34, 1. P. C. In respect of his conviction under s. 201, I. P. C. no separate sentence was imposed by the trial court. The High Court converted the conviction to one under s. 302 simpliciter but maintained his conviction under s. 201.
 On appeal, affirming the conviction under s. 201, 1. P. C.
 this Court passed an: order of sentence under s. 201, 1. P.
 C. In review application it was contended that since no appeal had been filed by the State against the failure of the trial court to pass a separate sentence under s. 201, I.
 P. C. or against the failure of the High Court to specify the sentence this Court could not pass any sentence at all now tinder this section.
 Dismissing the Review Application, Held : (1) The consequential order imposing a sentence, which by inadvertence was not passed by the High Court, could- be passed by this Court. The power to pass a sentence is a power which can and ought to be exercised by all courts which, having jurisdiction to decide whether the accused is guilty or not, find that he is.. This power is preserved to the appellate court experessly by s. 423 (1)(d), Cr. P.C. which enacts that it could "make any amendment or consequential or incidental order that may be just or proper". When a convictionis affirmed in appeal but no sentence had been awarded by the trial magistrate the award of a sentence is consequential on and incidental to the affirmance of theconviction and it is a just and proper order to be passed under the law. [609E; 610A-C] Vithoda & Anr. v. The State of Bombay, [1955] 2SCR 1049 @ 1054-55, followed..
 (2) The order passed showed that the applicant was not only convicted under S. 201, I.P.C. but his sentence for the offence was ordered to run concurrently with the life sentence. Only the period of sentence was not fixed. That was plainly erroneous. The sentence could not be concurrent for the whole period of the sentence under s. 302 I. P. C. When that sentence was set aside the period of' sentence under s. 201, I.P.C. had to be fixed as a necessary consequence. [610 D-E]
