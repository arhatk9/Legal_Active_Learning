 The appellant was the tenant with respect to shop room on a monthly rent of Rs. 50. On 27th September, 1973, the respondent purchased the premises in question from the Commissioner of Partition and Receiver in a suit for partition between the owners of the said premises. The appellant tenant was notified about the sale and was asked to pay rent to the respondents.
 The respondents filed a suit for ejectment on 12th December, 1975 in the City Civil Court on the ground of default In payment of rent and sub-letting. The Trial Court decreed the suit on the ground of sub-letting. The appellant flied an appeal before the High Court against the judgement of the Trial Court.
 The Judges of the Division Bench of the High Court took divergent views. While one Judge held that the plaintiff having accepted the rent even after having the knowledge of subletting plaintiff had waived or dispensed with their right of forfeiture and as such directed the dismissal of the plaintiffs suit, the other Judge took a contrary view that under the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1956, a tenant was under an obligation to pay rent to the landlord and there was no question of waiving the right of forfeiture by accepting the rent by the landlord.
 In view the difference of opinion between the two judges, the matter was referred to a third teamed Judge, who agreed with the latter view. Thus the appeal preferred by the tenant was dismissed, against which the 472 473 present appeal by special leave was filed.
 Dismissing the appeal, this Court, 
HELD : 1.01. A perusal of the provisions of Section 13 and 16 of the Act clearly shows that when there was no previous consent in writing of the landlord for creation of sub- tenancy It shall be a ground for eviction in terms of Section 13(1)(a) of the Ad. Even in case of creation of sub-tenancy with the consent of the landlord in writing it was necessary to follow the future procedure prescribed under section 16(1) of the Act. Mere knowledge or acknowledgement of rent cannot defeat the landlord's right to get a decree for ejectment on the ground of sub-letting.
 If the view as contended on behalf of the applicant is accepted the provisions of both the sections 13 and 16 would become nuptory. [476E-F] 1.02.There Is a clear mandate in Section 13(1)(a) that the protection against eviction to the tenant shall not be available in case the tenant transfers, assigns or sub-lets in whole or in part the premises held by him without the previous consent in writing of the landlord. [476F] 1.03. Waiver is a question of fact which depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. In case of waiver of any provisions of the Statute it Is necessary to prove that there was conscious relinquishment of the statutes. [478D] 1.04. In the instant case there is no question of waiver. It was necessary for the tenant appellant to prove that the landlord had accepted the rent being fully conscious that by their act they were relinquishing the right of eviction available to them on the ground of sub- letting under Section 13(1)(a) of the Act. [478E] 1.05. Any acceptance of rent from the appellant in January, 1975 cannot amount to any waiver in respect of rent from the appellant in January, 1975 cannot amount to any waiver in respect of the right of eviction on the ground of sub-letting.
