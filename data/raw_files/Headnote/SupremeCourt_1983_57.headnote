 The appellant was working as a Godown-Keeper in the northern region of the Food Corporation of Delhi. He was transferred to the eastern region at his own request on March 1, 1961. In August 1962, the Union of India issued a circular to the effect that an officer who was transferred from one region to another at his own request should be treated as a fresh entrant in the cadre to which he belonged in the latter region for the purpose of seniority and thus thereby such an officer will forfeit his past services. In the Seniority List of 1969, the appellant's name was shown at S. No 261 but in the seniority list of 1972 his name was shown against SI. No. 266 and as a result four of his juniors were promoted. The appellant's several representations against the said promotions having failed, he filed a writ petition in the Calcutta High Court praying for a mandamus directing the respondents either to forbear from giving effect to the promotions or to transfer him back to Northern region restoring his seniority. As per the High Court's orders, the Joint Personnel Manager of the Corporation wrote to the Zonal Manager (E) at Calcutta assuring that the seniority position of appellant in the Northern region prior to his transfer to the Eastern region would be restored to him. After his re-transfer to the Northern region, the appellant found that some of his juniors had already been promoted. On his representation, the Departmental Promotion Committee empanelled him in the 1976 panel and refused to empanel him from 1970 on the ground of non-availability of service records. But when they were traced and produced, the Departmental Promotion Committee refused to empanel his name in the 1970 List with a cryptic resolution to the effect that "on the basis of records of his service, his case cannot be reopened". His representations against the said resolution having failed, the appellant filed a writ petition in the Delhi High Court which was dismissed in limine. Hence the appeal by Special Leave.
 Allowing the appeal, the Court ^ 
 HELD: 1:1 The resolution of the Zonal Committee passed in May 1979 stating that the case of the appellant could not be reopened has to be 7 treated as non-est and ineffective one in the eye of law.
 The Zonal Promotion Committee had not considered the case of the appellant for the purpose of including him in the 1970 panel. The re-opening of a case arises only when it has been once considered and a decision is taken thereon. [10 G-H, 11 A-B] 1:2 The resolution passed by the Zonal Promotion Committee means that it was not willing to reopen the case of the appellant on the basis of his service records. The resolution does not show that the Committee had in fact considered the suitability of the appellant for promotion to a higher post at the time when his juniors were empanelled for the purposes of promotion. If it had done so, the Committee would have recorded in its resolution that the appellant had been found to be unsuitable for promotion during the relevant time. When his case came up before the Committee for the first time in December 5, 1977, it deferred the consideration of his case on the ground that the relevant Confidential Reports were not available. Having thus deferred the consideration of the case of the appellant on that occasion, the Zonal Promotion Committee should have considered his case when the relevant Confidential Reports were placed before it and passed an appropriate resolution instead of remarking that his case could not be reopened.
