 The respondent was an officiating Sub-inspector of Police in Ajmer. After the merger of Ajmer in the State of Rajasthan under the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, the respondent was appointed officiating Sub-Inspector of Police in Rajasthan. On April 6, 1957, he was reverted to his substantive post of Head Constable. He challenged his reversion on the ground that under the standing Orders of the Police Force in Ajmer which formed part of his conditions of service he had a guaranteed right not to be reverted except in strict order of juniority, that the reversion was an alteration in the conditions of his service which the State Government was not competent to effect without the sanction of the Central Government under s. 1 15 (7) of the Act and that there was a direction by the Central Government under s. 117 of the Act which made the right to retain an officiating post without reversion a condition of service.
 Held that the Standing Orders were mere administrative instructions issued by the Inspector-General of Police under s. 12 of the Police Act and were not conditions of service which could only be framed by the State Government. As such, even if the order of reversion violated the Standing Order there was no violation of the conditions of service.
 It is not a condition of service that the holder of an officiating post shall not be reverted to his substantive post and there was no alteration of the conditions of service by the order of reversion as contemplated by s. 115 (7) of the Reorganisation Act, 1956. Nor was any direction given by the Central Government under s. 117 of the Act curtailing the powers of the State Government in this respect. On the other hand the powers of the State Government to pass in relation to such a person "any order 983 affecting his continuance in such post or office" have been specifically preserved by s. II 6 (2) of the Act. There is no legal right in an officer to hold an officiating post and he cannot claim that he cannot be reverted except for proper reasons. Parshotam Lal Dhingra v. Union of India, (1958) S.
 C. R. 828, referred to.
