 The suit flied by the appellant for ejecting the respondents limited company, from the suit premises, was decreed ex- parte by the trial court since neither the advocate nor the respondent-tenant, appeared when the case came up for final- hearing. Thereafter, the respondent-company flied an application to set aside the ex-parte decree, stating that the non-appearance of the respondent-tenant was due to the advice tendered by the advocate-on-record to the effect that the respondent-tenant need not be present at the hearing of the suit till the disposal of the two interlocutory applications filed by the respondent-tenant According to it, there was sufficient cause to set aside the ex-parte decree within the meaning of Order 9 Rule 13 C.P.C. The trial court dismissed the said application. The appeal against the trial court's order was also dismissed by a Division Bench of the High Court. However, before the judgment was signed by the learned Judges, an application was moved by the respondent-tenant for alteration or modification and/or reconsideration of the judgment on the ground that the respondents' counsel could not bring to the notice of the Court, the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Rafiq and Anr. v. Munshilal and Anr., [1981] INSC 94; AIR 1981 SC 1400 which supported respondent-tenant's case. This was opposed by the appellant on the ground that once the judgment was pronounced in open court, it was final and that matter could not be reopened, just because a relevant decision was not brought to the notice of the court. However, the Division Bench reopened the case on the ground that technicalities should not be allowed to stand in the way of doing justice to the parties and allowed the appeal, 794 795 relying on the decision.
 In the appeal before this Court on behalf of the appellant It was contended that the decision in the case of Rafiq did not support the respondents' case and the High Court had erred in holding otherwise, Inasmuch as the respondent- tenant in the Instant case was a private limited company, managed by persons who were not only well-educated but were practical businessmen, unlike the appellant In the case of Rafiq, who was a rustic innocent villager, placing his entire trust In his advocate.
 On behalf of the respondent-tenant it was submitted that when the High Court had applied and acted upon a decision of this Court, it would not be proper to set aside their order under Article 136 of the Constitution, and that the respondent-company implicitly trusted their advocate and acted according to his advice and should not be penalised therefore.
 Allowing the appeal, this Court, 
HELD : 1.1. The advocate is the agent of the party. His acts and statements made within the limits of authority given to him, are the acts and statements of the principal, i.e., the party who engaged him. It is true that in certain situations, the Court may, in the interest of justice, set side a dismissal order or an ex-parte decree notwithstanding the Negligence and/or misdemeanour of the advocate where It finds that the client was an innocent litigant, but there is no such absolute rule that a party can disown its advocate at any time and seek relief No such absolute immunity can be recognised. Such an absolute rule would make the working of the system extremely difficult. [801G] 1.2. The instant case was an on-going suit posted for final hearing after a lapse of seven years of its institution. It was not a second appeal riled by a villager residing away from the city, where the Court is located. The respondent is also not a justice ignorant villager but a private limited company with its head-office at the place where the court is located and managed by educated businessmen who know where their interest lies. It is evident that when their interlocutory applications were not disposed of before taking up the suit for final hearing, they felt piqued and refused to appear before the court. May be, it was part of their delaying tactics as alleged by the appellant. May be not. But one thing is clear they chose to non-cooperate with the court. Having adopted such a stand towards the 796 Court, the respondent has no right to ask its Indulgence.
 Putting the entire blame upon the advocate and trying to make It out as if they were totally unaware of the nature or significance of the proceedings Is a theory which cannot be accepted and ought not to have been accepted. [802A-C] 1.3. It is difficult. to believe that the respondents implicitly believed their advocate's advice. Being educated businessmen they would have known that non-participation at the final hearing of the suit would necessarily result In an adverse decision. This Court is not prepared to believe that such an advice was in fact tendered by the advocate.
 No advocate worth his salt would give such advice to his client. Secondly, there are several contradictions in his deposition. Therefore, the story set up by the respondent- company in its application under Order 9 Rule 13 is an after-thought and ought not to have been accepted by the Division Bench, more particularly, when it had rejected the very case in its earlier judgment [800G-H, 801AE] Rafiq and Anr. v. Munshilal and Anr., [1981] INSC 94; A.I.R. 1981 S.C. 1400, distinguished.
