 The Bombay Cinemas (Regulation) Act 11 of 1953 and the rules made thereunder were made applicable to the territory of the State of Gujarat by the Bombay Reorganisation Act, 1960.
 Under s. 3 of Act It of 1953 films can be exhibited only in licensed premises. By s. 4(3) the District Magistrate is, where there is no Commissioner of Police, the Licensing Authority. By s. 5 the Licensing Authority is subject to the control of the State Government. A person aggrieved by the order of the Licensing Authority has under s. 8A a right of appeal to the State Government. Rule 5(2) authorises the Government on consideration of the report of the Licensing Authority, in its absolute discretion to grant permission for the issue of a no objection certificate to the applicant or to refuse to grant the same. By r. 89 it is enacted that no person shall put up any building or structure or convert existing premises for being used as a cinema except with the permission in writing of the Licensing Authority.
 The respondents carried on the business of exhibiting cinematograph films in a theatre named Krishna Cinema at Rajkot. On May 14, 1963 they applied to the District Magistrate for a 'no objection certificate' to the user of a building to construction as an 'annexe' to the Krishna Cinema, The Magistrate sanctioned the construction of the building and the plans submitted by the respondents were approved by the Executive Engineer. On completion of the building the Executive Engineer recommended the grant of a 'no objection certificate'. Thereafter the District Magistrate in his report of the State Government suggesting that a no objection certificate be granted even though the construction of the building before the grant of the certificate was against the rules. The Government of Gujarat intimated by a letter dated July 9, 1964 written by the Add. District Magistrate, Rajkot that the application filed by the respondents could not be granted,. An appeal filed against the order communicated by the Addl. District Magistrate to the State Government was rejected. The respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court which succeeded. The State of Gujarat appealed to this Court relying on r. 89 for their contention that the building was constructed in violation of the rules and, therefore, the refusal of a 'no objection certificate' was justified.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) Rule 89 authorises the Licensing Authority to allow conversion of an existing building into a cinematograph theatre. Therefore the completion of the building before the Government considered the request to a 'no objection certificate' did not constitute a bar to the exercise of jurisdiction to grant the certificate and District Magistrate was right in his view that the certificate applied for must be granted. [II S B-C] 111 The 'annexe' complied with all the requirements of the rules, but by letter dated July 9, 1964 the Licensing Authority under instructions of the State Government informed the respondent that application for constructing a permanent annexe near the present Krisha Cinema and for obtaining a 'no objection certificate' was not admissible.
 The building had been constructed several months before the date on which the letter was written. The contents of the letter created an impression that in the view of the authorities the building had still to be constructed. It was clear that the authority did not apply its mind to the application. It did not consider whether a building which was already in existence should be allowed to be converted into a cinematograph theatre. [116 A-C] Further in dismissing the appeal preferred to the State Government it was recorded that the Government did 'not see any reasons to change the decision already taken by the District Magistrate'. The order of the State Government which was a reaffirmation of its original decision communi- cated through the Licensing Authority gave no indication that the objections raised in the memorandum of appeal were considered. No reasons in support of the order were set out. [116 C-D] Since the State Government did not correctly apprise itself of the facts when it gave its directions to the Licensing Authority to dismiss the application and later dismissed the appeal without. giving any reasons, its order giving directions to the District Magistrate and in appeal were rightly set aside by the High Court. [117 A-B] (ii)Power to control the Licensing Authority under s. 5 is not power to supplant the Licensing Authority. The power to grant a licence under the Act is a quasi-Judicial power and by the use of the Expression 'absolute discretion' in r.
 5 it is not intended to invest the Licensing Authority with arbitrary power so as to destroy the limitations to which it is subject by its inherent nature. [116 G-H] [The court found it unnecessary for the purpose of the case to express any opinion on the propriety or validity of provisions making exercise of quasi-judicial power subject to the control, at the stage when it was exercised, of the executive. It observed however that a right of appeal Linder s. 8A the State Government against the order of the Licensing Authority issued under the order of the State Government was a futile formality and served no useful purpose.
