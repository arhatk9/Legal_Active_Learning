 The question for decision in this appeal was whether the Regional Transport Officer under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, as amended by the Madras State Legislature, had the power to vary the terms of a stage carriage permit granted under that Act. The appellant, holder of a stage carriage permit, applied on July 19, 1954, to the Regional Transport Officer for a variation of the route specified in his permit. The Regional Officer after hearing objections rejected the application. The appellant applied to the State Government for revision of the order under s. 64A of the Act and the Government after hearing objections set aside the order of the Regional Transport Officer and granted variation of the permit as sought for. Against this order the respondent moved the Madras High Court under Art.
 226 of the Constitution. The Single judge who heard the matter, following a decision of a Division Bench of that Court, held that the Regional Transport Officer had no jurisdiction to deal with the appellant's application and the State Government for that very reason could have no power in revision to grant the same, and set aside the order of the Madras Government:
 Held (per Sinha, C. J., Imam, Sarkar and Shah, jj.). Section 64A of the Motor Vehicles Act, introduced into the Act by the Madras Legislature, although couched in wide language, does not confer on the State Government any original jurisdiction or authorise it to pass in revision an order which the authority, whose order it seeks to revise, has no jurisdiction to pass. While undoubtedly it can set aside an order of. an authority or officer 765 subordinate to it passed without jurisdiction under Ch. IV of the Act, it cannot substitute its own order directing a variation of the stage carriage permit granted to a particular person. Sections 43 and 48 of the Act make it quite clear that no such authority is vested in the State Government and the words " as it thinks fit " in s. 64A must mean within the ambit of the provisions of the Act.
 The words " any officer subordinate to him " used in s. 44A of the Act, as amended by the Madras State Legislature are of wide import and cannot be given a restricted meaning and must include an officer in any way subordinate to the Transport Commissioner.
 The Regional Transport Officer who was admittedly and without doubt administratively subordinate to the Transport Commissioner by virtue of the Madras Government notification dated February 14, 1953, at the time the application was made and was duly authorised in this behalf, had the jurisdiction to vary the conditions of the permit issued to the appellant.
 Section 44A of the Act did not depend for its operation on any rules to be framed under s. 133A of the Act, which was merely an enabling section, by the Government.
 Consequently, there can be no doubt that the State Govern- ment had the power under s. 64A of the Act to vary the terms of the permit which the Regional Transport Officer had refused to do.
 B. Veeraswamy v. State of Andhra Pradesh, A.I.R. 1959 And.

 T. Krishnaswamy Mudaliar v. P. S. Palani Pillai, A.I.R.
 1957 Mad. 599, disapproved.
 Per Subba Rao, J.-Section 44A of the Act does not authorise the State Government to appoint subordinate officers to the Transport Commissioner but only enables it to confer statutory powers on officers subordinate to him. The State Government has made no rules under s. 133A of the Act making the Regional Transport Officer subordinate to the commissioner. It is, therefore, manifest that neither under the statute nor under any rules made thereunder is the Regional Transport Officer subordinate to the Commissioner in any way within the meaning Of s. 44A of the Act.
 Even assuming that the State Government administratively treated the Regional Transport Officer as a subordinate to the Transport Commissioner and the word 'may' in s. 133A of the Act conferred a discretionary power on it either to frame rules or not to do so, it is wrong to say that it could do administratively what it was empowered to do by rules. If the Government really intended to make the Regional Transport Officer subordinate to the State Transport Commissioner, the only way in which it could do so was by framing a rule under s. 133A(3) of the Act.
