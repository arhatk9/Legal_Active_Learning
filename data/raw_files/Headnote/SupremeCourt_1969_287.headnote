 There was a one-day strike by the workmen in the appellant factory on February 27, 1964. On the same day the management declared a lock-out which continued till March 22, 1964. The industrial dispute being referred to the Tribunal, the latter found that the strike was illegal and therefore the lock-out on February 27 was justified. The Tribunal however held that the prolonged lock-out from February 28, onwards was unjustified. On this finding the Tribunal awarded wages for the period of the lock-out after February 28, 1964 to the workmen. In appeal by special leave before this Court it was contended on behalf of the employers that the workmen were not free from blame in the matter of lock-out and therefore in view of the decisions of this Court only half the wages for the period of the unjustified lock-out should have been awarded to the workmen. It was also submitted that the Tribunal was wrong in refusing the appellant's prayer for adjournment which was sought for the purpose of producing evidence regarding the blame for the lock-out.
 
HELD: (i) It was incumbent on the Tribunal to apply its mind to the question of apportionment of blame on the two parties and to its effect on the amount of wages to be awarded to the workmen for the period of lock-out after February 28. 1964. The order of the Tribunal ignoring this important aspect was difficult to sustain. (885 B-C] India General Navigation and Railway Co. Ltd. v.

 (ii) On the facts of the case it would have been more appropriate exercise of judicial discretion on the part of the Tribunal to adjourn the case to the following day for the production of the appellant's evidence, if necessary on payment of costs. [885 C-D] (iii) In the circumstances of, the case it was not necessary to prolong the litigation by remitting the case back to the Tribunal. It was more just and proper to end the controversy by directing that half wages should be paid to the workmen for the period of the lock-out from February 28, 1964. 1885 E]
