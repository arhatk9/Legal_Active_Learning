 In order to promote tourism, the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 was amended by the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act 56 of 1969. Sub-s.(7) which was introduced in s. 63 by the Amending Act provided that notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-s. (1) but subject to any rules that may be made under this Act, any State Transport Authority may, for the purpose of promoting tourism, grant permits valid for the whole or any part of India, in respect of such number of tourist Vehicles as the Central Government may, in respect of that State, specify in this behalf. In exercise of this power the Central Government by its notification No. S. O 22 dated December 19, 1977 fixed a quota of 50 as the all India tourist permits for each State. The petitioners challenged this quota as discriminatory and violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution.
 Dismissing the writ petitions, ^ 
 HELD: It appears that s. 63 (7) was introduced after ascertaining the needs of developing tourist trade. The Central Government fixed quota of 50 permits for each State.
 It may be that a smaller State like Himachal Pradesh or Jammu and Kashmir may have larger number of places of tourist interest. Equally area-wise the biggest State Madhya Pradesh may have few spots of tourist interest. Therefore, unless all the relevant fact are placed on record which may point to the invidiousness of fixing a flat quota, the petitioners contention that the quota is arbitrary and violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution has no force.
 [528D-F, 525E] 523 The Parliament enacted Sub-s.(7) of s. 63 conferring an enabling power or State Transport Authority to grant a permit valid for the whole of India which but for the provision contained in Sub-s. (7) of s. 63 it was not entitled to grant and that this power to grant was subject to the condition that the Central Government will specify the quota. Therefore, the quota is not severable from the power to grant the permit. Assuming that the quota is severable from the enabling provision, no material has been placed on record to point out the needs of each State, the places of tourist interest, the influx of tourists, the facility for their boarding and lodging and the condition of roads in respect of each State. In the absence of this fact situation, the petitioners' submission that the expression, in respect of such number of tourist vehicles as the Central Government may, in respect of that State specify in this behalf' is severable and therefore the enabling part of sub- s. (7) will permit State Transport Authority in each State to grant all India tourist permit keeping in view the need of the tourists and the needs of the State, cannot be examined on merits. [527H, 528A-B, 527G] It is recommended that in view of the vast expanding tourist traffic the Central Government must undertake an exercise within a reasonable time and at regular intervals to reevaluate the quota of all India tourist permits to keep pace with developing notion of attracting tourists.
