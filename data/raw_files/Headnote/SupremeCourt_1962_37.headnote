 The Sastri Award provided one scale of wages for clerks in all banks. It further provided for a special allowances to clerks who were assigned special posts requiring special skill. Paragraph 297 (7) of the Award provided for fixing the basic wages of employees of a bank who joined after January 31,1951 in the new scales prescribed. The respondent, who was a clerk in the appellant bank, was appointed a supervisor in 1951. The appellant fixed his basic wages according to the scale payable to graduate clerks and gave him the special allowance prescribed by the Sastri Award.
 The respondent made an application under s. 33C (2) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, for computing in terms of money the benefit to which he was entitled under the Sastri Award claiming that his basic wages should be fixed according to the scale prescribed by the Bank for supervisors.
 The appellant contended that s. 33C (2) was not applicable to monetary benefits and that the respondent being a clerk his wages were rightly fixed.
 ^ Held, that s. 33C (2) of the Act was applicable to computation of monetary benefits also to which a workman was entitled and the application was maintainable. The word "benefit" included both 'monetary benefit' as well as 'non monetary benefit' and there was no reason to exclude 'monetary benefit' therefrom. The word used in s. 33C (2) was "computed" and not "converted" and compute means to calculate. The provision of s. 33C (2) was concerned purely with execution and there was no reason to hold that it applied to non-monetary benefits alone.
