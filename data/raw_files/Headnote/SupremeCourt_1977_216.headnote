 Pursuant to the decision of the Government dated September 9, 1975 that Government servants who owned houses in their own names or in the name of their families and were occupying Government accommodation should be required to vacate Government accommodation allotted to them within three months from 1st October 1975 and that in default of their vacating Government accommodation by December 31, 1975, they should be charged enhanced licence fee at the market rates, the appellant, landlord a Government servant who was in occupation of a government accommodation bearing No. B-11/ 791 situated at Lodhi Colony, New Delhi was also served with a general Order dated Sept. 30, 1975 to that effect. The appellant, who in his own name owned a two and half storied residential house bearing No. W-43, Green Park, New Delhi filed an application u/s 14A(1) read with S. 25B of the Delhi Rent Control (Amendment) Ordinance 1975 (No. 24 of 1975) for eviction of the respondent-tenant from the first floor of his house, on the ground that he had been asked to vacate the Government accommodation on account of his owning a house in the Union Territory of Delhi and had incurred an obligation to pay penal licence fee in default.
 In response to the summons served upon him, the respondent- tenant filed, on January 16, 1976, an application supported by a detailed affidavit seeking leave to contest and defend the case on various grounds viz. : (1) The summary procedure provided u/s 25B was available not for an application filed u/s 14A(1) but only for an application seeking eviction u/s 14(1)(e) of the Delhi Rent Control Act, (ii) Even otherwise since according to the landlord's own showing he had retired from Government service on November 30, 1975 and- was therefore, liable to vacate the Government accommodation, the application u/s 14A(1) was not maintainable in other words S. 14A(1) was not meant for a retired Government servant or a Government servant who was transferred outside Delhi; (iii) The application seeking his eviction was not filed bona fide inasmuch as the appellant-landlord had earlier filed in application No. 497/1975 seeking respondent's eviction from the premises on the ground of bona fide personal requirement u/s 14(1)(c) which had (iv)The application for eviction was wholly mala fide because the premises werelet out initially at a rent of Rs. 300/- per month which was increased to Rs. 350/- per month w.e.f. October 1, 1971 and thereafter it was further increased to Rs. 400/- per month and further because when the ground floor premises of the house in question had fallen vacant on two occasions prior to the filing of the application the landlord instead of himself occupying the said premises had let out the same at higher rents. The appellant landlord refuted these contentions and explained the circumstances Why he had let out portions of his house after these had fallen vacant during the pendency of his earlier eviction application and prior to his filing the instant application.
 By his order dated August 11, 1976, the Rent Controller Delhi, negatived all the contentions urged by the Respondent-tenant, rejected his prayer for granting leave to contest and defend the proceedings and passed an order of eviction against him u/s 14A(1) directing the respondent to deliver vacant possession of the premises in his occupation to the appellant-landlord within two months from the date of the order. The Revision applications filed by The respondent 'was allowed by the Delhi High Court which held :
 (1) S. 14A((1) would not be available to a landlord who was an allottee of the Government accommodation of whose allotment was liable to be cancelled by virtue of his retirement from service or transfer outside Delhi. (ii) The 184 provision of S. 14 A(1) as also the summary procedure provided u/s 25B of the Act were extraordinary provisions intended to ensure expeditious eviction of tenants who were in occupation of residential accommodation owned by such allottees of Govt. accommodation who were required to vacate by virtue of their ownership of such accommodation, that these provisions were intended to deal with hard cases and that no landlord should be permitted to take undue advantage thereof, if he was required to vacate Govt. accommodation by virtue of his retirement or transfer and (iii) on the facts of the case the appellant was not entitled to invoke the provisions of S. 14A(1) of the Act inasmuch as even before the application was filed he had already retired from service and was on that account liable to vacate the Government accommodation.
 Allowing the appeal by special leave the Court, 
HELD (1) The object of S. 14A is to confer a right on certain landlords to recover "immediate possession of the premises" belonging to them and which are in possession of their tenants provided they are required to vacate Govt.
 accommodation in their occupation by a general or specific order. Such a right is "to accrue" to a landlord on his satisfying the following conditions : (a) Such landlord must be in occupation of a residential accommodation allotted to him by the Central Government or any local authority; and (b) such a landlord must have been required to vacate such residential accommodation or in default to incur certain obligations by any general or special order made by that Government or authority on the ground that he owns in the Union Territory of Delhi a residential accommodation either in his own name or in the name of his wife, or dependent child. To such a landlord who satisfies the aforesaid conditions the right to evict his tenant accrues "on or from the date of such order" (meaning the general or special order by which he is required to vacate or in default he incurs certain obligations). The crucial words are 'on or from the date of such order." with the result that the cause of action accrues to the landlord on the date when he is served with the general or special order requiring him to vacate or incur obligations, though the speedy remedy to secure possession of that cause of actioncould be said to have been made available to him only with the cominginto force of the Ordinance No. 24 of 1975. [189 D-G] (2) In the instant case, the appellant landlord is entitled to invoke the provisions of S. 14A(1) notwithstanding the fact that he had retired from service w.e.f. November 30, 1975. Pursuant to Central Government's decision taken in that behalf on September 9, 1975, a general order, requiring him to vacate the Govt. accommodation or in default to incur obligation of payment of penal licencefee on the ground that he owns a residential accommodation in his own name in the Union Territory of Delhi was served upon the appellant- landlordon Sept. 30, 1975, which was much before his retirement, which took Place on November 30, 1975. In other words when the cause of action arose or the right to evict his tenant accrued to him, the appellant landlord was very much in service. This is not a case where the right to evict has accrued to a government servant landlord simultaneously with or after his retirement from service.
