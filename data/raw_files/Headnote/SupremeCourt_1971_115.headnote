 Notice under s. 34(1) (a) of the Income-tax Act, 1922 was served in, February 1957 on the appellant with respect to escaped income of Rs. 40,000 for the assessment year 1948- 
49. On appeal the Appellate Assistant Commissioner held that the proceedings were illegal. On July 9, 1958, the Income-tax Officer issued another notice and assessed the assessee's income including therein the Rs. 40,000, to tax.
 When the matter came up before the High Court on reference, the. High Court held that the notice dated July 9, 1958 was a fresh notice but that it was saved from the bar of limitation by s. 4 of the Income tax (Amendment) Act, 1959.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD:Section 4 of the 1959-Act refers to all notices issued tinder s. 34(1) (a) of the 1922 Act at any time before the commencement of the, 1959-Act. The notice dated July 9, 1958, in the present case, fell within that description. But s. 4 of the 1959-Act does not save such notices from attack on all grounds whatsoever; the only ground of attack which cannot be taken is that at the time the notice was issued the period prescribed by s. 34(1) (a) of the 1922-Act, as in force before its amendment by the Finance Act, 1956, had expired. But in the present case, what the assessee was saying was, that a notice under s.
 34(1) (a) as amended by the Finance Act of 1956, could have been issued under that Act in respect of the assessment year 1948-49 till April 1, 1957; but when the Finance Act of 1956, came into force, he came to be governed by the 8 year period prescribed by the Act as amended by the 1956 Act and not the 8 year period prescribed by the Act as it stood before the amendment in 1956. Accordingly the escaped income being less than a lakh, the assessee's ground of attack was that the 8 years prescribed by s. 34 as amended after 1956 had a] ready expired before July 9, 1958. The assessee's stand was correct, and the notice was barred.
