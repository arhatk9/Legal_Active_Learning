 The services of Respondent Ramlakhan Singh who was working as sectional officer in the Waste Paper department of the paper factory of the appellant at Dalmianagar, Bihar State was terminated with immediate effect by a notice dated 10-6- 1970, with an offer of one months wages in lieu of notice.
 The respondent assailed the order of his termination by making a complaint u/s. 26(2) of the Bihar Shops & Establishments Act, 1953. The appellant contested on merits, as well as on the technical ground that it was not maintainable under the Bihar Act as the respondent was not an employee within the meaning of s. 2(4) of the Act. The Labour Court, by its order dated 29-5-1972, held that the respondent was not a factory worker within the meaning of s.
 2(1) of the Factories Act, 1948 and hence was an employee within the meaning of the Bihar Act. The Writ Petition filed by the appellant in the Patna High Court against the said order was dismissed asking him to agitate this point after the final decision was made by the Court. The Labour Court, on merits, decided the matter on 28-2-1973, allowed the petition of the respondent and ordered his reinstatement with full back wages. A fresh writ petition challenging the said orders was also dismissed by the Patna High Court.
 Allowing the appeal by special leave, the Court, 
HELD: Only a. person who is an employee u/s 2(4) of the Bihar Shops and Establishments Act, 1953, could file an application u/s 26(2). [95B] Even (persons employed in a factory by the inclusive clause in the second sentence the definition in S. 2(4) are employees within the meaning of the Bihar Act. But two exceptions have been carved our from the category of such, persons. namely, (1) "Who are not workers within the meaning of the Factories Act", such a worker does not come within the inclusive definition of the term employee; (2) who are not working in a managerial capacity. In other words even a person employed in a factory and who is not a worker within the meaning of the Factories Act will not be an employee u/s 2(4) of the Bihar Act, if he is working in a managerial capacity. [95D-F] Reading clause (1) of s. 2 of the Factories Act, 1948, together with clause (k) and (m) thereof, it is clear that a person to be a worker within the meaning of the Factories Act must be a person employed in the premises or the precincts of the factory. [96C] State of U.P. v. M. P. Singh & Ors., [1959] INSC 153; [1960] 2 SCR 605 reiterated.
 Raw materials used in the manufacturing process for producing paper and its various products, undoubtedly, will be a "subject of the manufacturing process' within the meaning of clause 1 of section 2 of the Factories Act, whatever also may be or may not be such subject. [97A-B] In the instant case, the respondent was not working in a managers capacity. Though he was not employed "in any manufacturing process or in cleaning any part of the machinery or premises used for a manufacturing process", he was engaged in a work which was connected with the 94 "Subject of the manufacturing process" and therefore, he was a factory worker within the meaning of clause (1) of s. 2 of the Factories Act, 1948. Hence he was not an employee within the meaning of the Bihar Shops and Establishments Act, 1953. The petition of complaint filed by him u/s 26(2) was not maintainable. [96G, 97B-C]
