 The income from the business of Nathmal Tolaram carried on by Narmal was assessed as Hindu Undivided Family income till 1950. After the death of Narmal in 1945, the business was partitioned w.e.f. 6th April 1949 and by a deed of partnership executed on 7th April 1949, the business carried on at two places, Dhubri and Gauripore, was converted by his three sons Srinivas, Nathmal & Tolaram, into a partnership business. In this deed, it wits admitted that the business had been carried on previous to the partition as Hindu Undivided Family business. On an application u/s 25A of the Income Tax Act, 1922 the said partition was recorded and registered in the files of the tax authority on 17th August 1954. On 28-3-1959, the firm of M/s. Nathmal Tolaram was dissolved and a new firm Nathmal Tolaram (Petrol Depot) came into existence. In the assessment year 1959-60, Tolaram claimed that his share in this partnership business should be assessed separately as his individual income. His claim was rejected by the Income Tax Officer, but wag accepted in appeal. However a similar claim for the relevant assessment year 1960-61, to separate assessment of income derived from the partnership business in petrol amounting to Rs. 21,746/- , was rejected by the Income Tax Officer. On further appeals, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the Tribunal affirmed the order of the Income Tax Officer. The High Court also answered the reference in favour of Revenue.
 
HELD : Partition only cuts off the claim of the dividing coparceners. When a coparcener receives his share of the joint family property on a partition, such property in the hands of the coparcener belongs to the Hindu Undivided family as the share of the property is taken by him only as representing his branch. The status of such coparcener on partition is not that of an individual. [837 A-D] In the instant case, the share of Tolaram in the partnership which came into being on the partition of the Hindu Undivided Family could not be regarded as his separate property. It became the property of the Joint Hindu Family of Tolaram and his sons since the business prior to the partition of the Hindu Undivided family was assessed as joint family business and the partition deed signed by Tolaram and others itself contained a recital to that effect.
