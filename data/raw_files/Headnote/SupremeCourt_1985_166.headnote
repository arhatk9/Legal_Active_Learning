 The appellant, who was carrying on supply business of various items of ration including 'meat on hoof' to the Central Reserve Police units, was assessed to sales tax under s.19 of Assam Sales Tax Act, 1947 for the period ending 30th September 1965.
 He challenged before the High Court in a writ petition the order of assessment and the notice of demand dated 23rd May, 1969 on the grounds: (i) that 'meat on hoof' is a peculiar abbreviation used mainly by the Military which is nothing but a live goat and the sole purpose for which the 'meat on hoof' was supplied was for meat, and that it was a device to satisfy certain religious sentiments of the people in the Military that the aforesaid phrase had been used and since 'meat' is exempted from sales-tax as appearing at Serial No. 11 of Schedule III to the Act, the assessment order was unauthorised and invalid; (ii) that goods as defined in Section 2(4) did not include 'meat on hoof' which was nothing but live animal and the provisions of the said Act were not attracted to sale of animals, and (iii) that entry 48 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Government of India Act, 1935 under which the said Act was passed, the tax was on "sale of goods and on advertisements" and not on "animals". The High Court dismissed the petition on the ground that 'meat' at Serial No. 11 of Schedule III to the said Act could not be equated with 'meat on hoof' and it was not possible to interpret the exempted item in the Schedule with reference to what the parties understood at the time of the contract and since 'meat on hoof' was live animal, its sale is sale of goods under the said Act.
 386 Allowing the Appeal, ^ 
 HELD : 1. It is well-settled that in interpreting items in statutes like the Sales Tax Acts whose primary object is to raise revenue and for which purpose they classify diverse products, articles and substances, resort should be had not to the scientific and technical meaning of the terms or expressions used but to their popular meaning i.e. the meaning attached to them by those dealing in them.
 (emphasis supplied). If any term of expression has been defined in the enactment then it must be understood in the sense in which it is defined. But in the absence of any definition being given in the enactment, the meaning of the term in common parlance or commercial parlance has to be adopted. [390 D-F] In the instant case, 'meat on hoof' is not defined in the Act. Therefore, it must be understood in the context of the persons who were dealing in 'meat on hoof'. It has been found as a fact that the 'meat on hoof' was intended for supply of ration to the personnel of the Third Battalion of the M.S.R.P.F. What was intended to be bought was undoubtedly meat for ration and a reasonable explanation has been given as to why instead of near (flesh of the goat) 'meat on hoof' was asked to be supplied. Therefore the transaction that were between the parties were for the 'meat' in respect of which the levy of sales tax was sought to be imposed. That cannot be done. In that view of the matter, the High Court was in error in holding that the transactions in question were subject to sales tax. [390 E- F, 392 D-E, 391 E-F, 392 E] Indo International Industries v.
