 The respondent/accused was an Inspector in Regional Transport Office, Kolhapur. Under a search warrant his house was searched and a lot of property was recovered from his possession. While the matter was still under investigation, the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 was amended by inserting clause (e) in sub-section (1) of s. 5, The special Judge, Kolhapur, on 3rd April 1969, held the accused guilty of offences u/cl. (a), (b), (d) and (e) of sub. s. (1) of s. 5 of Prevention of Corruption Act 1947 and under s. 161 and 165 of IPC and sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment for 3 years and a fine of Rs. 20,000/-.
 The accused filed an appeal against his conviction and the High Court held that there was not even one witness who supported the prosecution case under s. 5(1)(a), (b), (d) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. The High Court also held that as there was nothing on the record to show that the accused wag in possession or came into possession of any pecuniary resources or property disproportionate to his known sources of income, after the enactment of clause (e) of sub-section (1) of s. 5 of the Act by the amending Act of 1964, his conviction under that clause was "illegal inasmuch as the said clause (e) could not be interpreted as to apply to the possession of the property and resources by the appellant before it was enacted." The accused was accordingly. acquitted by High Court.
 The Supreme Court granted special leave limited to the question whether the acquittal of the accused for the offence under s. 5(1)(e) of the Act was justified ? Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) Clause (e) of sub-section (1) of s. 5 came into existence on December 18, 1964 by the Amending Act of 1964.
 It added yet another clause to the four clauses which constituted the offence of criminal misconduct under sub- section (1) of s. 5. The result of the insertion was that mere possession of pecuniary resources or property disproportionate to be known sources of income of a public servant, for which he could not satisfactorily account, be- came an offence by itself. Such a possession was not, however, an offence by itself until December 18, 1964 although there was a third sub-section of S. 5 before that date which created a rebuttable presumption to prove offences under clause (a) to (d) of s. 5(1). [276 F,G, 277A- B] (2)The Legislature, it appears, thereafter, thought it proper to do away with the rule of evidence provided by sub- sec. (3) of s. 5 and inserted a new clause (e) in sub- section (1) of s. 5 as one more category of the offence of criminal misconduct. But it cannot be gainsaid that the new offence under the newly inserted clause (e) became an offence on and from December 18, 1964 by virtue, of s. 6 of Amending Act 40 of 1964. In this view of the matter, the High Court rightly held that "in the absence of any evidence on record to show that the appellant acquired or was found to be in possession of pecuniary resources etc. after the coming into force of the Amending Act' he was entitled to the protection of clause (1) of Article 20 of the Constitu- tion.
