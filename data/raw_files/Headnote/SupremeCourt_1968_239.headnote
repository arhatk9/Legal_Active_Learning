 The Respondent-assessee claimed in its assessment to tax for the assessment year 1970-71 that the amounts of deficiency under Sec. 801 for the current as well as past assessment years were liable to be adjusted against the profit of Rs. 1,51,011/- earned by its cold storage plant which was a new industrial undertaking to which sub-section (4) of Sec. 80J of the Income Tax Act applied. The assessee did not make any profit in the business of cold storage plant during the assessment years 1967-68, and 1968-69 and 1969-70, but there was profit in the other businesses and the losses, depreciation allowance and development rebate in respect of the cold storage plant were adjusted against the profit from the other businesses in computing the total income of the assessee chargeable to tax for those assessment years. The Income Tax officer and in appeal the Appellate Assistant Commissioner rejected the claim of the assessee for adjustment. But in further appeal the Tribunal held that since the losses as well as depreciation allowance and development rebate in respect of the cold storage business for the past assessment years were already adjusted against the profit from other businesses, no part of such losses, depreciation allowance or development rebate remained unabsorbed so as to be carried forward and set off against the profit for the assessment year 1970-71 and hence the profit of Rs. 1,51,011/- from the cold storage business was not liable to be reduced by any such set off and the assessee was entitled to claim that from out of such profit there should be deducted, first, the amount of Rs. 83,891/- representing the relevant amount of capital employed during the previous year and then the amounts of deficiency for the past assessment years. The High Court on a reference, at the instance of the Revenue answered the question in favour of the assessee.
 Dismissing the appeal by special leave the Court, ^ 
 HELD: (1) The proper construction of sub-section (1) of Sec. 80J must, be taken to be that the profits or gains of the new industrial undertaking must be computed in accordance with the provisions of the Act in the same manner as they would be in determining the total income chargeable to tax and it must follow a fortiori that if the losses, depreciation allowance and development rebate in respect of the new industrial undertaking for the past assessment years have been fully set off against the profit of the assessee from other business or for the matter of that, against the income of the assessee under any other head by reason of sections 70 and 71 read with sub-section (2) of Sec. 32 and sub-section (2) of Sec. 32A, no part. Of such losses, depreciation allowance or development rebate would be liable to be adjusted over again in computing the profits or gains of the new industrial undertaking for applying the provision contained in sub-section (1) of Sec. 80J. The same mode of computation must Prevail also in applying the provision contained in 1129 sub-section (3) of Sec. 80J, because that sub-section provides for setting off the carried-forward amount of deficiency of the past assessment years against "the profits and gains referred to in sub-section 1" or Sec. 80J, as computed after allowing inter alia the deduction admissible under sub-section and, therefore, if, for the purpose of sub-section ( I ) of Sec. 80J, the profits or gains of the new industrial undertaking are to be computed in accordance.. with the provision of the Act and no part of the losses, depreciation allowance or development rebate for the past assessment years which has been fully set off against the profit from other businesses or income under any other head is liable to be adjusted over again in computing the profits or gains of the awe industrial undertaking, no such adjustment would equally be permissible in applying the provision contained in sub-section of Section 80J.[1136 D-H, 1137-A] (2) It is clear from the language of sub-section (1) of Section 80J that the profits or gains of a new industrial undertaking from which deduction of the relevant amount of capital employed during a particular assessment year is allowable under. that provision, are the profits or gains includible in the computation of the total income chargeable to tax. Therefore, whatever- be the profits or gains of the new industrial undertaking computed for the purpose of arriving at the total income chargeable to tax, would have to be taken to be the profits or. gains for applying the provision contained in sub-section (I) of Section 80J. [1135 D-E] (3) There are no two modes of computation of the profits or gains of the new industrial undertaking contemplated by sub-section(1) of Sec. 80J, one for determining the total income chargeable to tax and the other for applying the provision contained in that sub-section.
 The language of sub-section of Section 80J is clear and explicit and leaves no doubt that the profits or gains of the new industrial undertaking for the purpose of allowing the deduction provided in that sub-section, have to be computed in the same manner in which they would be in determining the total income chargeable to tax and a deduction has then to be made from such profits or gains, of the relevant amount of. capital employed during the assessment year in question. It cannot be held by any process of construction, even by turning and twisting the language of sub-section ( I ) of Sec. 80J that for the purpose of allowing the deduction contemplated under that section the profits or gains of the new industrial undertaking must be computed in a manner different from that in which they would be computed in determining the total income chargeable to tax. Sub-section (1 ) of Section 80J does not create a legal fiction that for the purpose of applying the provision contained in that sub-section, the profits or- gains of the new industrial undertaking shall be computed as if the new industrial undertaking were the only business of the asseesee right from the date of its establishment or the losses, depreciation allowance or development rebate in respect of the new industrial undertaking for the past assessment years were not set off against the profit from other businesses. If the construction of sub-section (1) of Sec. 80J contended for and on behalf of the Revenue were accepted, it would lead to the absurd result that there would be two species of profits or gains of the new industrial undertaking, one for inclusion in the total income chargeable to tax and the other for determining the availability of the deduction under sub-section ( I ) of Section 80J. That would be plainly contrary to the express language of sub-section (I) of Section 80J. [1135 E-H,1136 A-D] 1130
