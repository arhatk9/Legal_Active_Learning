 In a suit for partition the first defendant (respondent in this Court) claim that the-disputed items of property exclusively belonged to him. The trial court as well as the High Court accepted his case on the basis of admission made by the first plaintiff and the eighth. defendant (father of the plaintiff) it depositions in an earlier suit as well as similar admissions made in the writer statement Wed in that suit by the eighth defendant together with the present plaintiffs, and held that the said property belonged to the first defendant.
 It was contended in this Court that (1) the courts below relied on the admissions of the plaintiffs and the eighth defendant which were not even suggested in the written statement and as such a new case which was at total variance from the pleadings should not have been considered by the court; ant. (2) these admissions were not put to the first plaintiff, when he was in the witness box; nor was the eighth defendant summoned for examination by the first defendant to give him an opportunity to explain the admissions.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : There is no doubt that if the depositions of the first plaintiff, the deposition by the eighth defendant and the written statement filed by these parties in the title suit were reliable, the plaintiffs case was damaged by their own admissions. [126B] (1) Although the first defendant's basic defence was a denial of joint family ownership even in the trial court the admissions had been considered and acted upon. Even in the High Court the appellants did not state that they had been prejudiced by the reliance on the admissions by the trial court nor did the appellants contend before the High Court of any prejudice by not being given an opportunity to explain the material against them. Neither in the memorandum of appeal appended to the application for a certificate nor in the statement of the case in this Court was a ground raised on this point. [126G-H] (2) It cannot be contended that because the disputed statements had not been put to the first plaintiff when he was in the witness box or to the eighth defendant they could not be used against him. [127A] There is a cardinal distinction between a party who is the author of a prior statement and a witness who is examined and is sought to be discredited by use of his prior statement. In the former case an admission by a party is substantive evidence if it fulfill the requirements of s. 21 of the Evidence Act; in the latter case a prior statement is used to discredit the credibility of the witness and does not become substantive evidence. In the former there is no necessary requirement of the statement containing the admission having to be put to the party because it is evidence proprio vigore; in the latter case the court cannot .be invited to disbelieve a witness on the strength of a prior contradictory statement unless it has been put to him, as required by s. 145 of the Evidence Act.
