 With regard to admission of students to the Engineering and Medical Colleges of the State, the Province of Madras had issued an order (known as the Communal G. O.) that seats should be filled in by the selection committee strictly on the following basis, i.e., out of every 14 seats, 6 were to be allotted to Non-Brahmin (Hindus), 2 to Backward Hindus, 2 to Brahmins, 2 to Harijans. 1 to Anglo-Indians and Indian Christians and 1 to Muslims:
 Held by the Full Court (Kania C.J., Fazl Ali, PatanJali Sastri, Mehr Chand Mahajan, Mukherjea, S.R. Das and Vivian Bose JJ.).--that the Communal G.O. constituted a violation of the fundamental right guaranteed to the citi- zens of India by Art. 29 (2) of the Constitution, namely, that "no citizen shall be denied admission to any education- al institution maintained by the State or receiving aid out of the State funds on grounds only of religion, race, caste, language or any of them and was therefore void under Art.
 13.
 The directive principles of State policy laid down in Part IV the Constitution cannot in any way override or abridge the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III. On the other hand they have to conform to and run as subsidiary to the fundamental rights laid down in Part III.
 Judgment of the Madras High Court affirmed.
