 The dispute between the parties regarding their shares in a firm was referred to arbitration. The arbitrator made his award, inter alia, awarding certain sums of moneys to be paid by certain instalments. There was also a provision in the award that the parties shall be liable to pay in equal shares the income-tax to be assessed.
 The award was filed in court by the arbitrator.
 The appellant made an application for setting aside the award and the respondents filed their replies to the application. Thereafter, the parties came to terms and asked for a decree to be passed in accordance therewith. The court passed a decree on the award as modified by the compromise.
 In execution, the appellant contended that the decree was a nullity as the court had no jurisdiction to modify the award by compromise.
 ^ Held, that the decree was not a nullity and was executable. In cases of compromise after an award, if the parties are dissatisfied with the award and wanted to substitute it by a compromise involving matters alien to the original dispute which are inseparable, the court may supersede the submission and leave the parties to work out their agreement in accordance with the law outside the Arbitration Act. In such circumstances the new compromise itself furnishes a very good ground for superseding the reference and thus revoking the award. Where the parties do not throw the award overboard but modify it in its operation, the award, in so far as it is not altered still remains operative and continuous to bind the parties and cannot be revoked. If the whole of the subject- 478 matter of the compromise is within the reference, the court may include in the operative part of the decree the award as modified. But if it is not so, the court may confine the operative part of the decree to the award as far as it is accepted and the other terms of the compromise, if severable and within the reference, in a schedule to the decree. The portion included in the operative portion would be executable but that included in the schedule would be enforceable as a contract of which the evidence could be the decree, but not enforceable as a decree. In the present case the compromise and the decree did not alter the amounts awarded to the respondents by the award, it only made adjustments after quantifying the amount of income-tax. The difference was as to the mode of payment by changing the number of instalments. This was a matter on which parties could agree and the court could substitute the agreement in the operative part of the decree.
