 The appellants, along with their brothers, were residing in an ancestral property. The eldest member of the family sold the property to the State Government as property belonging to him. After the sale, the State Government issued notice of eviction to the appellant under Section 4(1) of the Punjab Public Premises and Land (Eviction and Rent Recovery Act, 1959. The writ petition, challenging legality of the eviction order was rejected by the single Judge, and then on appeal by the Division Bench of the Punjab High Court.
 Before this Court the appellants contended that they were in possession under a legal title and that the impugned notice was issued without jurisdiction.
 
 HELD : The appellants were in possession of the property before the date of sale to the State Government, when it was not public preprocess. The word "thereof" in Sec. 3(1) makes it clear that the person must have entered into possession of public premises before or after the commencement of the Act in order that he may be deemed to be in unauthorised occupation. Unless the premises are public premises on the date of possession, Section 3(a) is not applicable., [170A-B] 
HELD, further, that Section 3(b) is attracted only where the person continues in possession after the cancellation or determination of allotment, lease or grant from Government.
 The appellants were not in unauthorised occupation of public premises and therefore the notice under Section 4(1) was issued without jurisdiction. [171A] Appeal allowed.
