 Section 4(3) of the Land Acquisition (Amendment and Validation) Act, 1967 provides that where acquisition of any particular land has been made under the Land Acquisition Act 1894, a simple interest at the rate of six per cent per annum on the market value of such land as determined under S. 23 of the Land Acquisition Act 1894 from the date of expiry of three years to the date of tender of payment of compensation, shall be paid and Section 23(1) of the Land Acquisition Act provides for the various factors to be considered by Court in determining the amount of compensation, such as, the market value of the land at the date of publication under S. 4 of the Act, the damage sustained by the person etc., and S. 23(2) provides that in addition, to the market value of the land, the Court shall award in every case, a sum of 15% on such market value for compulsory acquisition.
 On question whether interest was payable under S. 4(3) of the Amending Act, not only on the market value of the land as determined under s. 23(1); but also on the additional amount of 15% (solatium) payable on such market value under Sub. Section (2) of that Section,, 
HELD : (1) The additional amount of 15% certainly forms part of the amount of compensation because under S. 23, the compensation is to consist of what is provided for in Sub- section (1); plus the additional amount of 15% on the market value of the land acquired. But 'compensation' and 'market value' are distinct expressions and have been used as such in the Land Acquisition Act. The key to the meaning of the word "compensation" is to be found in S. 23(1) and it consists of the market value of the land and the sum of 15% of such market value, which is stated to be the consideration for the compulsory nature ,of the acquisition.
 Market value is, therefore, only one of the components in the determination of the amount of compensation. If the legislature has used the word "market value" in S. 4(3) of the Amending Act, it must be held that it was done deliberately and what was intended was that interest should be payable on the market value of the land and not on the amount of compensation., [725F] Raja Vyringharla Narayana Gajapatiraju v.
