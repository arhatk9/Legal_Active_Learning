 The Kerala Land Reforms Act 1 of 1964 was included in the Ninth Schedule and was protected by Art. 31-B of the Constitution. The Act was amended by the Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1969. The amending Act was not included in the Ninth Schedule and therefore it could claim protection only under Art. 31A. The validity of the amended Act was considered by the Kerala High Court in Narayan Nair v. State, (A.I.R., 1971 Kerala 98). The High Court, inter alia, held that the lands in question were 'estates' within the meaning of Art. 31A, and that the reference in s. 96 to reservation of acquired land for 'public purpose' must be read down to mean public purpose connected with agrarian reform, and so read the Act. as a whole was Protected by Art. 31A though portions failed for want of that protection.
 After this judgment the Kerala legislature by a further amendment added sub-s. (IA) to s. 96 and provided therein that "Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-s. (1) the Land Board may, if it considered that any land vested in the Government under section 86 and section 87 is required for any public purpose, reserve such land for such purpose".
 The present petitions challenging various provisions of the Act as amended were filed under Art. 32 of the Constitution.
 
HELD : (i) It was for the petitioners to establish that the lands held by them and mentioned in the petitions were not "estates' so that they could be out of the purview of the Act. it was all the more necessary for them to do so in view of the categorical findings of the Full Bench of the Kerala High Court in Paragraph 5 and 99 of the judgment is Narayan Nair's case. In the absence of material in the petitions to show Prima facie that the lands of the petitioners were not estates it could not be held that the petitioners were not affected by the Kerala Land Reforms Act of 1964 as amended in 1969. In any event, so far as the provisions of the 1964 Act are concerned the same could not be challenged under Art. 31 by reason of its inclusion in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. [426E-F] (ii) The reduction of the Ceiling limit by the Amending Act of 1969 does not attract the operation of the second proviso to Art. 31 A(1) [426G] The contention that reduction in the ceiling area fixed by the 1964 Act had to be compensated for by Payment of market value of the difference between the ceiling areas fixed by the two Acts could not be 400 accepted inasmuch, as the "ceiling limit applicable to him under any law for the time being in force in Art. 31 A' can refer only to the limit imposed by the law which fixes it and not any earlier law which is amended and repealed..
 [413G] It was open to the legislature to prescribe a ceiling for all I landholders whether they are incorporated or not, and merely because the 1964 Act did not touch these incorporated bodies, no objection can be taken to their being brought within. the fold by the Amending Act,. [413H-414B] (iii) Section 96(1A) is no doubt couched is too general and wide a language of including public purpose which would not be those failing within the 'expression 'agrarian reform'. The fact however that the legislature has once again used the same general language in spite of the interpretation given by the High Court in Narayan Nair's case need not lead us to strike down wholly the sub-section.
 In accordance with the well recognised canon of construction adopted in a number of cases decided by this Court the sub- section must be read down to mean only reservation of the land for such public purposes as would bring about agrarian reform inasmuch as any acquisition under Art. 31-A for any public purpose other than that falling under the expression "agrarian reform" cannot be considered as having the protection of that Article, [415H-416D] Ranjit Singh v. State of Punjab, [1964] INSC 178; [1965] 1 S.C.R. 82, referred to.
 The provision for settlement of tenants of kudikidippukars in small holdings would be covered by agrarian reform or purposes ancillary thereto. The problem of the kudkidppukars has always been intimately connected with agricultural 1-and and can Legitimately come within "agrarian reform". Historically they were allowed to come on to the land because of the needs of an agricultural population and any scheme which envisages the improvement of their lot and grant of permanent rights to them would not transgress the limits of agrarian reform. This principle however only relates to lands in- panchayat areas and kudikidappukars etc. on them. The provisions for purchase contained in s. 80A of the Act by kudikidappukaran of their kudikidappus for consideration less than the mark' value of the land when the same was below the ceiling area fixed tinder the Act and within the area of the personal cultivation of the landlord would be hit by the second proviso to Art. 31-A of. the Constitution.

 (iv) Lands which are interspersed between sites of commercial under takings and house-sites in municipalities with land-, surrounding them are not agricultural lands fit for acquisition under the Act. [427D] (v) The provisions of the Act withdrawing protecton to pepper and area plantation could not be challenged under Art. 14 if the lands were estates within the meaning of Art.
 3 IA(2) (a). [426H] (vi) The Act was not discriminatory with regard to cashew and cocoanut gardens.. [426H] (vii) The withdrawal of exemption from lands continuous to rubber plantations by the Amending Act of 1964 could not be challenged. [427A] However important it may be for the owner of the rubber plantation to have or hold lands in the immediate vicinity of the plantation for its 401 expansion it. cannot be said that the Rubber, Act gave the Union Legislature any power to direct a rubber manufacturer to increase his production by bringing any additional land under rubber plants. All that s. 17 of the Act aims at is to make it obligatory on the owner of an estate to secure a licence if he wants to plant rubber on land which does not bear it or replant rubber in the portions of the land which are under it. Further although it was the function of the Rubber Board under s. 8 to take measures for the development of the rubber industry, it did not appear that the expansion of a rubber plantation or guidance in that direction by the Board was contemplated under the section.

 (vii) Forest lands and jungles would be exempt from the operation of the Act. A jungle unless it is included within an estate consisting inter alia of lands held for agricultural purposes cannot be acquired so as to have the protection of Art. 31A : if the holding or tenure in which the jungle lies consists oily of jungle it cannot be so acquired. The same private forests are specially exempted from acquisition under the Act.[426B-C] (ix) Lands under eucalyptus or teak which are the result of agricultural operations normally would be agricultural 'lands and therefore would be exempt under the provisions of the Act. However lands which are covered by eucalyptus or teak growing spontaneously as in a jungle or a forest would be outside the purview of acquisition [426 D]
