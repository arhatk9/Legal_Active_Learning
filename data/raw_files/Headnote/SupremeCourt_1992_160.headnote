 The validity of Section 25-N in Chapter V-B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, inserted by the Amendment Act, 1976, prescribing conditions precedent for retrenchment of workmen in an industrial establishment, was challenged before various High Courts. There was difference of opinion 410 amongst the High Courts. While one High Court upheld the validity of the Section, two other High Courts held the Section to be violative of the right guaranteed under Article 19(1) (g) of the Constitution imposing unreasonable restrictions on the right of the employer to retrench workmen, and invalid. The correctness of the decisions of these two High Court was challenged in the appeals and Writ Petitions filed before this Court.
 On behalf of the workmen, it was contended that the right to retrench the workmen could only be regarded as a peripheral or concomitant right which facilitated the exercise of the right to carry on business but it could not be trated as an integral part of the right to carry on businss; that the employers in the instant cases were all companies registered under the Companies Act, 1956; and a company, being an artificial person, was not a citizen and it could not claim the fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens under Article 19 of the Constitution; that the shareholder of a limited company could not be permitted to challenge the validity of Section 25-N inasmuch as by the said provision none of the fundamental rights of the shareholder is impaired; that in a modern public company, the shareholder, although a member, was in economic reality, a mere lender of capital on which he hoped for return but without any effective control over the borrower; that while considering the matter of grant or refusal of permission for retrenchment the appropriate Government or authority was required to exercise its power in a quasi-judicial manner, i.e., it must pass the order after affording an opportunity to both the parties, (the employer and the workmen) to make their submissions; that reference of a dispute for adjudication to the Industrial Tribunal depended on the discretion of the appropriate Government and there was no right as such to approach the Industrial Tribunal; that the power that was exercised by the appropriate Government or authority under sub-section (2) of section 25-N was similar to that exercised by the various authorities under section 33 of the Act while giving approval to the action taken by the management in discharging or punishing a workman whether by dismissal or otherwise or altering the conditions of service of the workman, that in cases where such approval was given to the action of the management, it was open to the workmen to raise a dispute and have it referred for adjudication under section 10 of the Act but no similar right was available to the management.
 On behalf of the employers it was submitted that the right of the employer to carry on any business guaranteed under Article 19(1)(g) included the right to organise the business in a way that it was most 411 beneficial for him and, if necessary, this may be achieved by limiting the labour force employed in the establishment and, therefore, the right to retrench workmen was an integral part of the right to carry on the business, and stood on a higher footing than the right to close the business because in the case of retrenchment, the business was continuing and only a part of labour force was dispensed with; that the appropriate Government or authority, while exercising power to grant or refuse permission to retrench under sub-section (2) of Section 25-N acted purely in an administrative capacity; that while passing an order under sub-section (2), the appropriate Government or authority could either grant or refuse permission for the proposed retrenchment in its entirety and that it was not permissible for it to grant permission for retrenchment of some out of the workmen proposed to be retrenched and refuse such permission in respect of the rest; that since no indication about the factors which were to be taken into consideration by the appropriate Government or authority while exercising its power was given in sub-section (2), it should be held that Parliament did not intend to alter the existing law governing retrenchment and the principles of industrial law that were applied by Industrial Tribunals for examining the validity of retrenchment under Section 25-F would also be applicable in the matter of exercise of power under sub- section (2) of section 25-N and that the principle of statutory construction was that the legislature should not be considered to make radical changes in law without using explicit language which unmistakably pointed in that direction; that in sub-section (7) of section 25-N, an indication had been given by the legislature about the factors which may be taken into consideration by the appropriate Government or authority while exercising its power under sub-section (2), that the two circumstances referred to in sub-section (7), viz., retrenchment being by way of victimization or the retrenchment not being in the interest of maintenance of industrial peace, could be treated as the factors which were required to be taken into account by the appropriate Government or authority while exercising its power under sub-section (2); that if the appropriate Government or authority, while passing the order under sub-section (2) was held to be exercising functions which were judicial in nature, then it must be held to be functioning as a tribunal for the purpose of Article 136 of the Constitution and an appeal would lie to this Court against such an order; that prior to the enactment of s.25- N, the validity of retrenchment in all industrial establishments, big or small, was required to be judicially determined by 412 industrial tribunals/labour courts by following the normal judicial procedure and as a result of the enactment of S.25- N retrenchment of workmen in industrial establishments to which the said provisions were applicable would be examined by the appropriate Government or the authority specified by the appropriate Government and the said authority could be any officer who need not be trained in law; that S.25-N did not give any indication about the status and qualifications of the officer who would be entrusted with the power to grant or refuse permission for retrenchment of workmen under sub-section (2) and it was left to the unguided discretion of the appropriate Government to nominate any officer as the authority entitled to exercise this power; that sub-section (2) of section 25-N did not prescribe any guidelines or principles to govern the exercise of the power that had been conferred on the appropriate government or the authority in the matter of grant or refusal of permission for retrenchment and in the absence of such guidelines or principles, it would be open to the appropriate Government or authority to take into account matters having no bearing or relevance to the legitimate need of the employer to reorganise his business and which might even be opposed to such need and that it would be permissible to pass the order by taking into consideration the state of unemployment in the State; that the requirement that reasons should be recorded in the order that was passed by the appropriate Government or authority would not provide any protection against arbitrary action because in the absence of principles governing the exercise of the power, there was no touchstone to assess the validity of those reasons; that the considerations referred to in sub-section (3) of Section 25- N, as substituted by Amending Act 49 of 1984, were declaratory in character and the same were also required to be taken into consideration in the matter of exercise of power by the appropriate Government or the authority under sub-section (2) of Section 25-N as originally enacted, that the "interest of the workmen and all other relevant factors" would result in introducing impermissible elements in the matter of exercise of the power to grant or refuse permission for retrenchment inasmuch as the order for grant or refusal of permission for retrenchment was only to be based on the relevant circumstances, namely, that the action of the employer was bona fide and was not actuated by victimisation or unfair labour practice, and that the retrenchment would always be prejudicial to the "interests of the workmen" and if the interests of workmen were to be taken into consideration, permission for retrenchment would never be 413 granted; that no provisions had been made for an appeal or revision against the order passed by the appropriate Government or authority granting or refusing permission for retrenchment of workmen under sub-section (2) of section 25- N, nor was there any provision for review, that the remedy of judicial review under Article 226 of the Constitution was not an adequate remedy inasmuch as the scope of judicial review under Article 226 of the Constitution was very limited and did not enable challenge on the ground of an error of fact in the order; that the permission for retrenchment of workmen may be refused by the appropriate Government or authority under sub-section (2) of section 25- N on policy considerations and in that event relief under Article 226 of the Constitution may not be available, and that the provisions were ex-facie arbitrary and discriminatory inasmuch as while the workmen had a right to challenge on facts, the correctness of an order passed under sub-section (2) granting permission for retrenchment before the Industrial Tribunal by seeking a reference under Section 10 of the Act, the management did not have a similar right to challenge the validity of an order passed under sub- section (2) refusing or granting permission for retrenchment.
 Upholding the validity of Section 25-N of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, as it stood prior to its amendment by Amendment Act of 1984, and directing the matters to be placed before a Division Bench for disposal, this Court, 
 HELD : 1. Section 25-N of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, did not suffer from the vice of unconstitutionality on the ground that it was violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution and was not saved by Article 19(6) of the Constitution. [464 E] Excel Wear etc. v. Union of India and Ors., [1978] INSC 192; [1979] 1 SCR 1009 distinguished.
 I.D.L. Chemicals Ltd. v. T. Gattiah & Ors., D.B. Writ Appeal 16 of 1981, approved.

 2.1 The object underlying the enactment of section 25- N, by introducing prior scrutiny of the reasons for retrenchment is to prevent avoidable 414 hardship to the employees resulting from retrenchment by protecting existing employment and check the growth of unemployment which would otherwise be the consequence of retrenchment in industrial etablishments employing large number of workmen. It is also intended to maintain higher tempo of production and productivity by preserving industrial peace and harmony. In that sense, Section 25-N seeks to give effect to the mandate contained in the Directive Principles of the Constitution. The restrictions imposed by Section 25-N on the right of the employer to retrench the workmen must, therefore, be regarded as having been imposed in the interest of general public. [440 G, 441 A-B] 2.2. Ordinarily any restriction so imposed which has the effect of promoting or effectuating a directive principle can be presumed to be a reasonable restriction in public interest. A restriction imposed on the employer's right to terminate the service of an employee is not alien to the Constitutional scheme which indicates that the employer's right is not absolute.

Board of Regents of New York, [1954] USSC 38; 347 US 442 and The National Commission on Labour, report submitted in 1969, referred to.
 
 2.3 The appropriate Government or authority, before passing an order granting or refusing permission for retrenchment, is required to make an enquiry, though the precise nature of the enquiry that is to be made is left in the discretion of the appropriate Government or authority, and further that the order that is passed by the appropriate Government or authority must be a speaking order containing reasons. The requirement to make an enquiry postulates and enquiry into the correctness of the facts stated by the employer in the notice served under clause (c) of sub- section (1) of section 25-N for retrenchment of the workmen and other relevant facts and circumstances including the employer's bona fides in making such retrenchment and such an enquiry involving ascertainment or relevant facts will necessarily require affording an opportunity to the parties viz., the employer and the workmen, who have an interest in the matter, to make their submissions. [442 G-H, 443 A-B] 
 2.4 Sub-rule (1) of Rule 76-A of the Industrial Disputes (Central) Rules, 1957 framed by the Central Government under the Act, requires 415 that the notice required to be given under clause (c) of sub-section (1) of section 25-N shall be served in Form P-A.
 Sub-rule (3) requires that the copy of the said notice or the application shall be served by the employer on the workmen concerned and a proof to that effect shall be submitted by the employer along with the notice or, as the case may be, the application. Sub-rule (4) lays down that the employer concerned shall furnish to the Central Government or the authority to whom the notice for retrenchment has been given or the application for permission for retrenchment has been made, such further information as the Central Government or, as the case may be, the authority considers necessary for arriving at a decision on the notice or, as the case may be, the application, as and when called for by such authority. Form P-A prescribes the various particulars in respect of which information has to be furnished by the employer in the notice served under clause (c) of sub-section (1) of Section 25-N. Thus, the employer is required to furnish detailed information in respect of the working of the industrial undertaking so as to enable the appropriate Government or authority to make up its mind whether to grant or refuse permission for retrenchment. Before passing such order, the appropriate Government or authority will have to ascertain whether the said information furnished by the employer is correct and the proposed action involving retrenchment of workmen is necessary and if so, to what extent and for that purpose it would be necessary for the appropriate Government or authority to make an enquiry after affording an opportunity to the employer as well as the workmen to represent their case and make a speaking order containing reasons. This necessarily envisages exercise of functions which are not purely administrative in character and are quasijudicial in nature. [443 C-E, 444 E-F] 
 2.5 The words "as such government or authority thinks fit" do not mean that the government or authority may dispense with the enquiry at its discretion. These words only mean that the government or authority has the discretion about the nature of enquiry which it may make.
 Therefore, while exercising its powers under sub-section (2) of section 25-N in the matter of granting or refusing permission for retrenchment, the appropriate government or the authority does not exercise powers which are purely administrative but exercises powers which are quasi-judicial in nature. [444 G-H, 445 A] 
 2.6 No words of limitation are found in sub-section (2) of Section 416 25-N which preclude the appropriate government or authority to grant partial permission in respect of some of the workmen out of the workmen proposed to be retrenched and refuse the same in respect of the rest keeping in view the particular facts in relation to a particular establishment.
 Nor is there anything in sub-section (2) which requires the appropriate Government or authority to either grant permission for retrenchment of the entire lot of the workmen proposed to be retrenched or refuse to grant permission in respect of the entire lot of workmen. It may be that the appropriate Government or authority may feel that the demand of the management for the proposed retrenchment is pitched too high and that in view of the facts and circumstances revealed as a result of an enquiry it is found that the industrial establishment can be efficiently run after retrenching a few of the workmen proposed to be retrenched.
 In that event, it would be permissible for the appropriate Government or authority to grant permission for retrenchment of only some of the workmen proposed to be retrenched and to refuse such permission for the rest of the workmen.[445 C-E] 
 3.1 Retrenchment, as defined in section 2(00), means termination by the employer of the service of a workman for any reason whatsoever otherwise than as a punishment inflicted by way of disciplinary action and those expressly excluded by clauses (a), (b) and (c) of the definition.
 Therefore, it cannot be said that retrenchment means termination by the employer of the service of a workman as surplus labour. [447 B] D. Macropollo & Co. (Pvt.) Ltd. v.

 3.2.In enacting Chapter V-B, the intention of Parliament was to alter the existing law relating to lay-off, retrenchment and closure in relation to larger industrial establishments falling within the ambit of Chapter V-B because it was felt that the existing law enabled large scale lay-offs, retrenchment and closures by large companies and undertakings and this had resulted in all-round demoralising effect on workmen. Therefore, it cannot be accepted that in enacting Section 25-N, Parliament did not intend to alter the existing industrial law governing retrenchment of workmen. [447 E-F] 
 4. Sub-section (2) deals with a stage prior to retrenchment whereas sub-section (7) deals with a stage after retrenchment. Sub-section (7) seeks to provide for disposal of industrial disputes arising due to retrenchment of workmen where either of the two conditions laid down in sub-section (7) is satisfied and which were pending at pre- reference stage on the date of commencement of the 1976 Act, by an authority specified by the appropriate Government instead of an Industrial Tribunal. Industrial disputes which do not fulfill either of these two conditions will have to be adjudicated by the Industrial Tribunal after reference. The two conditions laid down in sub-section (7) which govern the withdrawal of the disputes pending at pre- reference stage and transfer for adjudication to the specified authority, cannot be equated with the considerations which should weigh with the appropriate Government or authority while exercising its power to grant or refuse permission for retrenchment of workmen under sub- section (2). [448 D-F] 
 5. Although the appropriate Government or authority was required to act judicially while granting or refusing permission for retrenchment of workmen under sub-section (2) of Section 25-N, it is not vested with the judicial power of the State and it cannot be regarded as a Tribunal within the meaning of Article 136 of the Constitution and no appeal would, therefore, lie to the Supreme Court against an order passed under sub-section (2) of Section 25-N. [449 G, 450 A] Associated Cement Companies Ltd. v. P.N. Sharma & Anr., [1964] INSC 286; [1965] 2 SCR 366 and Jaswant Sugar Mills Ltd. v.
 Lakshmichand, [1963] Supp. 1 418 SCR 242, referred to.
 
 6.1 The power to grant or refuse permission for retrenchment of workmen that has been conferred under sub- section (2) has to be exercised on an objective consideration of the relevant facts after affording an opportunity to the parties having an interest in the matter and reasons have to be recorded in the order that is passed.
 Rule 76-A of the Industrial Disputes (Central) Rules and From P-A prescribed under the said rules for the notice to be served under Claus (c) of sub-section (1) of Section 25- N, and the particulars which are required to be supplied by the employer under the various heads in the said notice.
 The enquiry, which has to be made under sub-section (2) before an order granting or refusing permission for retrenchment of workmen is passed, would require an examination of the said particulars and other material that is furnished by the employer as well as the workmen. In view of the time limit of three months prescribed in sub- section (3) there is need for expeditious disposal which may not be feasible if the proceedings are conducted before a judicial officer accustomed to the judicial process.
 Moreover, during the course of such consideration it may become necessary to explore the steps that may have to be taken to remove the causes necessitating the proposed retrenchment which may involve interaction between the various departments of the Government. This can be better appreciated and achieved by an executive officer rather than a judicial officer. The discretion conferred on the appropriate Government to specify the authority which may exercise the power under sub-section (2) is given to the Government itself and not to a subordinate officer. [451 E- H, 452 A, C] 
 6.2 Keeping in view the fact that the power to specify the authority which can exercise the power conferred under sub-section (2) of Section 25-N has been conferred on the appropriate Government, it cannot be held that the delegation of the power to the appropriate Government to specify the authority renders the provisions of Section 25-N as arbitrary or unreasonable. [453 B] Virendra v. State of Punjab & Anr., [1957] INSC 63; [1958] SCR 308 and Dawarka Prasad Laxmi Narian v. The State of Uttar Pradesh, [1983] INSC 175; [1984] SCR 803, referred to.
 7.1. The power is not purely administrative in character but partakes exercise of a function which is judicial in nature. The exercise of the said 419 power envisages passing of a speaking order on an objective consideration of relevant facts after affording an opportunity to the concerned Parties Principles or guidelines are insisted with a view to control the exercise of discretion conferred by the statute. There is need for such principles or guidelines when the discretionary power is purely administrative in character to be exercised on the subjective opinion of the authority. The same is, however, not true when the power is required to be exercised on objective considerations by a speaking order after affording the parties an opportunity to put forward their respective points of view. That apart, it cannot be said that no guidance is given in the Act in the matter of exercise of the power conferred by sub-section (2) of Section 25-N.
 [453 G, 454 A] 
 7.2 The power conferred under sub-section (2) of section 25-N has to be exercised keeping in view the provisions of the Act and the object underlying the 1976 Act whereby section 25-N was inserted in the Act. The basic idea underlying all the Provision of the Act is the settlement of industrial disputes and the promotion of industrial peace so that the production may not be interrupted and the community in general may be benefited.
 The object underlying the requirement of prior permission for retrenchment introduced by section 25-N as indicated in the Statement of Objects and Reasons for the 1976 Act, is to prevent avoidable hardship of unemployment to those already employed and maintain higher tempo of production and productivity. The said considerations coupled with the basic idea underlying the provisions of the Act, viz., settlement of industrial disputes and promotion of industrial peace, give a sufficient indication of the factors which have to be borne in mind by the appropriate Government or authority while exercising its power to grant or refuse permission for retrenchment under sub-section (2).

 8.1 It is not correct to say that retrenchment would always be prejudicial to the "interests of the workmen" and if the interests of workmen were to be taken into consideration permission for retrenchment would never be granted. Assuming that the factors mentioned in sub-section (3) of Section 25-N, as substituted by Amending Act 49 of 1984, are declaratory in nature and are required to be taken into consideration by the appropriate Government or the authority while passing an order under 420 sub-section (2) of section 25-N, as orginally enacted, it cannot be said that the interests of the workmen is not a relevant factor for exercising the said power. [455 C-D] Prof. Gower: Principles of Modern company Law 4th Edn.
 p.10., referred to.
 
 8.2 The Indian Constitution recognises the role of workers in the management of the industries inasmuch as Article 43A requires that the State shall take steps by suitable legislation or in any other way to secure the participation of workers in the management of undertakings, establishments or other organisations engaged in any industry. [455 F] 
 8.3 The expression `interests of workers', covers the interests of all the workers employed in the establishment, including not only the workers who are proposed to be retrenched but also the workers who are to be retained. It would be in the interests of the workers as a whole that the industrial establishment in which they are employed continues to run in good health because sickness leading to closure of the establishment would result in unemployment for all of them. It is, therefore, not correct to say that the interests of workmen would always be adverse to the interests of the industrial establishment and no order granting permission for the retrenchment would be passed if the interests of the workers is to be taken into consideration. Since retrenchment of a large number of workmen would lead to worsening of the unemployment situation it cannot be said that the condition of unemployment in the particular industry or the condition of unemployment in the particular State have no relevance to the exercise of the power to grant or refuse permission for retrenchment of workmen under sub-section (2) of Section 25- N. These factors cannot be treated as alien to the factors which are required to be considered for exercising the said power. It is, therefore, not correct to say that sub- section (2) of Section 25-N by enabling the appropriate Government or authority to take into consideration the condition of employment in the industry or the condition of employment in the State imposes an unreasonable restriction on the right of the employer under Article 19(1)(g).

 8.4 It is also not correct to say that the requirement of passing a speaking order containing reasons as laid down in sub-section(2) of Section 421 25-N does not provide sufficient safeguard against arbitrary action. Irrespective of the fact whether the decision is subject to appeal, revision or judicial review, the recording of reasons by an administrative authority by itself, serves a salutarty purpose, viz., it excludes chances of arbitrariness and ensures a degree of fairness in the process of decision-making.

 9.1 The order under sub-section (2) granting or refusing permission for retrenchment is to be passed either by the appropriate Government or authority specified by the appropriate Government, and the said order is required to be a speaking order based on objective consideration of relevant facts after following the principles of natural justice. In the circumstances the absence of a provision for appeal or revision is not of much consequence, especially when it is open to an aggrieved party to invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constittution.

 9.2 The remedy of judicial review under Article 226 is an adequate protection against arbitrary action in the matter of exercise of power by the appropriate Government or authority under sub-section (2) of Section 25-N of the Act.

 10. In order to validly retrench the workmen under Section 25-N, apart from obtaining permission for such retrenchment under sub-section (2), an employer has also to fulfil other requirements, namely, to give three months, notice or pay wages in lieu of notice to the workmen proposed to 422 be retrenched under clause (a) of sub-section (1), pay retrenchment compensation to them under clause (b) of sub- section (1) and to comply with the requirement of section 25-G, which is applicable to retrenchment under section 25-N in view of section 25-S. An industrial dispute may arise on account of failure on the part of the employer to comply with these condition and the same can be referred for adjudication under section 10. In addition, an industrial dispute could also be raised by the workmen in a case where retrenchment has been effected on the basis of permission deemed to have been granted under sub-section (3) of section 25-N on account of failure on the part of the appropriate Government or authority to communicate the order granting or refusing permission for retrenchment within a period of three months from the date of the service of notice under clause (c) of sub-section (1) because in such a case, there has been no consideration, on merits, of the reasons for proposed retrenchment by the appropriate Government or authority and reference of the dispute for adjudication would not be precluded. [462 G-H, 463 A-C] 
 10.2 Since there is no provision similar to that contained in sub-section (7) of section 25-N attaching finality to an order passed under sub-section (2) it would be permissible for the workmen aggrieved by retrenchment effected in pursuance of an order granting permission for such retrenchment to raise an industrial dispute claiming that the retrenchment was not justified and it would be permissible for the appropriate Government to refer such dispute for adjudication though the likelihood of such a dispute being referred for adjudication would be extremely remote since the order granting permission for retrenchment would have been passed either by the appropriate Government or authority specified by the appropriate Government and reference under s.10 of the Act is also to be made by the appropriate Government. Since the expression "industrial dispute" as defined in section 2(k) of the Act covers a dispute connected with non-employment of any person and section 10 of the Act empowers the appropriate government to make a reference in a case where an industrial dispute is apprehended, an employer proposing retrenchment of workmen, who feels aggrieved by an order rfusing permission for retrenchment under sub-section (2) of Section 25-N, can also move for reference of such a dispute relating to proposed retrenchment for adjudication under Section 10 of the Act though the possibility of such a reference would be equally remote. The employer who feels aggrieved by an order refusing permission for retrenchment thus stands on the same 423 footing as the workmen feeling aggrieved by an order granting permission for retrenchment under sub-section (2) of Section 25-N inasmuch as it is permissible for both to raise an industrial dispute which may be referred for adjudication by the appropriate Government and it cannot be said that, as compared to the workmen, the employer suffers from a disadvantage in the matter of raising an industrial dispute and having it referred for adjudication.

 11. In view of the fact that some of the grounds for challenging the validity of Section 25-N on the ground of violation of Article 19 can also be made the basis for challenging the ground of violation of Article 14, it is not necessary to go into the question whether the right to retrench the workmen is an integral part of the right of the employer to carry on the business or it is only a peripheral or concomitant right which facilitates the exercise of the said fundamental right to carry on the business and it can be assumed that the right to retrench the workman is an integral part of the fundamental right of the employer to carry on the business under Article 19(1)(g). For the same reason, challenge to the validity of Section 25-N could not be ruled out on the ground that a company, incorporated under the Companies Act, being not a citizen, cannot invoke the fundamental right under Article 19 and the shareholders of the companies seeking to challenge the validity of Section 25-N in the instant cases cannot complain of infringement of their fundamental right under Article 19.
