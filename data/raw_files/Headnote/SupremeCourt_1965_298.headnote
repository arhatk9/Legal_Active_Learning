 For the assessment year 1957-58, the appellant-company was assessed to agricultural income-tax under the Kerala Agricultural Income-tax Act,. 1950 and a surcharge was also levied and collected from the appellant under the provisions of the Kerala surcharge on Taxes Act, 1957. The appellant appealed to the Deputy Commissioner, objecting to the imposition of surcharge on the ground that the law applicable to the assessment for 1957-58, under the provisions of the Agricultural Income-tax Act,. was the law in force on 1st April 1957, and as the Surcharge Act came into force only from 1st September 1957 and did not have retrospective effect, the surcharge could not be levied for that year. The Deputy Commissioner rejected the objections but the Appellate Tribunal' on further appeal upheld the contention. The High Court. on a reference,. held against the appellant.
