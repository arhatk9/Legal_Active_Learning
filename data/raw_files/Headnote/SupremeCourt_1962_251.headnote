 The petitioners carried on business as manufacturers of medicinal preparations according to Ayurvedic system and as such manufactured Mritasanjibani, Mritasanjibani Sudha and Mritasanjibani Sura by the process of distillation in accordance with the Ayurvedic formula stated in such ancient Ayurvedic treatises as Ayurvedic Sangraba, Bhaisajya Ratna- bali and Arka Prakash, accepted as embodying the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia all over India. When the Parliament passed the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations (Excise Duties) Act, 1955, these three Ayurvedic preparations were taxed at the rate of Rs. 17/8/- as prescribed by item I of the Schedule to the Rules framed under s. 18(2) of the Act as being medicinal preparations as defined by s. 2(g) of the Act.
 Later on, the Rules were amended and the three preparations omitted from the schedule to the rules and the various State Governments began demanding duties of excise on these preparations at much higher rates under the various State Excise Acts. The case of the petitioners was that the levy of Excise duties on these preparations fell within item 84 of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and it was not open to the State Governments to levy Excise duties under the State Acts, that since these preparations were medicinal preparations as defined by s.2(g) of the Act, their omission from the Schedule was of no effect and could not empower the State Governments to levy Excise duties and that the Central Government had no power to exclude the said preparations on the advice of the Standing Committee constituted under r. 68 of the Rules. The petitioners relied on a large number of affidavits from qualified Ayurvedic 958 practitioners to the effect that these preparations were Ayurvedic medicines. This was denied by the respondents who relied on the report of the Standing Committee that these preparation were mere beverages and not medicinal preparations. No affidavit of any Ayurvedic expert was, however, filed by them.
 Held, that there could be no doubt that these preparations according to standard Ayurvedic texts were clearly "medicinal preparations" within the meaning of s.2(g) of the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations (Excise Duties) Act, 1955, though they could also be used as ordinary alcoholic beverages. They were, therefore, liable to duty under item I of the Schedule to that Act and no Excise Duty could be levied on them under the Excise Acts of the States.
 The decision of the Standing Committee could not be conclusive on the question whether these preparations were medicinal preparations and their omission from the list attached to the Rules on its report could be of no effect.
 Held, further, that it could not be correct to say that even if these preparations were "medicinal preparations" they would be liable to Excise duty both under the Act and the various Excise Acts of the States.
 With the passing of the said Act, the saving made by ,Art.
 277 of the Constitution in favour of the States came to an end and the result was it at the State Governments were no longer entitled lo levy any duty on medicinal and toilet preparations and, further, s.21 of the Act effected a repeal of such provisions of the State Excise Acts as related to medicinal and toilet preparations.
