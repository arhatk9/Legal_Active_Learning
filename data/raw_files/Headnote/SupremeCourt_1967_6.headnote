 The first respondent instituted a complaint before the Magistrate of certain offences under the Penal Code and the Magistrate, after holding a preliminary enquiry, issued summons to the second respondent and another accused.
 The Prosecuting Deputy Superintendent of Police, in his capacity as Public Prosecutor for the District, filed an.
 application before Trial Magistrate under s. 494 Cr.P.C. for permission to withdraw from the prosecution of the case and for discharging the second respondent on the ground that it had come to his knowledge during an investigation of an earlier complaint that the second respondent was innocent and that he had been falsely involved in the case by the complainant. This application was opposed by the first respondent, but the trial Magistrate granted permission for the withdrawal of the case and the Sessions Judge, in revision, upheld this decision.
 However, the High Court, in appeal, accepted the contentions of the first respondent and held that a Public Prosecutor cannot withdraw under s. 494 of the Code from the prosecution of a case pending before the Magistrate, instituted upon a private complaint despite the complainant's objection to the withdrawal of the case.
 On a further appeal to this Court, 
HELD: As the prosecution was being conducted by the complainant, the High Court was right in holding that the Public Prosecutor was not entitled to file an application for withdrawal. [360 E] The reasonable interpretation to be placed upon s. 494 is that it is only the Public Prosecutor who is in charge of a particular case and is actually conducting the prosecution that can file an application under that section seeking permission to withdraw from the prosecution. [360 C-D] There was no force in the contention that the expression 'the Public Prosecutor in s. 494 is to be understood as referring to any person who is a Public Prosecutor, whether he is a Public Prosecutor appointed gene under s. 492(1) or for the purpose of a particular case, as contemplated under s. 492(2) of the Code. If any Public Prosecutor, who had nothing to do with a particular case, is held entitled to file an application under s. 494 the result will be very anomalous in that if there are two Public Prosecutors appointed for a particular Court, and one of the Public Prosecutors is conducting the prosecution in a particular case, and desires to go on with the proceedings,it will be open to the other Public Prosecutor to ask for withdrawal from the prosecution.
