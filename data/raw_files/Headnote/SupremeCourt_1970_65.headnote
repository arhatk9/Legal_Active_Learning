 V the son of the mortgagor executed a power of attorney in California (U.S.A.) authorising S to sell the property and to execute the sale deed and present it for registration. S executed the sale deed in favour of the respondents, who applied for the redemption of the mortgage under s. 9 of the Punjab Redemption of Mortgages Act, 1913. The Collector ordered the redemption. The appellants-the sons of the mortgagees filed a suit suit under s. 12 of the Act praying for a declaration that the -respondents were neither owners nor they had any right of redemption, as per the orders of the Collector which was illegal and the appellants were not bound by it. V was not party to this suit. During the pendency of the suit V executed a fresh power of attorney in California in favour of S, stating that first one was defective and was being ratified and further that the act of S will be that of V, which included not only the making of the document but also the presentations. The second power of attorney was produced in the suit, and the suit was dismissed. Appeal in the District Court and a second appeal filed in the High Court failed. Dismissing the appeal, this Court, 
HELD : The first power of attorney was not authenticated as required by s; 33 of the Indian Registration Act which in the case of an Indian residing abroad,requires that the document should be authenticated by a Notary Public. The document only bore the signature of a witness without anythingto show that he was a Notary Public. In any event there was no authentication by the Notary Public (if he was one) in the manner which the law would consider adequate.
 The second power of attorney however did show that it was executed before a proper Notary Public who complied with the laws of California and authenticated the document as required by that law, and was also duly authenticated in accordance with our laws. The only complaint was that the Notary Public did not say in his endorsement that V had been identified to his satisfaction. But that flows from the fact that he endorsed on the document that it had been subscribed and sworn before him. There is a presumption of regularity of official acts and he must have satisfied himself in the discharge of his duties that the person who was executing it was the proper person. This made the second power of attorney valid and effective both under s.
 85 of the Indian Evidence Act and s. 33 of the Indian Registration Act. [42 G-43 C] The second power of attorney was a valid document and it authorised S to execute the document as well as to present it for registration. This being a document ratifying a former inconclusive act related back 39 to the time when the first document was made and cured the illegality in the presentation for registration which had taken place.
 Now the law is quite clear that ratification relates back to the original act provided there is a disclosed principal.
 [43 E-F] Keighly Maxsted & Co. v. Durant; [1901] A.C. 241 and Wilson v. Tumman, 1843 6 M & G 242, relied on.
 Kottie Keran & Ors. v. Lachmi Prasad Sinha & Ors. 58 I.A.
 58, held inapplicable.
 The appellants were not entitled to the declaration prayed for. They neither asked for the cancellation of the order of the Collector nor for any injunction, two of the reliefs which they were entitled to ask in the case in addition to the declaration. Such a suit was hit by s. 42 of the Specific Relief Act and they were to be denied the declaration without these specified reliefs. Indeed they had only to ask for the setting aside of the order.
 The suit was notproperly framed. The appellants as plaintiffs in the case joined the transferees from V but made no attempt to join V, the son of the original mortgagor. The suit could be only properly framed with all the parties before the Court.Even if V was not a necessary party, he was at least a proper party.If he had been brought before the court, it could have known from himwhether he bad given the authority to execute the document and he could have adopted the act of S by ratifying it again.
 Normally costs should follow the event and it is not the rule that costs should be left to be borne to the parties.
 Here a case was decided against one of the parties in a contentious 'matter, and costs should have been awarded. [44 F-45D]
