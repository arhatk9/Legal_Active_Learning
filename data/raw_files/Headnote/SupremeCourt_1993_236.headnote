 The appellant in Civil Appeal No.481 of 1983, and thousands of other families, known as Chakmas, migrated from the erstwhile East Pakistan to Assam where they were given shelter as refugees in 1964. In the year 1966 the Government drew up the Chakma resettlement Schemes whereunder they were allotted lands within the-North East Frontier Agency, which later became State of Arunachal Pradesh. The appellant and 56 other Chakma families strayed away from the original settlement area and negotiated with the local Raja who through an unregistered deed donated land to them inside the inner line which was a protected area under the Foreigners' Protection Area Order 1958. Later, the State Govenment received complaints that the 402 Chakmas were making encroachment on lands of local people, indulging in illegal collection of arms and ammunition and establishing contacts with the extremist groups. An inquiry into the matter was directed. The Government found it necessary to shift them, and by order dated 15.2.1984 directed the appellant and the other Chakma families to vacate the land and to shift to the original settlementarea where other Chakma families were already` residing. The appellant challenged the order before the High Court by filing a writ petition which was dismissed. However, the High Court, on humanitarian grounds, directed the State Government to give adequate compensation to the Chakmas.
 Both, the appellant and the State Government filed the appeals by special leave.
 It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the appellant and the other Chakmas being of Indian origin and having returned to Assam State in 1964, would be entitled to citizenship under Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, 1955, and by mere accident of their going to Arunachal Pradesh they cannot lose their citizenship; and that the order dated 15.2.1984, besides being against the principles of natunal justice, was violative of Article 14 of the Constitution as it infringed the rights of the appellant and other Chakmas under Articles 19(1) (d) and (e) of the Constitution.
 Dismissing the appeal on behalf of the Chakmas and allowing that of the State, this Court, 
HELD : 1.1 The appellant and other Chakmas residing in Arunachal Pradesh long before 1985 cannot be regarded as citizens of India. [420- H] 
1.2 Under Section 6-A of the Citizenship Act, 1955, which was incorporated by the Amending Act, 1985 as a result of Assam Accord, two conditions are required to be satisfied:
 (1) Persons of Indian origin (undivided India) who came before 1.1.1966 to Assam from the specified territory; and (2) they have been "ordinarily resident" in Assam as it existed in 1985 since their date of entry in Assam. [411 G- H; 412 A] 
1.3 Though the appellant and other Chakmas were of Indian origin and came to Assam prior to 1.1.1966 from the then East Pakistan, one of the specified territories but, in 1966 they shifted to the area within North East Frontier Agency which later became State of Arunachal Pradesh, and at no time was part of the Territory of the State of Assam though was being administered by the Governors of Assam or the President of India, as the case 403 may be. Besides, bt the North-Eastern Areas (Reorganisation) Act, 1971, the territories of Arunachal Pradesh were excluded from the purview of the Immigrants (Explusion from Assam) Act, 1950. The appellant and the other Chakmas were residing in Arunachal Pradesh long before 1985, and as such cannot be said to be "ordinarly resident" in Assam as it existed in 1985 since their date of en try in Assam.

1.4 If the law lays down certain conditions for acquiring citizenship, the same cannot be disregarded. (421-A) Kennedy v. Mendoza- Martinez [1963] USSC 21; 372 US. 144,159 [1963], referred to.

 2.The place where the Chakma families are residing is within the inner line notified by the State Government. The place is the protected one under the Foreigners'Protection Area Order, 1958, wherein acquisition of any land or any interest thereon by any foreigner is prohibited as envisaged by clause section 7 of the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation, 1873 and Clause 9(2) of the Foreigners' Order 1948 issued under Section 3 of the Foreigners Act, 1946. (410 DE) 2.2Accordingly, the donation deed through which the Raja gave land to the appellant and the other Chakmas is illegal.(421 D) 2.3Unlike article 21, rights under Articles 19(1) (d) and (e) of the Constitution are unavailable to foreigners because these rights are conferred only on the citizens and are expressly withheld to foreigners. The machinery of Article 14 cannot be invoked to obtain that fundamental right.(424 E) Indo-China Steam Navigation Co. v. Jasjit Singh, [1964]6 SCR 594 at 621 to 622, followed.

3.1 Settling the Chakmas in a particular place is a matter of policy. This Court cannot enter into the wisdom of such a policy. Besides, the reasons for shifting the Chakma families are : they are in illegal occupation of the protected are, they are indulging in procurement of arms and anununitions and other criminal activities; they are associating with anti-social elements, and have been source of constant trouble to the local tribals. Arunachal Pradesh being a Border State is stategically important (424B, 423EFG) 
4. In the instant case, the principles of natural justice were fully complied with. It cannot he said that the order dated 15.2.1984 for shifting the Chakmas came to be issued like 'a bolt from the blue'. The record mentions that before passing of the shifting order, notice after notice were issued to chakma families to return to their original place of settlement. Survey Reports for their settlement were submitted and representation were made to the authorities concerned who gave oral hearing to the representatives of Chakmas.

5.1 In view of the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation, 1873 and Clause 9(2) of the Foreigners'Order 1948 the acquisition of the land being illegal, the instant one is not a case for award of compensation. (426-C) 
5.2 However, having regard to the statement made on bahalf of the State that the Chief Minister is ready to hear the Chakmas, an opportunity be afforded to them by the Chief Minister who may grant such relief as may be deemed fit. It is made clear that it will be a post decisional hearing.
