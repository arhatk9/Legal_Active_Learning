 The mathadhipathi of the, appellant math granted a perpetual lease of the math properties, at a fixed rent to the predecessor of the respondent in 1883, but without any legal necessity. The mathadipathi died in 1915. From 1915 there was only a de facto manager of the math for 20 years. In 1939, the present mathadhipathi was elected and in 1950 the math obtained possession of the properties. Since 1915 the respondent and his predecessors did not pay any rent to the, math. In 1954, the respondent filed the suit against the math reprcsented by the mathadipathi, for recovery of possession of he properties claiming title by adverse pos- session. The trial court decreed the suit. On appeal, the decree was set aside, but was restored by the High Court on further appeal.
 in the appeal to this Court the appellants contended that adverse possession could not run till the mathadhipathi was appointed, because, the right to sue for the recovery of the math properties vested only in the legally appointed mathadhipathi; and before possession could be adverse there must be a competitor who, by due vigilance, could avoid the running of time,.
 
HELD : In the absence of legal necessity, the lease of 1883 endured only during the life time of the previous mathadhipathi and terminated on his death in 1915, and possession thereafter of the respondent and his predecessor was adverse to the math. Therefore, the time under Art. 144 of the Limitation Act, 1908, commenced to run in 1915 and the absence of a legally appointed mathadhipathi did not prevent the running of time. Thus, the title of the math to the suit properties became extinguished in 1927 and the 'respondent acquired title by prescription, by operation of s. 28 and art. 144. [910 E; 913 H; 914 C] A math is the owner of endowed property and like an idol is a juristic person having the power of acquiring, owning and possessing properties and having the capacity of suing and being sued. It. may acquire property by prescription and likewise lose it by adverse possession. A legally appointed mathadhipathi has large beneficial interests in the math properties and he may sue on its behalf for recovery of its properties. In his absence, a de facto mathadhipathi may do so, and where necessary, a disciple or other beneficiary of the math may take steps for vindicating its legal rights.
 Therefore, if before the mathadhipathi's appointment limitation under art. 144 had commenced to run against the math, the appointment does not give either the, math or the mathadhipathi a new right of suit or a fresh starting point of limitation, and so, if the title of the math to any property is extinguished by adverse possession, the rights of all beneficiaries of the math in the property are also extinguished.
