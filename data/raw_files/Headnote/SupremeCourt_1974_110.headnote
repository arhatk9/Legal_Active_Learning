 Notices were issued to the petitioners under s. 6 of the Tamil Nadu Land Encroachment Act, 1905, for evicting the petitioners and they challenged the constitutional validity of the Act on the basis of the decision in Northern India Caterers v. Punjab. [1967] INSC 88; [1967] 3 S.C.R. 399.
 Dismissing the petitions, 
HELD : Under the Tamil Nadu Act s. 2 defines 'property of government', s. 3 lays down that any person who shall unauthorisedly occupy any land which is the property of the Government shall be liable to pay the full assessment on the land, s. 5 provides for further payment of penalty, and s. 6 provides for eviction of such person and for forfeiture of any crop or other product raised on the land and any building or other construction erected on the land. The eviction was to be carried out by serving a notice as provided under s. 7 after giving him, reasonable time to vacate. There is a provision for appeal against the order of the Collector or other officer and there is also a provision for revision by the Government. Section 14 provides for a right of suit by any person deeming himself aggrieved by any proceedings under the Act.
 This Court in Maganlal Chagganlal Ltd. v. Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay [1975] 1 S.C.R. I considered the constitutional validity of Chapter V-A of the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, and the Bombay Government Premises (Eviction) Act, 1955, which provide for a special procedure for eviction of unauthorised occupants of public premises. The Court observed that the mere availability of two procedures will not vitiate the special procedure and discussed the principles as to when the statute will not be hit by Art. 14. The Court then went on to point out that the procedures laid down by the two Acts were not so harsh or onerous as to suggest that a discrimination would result if resort was made to the provisions of these two Acts in some cases and to the ordinary civil court in others; and this decision would apply on all fours to the facts of the present case.
