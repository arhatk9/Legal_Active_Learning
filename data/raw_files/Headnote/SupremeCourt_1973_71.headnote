 These are all connected appeals. The assessee-respondent was the managing agent of two companies N & G. As Managing Agent of N Company, it was entitled to receive a commission of 12 1/2 on the net profits of the Managed Company together with a sum of Rs. 18,000/as office allowance. In the case of G company, the assessee was entitled to get an allowance of Rs. 30,000/- in addition to its agreed commission. In all these appeals, certain questions were submitted by the Tribunal to the High Court. In Civil Appeal No. Z42 of 1970 only one question was submitted and in the other two cases, i.e., Civil Appeal No. 243 and 244 of 1970, two questions were submitted.
 In the first appeal, the question submitted was whether on the f,acts and circumstances of the case, a certain sum said to, have been foregone by the assessee as managing agency commission was allowable as revenue expenditure. Similar questions were called for, for the remaining two assessment years as well and in addition, one more question was submitted as to whether certain sum, said' to have been 'foregone by the assessee as, office allowance, was allowable as revenue expenditure under the lncome Tax Act.
 The assessment years were 1954-55, 1955-56 and 1956-57.
 The High Court came to the conclusion that it is not necessary to answer the common question referred to in all these appeals because it was academic; but the question relating to the office allowance was ,answered in favour of the assessee.
 In the relevant accounting years, the assessee gave up the managing agency commission from both the managed companies.
 It also gave up the office allowance due from G. Company.
 The accounting years of both the assessee company as well as the managed companies were the financial year. The commission was given up by the assessee company after the end of the financial year, but before the accounts 'of the managed company were made up. The accounts of the managed companies were made up some time during the end of September of the year following the respective accounting years. But in the case of office allowance, the same was given up even before the end of the financial years, On the basis of these facts, the I.T.O. as well as the Appellate Assistant Commissioner held that the deductions claimed were not allowable. As regards the commission, they came to the conclusion that the same having accrued at the end of each of the financial years, the agency giving up the same subsequent to these dates, does not bring the case under s. 10(1) of the Income-tax Act. So far as the office allowance was concerned, they came to the conclusion that there was no justification for giving up the same. The Income Tax Appellate 903 Tribunal differed from this view and held that to the extent the commission was given up, the assessee company had no income at all. In other words, the commission that was given up cannot be considered as the real income of the assessee company. Therefore, it is an allowable expenditure under s. 10(2)(xv). As regards the office allowance the Tribunal held that the same was allowable deduction under s.
 10(2) (xv). The Tribunal further held that the commission as well as the office allowance were given up by the assessee on the ground of commercial expediency. The High Court agreed with this view taken by the Tribunal.
 Dismissing the appeal, HELD : (i) As regards office allowance, following C.I.T.
 Bombay North v. Chandulal Keshavlal & Co., 38 I.T.R. 601 the Tribunal was fully justified in coming to the conclusion that the expenditure incurred came within the scope of s.
 10(2)(xv). The only contention advanced by the appellant was that the allowance was paid to meet certain expenses incurred by the assessee, company. Therefore, the assessee could not have given up the same. This contention makes no difference in law. The ratio of the decision of this Court in Chandulal's case completely covers the point under consideration. [906B] (ii) The question regarding giving up of the commission, no due date was fixed for the payment of the commission under the managing agency agreements. The commission receivable could have been ascertained only after the managed company made up its accounts. The assessee had given up the commission even before the managed company made up its accounts. Hence, the fact that the assessee company was maintaining its accounts on the basis of mercantile system cannot lead to the conclusion that the commission accrued to 'it by the end of the relevant accounting year. It was the real income of the assessee company that was liable to tax and the real income could not be arrived at without taking into account the amount given up by the assessee.
 Therefore. in the present case, the contention of the revenue that a surrender of the commission under the provisions mentioned in the agreement were not deductable for the purposes of Income Tax, cannot be sustained. [906 F] Poona Electric Supply Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income- tax, Bombay City 1, 57 I.T.R. 521 H. M. Kashiparekh & Co.
 Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay North, Kutch & Saurashtra, 39 I.T.R. 706, referred to.
 The question whether the given up commission comes under s.
 10(2)(xv) depended on whether the income had really accrued or not. It is not a hypothetical accrual of income that has got to be taken into consideration but the real accrual of the income. In the present case, since there was no real accrual of Income, the assessee was not liable to tax for this amount.
