 The assessee appellant was at all material times a shareholder of a number of companies engaged in the business of managing hotels. Gradually he came to own a large block of shares of $pence's Hotel Ltd. and also became its managing director. He was in charge of the management thereof at the material time. He further purchased interest in Associated Hotels of India Ltd. and Hotels (1938) in association with M. S. Oberoi. In 1944 Oberoi purchased from the assessee his share holding in the Associated Hotels of India Limited for an amount of Rs. 20,657,05/13/0. The assessee maintained that he had filed returns of income in respect of the relevant assessment years and that during the assessment for the year 1944-45 he had disclosed to the Income-tax Officer that he had received the aforesaid amount for the sale of the shares of the Associated Hotels. That amount was held to be a capital receipt on which no income- tax was payable. Subsequently the Income-tax Officer issued seven notices dated 5th November 1954 to the assessee tinder s, 34 (1-A) of the Income-tax Act, 1922 in respect of assessment years 1940-41 to 1946-47 alleging therein that the income of the appellant had partly escaped assessment.
 In spite of the assessee's objections relating to jurisdiction the Income Tax Officer made asseessmerits in respect of the years 1942-43 to 1945-46. In appeal the Appellate Assistant Commissioner remanded the case to the Income-tax Officer to submit a report on various matters.
 Thereafter the appellant submitted a petition under Art. 226 in the High Court challenging inter alia the validity of the notice under s. 34 (1-A). The High Court accepted the preliminary objection of the Revenue that since the appellant had invoked the remedy under the Act a petition under Art. 226 did not lie. Nevertheless it proceeded to hold that the notice under s.34 (1-A) was valid and the required preconditions were satisfied, Appeal was filed by the assessee in this Court by special leave.
 
HELD : (i) The correct course for the High Court to follow after sustaining the preliminary objection was to have dismissed the writ petition, Since the High Court gave a decision in the matter which 17 6 would be binding on the Appellate Assistant Commissioner.
 the contention of the Revenue that this Court should decline to go into the question arising out of the provisions of s.
 34 (1-A) could not be accepted. [179 D-E] (ii) There can be no manner of doubt that the words 'reason to believe' suggest that the belief must be that of an honest and reasonable person based upon reasonable grounds and that the Income-tax Officer may act on direct and circumstantial evidence but not on mere suspicion gossip or rumour. The Income-tax Officer would be acting without jurisdiction if the reason for this belief that the conditions are satisfied does not exist or is not material or relevant to the belief required by the section. The Court can always examine this aspect though the declaration or sufficiency of the reasons for the belief cannot be investigated by the Court. [182F-H] Chhugamal Rajpal v. S. P. Chaliha & Ors., 1971 (79) I.T.R.
 603. referred to, There was no material or fact which had been stated in the reasons for starting proceedings in the present case on which any belief could be founded of the nature contemplated by s. 34 (1-A) The so called reasons were stated to be beliefs, thus leading to an obvious self contradiction.
 Therefore the requirements of s. 34(1-A) were not satisfied and, the notices which had been issued were wholly illegal and invalid.
 [183 B] In the result the appeal must be allowed and the impugned notices were quashed.
