 Under Explanation (2) to s. 2(h) of the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939, a sale is deemed to have taken place in that State, wherever the contract of sale might have been made, if the goods were actually in the State at the time when the contract in respect thereof was made. The Constitution, by Art. 286 as it was originally enacted, imposed four bans upon the legislative power of the States to impose sales tax. Clause (1)(a) prohibited every State from imposing or authorising the imposition of, a tax on outside sales. Am outside sale was defined by defining an inside sale in the Explanation to the clause, as a sale which shall be deemed to have taken place in the State in which the goods have actually been delivered as a direct result of such sale for the purpose of consumption in that State notwithstanding the fact that under the general law relating to sale of goods the property in the goods has by reason of such sale passed in another State. Clause (1)(b) prohibited the imposition of tax on sales in the course of import into or export out of, the territory of India. Clause (2) prohibited the imposition of tax on the sale of goods where such sale took place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce unless Parliament otherwise provided. Clause (3) prohibited the State from imposing or authorising the imposition of a tax on the sale of any goods declared by Parliament by law to be essential for the life of the community, unless the legislation was reserved for the consideration of the President and had received his assent. This Court, in its judgment in the Bengal Immunity Co. Ltd. Case, [1955] 2 S.C.R. 603 delivered on September 6, 1955, held that because of Art. 286(2), the State legislature could not impose sales-tax on inter-State sales until Parliament provided otherwise. By the Sales Tax Laws Validation Act, 1956, Parliament removed the ban contained in Art. 286(2) retro- spectively, during the period between April 1, 1951, and September 6, 1955, with the result that, transactions of sale, even though they were inter-State sales, could, for that period be lawfully charged to tax. [386C-E; 387D, F-H;
 388A-D] The respondent was a beedi manufacturer in the appellant- State. Beedies, which were within the territory of the appellantState at the time the contract of sale in respect of them was made were sold to non-resident buyers. On the question whether the sales during the period from April 1, 1955 to September 5, 1955 were taxable by virtue of Explanation 2 to s. 2(h) of the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939, in view of the lifting of the ban on the levy of tax on inter-State sales by the Sales Tax Laws Validation Act, the High Court relying on additional affidavits filed before it, held 381 382 that the sales were outside sales and that the State had no jurisdiction to impose sales tax.
 In appeal by the State;
 Held: (1) The restrictions imposed by the several clauses of Art. 286 as it stood were cumulative, and the legislative power of the State to tax sale or purchase transactions could be exercised only if it was not hit by any of those limitations. The Validation Act merely lifted the ban under Art. 286(2) but the ban imposed by Art. 286(1)(a) was still effective, and could not be removed by any legislation of Parliament. Thus. even if the ban under Art. 286 (2) was removed by the Validation Act, no State could tax an inter- State sale or purchase which took place outside its territorial limits. The sales falling within the Explanation to Art. 286(1)(a) were fictionally to be regarded as inside the State in which the goods were actually delivered for consumption and so within the taxing power of that State and as being outside all other States and so, exempt from sales-tax by those other States.
 Therefore, in the present case, even though the sales fell within Explanation (2) to s. 2(h) of the Madras General Sales Tax Act, it was beyond the competence of the Madras State to tax them as the assessee had delivered the goods for consumption outside the State and were thus outside sales covered by the ban imposed by Art. 286(1)(a).

 (2) The appellant-State, not having raised any objection before the High Court that the High Court, in exercising the revisional powers under s. 38 of the Madras General Sales Tax Act could not take the affidavits in evidence could not urge in this Court that the High Court acted illegaly in taking them in evidence.
