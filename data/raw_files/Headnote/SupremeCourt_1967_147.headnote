 The appellant carried on mining business at Bhilwara which was, during the relevant period. in a Part 'B' State and exported mica to Kodarma and Giridih situated in Part 'A' and Part 'C' States respectively. The appellant entered into. contracts with purchasers whereby the consignments would be sent to Kodarma and Giridih by railway and the railway receipts would be sent through the bank. The goods were consigned t0 "self" and the railway receipts along with the Bills of Exchange were presented by the appellant to its bank in Bhilwara for collection after endorsing the railway receipts in favour of the bank. The bank, in its turn, endorsed the railway receipts in favour of its branches in Part 'A' '.and Part 'C' States and the goods were delivered to the buyers only when they paid the price to the bank's branches and obtained the railway receipts.
 In the course of the appellant's assessment to income-tax for the. years 1950-51 and 1951-52, the appellant claimed that it was entitled the benefit of rebate under the Part 'B' States (Taxation Concessions) Order. 1950 in regard to profits from sales made by it and that s. 4(1)(a) of the Income-tax Act, 1922 was not applicable to its transactions.
 The Income-tax Officer held that the sales took place in Part 'A' and Part 'C' States and the entire profits from those sales accrued and were received by the appellant in those States and therefore no rebate was admissible under 'the Order. He also rejected the appellant's claim that in regard to some of the sales, Bills were discounted by the local bank and hence payment to that extent should be treated as having been received at Bhilwara in a Part 'B' State. Appeals made to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the Tribunal were dismissed and, the High, Court, upon a reference, also decided against the appellant.
 In the appeal to this Court it was also contended on behalf of the appellant that as the mica was extracted, processed, sorted and packed at Bhilwara in Part 'B' State, there was accrual of a part of the income at Bhilwara and the appellant was, in any case, entitled to claim apportionment of the profits accrued.
 
 HELD: (i) The appellant became entitled to the purchase money only on the passing of title to the purchasers at Kodarma and Giridih in Part 'A" and Part 'C' States and the income therefore accrued to the appellant 962 .
 in those States. The appellant was not therefore entitled to exemption under the Part 'B' States (Taxation Concessions) Order, 1950. [970B] When the seller draws a hundi or a bill of exchange on the pur,chaser and delivers the hundi or the bill of exchange with a relative railway receipt to his own banker for the purpose of delivery of the railway receipt to the purchaser on his honouring the hundi, the property in the goods cannot be held to pass to the purchaser till he pays the price and takes delivery of the railway receipt from the banker. [968 D] Income may accrue to an assessee without actual receipt of the same. 'If the assessee acquires a right to receive the income, the income can be said to accrue to him though it may be 'received later on its being ascertained. The basic conception is that he must have acquired a right to receive the income. [966B] (ii) When the local bank discounted the bills, the payments could not be regarded as income accruing in a Part 'B' State. When the bank gave credit of part of the amount of some of the bills to the appellant. it was apparent from the conditions specified in the discount form of -the bank that the responsibility of the appellant did not cease till the bank realised payments from the purchasers. When the appellant negotiated the documents with the bank, the latter did so only as part of its banking business. The discounting by the bank of the Bills could not -mean that there was a sale of the goods to the bankers. Therefore if any -money was paid by the bank to the appellant as price for the hundi, it was not the sale price of the goods in any sense and the bank was not acting at the agent of the buyer.[969 C-H] Colquhoun v.

 The contention that the profits earned should be apportioned as there was accrual of part of the income in a Part 'B' State could not be considered as it was not raised before the Tribunal. [970E-F] C.I.T. Bombay v. Ahmedbhai Umarbhai & Co., 18 I.T.R. 472;
