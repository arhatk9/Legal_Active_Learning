 The appellant who is the owner of the building hearing No.
 24/6, Tulsa Kothi, Kanpur, lives in the upper floor of the building with his son and other members of the family.
 There are two shops in the ground floor in which tenants had been inducted. One of the shops has been in possession of Raghunath Prasad Mehrotra, respondent no. 3 and his brother Kanahyalal Mehrotra who have been carrying on the business of Druggists and Chemists in the said shop as partners of the firm Pioneer Drug Stores. The other shop was in the tenancy of Bata Shoe Company Ltd. Since the said Company had taken another shop on rent sometime in the year 1961 it was about to vacate the shop in the building of the appellant. He. therefore, filed an application on 7-11-1961 before the Rent Control and Eviction Officer (Rent Controller) with a copy to the District Magistrate, Kanpur under Rule 6 of the Control of Rent and Eviction Rules, 1949- framed under Section 17 of the U.P. (Temporary) Control of Rent and Eviction Act, 1947 praying for the release of the shop in his favour on the ground that he required the accommodation for his own use for establishing a business for his son. On 2-5-1962. respondent No. 3 made an application under section 7(2) of the Act for allotment of the accommodation to him. There were four more applicants under section 7(2). The shop was actually vacated by Bata Shoe Company on 15-8-1962. On 16-8-1962 intimation was given by the appellant to the Rent Controller about the vacancy of the shop in accordance with section 7(1). The Additional District Magistrate, to whom proceedings had been transferred, made an order on 17-9-1962 refusing to release the shop to the appellant and directed its allotment to respondent No. 3. In pursuance of the order made in his favour, the respondent got actual possession of the shop from the appellant who had occupied the shop in the meantime.
 Before the filing of the application by the third respondent on 2-11-1962 under section 7A of the Act, the appellant had filed on 22-9-1962, suit No. 132/1962 in the Court of First Civil Judge at Kanpur challenging the allotment order of the Additional District Magistrate and the Rent Controller impleading the third respondent as the sole defendant in the suit. A decree for permanent injunction was asked for.
 interim injunction was granted. The suit ended in compromise on 11-10-1962. The appellant filed an application for review on 17-11-1962 before the Rent Controller asking him to review his ex-parte order dated 15- 11-1962 made under section 7A of the Act chiefly oil two grounds viz. (1) that no notice was served upon the appellant; (2) that the third respondent had obtained the order fradulently by suppressing the fact of compromise entered in Suit No. 132/1962. The Rent Controller refused to review his order and dismissed the application on 8-1- 1963. The appellant on the same date i.e. on 8-1-1963 filed a petition in the Allahabad High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution to challenge the various orders of allot- ment and delivery of possession made by respondents I and 2 from time to time. The Writ Petition was dismissed by a learned single Judge on 7-5-19-63. Special Appeal No.
 254/1963 was dismissed by a Bench of the Allahabad High Court on 3-2-1964. The present appeal was preferred in this Court on grant of certificate by the High Court.
 710 It was contended on behalf of the appellant that (i) The order of allotment having not been made within 30 days of the receipt of the intimation sent by the landlord under section 7(1) (a) of the Act as required by Rule 3 of the Rules was ultra vires and void;
 (ii) Respondent No. 3 had no right to apply for possession under section 7A of the Act after having entered into a compromise in Suit No. 132/1962;
 (iii) that the order of allotment issued by the Rent Controller was bad as it was mechanically issued on the basis of the order of the Additional District Magistrate and without any application of the mind by the former.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
 HELD:(By Court) (i) Section 3 of the Act providing for restrictions on eviction is based on public policy. It is intended to protect the weaker section of the community in general by granting equality of bargaining power. [714D; 718E] Murlidhar Agarwal and Anr. v State of Uttar Pradesh and Ors.; [1974] INSC 128; A.I.R. 1974 S.C. 1924, relied on In Jiwan Singh v. Rajindra Prasad & Anr., Civil Appeal No.
 999(N) of 1971 decided on 18-12-1974, this Court held that if the landlord failed to discharge his obligation of giving 7 days' notice in accordance with section 7(1) (a), he lost his right of making a nomination under Rule 4. The District Magistrate has got to make the order, of allotment within 30 days of the receipt of the intimation sent by the landlord under section 7(1)(a) of the Act. Ho has, at the same time, to give notice of his order of allotment to the landlord.
 If the landlord receives no notice from the District Magistrate within 30 days, which as a matter of construction under Rule 4 must mean shortly after the expiry of 30 days of , the receipt by the landlord under section 7(1)(a), of an order of allotment having been made within that period, he gets a right to nominate a tenant. Ordinarily and generally the District Magistrate shall have to allot the accommodation to the nominee of the landlord but for special reasons to be recorded in writing, he may depart from the nomination made by the landlord and allot the accommodation to some other person' even to a person who was an applicant before him before the expiry of the period of 30 days and due to one reason or the other no order of allotment could be in his favour within the said period. If, however, the landlord does not make a nomination in accordance with Rule 4 be cannot challenge the order of allotment subsequently made by the District Magistrate on the expiry of the period of 30 days only on the ground of its having been made beyond the time. [715D-E, F-716B; 718E-719F] (ii) in the instant case it is not correct to say that the order of allotment made onthe 17th September. 1962-two days after the expiry of the period of 30 days was invalid on that account alone. The High Court is also right in its view that no order of allotment was possible to be made in this case before disposal of the landlord's claim under Rule, 6. There is no time limit fixed for disposal of such a laim. of course it should be disposed of as quickly as possible, preferably within the period of 30 days mentioned in Rule 3. That being so even in the light of Rule 6 it is difficult to nullify an order of allotment made by the District Magistrate merely on the ground of having been made on the expiry of the period of 30 days. On the facts of this case surely ,the Order of allotment was not invalid.
 [716D-E-, 719F-720B] (iii) The order of allotment in this caw was made by the Additional District Magistrate, respondent No. 1. It may not be quite correct to say that it was purely an administrative order as has been the view of the High Court in the Special Appeal. But the, order was made by him in 71l a quasi- judicial manner after hearing the parties concerned and after fully allying his mind. He being a delegate of the District Magistrate, was competent to make order of allotment. So was the Rent Controller. But the latter merely issued the formal order made by the former. It was not a cm where *a authority competent to make the order mechanically did it on the direction or in pursuance of an order of a different authority not competent to Pass the order. [717G-718B; C-D] (ii) By majority (Mathew and Untwalia, JJ.) The appellant filed Civil Suit No. 132/1962 against the third respondent to challenge the order of allotment made in his favour by respondent Nos. 1 and 2. Neither of the said two respondents was impleaded as a defendant in the suit.
 But that apart, the agreement entered into between the appellant and respondent No. 3 embodied in the compromise petition dated 11-10-1962 Was void under section 23 of the Contract Act as it was unlawful and against the public policy of the Act under the Rules. So long as the Act and the Rules continued in force, the control of letting vested in the District Magistrate and not in the parties. By an agreement of the kind embodied in the compromise petition the parties could not curtail the powers of the District Magistrate. It was unlawful and against the public policy of the law to do so. Respondent No. 3 committed no fraud in ignoring the void compromise when he applied for eviction of the appellant under section 7A of the Act and for delivery of actual, physical possession to him. [717C-F] Per Bhagwati, J. (dissenting) Even it the compromise was unlawful and the consent decree was on that account void, the very fact of the 3rd respondent having submitted to the consent decree, declaring the order of allotment to be invalid and recognising the right of the appellant to occupy the shop for himself vis-a- vis the 3rd respondent, was a highly relevant circumstance bearing on the exercise of the discretion of the District Magistrate, and it ought to have been disclosed to the District Magistrate. It is a well settled proposition of law and this proposition ,Should apply equally in the field of administrative law, that when a party approaches a tribunal for discretionary relief, he must not only come with clean hands but must also show the utmost good faith and disclose all material facts having a bearing on the exercise of discretion of the authority which are within his knowledge. He cannot escape this obligation on the plea that So other side can always, if it so chooses, appear and bring the material facts to the notice of the authority. It is an obligation of confidence which he owes to the authority and this obligation is imposed by law in the larger interests of administration of justice so that justice, whether dispensed by Civil court or by administrative authority, remains pure and unsullied. The nondisclosure of the fact of consent decree by the 3rd respondent in the application made by him vitiated the order of the Rent Control and Eviction Officer under section 7A.
