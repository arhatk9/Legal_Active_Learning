 Properties belonging to a 'trust were sold in execution of a decree obtained by the second respondent against the trust and were purchased by the first respondent. Thereafter, a suit was filed under s. 92, C.P.C. for the removal of the trustees wherein it was prayed that the sale in favour of the first respondent may be set aside and adequate provision for discharging the decree of the second respondent be made in the scheme to he framed for managing the trust. The second respondent agreed to such a course and thereupon, the appellant, who was appointed a receiver in the suit under s.
 92, applied to the Court under O.XXI, r. 89 C.P.C. for setting aside the sale. He deposited certain amounts for payment to the first respondent purchaser. He did not, however, deposit the amount specified in the Proclamation of sale for payment to the second respondent decree-holder, as required under O.XXI, r. 89(b), but instead, prayed that the Court may dispense with such deposit. The Court allowed the application, but on appeal by the purchaser the High Court set aside the order.
 In appeal, by the receiver, to this Court, HELD : If at the time when the application under O.XXI, r.
 89 is made by the judgment-debtor, the decree has been satisfied or adjusted, the deposit of any money for payment to the decree-holder is not called for. But a mere promise on the part of the judgment-debtor to take steps to ensure payment of the decretal amount, even if acceded to by the decree-holder would not have the same effect. In the present case, the decree was kept alive and the decree- holder had merely agreed to postpone realising the decretal amount in case satisfactory provision for payment of his dues was made in the suit. There was no adjustment of the decree which could be recorded under O.XXI, r. 2; neither had the decree been satisfied. Therefore, the necessity for the judgment-debtor making a deposit under the provisions of O.XXI, r. 89(b) was not obviated. [706 B-C, E-H; 707'A-B]
