 The petitioners were arrested on November 6, 1968 at a railway station in Bihar. According to the Sub-Inspector's report recorded in the general diary they had taken out a procession in defiance of a prohibitory order under s. 144 Cr. P.C. and had been arrested under s. 151 Cr. P.C. It was stated that report was being submitted "under sections 107 and 117 of the Criminal Procedure Code and under s. 188 of the Indian Penal Code." On November 6 itself the first petitioner sent a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution in the form of a letter mentioning that he and his companions had been arrested but no grounds of 'arrest had been communicated to them and they had been merely told that the arrests had been made "under sections which were bailable". It was prayed that a writ of Habeas Corpus be issued. On November 7, 1968 a similar petition was sent by the petitioners from Jail. The additional fact given was that the arrested persons had been produced before the sub- Divisional Magistrate who bad on their refusal to furnish bail remanded them to custody upto November 20, 1968. Rule nisi was issued by this Court to the State authorities to produce the petitioners before the Court on November 25, 1968. On November 19, 1968 a first information report was recorded in which it was alleged that the petitioners had on November 6, 1968 committed offences under ss. 188 and 143 of the Penal Code. In the return, before this Court it was explained on behalf of the State that the officer-in-charge while forwarding the arrested persons on November 6, 1968, had by mistake omitted to mention s. 143 I.P.C. which was a cognizable offence. It was urged that the order of remand passed by the Magistrate could not be said to be illegal merely because of the omission of s. 143 I.P.C. in the order sheet when the police report clearly made out a case under that section. It was not claimed that the grounds of arrest had been supplied to the petitioners.
 
HELD : (i) When the arrests were effected by the Sub- Inspector on November 6, 1968, the offences for which the arrests were made were not stated to be cognizable. In the various reports etc. the only offence alleged was one under s. 188 I.P.C. which is non-cognizable. There was force in the suggestion of the petitioners that the first information report came to be recorded formally on November 19, 1968 only because the matter had been brought to this Court by way of a petition under Art. 32 and a further petition had been moved in the :High Court under Art. 226. It was not proved that the arrest had been made at the direction of a Magistrate who was present. It was somewhat surprising that no affidavit of the said Magistrate had been filed. It would be legitimate to conclude that the arrest of the petitioners was effected by the police officers concerned without any specific orders or directions of a Magistrate on November 6, 1968 for the offences and proceedings mentioned before in the various reports made prior to November 19, 1968. 1159 D-E; 160 B-161 B] 155 (ii) The two requirements of cl. (1) of Art. 22 are meant to afford the earliest opportunity to the arrested person to remove any mistake, misapprehension or misunderstanding in the minds of the arresting authority and, also, to know exactly what the accusation against him is so that he can exercise the second right, namely, of consulting a legal practitioner of his choice and to be defended by him.
 Whenever the Article is not complied with the petitioner would be entitled to a writ of Habeas Corp s directing his release. [162 E-163 C] In the present case the return filed by the State did not contain any information as to when and by whom the petitioners were informed of the grounds of their -arrest.
 It had not been contended on behalf of the State that the circumstances were such that the arrested persons trust have known the, general nature of the alleged offences for which they had been arrested. The petitioners were therefore entitled to be released on this ground alone. [ 163 F] (iii) Once it was shown that the arrests made by the police officers were illegal it was necessary for the State to establish that at the stage of remand the Magistrate directed detention in jail custody after applying his mind to all relevant matters. This the State had failed to do.
 The remand orders were patently routine and appeared to have been made mechanically. if the detention of the petitioners in, custody could not continue after their arrest because of the violation of Art. 22(1) of the Constitution', they were entitled to be released forthwith. The orders of remand were not such as would cure the constitutional infirmities. [1163 G-164 B] Christie & Anr. v. Leachinsky, [1947] UKHL 2; [1947] 1 All, E.R. 567, Ram Narayan Singh v.
