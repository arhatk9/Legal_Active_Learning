 In 1962, after the annexation of the territories belonging to India from Portuguese hands, the President of India promulgated the Daman (Abolition of Proprietorship of Villages) Regulation, 1962, for the abolition of the proprietorship of villages in Daman district. The five petitioners, who were proprietors of lands in five villages, challenged the validity of the Regulation under Arts. 14, 19 and 31 of the Constitution, while the Union of India contended that the Regulation was protected by Art. 31-A.
 
HELD : With respect to those portions of the lands of the petitioners which were devoted to agricultural or horticultural purposes, the proprietorship ceases and the Regulation operates upon them, because they fall within the definition of "estate" under Art. 31-A(2)(a)(iii). Those portions vest in the Government subject to payment of compensation under the Regulation. As regards the portions- which are hilly land, salt pans, salt lands, quarries, or lands within a municipal area, they do not vest in the Government under the Regulation and Art. 31-A(2) does not lend its protection to their expropriation. Compensation for them, if acquired,, would have to be assessed and given on considerations other than those in the Regulation. [605 E; 616 A-C, F-G; 617 El The Regulation deals with agrarian reform. Its general scheme follows that of the other Reform Acts abolishing intermediaries in India. But, in order that protection of Art. 31-A may be available to the Regulation the interest abolished by the Regulation must come within the compendious definition of "estate" in Art. 31-A(2) of the Constitution, inserted by the Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act.
 As the word " estate" as such has not been used in any of the Portuguese laws previously in force in the district of Daman, the lands and the interests in them, abolished by the Regulation,, cannot be referred to as "estates". They cannot also be treated as the equivalent of "estates" under the Indian Revenue Law, because, under the Indian Law to be an "estate" there must be land which pays land revenue and which is held in accordance with a law relating to land tenures. But as all lands in the district belonged to the Crown, Portuguese law contemplated only three kinds of dealing with land : (a) grant of a permanent lease, (b) grant of a period lease, and (c) sale; but there was no tenure nor payment of land revenue. No condition on which the lands were held in Daman district could properly be said to be a condition denoting tenure. The payment to the Government was either rent or a percentage of the presumable income from land. The holders were paying a kind of income- tax which resembled agricultural income-tax under the Indian Law. Even if it be regarded as land revenue, there was no law of land tenures, because, all the property, urban or agricultural,, was held alike on lease or by persons who were owners by purchase. [604 F-G; 607 E-G; 610 H; 612 A-El 603 As regards the three entities which are included in the definition of estate" in Art. 31-A(2)(a), clause (ii) is not applicable to the lands because, there was no ryotwari settlement or tenure in Daman district Clause (i) which mentions "any jagir, inam or muafi or other similar grant" could apply to one village which was granted for the upkeep of one Arab horse, but- there was no evidence that the village was held on confessional terms. Clause (iii), which includes "any land held or let for purpose of agriculture or for purposes ancillary thereto, including waste land, forest land, land for pasture or sites of buildings and other structures, occupied by cultivators of land, agricultural labourers and village artisans", however, applies to the bulk of the land in all the ,villages. But certain parts in the villages consist of salt pans, gravel pits, quarries and hills, and the property rights of the petitioners in such parts of lands were also extinguished by s. 3 of the Regulation, because, the definition of land in the Regulation includes all categories of land. Thus, the definition of "land" in the Regulation is at variance with the definition of "estate" in the Article and is not fully protected by the Article. The protection cannot be invoked by interpreting the definition to accord with the definition of "estate" in the Article on the principle that a legis- lature only acts within its powers, because, the Regulation was made in 1962, whereas Art. 31-A in its present form was introduced, though retrospectively, in 1964. The President of India, when he made the Regulation in 1962, could not be said to have been cognizant of the limit of his own power to make it in consonance with the definition of "estate" in Art. 31-A introduced later. The Regulation however, would still operate, as the definition of "land" is severable and the protection of Art. 31-A would be confined to those parts of the lands in the villages which fell within the definition of " estate" in Art. 31-A(2)(a)(iii).
