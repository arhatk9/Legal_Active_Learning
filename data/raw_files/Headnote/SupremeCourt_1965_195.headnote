 The respondent who was d student in the college of which the appellant was the Principal, was declared non-eligible to appear at the B.A. Part I examination of the Patna University because his attendance an Geography practicals was only 24% whereas the percentage required under Regulation 4 framed by the Academic Council of the University was 75%. He filed a writ petition under Art. 226 and obtained from the High Court interim orders directing the authorities to allow him to appear at the examination.
 On the merits the High Court held that under Regulation 4 the percentage of attendance in lectures tutorials and/or practicals in a particular subject had to be taken together and not separately and so taken the respondent's percentage in the subject of Geography as a whole was 66%. The shortage being less than 15% it was open to the Vice- Chancellor under Regulation 5 to condone it . The High Court therefore by a writ of certiorari quashed the order of the first appellant declaring the respondent non-eligible for appearing at the examination. and directed the authorities to refer the question of condonation of shortage in attendance to the Vice-Chancellor and if it was condoned to declare respondent's result. The appellants came to thin Court against this order by special leave.
 
HELD: (i) The requirement of 75% attendance in lectures tutorials and practicals has to be read disjunctively and not by taking them all together. Otherwise it will be possible for a student in certain subjects to complete the percentage required by attending all the lectures and no tutorials at. all. This could not be the intention in framing the Regulation and would not be in keeping with the methodology of modern education which lays great stress on tutorial and practical work. [980 G; 981F] (ii) It is true that the second clause of Regulation 4 requires that the percentage in question shall be calculated on the total number of lectures, tutorials and practicals delivered and provided during the session; but the provision is in the nature of a mere corollary to the main provision prescribed by Regulation 4, and if the requirement as to 75% attendance has been prescribed separately in relation to lectures. tutorials and/or practicals the second clause must be read accordingly. Thus read it only means that when the percentage is determined with reference to lectures, tutorials and practicals what has to be taken into account is the total number of lectures delivered, or tutorials or practicals held during the session. [981 G, H] 975 (iii) the petitioner filed his petition under Art. 226 only on the evening beforethe examination had to begin although he could have filed it earlier. In the circumstances it would have been better if the High Court hadnot passed interim orders. Even on the merits, where the question is One of interpreting a regulation framed by the Academic council of a University the High Court should ordinarily be reluctant to issue a writ of certiorari where it is plain that a regulation is capable of two constructions and it would generally not be expedient to reverse a decision of the educational authorities on the ground that the construction placed by the said authorities on the relevant regulations appears to the High Court less reasonable than the alternative construction which it is pleased to accept.
