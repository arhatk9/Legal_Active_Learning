 A notice under s. 22(2) of the Income Tax Act, 1922, was served on the appellant, a registered firm, calling upon it to submit a return of the income for the assessment year 1960-61. A return was filed, but not within time. The assessment was completed in November 1964. In view of the ammendment made by the Finance Act of 1956 in s. 23(5) of the Act of 1922, the tax payable by the firm as also the amount to be included in the income of each partner was determined. The Income Tax Officer also passed an order under Cl. (a) of s. 271 (i) of the Act of 1961 imposing a penalty for non-compliance with the notice under s. 22(2) of the 1922 Act. The appellants challenged in a writ petition the validity and constitutionality of s. 23 (5) of the Act of 1922 and s. 297 (2) (g) and s. 271(2) of the Act of 1961.
 The High Court dismissed the petition. In the appeal to this Court it was contended (i) section 23(5) was invalid for the reason that the same income in the hands of both the firm and the partners could not be simultaneously subjected to tax; (ii) cl. (g) of s. 297(2) was violative of Article 14 inasmuch as in the matter of imposition of penalty it- discriminated between two sets of assessees with reference to a particular date, namely completion of assessment proceedings on or after the first day of April 1962, the date of commencement of the Act of 1961, the classification thus being arbitrary depending on the accident of the date of completion of the assessment and (iii) s. 271(2) contravened Article 14, because, in the case of assessees other than registered firms the maximum penalty imposable under s. 271(l)(i) could not exceed fifty per cent of the tax payable by the assessee; whereas in the case of a registered firm the maximum penalty was not made to depend upon the tax assessed on or payable by such firm.
 
HELD: (i) After the Act of 1956 the firm did not cease to be an assessee; on the contrary it -was recognised as a separate entity and was subjected to tax as such. There can be double taxation if the legislature has distinctly enacted it. It is only when there are general words of taxation and they have to be interpreted they cannot be so interpreted as to tax the subject twice over to the same tax. The Constitution does not contain any prohibition against double taxation even if it be assumed that such a taxation is involved in the case of a firm and its partners after the amendment of s. 23(5) by the Act of 1956; nor is there any other enactment which interdicts such taxation.
 Even if s. 23(5) provides for the machinery for collection and recovery of tax, once the legislature has in clear terms, indicated that the income of the firm can be taxed as also the income in the hands of the partners, the distinction between a changing and a machinery section is of no consequence. Both sections have to be read together and construed harmoniously. [258 B, E-G] 254 Commissioner of Income tax, Bombay South v. Murlidhar Jhawar & commissioner of Inland Revenue v. Frank Bernard Senderson 8 T.C. 38 and Stevens v. The Durban-Roddepoort Gold Mining Co. Ltd., 5 T.C. 402 referred to.
 (ii) The date, first day of April 1962, which has been elected by the legislature for the purpose of cls. (f) and (g) of s. 297(2) cannot be characterised as arbitrary or fanciful. It is the date on which the Act of 1961 actually came into force, For the application and the implementation of the Act of 1961 it was necessary to fix a date and the stage of the proceedings which were pending for providing by which enactment they would be governed. Pending proceedings can be treated by the legislature as a class for the purpose of Art. 14. There was every justification for providing in cis. (f) and (g) that the date of the completion of the assessment would be determinative of the enactment under which the proceedings for penalty were to be held, 'for, the imposition of penalty can take place only after assessment has been completed. Although penalty has been regarded as an additional tax in a certain sense and for certain purposes, penalty proceedings are not a continuity of the proceedings relating to assessment, where a return has been filed. The scheme of s. 274(l) and 275 of the Act of 1961 is that the order of imposing penalty must be made after the completion of the assesment. The crucial date therefore for the purpose of penalty is the date of such completion. The mere possibility that some officer may intentionally delay the disposal of the case can hardly be a ground for striking down cl. (g) as discriminatory under Art. 14. There is no presumption that officers and authorities who are entrusted with responsible duties under th e taxation laws would not discharge them properly and in a bona fide manner. [262 B,F;

 (iii) After the Act of 1956 a registered firm has to pay tax at special reduced rates. If the firm got itself registered the partners would be entitled to certain benefits and advantages. it was, however, open to the legislature to say that once a registered firm committed a default attracting penalty it should be deemed or considered to be an unregistered firm for the purpose of its imposition. No question of discrimination under Art. 14 can arise in such a situation. [265 B]
