 Section 14(1) of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 provides that no tenant could be evicted except on an application made to the Rent Controller for an order for recovery of possession on one or more grounds specified in the section.
 Clause (a) to the proviso provides that if the tenant has neither paid nor tendered the whole of the arrears of the rent legally recoverable from him within two months of the date on which a notice of demand for the arrears of rent has been served on him by the landlord in the manner prescribed, the landlord can apply for recovery of possession. Sub- section (2) provides that no order for recovery of possession of any premises shall be made on the ground specified in cl. (a) of the proviso if the tenant makes payment or deposit as required by s. 15. Under s. 15(1) the Rent Controller shall make an order directing the tenant to pay arrears of rent with a direction that he should continue to pay or deposit the rent month by month by the fifteenth of each succeeding month. Sub-section (6) lays down that if a tenant makes payment or deposit as required by sub-s. (1) or sub-s. (3), no, order shall be made for, the recovery of possession on the ground of default in the payment of rent by the tenant. Sub-section (7) provides that if the tenant fails to make payment or deposit as required by subs. (1) the Controller may order, the defence against eviction to be struck out and proceed with the hearing of the application.
 The landlord-respondent filed an application under s. 14 of the Act for the eviction of the tenant-appellant on grounds of non-payment of rent and unauthorised subletting. In compliance with the directions of the Additional Rent Controller the tenant paid the arrears of rent upto a date but failed to deposit the rent month by month whereupon the landlord made an application under s. 15(7) for striking out the tenant's defence against eviction. Granting the application the Rent Controller struck off the tenant's defence on the ground that on the date of the order (October 15, 1965) the tenant was in default. On November 26, 1965 the Rent Controller passed an order of eviction on the ground of subletting.
 The Tribunal allowed the tenant's appeals against the orders of the Rent Controller.
 On appeal by the landlord the High Court held that when the tenant failed to make a deposit of the future rents in compliance with the order under s. 15(1) the right to obtain recovery of possession of the premises accrued to the landlord and the Rent Controller had no power to condone the default of the tenant in the payment of arrears of rent and to refuse to grant an order.
 Allowing the tenant's appeal and remitting the matter to the High Court, 
HELD : 1(a) The High Court was in error in allowing the application of the landlord on the basis of the failure of the tenant to comply with the order under s. 15(1). The High Court was also in error in holding that the right to obtain an order for recovery of possession accrued to the landlord. [246H] (b)The High Court ought to have considered and decided in the appeal whether the striking out of the defence by the Rent Controller was right or not. If the striking out was right then as the Rent Controller had proceeded with the hearing of the application and passed an order directing possession to the landlord it ought to uphold the order. In the event of the High Court holding that the order striking out the defence was erroneous then the order directing recovery of possession should be set aside and the petition heard by the Rent Controller after providing an opportunity to the tenant to raise his defence. [247D] 242 A 2(a) The landlord's contention that the word "may" in s.
 15(7) should be construed as "shall" and that in the event of non-compliance with s. 15(1) the defence against eviction should be struck out, has no force. In the context of s.
 15(7) it is not necessary to construe the word "may" as "shall". It is also in keeping with the legislative intent that a discretion is conferred on the Controller either to strike out the defence or not. [245G] (b) It is clear from s. 15(7) that the,, enquiry will have to be, proceeded with even when the defence of the tenant has been struck out. [246E] 
3. The High Court is right in holding that the Rent Controller has no discretion to extend the time prescribed under s. 15(1). Payment or deposit in compliance with the order under s. 15(1) takes away the right of the landlord to claim recovery of possession on the ground of default of rent. The legislature has given statutory protection to the tenant by affording him an opportunity to pay the arrears of rent within one month from the date of the order. 'Ibis statutory provision cannot be modified as rights of parties depend on compliance with an order under s. 15(1). [247E-F]
