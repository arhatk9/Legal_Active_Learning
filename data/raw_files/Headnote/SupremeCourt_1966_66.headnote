 The appellant's suit for partition of his share of 'home- farm' land in the Berar area of Madhya Pradesh was partly decreed by the trial court. Both sides filed appeals and the first appellate court also decided in favour of the appellant. The High Court however dismissed the suit as infructuous on the ground that by virtue of the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Rights (Estate, Mahals Alienated Lands) Act. 1950 the land stood vested in the State. The appellant came to this Court.
 
HELD : (i) It is no doubt true that so far as the proprietary interest in the village is concerned the whole of it has now been acquired by the State and vests in it.
 The acquisition of such interest by the &ate would not, however, put an and to the various rights of ex-properties in their capacity as owners of property. Thus every co- sharer could despite the acquisition, of his proprietary right obtain a declaration from a civil court as to the fact and extent of his share in the preexisting proprietary rights of that village so that he could lay claim to a proportionate extent of 'home-farm' land in the village.
 [819 A-C] (ii) A distinction has to be drawn between a suit brought by a proprietor in his character as proprietor for possession of property which the law then in force authorised him to claim by a suit for the benefit of the entire body of proprietors and a suit based upon trespass upon his individual rights obtained by him irrespective of- Ms character as such proprietor. If this distinction had been borne in mind by the High Court it would not have dismissed the present suit as wholly infructuous for a number of reliefs had been sought by the plaintiff-appellant with respect to property which not vested in the State. [819 G] (iii) The village in question being still undivided every bit of land which was in the cultivating possession of any of the co-shares in the village would be deemed to be in the possession of the entire body of co-sharers. The same would apply to land in the possession of lessees or ordinary tenants. The right to enforce claims to a partition of this land was in no way affected by any of the provisions of the Act.
