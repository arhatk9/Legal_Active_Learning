 The respondent company had a factory which was situated in Dandeli at the terminus of Alnawar-Dandeli branch of the southern Railway. It used the branch line for transporting coal, limestone etc. required for its manufacturing activities and also its manufactured products. Initially the Railways were levying freight on this branch line at "common rates" for all commodities on "a weight basis". On representations made by the users of this branch line, the Indian Railways substituted, with effect from February 1, 1964, the "standard telescopic class rates". In charging the goods freight, however, the actual distance of the branch line was multiplied by three. The company filed a complaint before the Railway Rates Tribunal and challenged as "unjust, unreasonable and discriminatory" the method of levy of freight on goods traffic. The company claimed that the levy of rates offended the provisions of s. 28 of the Indian Railways Act, 1890, and that the existing rates were per se unreasonable The company claimed a declaration that the rates between tsations specified in the complaint were unreasonable and a direction to the Railway to levy with effect from the date of the complaint standard rates and charges for the traffic on the branch line without "inflating the distance". The Union of India as representing the Southern Railway defended the complaint and contended that the rates were reasonable, that they were not discriminatory, and since they were fixed by order of the Central Government the Tribunal was precluded from questioning, the legality and propriety thereof. The Tribunal held that the rates in question were in contraven- tion of 28 of the Act being unreasonable and discriminatory.
 It further held that it had jurisdiction under s. 41(1)(b) of the Indian Railways Act to consider the complaint. By special leave appeal against the decision of the Tribunal was filed by the Union of India in this Court. The Court had to consider the question of the Tribunal's jurisdiction under s. 41 (1) (b) in the light of R. 63 of Goods Tariff No. 28, Rule 69 of Goods Tariff No. 29 and ss. 29 and 42 of the Railways Act.
 
HELD: Rules 63 of Goods Tariff No. 28 and 67 of Goods Tariff No. 29 refer to "station-to-station" rates. In s. 41(1) (b) the expression used is not 'station-to-station rates but a rate between two stations which is unreasonable. There is nothing in the rules which even indirectly affects the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to determine whether the rates for carriage of certain specified commodities between the two stations are unreasonable. [601 E] The Tribunal is invested with the authority subject to the limitations contained in s. 29(3) and s. 42 to entertain a complaint and to give relife n respect of rates which are found to be unreasonable between two 595 stations. The complaint made by the company in the present case did not seek intervention of the Tribunal in matters which may be raised only for decision to the Central Government by s. 29 and s. 42 of the Act, and the Tribunal had not given any relief in contravention of these pro- visions. The Tribunal had merely declared that the chargeable rate of freight determined by multiplying by three the distance over which the goods were transported, for specific commodities, was in contravention of s. 28 of the Indian Railways Act. The relief thus granted by the Tribunal was within its jurisdiction. [601 G] The view expressed by one of the members of the Tribunal that even if the Tribunal holds that the rates between two stations in respect of a specific commodity are unreasonable, it cannot make a declaration to that effect, must be rejected. Such a view would deprive the Tribunal of its power to give formal shape to its view. [602 A-B]
