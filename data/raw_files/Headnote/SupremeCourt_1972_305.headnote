 graduate degree in the concerned speciality mentioned in Part A of Anuxure 11 or equivalent." In the present case, the first Respondent apart from having a postgraduate degree in General Surgery (F.R.C.S.) had also a degree of M.C.H. (Arth), Liverpool; whereas the Second Respondent had a post graduate degree in General Surgery (F.R.C.S.) only.
 The question that arose for decision was whether the postgraduate qualification which was required in the case of a direct recruitment to the post in question was also a necessary qualification for appointment by promotion to that post, and what was the meaning of the phrase "a post- graduate degree in the Concerned Speciality." 
HELD : (i) Before the growth of specialised qualifications Surgeons obtaining the F.R.C.S. in general surgery used to specialise in orthopaedics and other specialities either by doing a diploma in Orthopaedics or simply by practice and experience. The Regulations framed by the Medical Council require that in addition to the general F.R.C.S., a surgeon must have a diploma in Orthopaedics before he could be, appointed a Professor, Reader or Lecturer in Orthopaedics.
 That regulation has been accepted by the Government. This gives an indication of what is considered a post-graduate degree in the concerned speciality. Therefore, in the present case, a mere degree of F.R.C.S. as such cannot be deemed to be a postgraduate qualification in the concerned speciality of Orthopaedics. To hold otherwise would mean that a person who has the qualification of F.R.C.S. could be deemed to be specialised in Tuberculosis and Orthopaedics, although he is also a specialist in general surgery.
 Therefore, the second Respondent does not hold a post- graduate degree in the concerned speciality, Orthopaedics and as such, his promotion to the post of a professor in Orthopaedics was illegal and against the Central Health Service Rules. Appeal dismissed.
