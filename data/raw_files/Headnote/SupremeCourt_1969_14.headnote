 The first respondent was appointed in a undertaking started and managed by the State Government, as its own concern.
 Later a company was registered and it took over the undertaking. All the shares in the company were held by the Government though some were in the name of its officers.
 The Directors of the Company were appointed by the Government a Minister was one of the first Directors of the Company; the appointment of the Secretary of the Company was subject to approval of the Government; and, even in the general working of the company, Government had the power to issue directions to the Directors which were to be carried out by them. When the concern was taken over from the Government by the Company, the services of the first respondent were not terminated and he was continued in the same post by the company which he was holding when the concern was being run by the Government, and there was no fresh contract entered into between him and the company. He was later promoted to the post of Superintendent in the Company, and he successfully contested a seat to the State Legislature. The appellant an unsuccessful candidate, challenged the election contending : (i) that the first respondent when initially appointed to the post was a government servant arid, even after that concern was taken over by the company, he continued to be in the service of the Government and (ii) alternatively, that ever if the first respondent ceased to be Government servant, he still continued to hold an office of profit under the State Government, though technically he was in the employment of the company.
 
HELD : The first respondent was not holding an office of profit under the State Government.
 (i) When the undertaking was taken over by the company as a going concern, the employees working in the undertaking were also taken over and since, in law, the company had to be treated as an entity distinct and separate from the Government, the employees, as a result of the transfer of the undertaking, became employees of the company and ceased to be employees of the Government. The first respondent was a workman at the time of the transfer of the undertaking and as a workman, he had, under s. 25FF of the Industrial Disputes Act, become an employee of the new employer, viz.
 the company. In view of this provision of law, there was no need for any specific contract being entered into between the Government and the first respondent terminating his Government service; nor was there any need for a fresh contract being entered into between the company and the first respondent to make him an employee of the company.
 Further, after the undertaking was taken over by the company, the employees, who were workmen, were no longer governed by the State's Civil Service Regulations. Their conditions of service were determined by the Standing Orders of the Company which were certified under 426 the Industrial Employment (Standing Order) Act, 1946. The mere inclusion in the Civil List of the name of a person could not prove that that person was in the service of the Government, unless evidence was tendered to show the circumstances under which the name was included in the Civil List and to exclude the possibility of names of persons other than those in government service being included in the Civil List. No such evidence was given in this case.
 Finally the post, which he was holding while the concern was being run by the Government, ceased to be a Government post in the transfer of the undertaking to the company and became a post under the company, so that the first respondent ceased to be in Government service by continuing in that post. [429E, G; 430B, E-H], (ii) The fact that the Government had control over the Managing Director and other Directors as well as the power of issuing directions relating to the working of the company could not lead to the inference that every employee of the company was under the control of the Government. The power to appoint and dismiss first respondent did not vest in the Government or in any Government servant, The power to con- trol and give directions as to the manner in which the duties of the office were to be performed by the first respondent also did not vest in the Government but in an officer of the company. Even the power to determine the question of remuneration payable to the first respondent was not vested in the Government which could only lay down rules relating to the conditions of service of the employees of the company. In the case of election as, President or Vice- President, the disqualification arises even if the candidate is holding an office of profit under the local or any other authority under the control of the Central Government or the State Government, whereas, in the case of a candidate for election as a Member of any of the Legislatures, no such disqualification is laid down by the Constitution if the office of profit is held under the local or any other authority under the control of the Government and not directly under any of the Government. This clearly indicates that in the case of eligibility for election as a member of a Legislature, the holding of an office of profit under a corporate body like a local authority does not bring about disqualification even if the local authority be under.
 the control of the Government. The mete control of the Government over the authority having the power to appoint, dismiss, or control the working of the officer employed by such authority does not disqualify the officer from being a candidate for election as a member of the Legislature in the manner in which such disqualification comes into existence for being elected as the President or the Vice-President.
 [433F; 434H; 435 A-C] By s. 10 of the Representation of the People Act, the disqualification is limited to a person holding the office of a managing agent, manager or secretary of a company in the capital of which the Government has not less than 25% share, and the disqualification does not apply to other employees of the company. This gives two indications as to the scope of the disqualification laid down in Arts. 102(1) (a) and 191 (1) (a) of the Constitution. One is that the holding of an office in a company, in the capital of which the Government has not less than 25% share, is not covered by the disqualifications laid down in Arts. 102(1)(a) and 191(1) (a), as, otherwise, this provision would be redundant. The second is that even Parliament, when passing the Act, did not consider it necessary to disqualify every person holding an office of profit under a Government company, but limited the disqualification to persons holding the office of managing agent,, manager or secretary of the company. The fact that the entire share capital in the company in this case is owned by the Government does not, make any difference. [435 D-H] 427 Gurugobinda Basu v. Sankari Prasad Ghosal & Ors.
