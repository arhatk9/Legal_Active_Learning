 The appellant was being tried before a Magistrate for offences under s. 420 of the Indian Penal Code and s. 7 of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. The offences arose out of the same set of parts and were investigated together under Chapter XIV of the Code of Criminal Procedure. At the end of the investigation the police officer filed in respect of the offence of cheating a charge-sheet against the appellant under s. 173 of the Code which was intended to serve also as a report in writing of a public servant as required by s. 11 of the Essential Commodities Act. At the trial the appellant objected that as the police had filed a report under s. 11 of the Essential Commodities Act, the trial of the offence under s. 7 could not be under s. 251-A but should be under s. 252 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The Magistrate overruled his objection, and in revision the Sessions Judge and the High Court upheld the Magistrate's order. Thereupon, the appellant came to the Supreme Court.
 The appellant's contention in the appeal was that under s.
 251-A as well as under el. (b) of s. 190(1) the report must be a report of a police officer under s. 173 after investigation under Chapter XIV of the Code of Criminal Procedure, that the report in the appellant's case being under s. 11 of the Essential Commodities Act, and not a report under s. 173 it could only be treated as a complaint under s. 190(1)(a), and that the procedure applicable was that under s. 252.
 
HELD : (i) Cases falling under cls. (a) and (c) of s. 190(l) are triable according to the procedure in s. 252 while those falling under el. (b) of that section are triable under s.
 251-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. As the report in the present case was made by a police officer it could not be taken cognizance of under cls. (a) and (c) which expressly exclude report or information given by a police officer. The offences mentioned in such a report could therefore not be tried under s. 252. [272H; 273C-D] (ii) A report under s. I 1 is not a charge-sheet, but a report made under s. 173 satisfies the provisions of s. I I as the police officer who makes it is also a public servant.
 The report regarding the offence under s. 7 was rightly included in the charge-sheet under s. 173 because both the offences were investigated under Chapter XIV. The case therefore was one instituted on a police report under s. 173 and s. 251-A was applicable. [273G; 274D-E; 275C-E] Bhagwati Saran V. State of U.P.
