 Respondent No. 2 who is an M.Com., but does not possess a Training Degree or a recognised Diploma in Education or three years' experience of teaching intermediate or higher classes or a recognised training certificate, as required by clause 18 of Chapter 4 of the Central Board of Secondary Education Hand Book, for teaching the subject of commerce to 9th and 10th classes, was appointed as Commerce teacher on probation for two years in the N. C. Jindal Public School, New Delhi with further condition that his services were.
 liable to be terminated with one month's notice on either side or a month's salary in lieu of notice without assigning any reason during the probation period, and three months' thereafter. Pursuant to the warning contained in, e letters dated November 2, 1972, December 24, 1973 and August 4, 1975 of the Central Board of Secondary Education, New Delhi to which the school is 'affiliated' since 1971, Respondent No.
 2 who did not possess the minimum, qualifications prescribed by the Board was served with three months' notice on August S, 1975 informing him that his services would not be required by the School w.e.f. November 8, 1975. On September 8, 1975 the management, vide its another notice to Respondent No. 2 enclosing therewith a cheque for Rs. 1300/- by way of his salary for two months from 8-9-1975 to 7-11-75 in lieu of the remaining period of two months, relieved him of his duties with effect from the afternoon of that date.
 Aggrieved by these notices, Respondent No. 2 filed u/s 8(3) of the Delhi School Education Act 1973, an appeal (No.
 22/75) before the Delhi School Tribunal Delhi asserting, inter alia, that after the expiry of the probationary period of two years, he was confirmed by the school authorities in the post of commerce teacher in July 1974, that despite sincere and hard work put in by him his services were terminated on the basis of false and baseless charges because of personal malice which the principal of the school bore towards him; that the- plea that he was not aca- demically qualified was incorrect, that the management which was fully cognizant of the requirements of the rules, having issued the letter of. appointment and subsequently that of confirmation was estopped from pleading that he was not qualified to teach the higher classes, that after completion of three years of teaching experience in the school the disqualification, if any having disappeared the said clause could not be made a ground for terminating his services, and that his services could not be terminated without the prior approval of the Director of Education as provided by sub section (2) of Section 8 of the Act and without following the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder.
 The appellants contested the appeal contending inter alia, that since the school was neither an aided one nor had been recognised by the appropriate authority, the Act and the rules framed thereunder were not applicable to it, and consequently the appeal was incompetent and the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to entertain the same; that the appeal was even otherwise incompetent as the impugned order was an order simpliciter of termination of his services not satisfying the conditions necessary for the application of s.8(3) and that in the circumstances of the case the 'prior approval of the Director of Education for terminating the services was not at all necessary. The Management denied the other allegations made by respondent No. 2. The Tribunal allowed the appeal.
 Allowing the appeal by special leave the Court, 
HELD : 1. From sub-clauses (e) and (t) of s. 2 of the Delhi Schools Education Act, 1973, which define a "recognised school" and an "appropriate authority" 7--1146SCI/77 508 respectively, it is clear that no school can be treated as a "recognised. school" unless it is recognised or acknowledged by the "appropriate authority". The name of the school lending a place in the list of Higher Secondary and middle schools prepared by the Directorate of Education, its affiliation to the Board or even its existence ,it the commencement of the Act can not clothe it with the status of a. recogninsed school. In the instant case, the school was not a "recognised private school" on the relevant date and.
 was therefore not amenable to the provisions of this Act.
 It was not an "existing school" within the meaning of 3.2(j) of the Act. [510 H, 511 A, E-G] 2.Prior approval of the Director of Education is required u/s 8(2) only if the service of an employee of a recognised private school is to be terminated. As in the instant case, the school was not a recognised private school. the approval of the Director of Education was not at all necessary to make the order of termination of service of respondent No. 2 valid and legal. [512 A-B] 3.For the applicability of S.8(3) of the Act, two conditions must co-exist viz. (i) that the employee should be an employee of a recognised private school and (ii) that he should be visited with either of the three major penalties of dismissal removal or reduction in rank. In the instant case, as the school was neither a recognised private school on the relevant date nor was the impugned order one of dismissal, removal or reduction in rank but was an order simpliciter of termination of service, the appeal filed before the Tribunal constituted u/s 11 of the Act was manifestly incompetent and the order passed thereon by the Tribunal was clearly without jurisdiction.
