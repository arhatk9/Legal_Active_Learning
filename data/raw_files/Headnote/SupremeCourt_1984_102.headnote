 The respondents in the appeal and the petitioners in the special leave petitions were the same persons and were employees of the Allahabad High Court. They were found to have removed some used court fee stamps from old files and re-used then in new cases. The Registrar with the permission of the Chief Justice of the High Court reported the matter to the Police. The Police after investigation submitted before the trial court three charge-sheets for offences under ss. 262, 263, 467 471 and 120B, I.P.C. In an application filed by the respondent for quashing the proceedings, the High Court held that so far as the offences under ss. 467, 471 and 120B, I.P.C. were concerned as they fell within the ambit of section 195(1)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Procedure no cognizance could be taken by the trial court without a complaint being filed, but for other offences the proceedings would continue. Hence these cross appeals and special leave petitions.
 Dismissing the appeals and the petitions, ^ 
 HELD: The law is now well settled that where an accused commits some offences which are separate and distinct from those contained in s. 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, s. 195 will affect only the offences mentioned there in unless such offences form an integral part so as to amount to offences committed as a part of the same transaction, in which case the other offences also would fall within the ambit of s. 195 of the Code. [741D] In the instant case, on the facts narrated by the Registrar in his complaint no offence under ss. 467, 471 and 120B, I.P.C. is at all revealed. At the most the offences against the accused would fall within the ambit of sections 262, 263, 380 and 420, I.P.G. which do not require a complaint under s. 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. As such it is not necessary to go into the question as to what offences are connected with ss. 467, 471 and 120B and which are severable from them. The High Court was fully justified in quashing the proceedings against the accused as far as offences under-ss 467, 471 and 120B I.P.C. were concerned, not because they were covered by s. 195 of the Code but because allegations contained in the complaint did not constitute these offences. The High Court was further fully justified in directing that other offences mentioned above did not require a complaint under s. 195 and would have to be tried. [741E-G] 739
