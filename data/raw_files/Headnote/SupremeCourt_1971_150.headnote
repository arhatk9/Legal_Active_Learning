 The appellant had filed a suit for the recovery of certain amount on the basis of a forged cheque. A private complaint was filed in the Court of the Judicial Magistrate against the appellant and another person for offences punishable under sections 467 and 471 Penal Code. The Magistrate found prima facie evidence that the appellant had fraudulently used in the Civil Suit a forged cheque, and committed him to the Sessions for trial. The appellant raised an objection that in view of section 195(i)(C) of the Code of Criminal Procedure no cognizance of the offence could be taken on a private complaint. The High Court upheld the commitment order. On the-scope and effect of section 195(i)(C) and its applicability to cases where a forged document has been produced as evidence in a judicial proceeding by a party thereto and prosecution of that party is sought for offences under sections 467 and 471 Penal Code, 
HELD:The words "to have been committed by a party to any proceeding in any court' in section 195(1)(c) mean that the offence should be alleged to have been committed by the party to the proceeding in his character as such party, that is, after having become a party to the proceeding. Sections 195(1)(C), 476 and 476A Code of Criminal Procedure, read together indicate that the legislature could not have intended to extend the prohibition contained in section 195(1)(c) to the offences mentioned therein when committed by a party to a proceeding in that court prior to his be- coming such party. The offences about which the court alone, to the exclusion of the aggrieved private parties, is clothed with the right to complain, may be appropriately considered to be only those offences committed by a party to a proceeding in that court, the commission of which has a reasonably close nexus with the proceedings in that court so that it can. without embarking upon a completely independent and fresh inquiry, satisfactorily consider by reference principally to its records the expediency of prosecuting the delinquent party. [842-D-H] In this case the offence under section 471 Penal Code is clearly covered by the prohibition contained in section 195(1) (C); but the offence under section 467 Penal Code can be tried in the absence of a complaint by the Court unless it is shown by the evidence that documents in question were forged by a party to the earlier proceeding in his character as such a party; in other words after the suit had been instituted.
