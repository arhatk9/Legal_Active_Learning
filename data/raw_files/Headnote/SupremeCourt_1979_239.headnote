 Evidence-Additional evidence reception of by the High Court-Supreme Court cannot interfere with the discretionary power of the High Court, when the application is very much belated.
 The testator Pearey Lal Singh Bhatia died on 30-3-1952 leaving behind him a Will dated 8-4-44, a widow Lakshmi Devi being his second wife, a son Om Prakash by Lakshmi Devi, and the widow and daughters (Manmohini, Raj Kumari and Pramod Kumari respectively) of a predeceased son by a pre-deceased first wife. Manmohini, the daughter-in-law of the testator and her daughter Raj Kumari had left the family house and moved away to Mathura, while Pramod Kumari stayed in with her grand father and was brought by up him. Lakshmi Devi, widow of Pearey Lal Singh died in 1958.
 The suit filed by Om Prakash for title to a sum of Rs.
 16,490/- lying in deposit with two banks was dismissed by the trial Judge, who on a strict and narrow construction of the will came to the conclusion that Om Prakash was not entitled to succeed under the will and that on the death of Lakshmi Devi the amount had to be divided among Om Prakash, Man Mohini, Raj Kumari and Pramod Kumari. On appeal the High Court of Allahabad held that on a true construction of the will Om Prakash alone was entitled to the amount.
 Dismissing the appeal by special leave, the Court, ^ 
 HELD : 1. A reading of the whole of the will clearly shows the unambiguous intention of the testator that his son Om Prakash should succeed to his estate after the death of Lakshmi Devi and none else was to be the owner of the properties. [57 A] The testator noticed the existence of five possible heirs : his wife, Lakshmi Deve, his son Om Prakash, his deceased son Krishna Chandra's widow, Manmohini and Krishna Chandra's daughters, Raj Kumari and Pramod Kumari. He was desirous that Pramod Kumari should be brought up by himself and his wife and that they should also perform her marriage.
 He was also desirous that a sum of Rs. 2000/- should be set apart for the marriage of Raj Kumari. Apart from that, he did make it clear that Man Mohini, Raj Kumari and Pramod Kumari should have no right or interest in any of his properties under any circumstances. On his death his properties were to go to his wife Lakshmi Devi who was to have a life interest in them. If his wife Lakshmi Devi predeceased him, the properties were to go to his son Om Prakash. [56 F-H] 54 
 2. No doubt, the testator while specifying that Om Prakash was to take the properties in case Lakshmi Devi predeceased the tester, did not specify that Om Prakash should take the properties after the death of Lakshmi Devi in case Lakshmi Devi survived the testator to enjoy the life estate given to her under the will. But this is a case where the testator's intention to give the properties to Om Prakash in case Lakshmi Devi predeceased the testator was so patently and reasonably certain, `no speculation but a compelling conviction', that the Court would be justified in exercising its curial draughtsmanship for the testator and supplying the specific words missing from the will. The Court has undoubted jurisdiction to do so. Therefore necessary words to that effect can and must be read into will. [57 A-C, 58-C] William Abbott v.

 3. Supreme Court cannot interfere with the discretion exercised by the High Court in refusing to receive additional evidence for which an application was made after several years. [58 F-G]
