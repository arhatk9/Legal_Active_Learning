 On the basis of a survey conducted, the respondent, a dealer in foreign liquor was directed to get itself registered for 1977-78 as a dealer. But this direction was not complied with. Such a direction in respect of l976-77 was also not complied with. The Sales Tax Officer imposed a 0penalty of Rs.4,500 for non-registration under Section 15A(1)(g) of the Act. The respondent went on appeal before the Assistant Commissioner (Judicial) who dismissed the appeal. Thereafter it preferred a revision before the Additional Judge (Revision) which was subsequently transferred to the Sales Tax Tribunal. The Tribunal dismissed the appeal. The respondent challenged the Tribunal's order, before the High Court by way of revision.
 Allowing the revision, the High Court held that the respondent was not under the legal obligation to seek registration and so the question of penalty under Section l5A(1)(g) of the Act did not arise.
 This appeal, by special leave is against the aforesaid decision of the High Court.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
 HELD: 1.1 Without calling upon the assessee or the dealer to explain its claim on Section 8-A(1)(c) the imposition of the penalty which was sought to be sustained and maintained under clause (d) of Section 8-A(1) of the Act cannot be sustained by reference to clause (c). [603A-B] 
 1.2 Clause (d) of Section 8-A(1) has no application to the facts of the present case. The dealer did not commence business during the course of the assessment year and as such he was not registrable in terms of that section. Clause (d) of the said section refers to a dealer who has commenced PG NO 599 PG NO 600 business during the course of an assessment year. It is abundantly clear that the assessee had started the business in the preceding year and is not the one who commenced his business during the course of the assessment year 1977-78.
 Therefore, clause (d) is inapplicable to the assessee. The contention that the order for the imposition of penalty could and should have been justified on clause (c) of Section 8-A(1) being a dealer who would, but for any exemption made or granted under the Act, be liable to pay tax thereunder provided his actual or estimated turnover for the assessment year is not less than fifty thousand rupees, was never agitated before the authorities below. The assessee or the dealer never had any occasion to meet this case. It is not a question of sustaining jurisdiction by reference to a wrong section, but imposition of penalty without notice.
