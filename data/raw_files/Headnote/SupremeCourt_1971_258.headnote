 In connection with the assessment year 1955-56 the Income- tax Officer issued notice under s. 22(2) of the Income-tax Act, 1922 to S in the status of an individual. He submitted a return in the status of karta of his H.U.F. The Income-tax Officer passed an ex-parte assessment order on him as individual under s. 23(4). The assessment was however set aside on S's application under s. 27 of the Act. A fresh assessment was made on the H.U.F. on February 6, 1961 on the basis of the return submitted by S in that status. This assessment was made after the period of four years mentioned in s. 34(3) of the Act. The question in appellate and reference proceedings was whether the latter assessment was one under s. 27 and therefore protected as regards limitation under s. 34(3) 2nd proviso.
 In the previous years relevant to the assessment years 1955- 56 and 1956-57 certain loans were advanced to the aforesaid H.U.F. by a company. The tribunal found that S held certain shares in that company. Its further finding was that he held these shares as the karta of his H.U.F. The company being one in which the public were not substantially in- terested the question was whether these loans could be considered as belonging to S and therefore any loan given by the company to S could not come within the scope of cl. (3) to s. 2(6A).
 
 HELD : (i) The return submitted by S in respect of the year 1955-56 was in his capacity as karta of his family. The status shown in the return was H.U.F. He filed no return in the status of an individual. The two capacities are totally different. The ex-parte order was made against S in the status of an individual. What was set aside under s. 27 was the assessment made on him in the status of an individual.
 There was no assessment against H.U.F. and there was no question of setting aside any assessment made against H.U.F.
 On February 6, 1961 the H.U.F. was assessed for the first time though the Income-tax Officer wrongly. called /it as a fresh' assessment. On the facts established it was not possible to come to the conclusion that the assessment made against the H.U.F. was an assessment under s. 27. That being so the assessment made against the H.U.F. on February 6, 1961 was clearly barred by time. The High ,Court was accordingly justified in answering the first question against the Department. [858 D-G] 855 (ii)Since the High Court had not gone into the question whether the shares were held by S in his individual capacity or as karta of H.U.F., this Court had to proceed on the basis of the finding of the Tribunal that he held those shares as the karta of his family. This Court held in Kishanchand Lunidasing Bajaj's case that when the shares acquired with the funds of H.U.F. were held in the name of the karta, the H.U.F. could be assessed to tax under the Act on the dividend from those shares. In view of that decision the loan in question must be held to be dividend within the meaning of cl. (e) of s. 2(6A). [The Court however made it clear that the loan granted in the account year previous to the assessment year 1955-56 could not be brought to tax because assessment in respect of that year was not made within the time prescribed.] [859 B-H] Kishanchand Lunidasing Bajaj v. C.I.T., Bangalore, 60 I.T.R, 500, applied.
