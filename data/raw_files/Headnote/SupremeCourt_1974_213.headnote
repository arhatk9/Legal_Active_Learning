 The appellant agreed to sell his hotel to the first respondent and the first respondent paid an earnest money of Rs. 5 lacg. Alleging a breach of contract the first respondent filed a suit in the sub-court Lahore, for return of the earnest money, and the suit was decreed. The appellant filed an appeal to the High Court at Lahore and the execution of the decree was stayed on condition of his depositing Rs. 3 lacs. The appellant deposited the amount but the decree holder (first respondent), on objection by the appellant, was not allowed to withdraw the amount before the disposal of the appeal. The appeal was allowed by the High Court, and thereafter, the appellant moved the High Court for refund of the deposit made by him. The Pakistan (Administration of Evacuee Property) Ordinance, 1949, having come into force by then, notice was given by the High Court to the Custodian and the Custodian prayed for staying the return of the amount on the ground that the appellant was an evacuee and also for the payment of the amount in deposit to the Custodian. The amount however continued to be in deposit in court. The respondent appealed to the Federal Court of Pakistan against the Judgment of the High Court and his appeal was allowed. The amount. however, continued to be in the Pakistan Treasury. In January, 1954, the appellant filed a petition in the High Court of Lahore praying, that the amount of Rs. 3 lacs deposited by him may be directed to be adjusted towards the satisfaction of the decree as orginally intended, and that his request for the refund may be treated as withdrawn, and that the objections filed by the Custodian dismissed. As a result of political understanding between the two countries, court deposits were agreed to be transferred to the respective countries. On the strength of that law in Pakistan the respondent moved the High Court at Lahore for transfer of the deposit of Rs.
 3 lacs to the concerned officer or authority in India on the ground that the money was deposited in part satisfaction of his decree. The High court dismissed the application but the Supreme Court of Pakistan allowed it and directed the transfer of the deposit to the concerned authority in India after dismissing the Custodian's objections. But the deposit continued in the Pakistan Treasury.
 The respondent thereupon moved the High Court of Punjab in India for levying execution of his decree and invoked the provisions of the Indian Independence (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1947. The High Court dismissed the execution appli- cation. In appeal the Supreme Court of lndia heid that the forum for enforcement and the process for getting relief and execution of the foreign decree was a suit under ss. 9 and 13, Civil Procedure Code, in the Competent Court. The respondent thereupon filed a suit for recovery of the decree amount based on the foreign judgment in his favour and the trial court and the High Court, in appeal, decided in his favour.
 In appeal, to this Court, it was contended by the appellant : (1) that the decree of the Federal Court of Pakistan which wag the foundation of the action in India had vested automatically in the Custodian under the Pakistan Ordinance of 1949, and that therefore, the respondent had no right to recover on the basis of the foreign judgment; (2) the six years period available under art. 117 of the Indian Limitation Act, 1908 for a suit upon a foreign decree having expired long ago the suit was barred by limitation; and (3) in any event the sum of Rs. 3 lacs already deposited to the credit of the decree in the Lahore Court, having been actually adjusted towards the decree, the appellant would be liable only for a sum of Rs. 2 lacs together with subsequent interest.
 492 Allowing the appeal on the last ground, 
HELD : 1 (a) A foreign judgment is enforceable by a suit upon the judgment and it shall be conclusive as to any matter thereby directly adjudicated upon between the same parties subject to the exceptions enumerated in g. 13, C.P.C. In the present case, the judgment of the Pakistan Court was in favour of the respondent, and none of the nullifying clauses in that section being attracted, it is conclusive under g. 13.
 [50OG-H] (b Since the decree was not treated as evacuee property under s. 3 of the Pakistan Administration of Evacuee Property Act, 1957, it is not evacuee property, and therefore, did not vest in the Custodian. The Custodian never demanded any right qua the decree-holder-respondent nor as stepping into his shoes. His claim in the Lahore court was that the appellant became an evacuee and that the amount should not be returned to him, and, at no stage did the appellant even contend that the respondent wag not entitled to sue for the amount and that the Custodian alone had such right. [50IF-H] (2) Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1908, saves the regpondent's suit from the bar of limitation. [502 D] It is a sine qua non of a claim under g. 14 that the earlier proceding is prosecuted in good faith; and any circumstances, legal or factual, which inbibits enter- tainment or consideration by the court of the dispute on the merits comes within the scope of s. 14. Section 14 is also wide enough to cover periods coered by execution proceedings. In the present case, the launching of execution of the Pakistani decree in India was done after consulting two leading Indian lawyers and the circumstance shows the bona fides of the respondent; and the prosecution of the execution proceedings in the High Court of Punjab was repelled, because and only because, the institution of such proceedings on the execution side was without jurisdiction.
 The question thus was one of initial jurisdiction of the Court to entertain the execution proceedings. [502E-H; 503A- C] Raghunath Das v. Gokal Chand and Another [1959] S.C.R. 817 at 818, India Electric Works Ltd. v. James Mantosh & Anr.

 (3)In India, the historical and artificial distinction between equity and law does not exist and equity itself is enforced as law with all its built in limitations. Our equitable jurisdiction is not hidebound by tradition and blinkered by precedent, though trammelled by judicially approved rules of conscience. When law speaks in positive terms equity may not be invoked against it, but, while applying the law, the court can and must ameliorate unwitting rigours inflicted by legaligms, where there is room for play by the use of equity. [503H; 507G; 509C-D] In the present cage, neither party was blameworthy and indeed both were agreed at a stage that the deposit should go in satisfaction of the decree affirmed by the final court in Pakistan. The decree holder had laid claim to the sum to the exclusion not only of the Custodian but also of the judgment-debtor. Taking a pragmatic view of the justice of the case, the Court has to see who should bear the loss in these circumstances. Although the courts and the parties assumed that the court deposit as specially earmarked towards the discharge of the decree, because of supervening political upheavals, and eventual disregard of the court's order by the Pakistan Government, the decree-holder- respondent could not withdraw the sum. The equity arises largely from the iniquity of a foreign government's refusal to carry out the directions of its municipal courts.
 Therefore, the deposit of Rs. 3 lacs should be treated as a pro tanto discharge of the decree in favour of the res- pondent from that date when the appellant agreed for such adjustment. The decree amount as on the date inclusive of costs incurred will have to be calculated and Rs. 3 lacs deducted therefrom. There will be a decree in favour of the respondent only for the balance which would carry 5% interest from then on as stipulated in the decree. [504C, E;
