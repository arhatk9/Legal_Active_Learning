 The respondents entered into three written contracts with the Railways for the construction of railway coaches according to the design provided by them, on the under- frames supplied by the Railways. The contractor was required to make security deposit for the due fulfilment and completion of the contract which in the event of breach, was liable to be forfeited and confiscated. Supply including manufacture, assembly, fitting, fixing and finishing of all constructional materials and fittings including timber was by the contractor. The Railways were required to supply electric fitting; Railway staff would work in association with the contractor's staff for installation of electrical equipment; Railway site was provided for the work and for no other purpose. The Railways had the right of inspection at all times and of maintenance of control over standard of workmanship requiring rectification of work and replacement of materials when ordered.

The respondents' appeal to the Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax. as also a revision application before the Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax and the Tribunal were unsuccessful. On reference, the High Court held that the contracts were works contracts.

 HELD: (1) From the totality of the material terms and conditions in the agreement it is not possible to hold that the parties intended that the contractor transferred the property in the railway coaches to the Railways after its completion. The essence of the contract or the reality of the transaction as a whole indicates that the contract was a contract for work and labour. [139 F] (2) The predominant element in the contract was the work and labour aspect and supply of materials was only accessory although the materials were definitely necessary for the execution of the work. The term that if the contractor died, his legal representatives would have no interest whatsoever in the agreement save in respect of a claim for the money due and for the return of the security deposit, clearly showed that the contract was a works contract. The unfinished work became the property of the Railways and the legal representatives were entitled only to claim for the value of the work done. In the event of the death of the contractor. there was no provision for the handing over of the unfinished coaches by the legal representatives to the Railways. In such an event the Railways automatically because the owner of the unfinished property. [140E-G] T. V. Sundaram Iyengar & Sons v. The State of Madras (1975) 35 STC 24 and Patnaik and Company v.
