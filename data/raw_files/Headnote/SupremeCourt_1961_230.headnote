 The Council of Regency of the erstwhile State of Patiala issued an order dated February 6, 1919, imposing a royalty on bricks from all kiln. owners at the rate of Rs. 50 per one lakh. After the State of Patiala became merged with the Patiala and East Punjab States Union, a Part B State under the Constitution of India, the Finance Act, 1950, which came into force on April 1, 1950, became operative in that State.
 By virtue of s. 11 of that Act the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944, was extended, inter alia, to Part B States, while under s. 13(2) it was provided that if immediately before April 1, 1950, there was in force in any State a law corresponding to but other than an Act referred to in s. II such law became repealed with effect from that state. The legality of the levy of royalty on bricks under the order dated February 19, 1949, after April 1, 1950, was challenged by the appellant on the grounds that the royalty was in the nature of an excise duty, and that the order levying it was a law corresponding to the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944, and therefore became repealed by s. 13(2) of the Finance Act, 1950.
 Held, that the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944, which provided for the levy and collection of duties of excise on goods specified in the First Schedule to the Act did not by a negative provision, expressly save other commodities, not intruded in the Schedule, from the operation of an), existing local law. Consequently, the order dated February 19, 1949, passed by the erstwhile State of Patiala, was not a law corresponding to the Act of 1944 and was not, therefore, within the repeal created by s. 13(2) of the Finance Act 1950.
