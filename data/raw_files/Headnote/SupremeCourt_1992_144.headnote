 The first-respondent was employed with J.P. Coats (P) Ltd., Koratty. On June 26, 1971 while he was going on his bicycle to join duty, on the road leading to the factory at a distance of 1 K.M. the Company's lorry hit him on left side of his body and knocked him down on the road. As a result of the accident, he suffered severe injuries and ultimately the Insurance Medical Officer certified that he was totally and permanently incapacitated to work in the factory. He laid a claim for the benefits before the Regional Director, Employees' State Insurance Corporation which was 24 rejected. Thereupon he filed a claim before the Employees' Insurance Court under Section 75 of the Employees' State Insurance Act, 1948 contending that since the injury was suffered by him while on the way to his duty, it is an `employment injury'. The respondent Corporation contended that it is not so, inasmuch as the accident took place on a public road. The Employees' State Insurance Court held in favour of the first respondent by holding that the respondent was going on the usual route along which he passes and repasses every day to and from the factory on the cycle purchased by him from the advance given by the employer and was not negligent in riding the cycle.
 Therefore, the injuries were caused to him in an accident while in the course of his employment and consequently he was entitled to the benefits under the Act. On appeal the High Court confirmed the findings of the Employees' State Insurance Court. Against the decision of the High Court, an appeal was preferred in this Court.
 Referring the matter to a larger Bench, this Court, 
 HELD : Per K. RAMASWAMY, J. 1. The respondent was trekking the road to attend to duty which found to be the accustomed route to reach the factory and just few minutes before reporting to duty he was struck by the truck resulting in the employment injury. It, therefore, occurred during the course of his employment and thereby he is entitled to the amount as compensation under the Act. [56 GH, 57-A] 
 2. In determining whether a given accident occurred in the course of employee's employment, the factual picture as a whole must be looked at, and any approach based on fallacious concept that any one factor is conclusive must be rejected. The facts are of crucial importance, and the addition to or subtraction of one factor in a given situation may tilt the balance, whereas in another situation the addition or subtraction of the same factor may make no difference. This, however, does not indicate that there are no principles in the light of which a court can decide whether an employee was acting in the course or arising out of his employment at the material time when the accident had occurred. [36D-E] 
 3. Literal construction of the phrase 'arising out of his employment' conveys the idea that there must be some sort of connection between the employment and the injury caused to a workman due to the accident. But it is wide enough to cover the case where there may not necessarily be a 25 direct connection of the workman. There may be circumstances tending to show that the workman received personal injury due to the accident that arose during the course of or out of his employment. It would not mean that personal injury only must have resulted from the mere nature of the employment, nor it be limited to cases where the personal injury is referable to duties to which the employee has to discharge. The phrase 'arising out of the employment' applies to employment as such, to its nature, its condition, its workman is brought within the zone of danger and resultant injury disease or death. In the context of the claims of the labour for social justice under welfare legislation, the principle is that the employer and the employees are so inter-related and depend on each other, than it is in the interest of each that the other should survive, and it is in the interest of society that both should be kept functioniong in harmony with each other.
 The expression 'arising out of', therefore, requires the assistance of causal connection between the employment and the accident. The employment is the cause and the accident is the effect. The causal relationship between employment and the accident does not logically necessitate direct or physical connection. It may be of various steps, namely, direct, physical, approximate, indirect or incidental.
 [33 GH, 34-A-D] 
 4. As a general rule the employment does not begin until the employee has reached the place of work. The ambit, scope or scene of his duty does not continue after he has left the place and the period of going and returning are excluded. But duty is not confined to the actual performance of work, it also applies when it is reasonably connected or incidental to the work. When the workman proceeds on a public road to his workplace or factory which is the accustomed road or route, the proximity of the place of accident, time and the obligation to report to duty are relevant and material facts to be kept in mind. [38-F] 
 5. The doctrine of coming in and going from workplace is subject to reasonable extension. It is common knowledge that the home is the employee's base from which it is his duty to start for work. When an employee travels by direct route from his home to the place of work but for that he has no occasion to traverse the way though private/public road way is the normal or agreed or accustomed route to reach the workplace, he must be treated to be travelling in the course of his employment as incidental to join the duty or leaving the work place. [54 D-E] 26 
 6. The motive to use public or private transport or route to reach the place of accident is not relevant. The employee may use the place, public road or transport services as usual course of means of attending to or going from the place of work, office or factory. The test is whether the employee has exposed to a particular risk by reason of his employment or whether he took the same risk as is incurred by any other public using the public way otherwise then his employment. [54 F-G] 
 7. When a workman walks, rides the bicycle etc. along the public road/street to get to his work, his right to walk does not spring, undoubtedly, from employment, and he also may exercise it as a member of the public. Nevertheless the workman too uses the public/permitted private way as access/means to attend to duty. The question whether he had encountered the danger or the accident exercising his right and to be at the place of incident as a member of the public or as his integral course of employment must always be born in mind. While as a member of the public he may have a right to walk or ride a cycle, drive a car etc. but while walking or crossing the road/driving to reach the place of work or duty he encounters the danger or the accident, which he would not have encountered but for that employment, then it must be incidental to his employment. The motive which induces the employee to do a thing is not material. His motive to go by a particular route is also immaterial, whether it was to save time or to save himself from trouble.
 Whether the place at which the injury/death occurred was on the only route or at least the normal/accustomed route which the employee must traverse to reach the place of work and became the hazard of the employment is also relevant fact.
 The fact that the risk is common to all mankind does not prove that the accident had not arisen out of employment.
 [54H, 55A-E] 
 8. Sections 51A and 51C of the Act give statutory presumptions/grounds as to when an accident happen while traveling in an employer's transport, etc. The Act intends to reiterate the law declared by this Court, apart from creating some statutory presumptions. But it is no corollary to conclude that an accident arising out of and in the course of employment, in any other way, by necessary implication, should stand excluded. To the extent covered under Section 51A to 51D by statutory amendment stands incorporated in the Act but in other respects the court has to consider whether the accident had arisen out of and in the course of employment, dehors the statutory presumptions etc. provided in Sections 27 51A to 51D. [55 F-H, 56 A-B] Gian Devi Anand v. Jeevan Kumar & Ors., [1985] Suppl. 1 S.C.R. 1, referred to.
 
 9. The contention that the Motor Vehicles Act provides the remedy for damages for an accident resulting in death of an injured person and that, therefore, the remedy under the Act cannot be availed of lacks force or substance. The general law of tort or special law in Motor Vehicles Act or Workman Compensation Act may provide a remedy for damages.
 The coverage of insurance under the Act in an insured employment is in addition to but not in substitution of the above remedies and cannot on that account be denied to the employee. [56 C-E] K. Bharati Devi v. G.I.C.I., A.I.R 1988 A.P. 361, referred to.
 
 10. The Employees' State Insurance Act fastens in an insured employment statutory obligation on the employer and the employee to contribute in the prescribed proportion and the manner towards the welfare fund constituted under the Act - Section 38 to 51 of the Act - to provide sustenance to the workmen in their hours of need, particularly when they become economically inactive because of a cause attributable to their employment or disability or death occurred while in employment. The fact that the employee contributed to the fund out of his hardearned wages cannot but have a vital bearing in adjudicating whether the injury or occupational disease suffered by an employee is an employment injury.
 The liability is based neither on any contract nor upon any act or omission by the employer but upon the existence of the relationship which employer bears to the employment during the course of which the employee had been injured.
 [33 D-F] 
 11. It falls foul from the mouth of the appellant, a trustee de son tort who collected the premium from the employee and employer with a promise to expand it for disability, to attempt to wriggle out from the promise or to deprive the employee the medical benefit for employment injury covered by the insurance on the technicalities. It is estopped to deny medical benefit to the insured employee.
 Though the plea of estoppel was not raised by the respondent yet it springs from the conduct of the appellant. [56-F] 28 
 12. The Employees' State Insurance Act is a social security legislation. To promote justice and to effectuate the object and purpose of the welfare legislation, broad interpretation should be given, even if it requires a departure from literal construction. The Court must seek light from loadstar Articles 38 and 39 and the economic and social justice envisaged in the Preamble of the Constitution which would enliven meaningful right to life of the worker under Article 21. [32-F] 
 13. Right to health, a fundamental human right stands enshrined in socio-economic justice of our Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Concomitantly right to medical benefit to a workman is his fundamental right. Right to medical benefit is, thus, a fundamental right to the workman. [32-H, 33-A] 
 14. De hors the human Right and Constitutional goal, the march of jurisprudence emphasises that the law did not remain static but kept pace with the changing social demands to secure socio-economic justice to workman.

 Per B.P. Jeevan Reddy, J.
 
 1. The respondent-employee cannot claim any disablement benefit under the Employees' State Insurance Act for the injuries suffered by him.
 [69-D] 
 2. A reading of the definition of 'employment injury' under Section 2(8) of the Employees' State Insurance Act shows that for constituting an employment injury it must not only be caused by an accident arising out of his employment but must be one arising in the course of his employment.
 The words 'arising out of and in the course of employment' are not defined in the Act or the Rules and Regulations thereunder. While both the expressions 'arising out of' and 'in the course of employment' are not defined in the Act or the Rules and Regulation thereunder. While both the expressions 'arising out of' and 'in the course of' do not mean the same thing, both of them do denote and contemplate a causal connection between the accident (which leads to injury) and the employment. The accident, in order words, must not be unconnected with the employment.
 [58-C, 60 C-D] 
 3. Any injury suffered by an insured employee as a result of an accident occurring on a public road or a public place, even while going to or returning from the place of employment cannot be treated as an employment injury. Once it is found that the accident took place on a public road, it becomes immaterial whether that place is one mile or one furlong away from the workplace. Of course, if the employee suffers an injury while travelling, whether voluntarily or as a condition of service, by a transport provided or arranged by the employer it will be an employment 30 injury. Similarly, if the accident takes place on the premises of the employer, it will be treated as one arising out of and in the course of employment. It is, however, necessary to clarify that if an employee suffers an injury while travelling by a public transport or while proceeding along a public road in the course of performance of his duties e.g., medical representatives, linesmen employed by Electricity and Telephone undertakings, repair and maintenance personnel employed to go to the residential and other places, (where the units/gadgets are installed), to attend them and so on. (68 H, 69 A-C] 
 4. In respect of injuries suffered in accidents not arising out of and in the course of employment, i.e., in the case of injuries other than employment injuries, remedies and forums are different e.g., Motor Vehicles Act, (Sections 110-A) Railways Act (Sections 82-A and 82-J) and so on. If an employee covered by the Act suffers an injury on account of an accident not arising out of and not in the course of his employment, he is not without a remedy in law. Forum may be different; procedure may be different; but he certainly has a remedy; just as an other citizen of this country; neither less nor more. [60 F-G] Saurashtra Salt Manufacturing Company v.
