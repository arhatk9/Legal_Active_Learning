 R died in 1941 leaving certain landed properties. His adopted son filed a suit for a declaration in favour of his adoption against R's widow as defendant. During the pendency of the suit the widow was put in possession of the lands by the revenue authorities.' The plaintiff added a prayer of possession to his plaint. The court served the widow with an injunction not to deal with the lands in any way during the pendency of the suit. In 1951 the suit was decreed in favour of the adopted son but nevertheless in 1952 the widow leased the lands to the appellants. In execution of the decree of the court possession of the lands was given in 1954 to the adopted son and the appellants were ejected. The appellants thereupon filed a claim under s.
 32(1) of the Hyderabad Tenancy. Agricultural Lands Act, 1950 to be put back in possession of the lands the plea that they had been lawfully cultivating the land as tenants. Tehsildar and the Collector held in their favour but the High Court in revision decided against them. They came to this Court by special leave.
 
HELD : The appellants were inducted on the land by R's widow after the decree in the suit for declaration of title and possession in favour ,of the adopted son. After the passing of the decree the possession of the widow could only be that of a trespasser and it was not open to her to create any right in the land in favour of anybody. The appellants ,could not get the benefit of s. 5 of the Act as they could not be said to be, lawfully cultivating the land. They could not call in aid the definition ,of 'asami shikmi' in s. 2(13) of the Act. When the person who inducted the tenants-on the land was found to be a trespasser on the date of ,the induction, the tenants could not continue to have a right to be on the land against the will of the true owner.
