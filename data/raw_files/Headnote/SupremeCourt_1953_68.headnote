 The question whether the idol itself is the true beneficiary subject to a charge in favour of the heirs of the testator, or the heirs are the true beneficiaries subject to a charge for the upkeep, worship and expenses of the idol, has to be determined by a conspectus of the entire provisions of the deed or will by which the properties are dedicated.
 Pande Har Narayan v. Surja, Kunwari (I.L.R. 47 I.A. 143) referred to.
 A provision giving a right to the sevayats to reside in the premises dedicated to the idol for the purpose of carrying on the daily and periodical worship and festivals does not detract from the absolute character of a dedication to the idol.
 Gnanendra Nath Das v. Surendra Nath Das (24 C.W.N. 1026) referred to.
 No shebait can, so long as he continues to be the shebait, ever claim adverse possession against the idol.
 Surendrakrishna Ray v. Shree Shree Ishwar Bhubaneshwari Thakurani (I.L.R. 60 Cal. 54) approved.
 Judgment of the Calcutta High Court affirmed.
