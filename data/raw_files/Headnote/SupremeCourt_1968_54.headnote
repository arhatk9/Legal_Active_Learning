 The respondent a syndicate with its registered office in Montgomery in undivided Punjab, had deposited certain amount with the appellant-Bank and obtained a Fixed Deposit Receipt. The deposit was required to be made for due performance of the conditions of a scheme for Procurement devised by the Government of Punjab in 1946. The receipt was made out in the name of the, Syndicate Account District Magistrate, Montgomery. No account was opened in the bank's books in the name of the District Magistrate and under the conditions of deposit it was repayable to the respondent on demand on due date. The respondent served a notice of withdrawal upon the Bank. An endorsement in that behalf was made on the receipt which was handed over to the District Magistrate, Montgomery. Following the communal riots in 1947 the staff of the respondent migrated to India and the respondent set UP a new business at Amritsar. The respondent demanded the money to which the appellant replied that the amount could not be returned until the respondent obtains a discharge from the District Magistrate, Montgomery (in Pakistan) of his lien on the fixed deposit receipt. The respondent filed a Petition before the Debt Adjustment Tribunal, Amritsar, for an order directing the appellant to pay the amount with interest, and impleaded the District Magistrate, Montgomery as a respondent. The District Magistrate filed no claim before the Tribunal. The Tribunal dismissed the petition holding that the amount stood forfeited by order of the District Magistrate, Montgomery.
 In appeal, the High Court made an order in terms of the prayers in the petition, subject to the condition that the respondent shall give an indemnity for restitution of the amount in case the bank had to pay the amount to the District Magistrate, Montgomery.
 In appeal to this Court.
 
HELD : The deposit receipt gave rise to no contractual obligation in favour of the District Magistrate, Montgomery nor was the bank a trustee for that officer. By an express condition the receipt was not transferable. The name in which the receipt was made out was by itself not sufficient to create an interest in the amount in favour of the District Magistrate. The District Magistrate was not in law constituted owner of the money deposited by the respond-ant with the appellant by virtue of the delivery of the receipt.
 In the books of the appellant the fund stood to the credit of the respondent : the respondent was the owner thereof and it was the respondent alone which was entitled to demand payment of the fund. In the absence of any obligation- contractual or fiduciary-undertaken by the appellant in favour of the District Magistrate, the appellant could not withhold payment of money deposited after the expiry of the period of notice. [399 D-H] 397 Even if the condition in the terms of deposit that on due date the deposit receipt should be discharged by the depositors was to be considered a condition precedent to the enforcement of the obligation of the Banking favour of the respondent, the High Court was right in the exercise of its equitable jurisdiction to direct that the money be paid to the respondent without production of the receipt. It might reasonably be inferred that the receipt was lost or was destroyed and in such cases the court's equitable jurisdiction could appropriately be exercised. the direction of the High Court that an indemnity be given by the respondent to the Bank for restitution if the Bank was to, pay the amount to the District Magistrate, MOntgomery has fully protected the Bank against any possible loss and this eminently reasonable direction was not liable to be set side.
