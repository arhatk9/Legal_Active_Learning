 The Public Works Department of the respondent-State had issued a tender notice for the construction of a road. The appellant inspected the site, went to the place where stone for the construction was said to be available, and after satisfying himself submitted a tender below the estimates in the tender notice. It was accepted and a contract was signed. The estimates in the tender notice were prepared by the P.W.D. on the basis that stone was available at a distance of 26 chains from the work spot. In fact, stone was available at that distance in the Cantonment area but for its removal permission of the Cantonment authorities had to be taken. The appellant was not able to obtain the necessary permission and so, he bad to get the stone from a Much longer distance. He requested for a higher rate but his request was rejected. Thereafter, he commenced work, and after the work was completed the Executive Engineer recommended his case for a higher rate.
 By a subsidiary contract the appellant undertook to execute some additional work for the department. The quantity of work which the appellant actually performed was far in excess of what was mentioned in the contract. He claimed a higher 'rate of payment for such extra work also.
 Since he did not get the higher rates he claimed, be filed a suit which. was dismissed by the High Court in appeal.
 In appeal to this Court, 
 HELD : (1) (a) In- none of the clauses of the tender notice or conditions of contract or in any other document was there any assurance that if stone was not available at the distance of 26 chains the appellant would 'be paid higher rates. It was for the appellant to have satisfied himself before entering into the contract that the Cantonment authorities would permit him to take the stone. Since be commenced work after his request for higher rate was rejected, it could not be said that the appellant was in any way induced by any assurance. The Executive Engineer's letter was only recommendatory and did not establish any right to obtain a higher rate. [472 G-H; 473 G-H; 475 C.] (b) It could not be said that once stone was not available at a distance, of 26 chains, the contract was at an end and that because the appellant had done the work, he should be paid on the basis of quantum meruit. That remedy would be available only when the original contract had been discharged by the defendant in such a way as to entitle the plaintiff to regard himself as discharged from any further performance, and be elects to do so; but, where work is done under a contract persuant to its terms no amount can be claimed by way of quantum meruit. [475 G-H; 476 C-D] Adopi Parshad & Sons. Ltd. v. Union of India, [1960] INSC 8; [1960] 2 S.C.R. 793, followed.
 (2) On the second item also the appellant could not succeed, because of cl. 12 of the contract. Under the clause the appellant was bound to perform all additional work which was required of him on the same terms and conditions in which be undertook to do the main work.
 Further, 470 paragraph 5 of the special instructions which formed part and parcel of the original contract provided that unless he gave notice that he was not prepared to do any extra work in excess of the quantity of the wort: mentioned in the contract plus 30 per cent of that quantity of work, and settled fresh rates for such extra work over 30 per cent, the appellant could not claim anything other than the rates mentioned in the contract.
