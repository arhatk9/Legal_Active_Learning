 After holding viva voce examination for direct recruitment to Class I and Class II posts relating to certain Administrative Services, the Mysore Public Service Commission published a list of 98 candidates who were selected and appointed.
 Subsequent to this announcement, the State Government sent, for the consideration of the Commission, a list of twenty-four candidates and as the Commission approved of them, they were also appointed. In giving their concurrence the Commission purported to take power from the foot-note to sub-r. (3) of r. 4 of the Mysore Public Service Commission (Functions) Rules, 1957.
 Sixteen candidates, out of those who were not selected, filed petitions in the High Court alleging violations of Arts. 14, 15 and 16 of Constitution. In the course of these proceedings, a compromise was effected and as a result of an undertaking given by the Government before the High Court, the sixteen petitioners were also appointed.
 Thereafter, other candidates, who were not selected, instituted similar proceedings in the High Court, but their petitions were summarily dismissed. They, thereupon, filed the present petitions under Art. 32 of the Constitution.
 Upon a direction of the Court to the Mysore State Government, mark-lists prepared by the Public Service Commission after the viva voce tests were produced and these showed that all the candidates-except two who belonged to the scheduled castes in the first list of 98 candidates-had secured marks higher than 56%. Some of the candidates who were appointed on the recommendation of the Government and those appointed by compromise in the High Court (excluding three who were not interviewed at all), received lower marks and it was admitted that many of the petitioners, who were rejected, had obtained higher marks than some of the selected candidates.
 
HELD (i) Discrimination and unequal treatment was established in the case of the 16 candidates selected as a result of compromise before the High Court. Their appointments could not be sustained since most of these candidates had obtained fewer marks than some of the rejected candidates. Three candidates had not attended the viva voce test at all and there was nothing before the High Court for comparing the remaining thirteen candidates with those who had failed in the selection. In such a case the court should be slow to accept compromises unless it was made clear that what was being done did not prejudice anybody else. 1364 E-H].
 361 (ii) The foot-note to sub-r. (3) of r. 4 of the Mysore Public Service (Functions) Rules, 1957, on which reliance was placed to justify the appointments of the 24 candidates selected at the suggestion of the Government, was not intended to bypass the selection based on merit but to cover a case of exceptional merit. These candidates had also obtained lower marks than some rejected candidates and their appointments could not therefore be upheld since this amounted to discrimination and unequal treatment.
