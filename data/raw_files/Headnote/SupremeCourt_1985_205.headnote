 Samaresh Bose, the first appellant, is a well-known writer of Bengali Novels and stories. He is the author of a novel which under the caption "Prajapati" came to be published in "Sarodiya Desh" (the- annual pooja number of the Bengali Journal 'Desh') for the Bengali year 1374 B.S.
 The novel centres round one Sukhen who figures as the main character and seeks to express the feelings, thoughts and actions of Sukhen and to portray his character. This the author seeks to do through Sukhen himself who narrates his own experience. , feelings, thoughts and actions in his own words what he has seen in others, which he despised and what he himself did and how he fell a victim to wine and women and later gradually slided into slimy life from that of the atmosphere he earlier experienced, bereft of any love and affection and proper guidance. "Desh" is a journal of repute with wide circulation and the puja number is read by lovers of Bengali' literature of all age groups all over India, Sitangshu Kumar Dasgupta, the second appellant is the publisher and the printer of the journal containing the said publication.
 On the 2nd of February, 1968, Amal Mitra, the second respondent, and a young Advocate, made an application in the Court of the Chief Presidency Magistrate at Calcutta complaining; (a) that the said novel "Prajapati" contains matters which are obscene; (b) that both the accused persons have, sold, distributed, printed and exhibited the same which has the tendency to corrupt the morals of those in whose hands the said "Sarodiya Desh" may fall and the reading public as well"; and (c) that therefore, both the accused persons have committed an offence punishable under section 292 Indian Penal Cote rest section 109 thereof.
 18 On the basis of the said complaint and after compliance with the necessary formalities, a Criminal Case No. 353/68 against both the accused persons came to be started and disposed of by the then Chief Presidency Magistrate of Calcutta by his judgment dated 11th February, 1968. During the trial on behalf of the accused Shri Budhadev Bose, (a whole time writer in Bengali, Professor of various institutions, the Chairman of the Comparative Literature at Jadavpur University, visiting professor of various universities in United States of America) and one Dr. Naresh Chandra Guha (the Professor and Head of the Department of Comparative Literature at Jadavpur University who had delivered lectures on Bengali literature before various literary gatherings, over the radio and also in the University of Chicago on the works of Rabindra Nath Tagore) were examined. When various passages which are alleged to be obscene by the complainant were put to them, both the witnesses emphatically refuted that there was any obscenity in any of those passages. According to them, the words used by the accused author may have been unknown in literature but they were very widely current in speech; that by introducing these forceful words into literature the author has done a service to Bengali Literature the author has done a service to Bengali Literature and language making the book praiseworthy; that the passages were necessary as they bring about the moral aspects of the hero's character and that the novel has great social and moral value.
 The Trial Judge did not place any reliance on the testimony of these two eminent witnesses and proceeded to make his own assessment after reading the book and that too "with an open mind and a number of times" for the reason that expert knowledge has nothing to do with such cases and whether a book is obscene or not depends on the interpretation of section 292 I.P.C. Only. After setting out in his judgment the gist of the story and referring to various aspects and incidents and at length for considering whether the book can be said to be obscene, he found that the novel in question was obscene within the mischief of section 292 I.P.C. Both the accused were, therefore, found guilty by the Trial Judge under section 292 I.P.C.. read with 109 I.P.C. The Trial Judge accordingly convicted both the accused and sentenced both of them to a fine of rupees 201 each and in default to undergo simple imprisonment for two months each. The Trial Judge also directed that the pages from 174 to 226 of the journal be destroyed under the provisions of section 521 Criminal Procedure Code after the period of appeal was over.
 19 Against the judgment and order passed by the Trial Judge both the accused preferred an appeal to the High Court at Calcutta. The complainant also filed a criminal revision in the High Court for enhancement of the sentence imposed by the Chief Presidency Magistrate on the two accused persons. The Criminal Appeal Number 106/1969, and the Criminal Revision Number 299 of 1969 were heard together and disposed of by a Single Judge of the High court by a common judgement delivered on 27.6.1972. The High Court discharged the rule in the Criminal Revision No. 299/1969 and dismissed the appeal affirming the conviction and sentences imposed OB both the accused persons. The High Court, however, modified the order regarding the destruction of pages from 174 to 226 of the Journal under section 521 Cr. P.C. by observing that in as much as the said novel which appear at those pages has been published in the form of a book also the Chief Presidency Magistrate should take appropriate steps under section 521 in respect of the copies of the novel published separately in a book from. Hence the appeal by the accused person , after obtaining special leave of the Court.
 Allowing the appeal, the Court ^ 
 HELD: 1.1 The question whether a particular book is obscene or not, does not altogether depend on oral evidence because it is the duty of the Court to ascertain whether the book offends the provisions of section 292 I.P.C. It may be necessary if it is at all required, to rely to a certain extent on the evidence and views of leading literatures on that aspect particularly when the book is in a language with which the Court is not conversant.

 1.2 Unlike England where the decision on the question of obscenity rests with the jury, in India, however, the responsibility of the decision rests essentially on the Court. In deciding the question of obscenity of any book, story or article the Court whose responsibility it is to adjudge the question may, if the Court considers it necessary, rely to an extent on evidence and views of leading literary personage, if available for its own appreciation and assessment and for satisfaction of its own conscience. The decision of the Court must necessarily be on an objective assessment of the book or story or article as a whole and with particular reference to the passages complained of 20 in the book, story or article. The Court must take an overall view of the matter complained of as obscene in the setting of the whole work, but the matter charged as obscene must also be considered by itself and separately to find out whether it is 80 gross and its obscenity 80 pronounced that it is likely to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to influence of this sort and into whose hands the book is likely to fall. Though the Court must consider the question objectively with an open mind, yet in the matter of objective assessment the subjective attitude of the Judge hearing the matter is likely to influence, even though unconsciously his mind and his decision on the question. A Judge with a puritan and prudish outlook may on the basis of an objective assessment of any book or story or article, consider the same to be obscene. It is possible that another judge with a different kind of outlook may not consider the same book to be obscene on his objective assessment of the very same book. [47 D-H; 48 A-B] The concept of obscenity is moulded to a very great extent by the social outlook of the people who are generally expected to read the book. It is beyond dispute that the concept of obscenity usually differs from country to country depending on the standards of morality of contemporary society in different countries. Therefore, including the question of obscenity, the Judge in the first place should try to place himself in the position of the author and from the view point of the author the Judge should try to understand what is it that the author seeks to convey and whether what the author convey has any literary and artistic value. The Judge should, thereafter, place himself in the position o a reader of every age group in whose hands the book is likely to fall and should try to appreciate what kind of possible influence the book is likely to have in the minds of the readers. A Judge, should thereafter, apply his judicial mind dispassionately to decide whether the book in question can be said to be obscene within the meaning of section 292 I.P.C. by an objective assessment of the book as a whole and also of the passages complained of as obscene separately. In appropriate case , the Court, for eliminating any subjective element or personal preference which may remain hidden in the sub-concious mind and may unconsciously affect a proper objective assessment, may draw upon the evidence on record and also consider the views expressed by reputed or recognized authors of literature on such questions if there be any for his own consideration and satisfaction to enable the court to discharge the duty of making a proper assessment.

 2.1 The novel "Prajapati" cannot be considered to be obscene on any count, whether considered in the position as an author or that of the reader. Sarodiya Desh is a very popular journal and is read by a large number of Bengalies of both sexes and almost of all ages all over India by teenagers, young boys, adolescents, grown-up youngmen and elderly people and the novel published in the Journal did not affect the moral character of the complainant as well.
 Reference to kissing, description of the body and the figures of the female characters in the book and suggestions of acts of sex by themselves may not have the effect of depraving, debasing and encouraging the readers of any age to Lasciviousness. [51 F-H] 2.2 A vulgar writing is not necessarily obscene.
 Vulgarity arouses a feeling of disgust and revulsion and also boredom but does not have the effect of depraving, debasing and corrupting the morals of any reader of the novel, whereas obscenity has the tendency to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences. [52 C-D] 
 2.3 In the instant case; (i) the character like Sukhen, Shikha, the father and the brothers of Sukhen, the business executives and others portrayed in the book are not just figments of the author's imagination. Such characters are often to be seen in real life in the society; (ii) the author who is a powerful writer has used his skill in focussing the attention of the readers on such characters in society and to describe the situation more eloquently he has used unconventional and slang words so that in the light of the author's understanding, the appropriate emphasis is there on the problems; (iii) some portions of the book may appear to be vulgar and readers of cultured and refined taste may feel shocked and disgusted. Equally in some portions, the words used and description given may not appear to be in proper taste. In some places there may have been an exhibition of bad taste leaving it to the readers of experience and maturity to draw the necessary inference but certainly not sufficient to bring home to the adolescents any 22 suggestion which is depraving or Lascivious; and (iv) the author has written this novel which came to be published in the Sarodiya Desh for all classes of readers and lt cannot be right to insist that the standard should always be for the writer to see that the adolescent may not be brought into contact with sex. If a reference to sex by itself in any novel is considered to be obscene and not fit to be read by adolescents, adolescents will not be in a position to read any novel and "will have to read books which are purely religious."
