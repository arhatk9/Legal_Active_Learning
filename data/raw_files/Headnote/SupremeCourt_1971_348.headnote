 Under s. 3 of the Andhra Pradesh Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1963, the State Government is empowered by notification to direct that the tax should be levied on every motor vehicle used or kept for use in a public place in the State, subject to the maximum specified in the First Schedule.
 Section 17 of the Act vests in the State Government the power to amend the Schedules in the manner prescribed.
 In 1963, the State Government issued a notification increasing the taxes and, in 1968, the State Government amended the First Schedule and increased the maximum tax payable and issued a notification directing the substitution of the higher rates. Both the increases were challenged by the appellants but the High Court dismissed the petitions.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended that : (1) the restrictions imposed by the tax were unreasonable having regard to Art. 19(1)(g) read with cl. (6) and Art. 301; (2) since part of the route lay outside the respondent-State the levy in respect of the entire mileage could not be of compensate nature; and (3) there was no justification for levying tax on spare buses.
 Dismissing the appeals, 
HELD : (1) (a) The facts and figures disclosed in the counter affidavits of the. State do not justify a conclusion that the levy was a general one for augmenting the revenues of the State. Even after the levy the total receipts from the tax fell short of expenditure on roads and allied purposes. The enhancement was only intended to meet the expanding requirements of maintenance of old roads and development of the road system as a whole and is therefore only a compensatory measure. [862 G-H] (b)Further, the impost would not result in bus operators running their business at a loss, especially when they had been permitted to increase the fares. [862 H] (c) The figures relied upon by the appellants in the report of the Road Transport Taxation Inquiry Committee do not give a completely accurate picture relevant to the present case.

 (2)There were reciprocal arrangements between the States and consequently the provisions made by the other States in regard to the 7-L736SupCI/72 854 free movement on their roads constituted a compensatory measure for the tax even though it was wholly levied by the respondent State. [862 F-G] (3)It was imperative for the owner of a fleet of buses to maintain spare vehicles to be available for substitution in case of breakdown. Accordingly, the levy of tax on such buses which can at any time be put on the road is justified and s. 3 empowers the State to levy such a tax on a motor vehicle kept for use. [863 A-C]
