 M had two sons-the first defendant and K. K died in 1921 leaving a widow and a daughter. In 1944 there was a partition between M and the first defendant, and, in that partition, allotment for residence and maintenance of K's widow was made. Thereafter, M gifted away his share, which he got in partition, to the first defendant's son, the second defendant (appellant). In 1956, before the Hindu Succession. Act came into force, the widow of K adopted her daughter's son (respondent) and he filed the suit for a fresh partition claiming a half share of the entire property ignoring the earlier partition and gift.
 On the question of the rights and shares of the parties, 
HELD : (1) The finding of the High Court that the adoption of the respondent was true and valid, both from the angles of custom and factum, is established by the evidence. [476F] (2)(a) Under the Mitakshara School of Hindu Law a widow's adoption cannot be stultified by an anterior partition of the joint family and the adopted son can claim a share as if he were begotten and alive when the adoptive father breathed his last. [485E] (b) Nevertheless the factum of partition is not wiped out by the later adoption. [485E-F] (c) Any disposition testamentary or inter vivos, lawfully made antecedent to the adoption is immune to challenge by the adopted son. [485F] (d)Lawful alienation, in this context, means not necessarily for a family necessity but alienation made competently in accordance with law. [485F-G] (e)A widow's power of alienation is limited, and if only if the conditions set by the Hindu Law are fulfilled will the alienation bind a subsequently adopted son. 'So also the alienation by the Karta of an undivided family or transfer by a coparcener governed by the Banaras School of Hindu Law; [485F-G] (f)Once partitioned validly, the share of a member of a Mitakshara Hindu family in which his own issue have no right by birth, can be transferred by him at his will and such transfers, be they by will, gift or sale, bind the adopted son who ,comes later on the scene. [485G-B] (3)In computing the net available property for giving a share to the respondent, the property gifted by M.to the second defendent has to be excluded while the allotment for maintenance will have to be brought into the corpus. But, in calculating his share, the adopted son's right, arising long after other proprietary events, should be worked out, not rigidly but justly. If the respondent is given his 1/3 share as at the time when the partition took place, since The share, which had been gifted away, should be ignored, the respondent will get his 1/3 share of the entire family property from out of the 1/2 share of the first defendant got by him at the 1944-partition. But it would be unfair to the first defendant to deprive him of such a large share mere because he had not parted with his properties before the respondent's adoption. Equally it would be unjust to the respondent if he is given only 1/3 of the properties given to the 1st defendant and remaining with him at the date of adoption. Therefore, it would be eminently just to divide the properties got by the first defendant at the 1944-partition which were with him at the date of adoption, into two equal shares and award one share to the plaintiff- respondent. Hence, a decree should be passed, (i) allowing the respondent an half share out of such properties allotted to the ant under the 1944-partition as were with the first defendant the adoption, including, therein,:the times set apart, for the mainte- 475 nance of the adoptive mother; (ii) directing profits to be paid to the plaintiff on that basis; and (iii) directing the cessation of payment of maintenance by the first defendant's branch to the adoptive mother.
