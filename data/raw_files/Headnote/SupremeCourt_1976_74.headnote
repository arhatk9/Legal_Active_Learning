 The defendant-appellant obtained an order of the High Court by giving an express undertaking to vacate the suit- premises within a month and a half of receiving a notice from the plaintiff-respondents that they required the same.
 The undertakings were deliberately flouted, and the appellant did not tender an apology at any stage. The High Court convicted him under the contempt of courts Act, 1971, s. 19(1)(b) for misconduct amounting to contempt. The appellant contended before this court that there had been no breach of any undertaking, and that he had only entered into an agreement to which an order of the court had been appended.
 Dismissing the appeal, the Court, ^ 
 HELD : This is a case of a perverse and deliberate flouting of undertakings given by a litigant who, evidently had no intention to abide by them. The undertakings seem to have been taken very lightly by him as mere cloaks for obtaining an order which would not have been passed but for the undertakings. [787F-G] (2) The case before us being a case of a deliberate violation of an undertaking to the court, the effect was the same as that of breach of an injunction.
