 M. & D. the two ex-Chief Justices of Allahabad High Court filed a W. P.. in Allahabad H. C. for appropriate Writ and directions challenging the fixation of their pension in rupee and to re-fix the pension in accordance with the provisions of the Govt. of India (High Court Judges) Order, 1937 in Sterling and then to convert the same into rupees at the present market rate of exchange after the devaluation of rupee on June 6, 1966. D further claimed a direction enabling him to draw his pension at the Treasury in England in Sterlings. Both the petitions were dismissed by the full Bench of the Allahabad H.C. They appealed to this Court after obtaining the certificate of fitness, N field a W.P.
 under Art.. 32 of the Constitution claiming similar reliefs.
 In exercise of power u/s 221 r/w see. 309 of the Govt. of India Act, 1935, the Governor General issued Govt. of India (H.C. Judges) Order, 1937. Schedule III to the Order expressed the pensions payable in Pound Sterlings. Para 21 provided "Pensions expressed in Sterling only shall, if paid in India, be converted at such rate of exchange as the Secy.
 of State may from time to time prescribe". With the adoption of the Constitution in 1950, the services of the three Judges were continued under Art. 376 of the Constitution. Art. 221 of the Constitution provides for the salaries, leave etc. of Judges and continues the guarantees of not varying salaries, pensions etc. to the disadvantage, of the Judges, as guaranteed by Sec. 221 of the 1935 Act.
 In 1954, Parliament passed an enactment regulating the salaries, pensions payable to the H. C. Judges including the Judges who belong to the I . C . S . Part 1. Part 11 and Part III of the First Schedule gave different options to be elected by the Judges u/s, 15 of the Act. In 1958. new paragraph 3 specifying in rupees the new scale for additional Pension was substituted for the original paragraph 3, of Part 11, in which pension payable to an ICS Judge, had been expressed in Sterling only. Part I of the Sch. provide for the pensions payable in rupees only. Sec.
 18 of the Act (reiterated provisions of para 21 of 1937 Order) provided that pensions expressed in Sterling shall be converted into rupees at such rate of exchange as the Central Govt. may from 774 time to time specify in this behalf. Sec. 25(1) of the Act restated the guarantees in Art 221 of the Constitution that the pension conditions shall not be varied to the disadvantage of the Judges.
 M was governed by Sec. 14 of the Act r/w Art. 221(2) of the Constitution as he was appointed the C.J. in 1947. D and N who were ICS Judges opted for the pensions to be paid according to the Part I of the First Schedule annexed to the 1954 Act. They were appointed C.J. after 1954. Before this Court, the three ex-Judges contended that they had a right under the 1937 order to get the pension expressed in Pound Sterlings and to convert the same into rupees according to the prevalent market rate, after the devaluation of the rupee. They further contended that the said right was protected and preserved by the Constitution and the 1954 Act, and that the fixation of their pension in rupees only was illegal.
 Dismissing the. appeals, 
HELD : (i) N & D were appointed C.J. after 1954 and exercised the option in terms of Sch., 1, Part I of the Act, which expressed pension in rupees only. M was governed by the provisions of the 1954 Act and Art. 221 of the Constitution. Strictly speaking for determining the ques- tion of the creation and preservation of the rights claimed by three Chief Justices, we have to look to the provisions of the Constitution and to the statutory enactment made in accordance with it.
 (2) Para 21 of the 1937 Order did not impose any legal obligation on the authorities concerned to adopt the current or market rate of exchange. The Secy. of States' Governor General were free to prescribe whatever they considered the proper rate of exchange. The 1937 order did not create any vested right in the Chief Justices. Further, by virtue of Art. 221(2) of the Constitution the provisions of 1937 Order were applicable only till the Parliament made a law in respect of pensions. [792F-H] (3) Art. 221(2) only protected the rights of a Judge in respect of pension against variation to his disadvantage.
 Assuming this proviso to take within its fold, the right of a Judge in respect of pensions under the 1937 Order. there was no right conferred on a Judge under that Order to get his pension specified in Pound Sterling only, converted into rupees at the current or market rate of exchange. There was therefore no question of any such right being protected under the Constitution or under Sec. 25 of the 1954 Act.
 [793B-F] (4) Since D had opted for payment according to Part I of Schedule I of the 1954 Act, his prayer for payment of pension in Sterlings on the Treasury in England was not tenable.
 (5) N's contention that as a creditor of the Govt. or a person having a money claim he was entitled to the conversion at market rate, 'was untenable in view of the fact that neither the Constitution nor the 1954 Act preserve 'the right' to express the pension in Pound. The Constitu- tion and the said Act only contemplate calculation and payment of pension in rupees. [796 C] (6) The plea of discrimination and violation of Art. 14 of the Constitution raised by N was misconceived. as the facts of his case were distinguishable from the facts of other ICS Officers. [798B] (7) D's contention that the Pound Sterling is intrinsically more stable than the rupee and therefore he was given less favourable terms was contrary to his own election of payment under Part I Schedule I of the 1954 Act and was without any merit. [799A] 775 Appeals of M & D were dismissed and N was allowed to withdraw writ petition.
