 The validity of s. 8A of the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax (Delhi Amendment) Act, 956, enabling the Commissioner of Sales Tax to demand security from dealers for payment of tax was challenged by the petitioners on the grounds that (i) the section gave undefined, unlimited and unrestricted power to the commissioner, (ii) no limit was fixed for the amount of security, and (iii) the section did not provide for any enquiry before the demand of security, nor did it provide for an opportunity of being heard being given to the person against whom the order was proposed to be passed.
 Held, that s. 8A did not give any unlimited or unrestricted power to the Commissioner of Sales Tax. The power of the Commissioner of Sales Tax was subject to the condition that it (1)[1958] 9 S.T.C. 194.
 284 must appear lo him to be necessary to demand security for the proper realisation of the tax. The power to levy a tax includes the power to impose reasonable safeguards for collecting it and demanding security for the proper payment of tax is neither in arbitrary nor an unreasonable restriction.
 Durga prasad Khaita v. Commercial Tax Officer, [1957] 8 S.T.C. 105, approved.
 Dwarka Prasad Laxmi Narain v. The State of Uttar Pradesh, [1954] INSC 1; [1954] S.C.R. 803, distinguished.
 Virendra v. The State of Punjab, [1957] INSC 63; [1958] S.C.R. 308 and Kishan Chand Arora v. The Commissioner of police, Calcutta[1960] INSC 282; , [1961] 3 S.C.R. 135, referred to.
 The power of the Commissioner as regards the amount of security was not unlimited because the order of the Commis- sioner was subject to revision and scrutiny by the Chief Commissioner.
 In the instant case an opportunity having been give to the petitioners for submitting their defence and an explanation having been actually submitted by the petitioners there was no violation of the principles of natural justice. A second opportunity for oral hearing was not obligatory.
