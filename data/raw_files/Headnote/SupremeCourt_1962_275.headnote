 The appellant a public servant, addressed a communication to the Panchayat Officer alleging that the complainant was a prostitute and that she should be removed from the house in which she was living. He was prosecuted and convicted of the offence of defamation under s. 500 Penal Code. The appellant contended that he was protected by exceptions 8 and 9 to 500.
 Held, that exceptions 8 and 9 to s. 500 were not applicable to the case and that the appellant was rightly convicted.
 Exception 8 was applicable only in cases where the defamatory statement was contained in a complaint to a person who had lawful authority over the person concerned in respect of the subject matter of the accusation.
 Prostitution was not an offence of which cognizance could be taken under the Punjab Gram Panchayat Act, 1952. Besides s.
 42 barred the Gram Panchayats from taking cognizance of any offence in which either the complainant or the accused was a public servant.
 Exception 9 applied to cases where the imputation was made in good faith for the protection of the interest of the per- son making it, or of any other person, or for the public good. Even assuming good faith, exception 9 was not applicable merely on account of the imputation having been made in the interest of the appellant. It was further necessary that the person to whom the communication was made must have an interest in protecting the person making it.
 Besides the bona fides of the person making the imputation, the person to whom the imputation is conveyed must have a common interest with the person making it which is served by the communication.
