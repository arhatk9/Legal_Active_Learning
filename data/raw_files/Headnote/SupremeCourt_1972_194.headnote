 The appellant and the respondent applied to the Regional Transport Authority for the grant of six stage carriage permits. The Authority directed the grant of one permit each on two out of six routes to the respondent. The appellant filed an appeal to the State Transport Appellate Tribunal. Taking in to account inter alia Government Order No.2265 dated 9th August, 1958 the Tribunal set aside the grant of two permits to the respondent and directed the grant of one permit to the appellant and the other to another appellant before the Tribunal. The respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court of Madras. The writ petition was dismissed by the Single Judge but 'the respondent's appeal was allowed by the Division Bench on the ground that the Government Order entered into the decision of the Tribunal. In this Court it was urged on behalf of the appellant that the Tribunal made reference to other grounds for the grant of permit to the appellant and therefore the order of the Tribunal could be sustained as valid. The Government Order in question was itself struck down by this Court as invalid in R. Lakshminarayanan's case.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : It is manifest that the State Transport Appellate Tribunal not only referred to the Government Order as indicating the basis for giving preferencefor the grant of permits but also applied the Government Order in assessingthe competing claims of the contenders for permits. Once it is foundthat a Tribunal which under the statute had to deal with the applications for permits in a judicial manner is directed by the Government to adopt any specified method for assessing the merits of the applicants and the Tribunal takes into consideration such direction of the executive, the judicial determination by the Tribunal is polluted. The High Court was right in directing that the applications must be dealt with and. disposed of "outside the ambit of the impugned Government Orders of their constraining interference."
