 The appellant was the holder of an inter-regional permit in respect of a motor vehicle plying on the town service route No.1A from Erode Railway Station to Tiruchengode. The major portion of the route mentioned in the permit of the appellant was lying within the jurisdiction of the Regional Transport Authority of Periyar and the smaller portion lay within the District of Salem.
 The appellant applied to the Regional Transport Authority of the District of Periyar which had issued the aforesaid permit for its variation involving, inter alia, conversion of the town service into a mofussil service and extension of route from Tiruchengode to Salem. If the route in respect of which extension is sought is added then the major portion of the total route would be within the District of Salem. The Regional Transport Authority after notifying the application for variation under section 57(3) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 and considering the representations/objections thereto, rejected the application on the ground that it was not proper for it to grant the extension since the entire sector in respect of which the extension was sought lay within Salem District and that the said sector was well-served by stage carriage services.
 Aggrieved by the decision of the Regional Transport Authority at Periyar, the appellant preferred an appeal before the State Transport Appellate Tribunal. The Tribunal allowed the appeal and granted the variation (including the extension) 69 applied for with slight modification. Thereupon, some of the objectors to the original application for variation filed before the High Court civil revision petitions and writ petition against the order of the Tribunal. The High Court allowed the petitions holding that the Regional Transport Authority, Periyar had no jurisdiction to entertain the application for variation since the entire route in respect of which extension was sought lay within the jurisdiction of the Salem Regional Transport Authority and, therefore, the proceedings commenced with the said application were liable to be quashed. Hence this appeal by special leave.
 Allowing the appeal on the question whether an application for the variation of an existing permit involving the extension of the route or the area specified in the permit, where the portion of the route or area in respect of which extension is sought lies entirely within the jurisdiction of a Regional Transport Authority which had not granted the permit, should be made to the Regional Transport Authority which had granted the permit or to the Regional Transport Authority within whose jurisdiction the route or area in respect of which extension is sought lies, ^ 
 HELD: 1. Section 45 of the Act does not apply to the case of a variation of permit and that when a variation of a permit is sought the application for the grant of such variation should be made to the Regional Transport Authority which has granted the permit even though the entire route or area in respect of which extension is sought lies in another region or a major portion of the entire route (including the new route or area) lies within another region. On such application being made it is the duty of the Regional Transport Authority which has granted the permit to consider whether the variation sought should be sanctioned in the public interest or not. If that Regional Transport Authority grants variation prayed for, then the concurrence of the other Regional Transport Authority would have to be sought in accordance with either section 63(1) of the Act or where there are rules made corresponding to rules 163-A, 163-B and 208 of Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Rules, as far as may be, in accordance with such rules. The decision of the High Court is, therefore, liable to be reversed. [96 F-H; 97 A-B] 70 1.(ii) The Judgment of the High Court is entirely based on its decision on the question of jurisdiction of the Regional Transport Authority of Periyar District to entertain the application. Since there were other contentions raised by the parties which have not been considered by the High Court, the case is remanded to the High Court to consider the other contentions raised in the case. If the High Court finds it necessary to remand the case either to the Tribunal or to the Regional Transport Authority in the light of the submissions to be made before it, it is open to the High Court to remand the case either to the tribunal or to the Regional Transport Authority, as the case may be. [97 B-D] 2.(i) Section 45(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 provides that every application for a permit shall be made to the Regional Transport Authority of the region in which it is proposed to use the vehicle or vehicles. The first proviso to sub-s. (1) of s. 45 of the Act provides that if it is proposed to use the vehicle or vehicles in two or more regions lying within the same State, the application shall be made to the Regional Transport Authority of the region in which the major portion of the proposed route or area lies and in case the portion of the proposed route or area in each of the regions is approximately equal, to the Regional Transport Authority of the region in which it is proposed to keep the vehicle or vehicles. Sub-s. (8) of s. 57 of the Act (as amended by Tamil Nadu Act No. 3 of 1964) which deals with the procedure to be followed by the holder of a permit who seeks such variation, does not expressly prescribe the Regional Transport Authority to which an application for the variation of a permit has to be made where the route or area in respect of which extension is sought lies outside the jurisdiction of the Regional Transport Authority which has granted the permit but within the jurisdiction of another Regional Transport Authority. The said sub-section is silent about it. It, however, provides that an application for the variation of a permit which involves extension or curtailment of the route or area specified in the permit should be treated as an application for grant of a new permit. In sub-s. 2 of s. 58 of the Act a similar language is adopted. That sub-section provides that a permit may be renewed on an application made and disposed of as if it were an application for a permit. An application for renewal of a permit and an application for variation of a 71 permit have both to be treated as applications for a new permit and in both the cases the procedure prescribed for the grant of a new permit has to be followed. The said procedure includes all the steps mentioned in sub-ss.
 (3),(4), (5) and (7) of s. 57 of the Act. The application should be advertised, representations and objections thereto should be invited and the application should be considered at a public hearing at which the applicant and the persons making representations and objections thereto should be given an opportunity of being heard either in person or by duly authorised representatives. The question, however, remains whether the words 'shall be treated as an application for the grant of a new permit' in sub-s. (8) of s.57 of the Act should be read as meaning that the Regional Transport Authority which can entertain an application for variation is the Regional Transport Authority which can entertain an application for a fresh permit in respect of a stage carriage for the entire route including the portion in respect of which extension is sought or that the application for variation can be made to the Regional Transport Authority which had granted the permit, but the procedure prescribed under s. 57 of the Act for the grant of a permit should be followed. [78 E-G; 85 F-H; 86 A-F] 2.(ii) Sub-section (1) of s. 63 of the Act, however, provides that except as may be otherwise prescribed, a permit granted by the Regional Transport Authority of any one region shall not be valid in any other region, unless the permit has been countersigned by the Regional Transport Authority of that other region. Rules 163-A, 163-B and 208 of the Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicle Rules framed under the Act provide for an alternative procedure to be followed when the motor vehicle is to be operated in two or more regions inside the State of Tamil Nadu as authorised by 5. 63(1) of the Act. Rule 163-A says that the Regional Transport Authority of any one region may, subject to the proviso to s.45 of the Act, grant a permit to be valid in any other region within the State without the countersignature of the Regional Transport Authority of the other region or of each of the other regions concerned and it shall as soon as possible send copies of proceedings to the concerned regions. The Regional Transport Authority granting a permit under sub-rule (1) of Rule 163-A of Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Rules is required before granting a permit in case of a stage carriage permit to seek the concurrence of the other 72 Regional Transport Authority. Rule 163-B of Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Rules provides that the provisions of Rule 163-A may be applied to variation, extension and curtailment of routes and to grant or refusal of endorsement as they apply to the grant of a permit. It is significant that this rule does not say that an application for variation would be subject to the provisions of s.45 of the Act but the provisions of Rule 163-A shall as far as may be applied to variation of a permit. There is no express requirement in this Rule to comply with the provisions of s.45 of the Act.
 [94 H; 95 A-D] 2.(iii) The words in sub-s. (8) of s. 57 of the Act "An application to vary the conditions of any permit... by the variation, extension or curtailment of the route or the area specified in the permit...shall be treated as an application for the grant of a new permit" create a legal fiction of limited character only for the purpose of making the procedure prescribed in sub-s. (3) to (7) of s.57 applicable. A permit is a document issued by a certain Regional Transport Authority authorising the use of a transport vehicle in a particular way. That can be varied or modified only by the authority issuing it or by an authority exercising appellate or revisional jurisdiction over it and not by another authority of equal power exercising jurisdiction on another region. In the case of an inter- regional route also a permit as mentioned earlier should be issued first by the Regional Transport Authority having territorial jurisdiction as provided in s. 45 of the Act. If a part of the route mentioned in that permit lies outside its region but within the jurisdiction of another Regional Transport Authority, the other Regional Transport Authority may either countersign the permit or may refuse to countersign it under s. 63(1) of the Act. If the other Regional Transport Authority countersigns the permit then on the basis of the said permit it would be open to the holder of the permit to run his vehicle along the portion of the route lying within the other region. If the permit is not so countersigned he would not be able to do so. But on the permit being countersigned, the permit would not cease to be the permit of the authority which issued it originally. To 'countersign' means 'to sign opposite to, along side of or in addition to another signature 'or' to add one's signature to a document (already signed by another) for authentication or confirmation'. It follows logically that when a variation of 73 the permit is sought the Regional Transport Authority which issued the permit originally must be first approached and it is only after it has accorded its sanction to the variation prayed for, the counter-signature of the permit so varied may be sought under s. 63(1) of the Act from the Regional Transport Authority. It is always open to the Regional Transport Authority within whose jurisdiction the portion of the route or area in respect of which extension is sought lies to refuse to countersign the permit even after an order of variation has been passed by the authority which had granted the permit originally. If it countersigns such a permit, the grant of variation by the Regional Transport Authority which has granted the permit would be effective, otherwise not. At any rate there is opportunity for both the Regional Transport Authorities to consider whether the vehicle in respect of which the permit is given can be allowed to move along the new route or area if the above view is taken. Any other construction of the provisions of the Act would be contrary to the entire scheme of the Act.
 [90 H; 91 A-H; 92 A-E] 2.(iv) Where totally a new route is sought to be included by an application to vary the conditions of the permit or the alteration of the route sought by such an application is of such a drastic character that it becomes substantially a new route, the application may be treated as r an application for grant of a new permit and may be for that reason rejected by the Regional Transport Authority which originally granted it. But merely because in a given case the entire new route or area which is to be included lies within the jurisdiction of another Regional Transport Authority or a major portion of the total route (including the route in respect of which the extension is sought) lies within the jurisdiction of another Regional Transport Authority, lt cannot be said that an application for a new permit has been made and the proviso of s.45 of the Act would be attracted. Then the proceeding would not be a proceeding for variation of the existing permit but would be a proceeding for the grant of a new permit. [93 D-G] Shiv Chand Amolak Chand v.
