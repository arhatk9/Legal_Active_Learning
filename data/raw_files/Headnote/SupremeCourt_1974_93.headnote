 One M obtained a licence for electrification of the Chapra town. Later the licence was assigned to J and thereafter to the Chapra Electric Supply Co. Ltd; which went into voluntary liquidation in 1944. thereafter, 5 persons entered into an oral agreement of partnership to buy the undertaking and their respective shares were : A 8 annas. M 4 annas. P had 2 annas and G & N had one anna each. It was also agreed that the licence will be obtained in the name of Mu alone.
 Thereafter, the Electrical undertaking was sold by the official liquidator on Sept. 15, 1944 to Mu. Each partner contributed in proportion, to their respective shares in the partnership and the total purchase price was paid in 3 instalments. Before the last instalment was paid, the oral agreement entered into between the partners was incorporated into a partnership deed executed on July 10, 1945 and registered under the Indian Registration Act. Thereafter, A advanced some money to buy some new plant and machinery and when Mu. and another sold one anna share each out of their respective shares. Thus the share of A increased to 10 annas, while that of Resp. I & P reduced to 3 annas and one anna respectively. Thereafter, the partners contributed the amount in accordance with their respective shares and a second deed was executed to this effect on Aug. 31, 1950.
 After the registration of the second partnership, the Electrical Inspector, Government of Bihar addressed a letter to Resp. I in which he stated that the partnership was illegal and void as it contravened the provisions of Indian Electricity Act and that, therefore, the Government did not recognise the partnership. Thereafter. one of the partners filed a suit for a declaration that the partnership had been dissolved by service of notice on the partners and for rendition of accounts. During the pendency of the suit, however, the Government of Bihar acting under S. 4(1) of the Indian Electrictiy Act, 1910 revoked the licence to Resp. I with the result that according to S. 5(1)(a) of the Act, all powers and liabilities of the licensees stood determined. A receiver was appointed who took over the electrical concern from Resp. I and R. After the receiver had taken possession, the Government decided to purchase the under- taking and deposited a sum of 3 lakhs in the Court as part of purchase money payable to the owners of the undertaking.
 Resp., I thereafter, filed a suit for a declaration that he, being the sole licensee was the exclusive owner of the undertaking and as such, he was entitled to receive the entire price paid or payable by the Government. He also averred that he alone paid the entire purchase money and others are only his employees.
 The trial, Court dismissed Resp. 1's Title Suit but the High Court reversed the trial Curt's judgment and decree by granting a declaration that Resp. I was entitled to the entire money deposited by the State; because the partnership was illegal and void. Before this Court two questions arose for decision (1) Whether because of dismissal of C.A. No. 1711./67 and 1985/68 which arose out of the Title Suit No. 68/54, the present two appeals are barred on the ground of res-judicata and (2.) Whether Resp. I was entitled to the entire money.
 Allowing the appeals, 
HELD. (1) The doctrine of res-judicata applies where a suit has been tried and finally decided on the merits, if the defeated party wishes in another suit 916 between the same parties relating to the, game properity, to re-agitate the game questions, he cannot be allowed to do so because his cause of action has passed into a judgment and the matter has become. res-judicata. The test is "whether the judge has applied his mind to the decision of the issue involved in the two ,suits twice or whether there has been in reality but one trial, one finding and one decision." [922 D-F] In the instant case. whatever may have been the common issues between the two suits, one issue which is not common and makes the subejct-matter of both the suits different is that whether the plaintiff in Title Suit No. 94 of 1956, is solely entitled to compensation from the State of Bihar or whether they are entitled to recover their respective shares from the compensation amount. This was not the subject- matter of Title Suit No. 68 of 1954. Therefore, no question of res-judicata could arise in the circumstances of the two cases. [921 E-F, 923 H-924 H] (2) From the documentary and other oral evidence, it is clear that the first respondent did not contribute the entire amount for the purchase of the undertaking and under s. 65 of the Contract Act, when an agreement is discovered to be void, or even a contract heroines void, any person who has received any advantage under such agreement or contract is bound to restore it or to make compensation to the person from whom he received it. [929 A-C] Budhu Lal v. Deccan Banking Company Ltd, A.I.R. 1955 Hyd.
 69, referred to.
 Therefore, whether the agreement was void ab initio or was void or valid initially but became void or discovered to be void subsequently, the appellants are entitled to share the compensation money in proportion to their respective shares as specified in the partnership deed of August 31, 1950, after paying the outstanding liabilities of-the Chapra Electric Supply Works.
