 B, a Hindu governed by Mitakshara School of Hindu Law dedicated certain self-acquired properties in favour of the deity Sri Sri lswar Gopal Jew. He executed a deed of trust and supplemented it by two subsequent deeds. Two-thirds of the income of the trust properes was under tile said deeds to be utilised for the seva of the deity and the remaining one third was to be retained in the hands of the trustees to meet the. collection charges, taxes and other incidental expense relating to the- trust properties. Under the trust-deeds the first trustee was to be B's third wife. and each of his sons on attaining majority was to become a trustee automatically. In proceedings for the assessment of income-tax, the Income-tax Officer assessed the income from all the properties in. the hands of the trustees at the maximum rate in accordance with the provision contained in the first proviso to section 41 (1 ) of the Indian, Income-tax Act, 1922. The order was confirmed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner-. In further appeal the Tribunal held that the sole beneficiary under tile deeds was the deity Sri Sri Iswar Gopal Jew. Hence according to the Tribunal, the first proviso to s. 41(1) was no,, applicable to, the facts of the case and the trustees were to be assessed in the, status cf individual in respect of the income received by them on behalf of the deity. The High Court in reference took the same view as the Tribunal. The Commissioner of Income-tax appealed to this court. The, appellant placed reliance on the fact that in one of the deeds executed by B, the trustees were referred to as beneficiaries. As no argument had been canvassed before the High Court or the tribunals below that a deity could not be considered a 'person' within the meaning of s. 2(9) of the Act, the Court proceeded on the basis that a deity is a 'person' within the meaning of the slid section.
 
HELD : In one of the trust-deeds the trustees were no doubt referred to as beneficiaries but on a reading of the entire deed it was clear that reference to them as beneficiaries was a misnomer and that they were not entitled to any benefit under any of the deeds. Therefore, the finding of the Tribunal that the sole beneficiary under the deeds was the deity not open to challenge, and that being so, the case clearly fell within the main section 4t(1), and the first proviso to that section was not applicable to the facts of the case. On the facts found by the Tribunal it could not be said that the income or profits in question were "not specifically receivable by the trustees on behalf of any one person". [31 5 H316 B] The fact that for certain purposes a trusteeship is considered as "property" and that the trustees have an interest in the trust was irrelevant in the present context.
 In considering the scope of s. 41(1) the only thing that had to be seen was whether the income in question was received by the trustees on behalf of any person. [316 B-C] Accordingly the appeal must be dismissed, [316 C] 313
