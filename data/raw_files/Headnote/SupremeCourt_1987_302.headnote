 % The U.P. Industrial Development Act, 1976 was enacted to provide for the constitution of an Authority for development of certain areas in the State into industrial and urban township. By a notification dated 17.4.1976 the "New Okhla Industrial Development Authority was established and "New Okhla Industrial Development Area" was declared.
 New Okhla Industrial Development Authority made the Building bye-laws, 1977, and the Authority in 1978 prepared a plan wherein the land of the Society was earmarked as 'low density residential area'.
 The appellant-Society submitted an application on March 14, 1978 with a plan for approval and permission to develop its land. By letters dated 12th June/3rd July, 1978 and 22.11.1978, Respondent No. 1 intimated the appellants that permission had been refused for development of the land and that the entire land of the Society had not been acquired.
 The appellants filed a writ petition before the High Court, assailing refusal of permission without recording proper and germane reasons, and praying for direction to respondents not to acquire the lands belonging to the Society, and to permit its development according to the lay out plan submitted by it.
 563 The High Court granted an interim order of stay of dispossession.
 During the pendency of the writ petition a G.O. dated 9.4.1980 was issued intimating that the Government had decided that the lands acquired by those Co-operative House Building Societies, which satisfied the conditions laid down therein should not be acquired as far as may be.
 The appellants' representation for reconsideration of the matter in the light of the above Government order was rejected, on the ground that the G.O. was an administrative instruction and could not be construed as mandatory, that the Government's power to acquire land for public purposes under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 was not prohibited, and that the object of the Act, to ensure planned development of the area for industrial and urban township would be frustrated, if individual societies were permitted to develop their lands themselves.
 The High Court dismissed the writ petition holding that the Government's orders dated July 27, 1967 and April 9, 1980, having not mentioned the Chief Executive officer, New Okhla Industrial Development Authority, the intention of the State Government was to exclude the Chief Executive officer, New Okhla Industrial Development Authority from its application, that on the basis of these G. Os. the appellants could not claim exemption from acquisition by New Okhla Industrial Development Authority under the provisions of U.P. Act VI, 1976.
 Aggrieved by the order of the High Court, the appellants filed a special leave petition before this Court, and also a writ petition challenging the validity of the change made by New Okhla Industrial Development Authority during the pendency of the Writ Petition in the Master Plan by showing the appellant's land as Regional Park.
 Dismissing the appeal by special leave, and the writ petition, ^ 
 HELD: 1.1 The sole object of the 1976 Act is to develop certain areas in the State into industrial and urban township in a planned way by the Authority constituted under the Act and as such the cooperative societies cannot be permitted to develop their lands for the purpose of building houses haphazardly. This will frustrate the entire object of the Act. The Government has power to acquire land for public purposes under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. [669B-D] 664 
 1.2 The application of the appellant-Society was duly considered and the Authority refused permission on their application for relevant and cogent reasons. [670B] 
 1.3 The G.O. dated 9.4.1980 merely states that the lands of Co-operative House Building Societies are not to be acquired "as far as may be". Hence the order is only directionary and cannot be considered to be mandatory.
 Moreover, this order is not a statutory one, being not issued under any statutory provision. It is at best an administrative instruction. It does not create an express bar on the power of the Government to acquire the land for public purposes under the Land Acquisition Act. [669A-B] 
 1.4 The Authority, which has been given the power under the Statute to prepare the development plan demarcating therein the sites to be developed for development of industrial, residential and other purposes for planned development of the industrial and urban townships, has necessarily the implied power to alter or modify the Plan showing the land meant for the particular user. Change of user of the land by altering the plan is not arbitrary because it is for the Authority to determine and demarcate the site to be developed and used for a particular purpose to secure planned development of the industrial township.
 The plan was based on the recommendations of the Expert Committee which were approved by the State Government. The alteration in the user of appellant's land does not lead to any hostile descrimination. [670E-H] 
 1.5 A proposal for acquisition of 325-353 acres of land in the village in which the appellant Society's land is situated was sent to the Collector, who agreed to it and after approval from Government, sent a notification under section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act to Government Press for publication. A Draft for Rs. 70 lakhs, being the approximate amount of 20% of compensation, has been sent to Collector by the Authority. In the circumstances, it cannot be said that no steps have been taken by the New Okhla Industrial Development Authority to acquire the Society's land. The question of allotment of alternative sites to the members of the society does not arise as the lands of the society have not yet been acquired. [671C-F]
