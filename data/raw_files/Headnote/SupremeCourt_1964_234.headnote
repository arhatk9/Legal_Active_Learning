 The appellant, the holder of a permit in respect of contract carriages in the Agra region challenged a scheme framed by the Uttar Pradesh Government nationalising road transport services in the Agra region and prohibiting private operation of the services on, certain specified routes. His writ petition before the High Court having been dismissed and Letters Patent Appeal also having failed he appealed to the Supreme Court, by special leave.
 Three contentions were advanced on behalf of the appellant :
 (1) The scheme was only a reproduction of an earlier scheme under A. 3 of the U.P. Road Transport (Development) Act, 1955 which had been struck down by the High Court. The requirements of s. 68C of the Motor Vehicles Act were quite different from those of s. 3 of the U.P. Act, and the scheme did not answer them. (2) Under s. 68C of the Motor Vehicles Act the State was under an obligation to provide 'adequate' transport services to replace those already in operation, but the scheme provided only for 16 contract carriage services. As the number of these services could be changed under the scheme, the latter would be again open to challenge whenever the change was effected. (3) The scheme was not properly framed because it provided for the operation of contract carriages on certain routes to the exclusion of the appellant who held a permit for an area irrespective of any route or routes.
 HELD : The appeal must be dismissed.
 (i) It is no doubt true that while s. 68C makes a mention of an "efficient, adequate, economical and properly coordinated road transport service" "in the public interest", the U.P. Act merely mentioned "the interest of the general public" "subserving the common good or for maintaining and developing efficient transport system".
 However it would be wrong to think that even under the U.P.
 Act Government would not think of an "adequate", "economical" or "property coordinated" road transport services for the common good and for maintaining and developing an efficient road transport system. The change in the language is no doubt there but the intention underlying the words is the same, and even if the exact words of s. 68C might not have been present before the framers of the scheme, it is quite obvious that they took into account those very factors. Indeed the use of the words "adequate State road transport contract carriage service" in cl. (3) of the scheme reproduced the language of s. 68C and not that of s. 3. This suggests that the requirements of s. 68C were probably borne in mind. [845 B- F] 842 (ii) The scheme was read as providing sixteen contract carriages and it was not considered whether it would become inadequate in the future. [84 A] (iii) Under the Motor Vehicles Act there is no doubt a distinction between area and route in some of the sections but in others that distinction does not seem to be preserved. The provisions of s. 51(2) (i) clearly show that the area at the commencement of the permit can be cut down by notifying certain routes and there seems to be no bar to doing it later in view of the scheme of nationalisation. By taking away one of the routes the area is as effectively cut down as when an area is included in the permit but routes are indicated on which alone the contract carriages can ply.
 The provisions of s. 68B also indicate that power is reserved to modify the existing permits either by curtailing the area or by curtailing the routes. Taking over of certain routes exclusively for the State undertakings renders that portion of the area ineffective for a private operator such as the appellant who holds the permit for the whole area including those routes.
