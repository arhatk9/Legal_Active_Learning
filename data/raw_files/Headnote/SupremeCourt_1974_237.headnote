 Certain persons engaged in the business of purchase export of Cinchona pro ducts, and others who were on the approved list of the Director General, Supplies and Disposals, were put on the black list by the Government, because, Government had information that they were indulging in some malpractices.
 On the question whether they were entitled to a notice to be heard, before they were put on the black list, 
HELD : (1) Under Art. 298 of the Constitution the executive power of the Union and the State shall extend to the carrying on of any trade and to the acquisition, holding and disposal of property and the making of contracts for any purpose. The State can carry on executive function by making a law or without making a law. The exercise of such powers and functions in trade by the State is subject to Part III of the Constitution. Article 14 speaks of equality before the law and equal protection of the laws. Equality of opportunity applies to matters of public contracts. The State need not enter into any contract with anyone but if it does, it must do so fairly without discrimination and without unfair procedure. No one has any right to enter into a contract with the Governor quotations for the purchase of goods. This privilege arises because it is the Government which is trading With the public, and the democratic form of Government demands equality and absence of arbitrariness and discrimination in such transactions.
 The activities of the Government have a public element and, therefore, there should be fairness and equality. [677C-E, G; 678D-E] (2) A body maybe under a duty to give fair consideration to the facts and to consider the representation but not to disclose details of information in its possession.
 Sometimes the duty to act fairly can also be sustained without providing opportunity for an oral hearing. It will depend upon the nature of the interest affected, and the circumstances in which the power is exercised and the nature of sanctions involved therein. [678H-679B] (3) Exclusion of 'a member of the public from dealing with a State in sales transactions has the effect of preventing him from purchasing and doing a lawful trade in goods by discriminating against him in favour of other people. The State can impose reasonable conditions regarding rejection and acceptance of bids or qualifications of bidders. Just as an exclusion of the lowest tender will be arbitrary, similarly exclusion of a person. who offers the highest price from participating in a public auction would also have the same aspect of arbitrariness. [678F-G] (4) Black listing has the effect of preventing a person from the privilege and advantage of entering into lawful relationship with the Government for purposes of gain. A person who is on the approved list is unable to enter into advantageous relations With the Government because of the order of black listing. A person who has been dealing with the Government in the matter of sale and purchase of materials ha& a legitimate interest or expectation. Black listing tarnishes one's reputation and reputation is a part of person's character and personality. The fact that a disability is created by the order of black listing indicates that the relevant authority is to have an objective satisfaction. Fundamentals of fair play require that the person concerned should be given an opportunity to represent his case before be is put on the black list.
