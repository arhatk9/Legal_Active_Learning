 The petitioner filed an application under s. 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 before the Magistrate for an order against her husband directing him to pay maintenance. Thereafter she filed another application for an interim order directing her husband to pay a reasonable sum by way of maintenance pending disposal of the main application. The Magistrate declined to make an interim order on the ground that there was no express provision in the Code enabling a Magistrate to pass such an order.
 The petitioner filed special leave petition in this Court.
 Disposing of the petition, ^ 
 HELD : 1. There is no express provision in the Code which authorises a Magistrate to make an interim order directing payment of maintenance pending disposal of an application for maintenance. The Code does not also expressly prohibit the making of such an order- [617 E] 
 2. The provisions contained in 88. 125, 126, 127 and 128 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1973 show that they are intended to provide for a preventive remedy for securing payment of maintenance which can be granted quickly and in deserving cases with effect from the date of the application itself. [618 C] G 
 3. The rate of maintenance that can be awarded under the Code is limited even though under the law governing the parties a competent civil court may order payment of a larger sum in appropriate cases. The civil courts have inherent power to grant interim maintenance pending disposal of the suit for maintenance. [618 C-D] 4.The Jurisdiction of a Magistrate under Chapter IX of the Code is not strictly a criminal Jurisdiction. While passing an 616 order under that Chapter asking a person to pay maintenance to his wife, child or parent, the Magistrate is not imposing any punishment on such person for a crime committed by him.
 Chapter IX of the Code contains a summary remedy for securing some reasonable sum by way of maintenance, subject to a decree, if any, which may be made in a civil court in a given case provided the Personal Law applicable to the per on concerned authorises the enforcement of any such right to maintenance. The Code, however, provides a quick remedy to protect the applicant against starvation and to tide over immediate difficulties. Chapter IX of the Code does not in reality create any serious new obligation. [618 E-G] 
 5. It is the duty of the Court to interpret the provisions in Chapter IX of the Code in such away that the construction placed on them would not defeat the very object of the legislation. In the absence of any express prohibition, it is appropriate to construe the provisions in Chapter IX as conferring an implied power to the Magistrate to direct the person against whom an application is made under s. 125 of the Code to pay some reasonable sum by way of maintenance to the applicant pending final disposal of the application. [619 E-G] Shri Bhagwan Dutt v. Smt. Kamla Devi and Anr., [1974] INSC 214; [1975] 2 S.C.R. 483 at 486, relied upon.
 
 6. There is no room for apprehension that recognition of such implied power would lead to the passing of interim orders in a large number of cases where the liability to pay maintenance may not exist. It is, quite possible that such contingency may arise in a few cases but the prejudice caused thereby to the person against whom it is made is minimal as it can be set right E` quickly after hearing both the parties. The Magistrate may, however, insist upon an affidavit being filed by or on behalf of the applicant concerned stating the grounds in support of the claim for interim maintenance to satisfy himself that there is a prima facie case for making such an order. If a Civil Court can pass such interim orders on affidavits, there is no reason why a magistrate should not rely on them for the purpose of issuing directions regarding payment of interim maintenance.
