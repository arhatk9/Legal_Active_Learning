 In 1959 on the application of the appellant for a mining lease in an area the then Government of Bombay made an order granting the entire area of the mines to the appellant; but in 1960, the State of Bombay having been divided into the States of Maharashtra and Gujarat, the Government of Maharashtra, in which State the mines fell, reserved the mines for exploitation in the public sector and informed the appellant that its application for a mining lease was rejected. The appellant's revision application under r. 55 of the Mineral Concession Rules, was rejected by the Central Government. Thereafter, the State Government changed its mind and again called for applications for the grant of a mining lease, and the appellant submitted its application.
 Meanwhile, the appellant filed an appeal under Art. 136 of the Constitution, to this Court, against the order of the Central Government dismissing its revision application.
 In the appeal, the respondent urged that since the appellant had submitted a fresh application, it was not a fit case for the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Court under Art.
 136, and the appellant contended that the order of the Central Government was bad because : (i) the mines could not be placed in the public sector without complying with the provisions of s. 17 of the Mines and Mineral (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957; (ii) the Central Government ignored the final order of the Government of Bombay granting the lease of the mines to the appellant; (iii) no personal hearing was given to the appellant; and (iv) no reasons were given in the order.
 
HELD (By Full Court) : (i) The appellant having taken the opportunity to apply for the lease, it was not a fit case for interference under Art. 136. [475 B, C] (ii) Section 17 has no bearing on the question at issue, as it has nothing to do with public or private sectors. [474 E- F; 475 C-D] (iii) The order of the Government of Bombay, was only a recommendation to the Central Government for the grant of a mining lease to the appellant. [474 D; 475 D] (iv) The appellant was not entitled to a. personal hearing before the Central Government. [473 F; 475 C-D] Per Subba Rao. J.-Rule 55, requires a reasonable opportunity to be given to the applicant. But the opportunity need not necessarily be by personal bearing, even if it was asked for. It could be by written repre- sentation. It depends on the facts of each case and is ordinarily in the discretion of the tribunal. [473 G-H] 467 (v) Per Mudholkar and Bachawat, JJ.The revision application was rejected by the Central Government because it agreed with the reasons given by the Government of Maharashtra, for refusing the appellant's application for a mining lease.
 The Central Government acting under r. 55, was therefore not bound to give in its order, fuller reasons for rejecting the application. [476 B] Per Subba Rao, J. (Contra) : Neither the State Government's nor the Central Government's order disclosed reasons for rejecting the appellant's application, and therefore the Central Government's order was vitiated. [473 E] The Central Government was acting judicially as a tribunal, under r. 55, and so its decision was subject to an appeal to the Supreme Court under Art. 136. Therefore, it should give reasons for its order. If tribunals can make orders without giving reasons, it may lead to abuse of power in the hands of unscrupulous or dishonest officers. But, if reasons are given, it will be an effective restraint on such abuse, as the order, if it discloses extraneous or irrelevant considerations, will be subject to judicial scrutiny and correction. A speaking order at its best will be reasonable and at its worst plausible. But, the extent, and nature of the reasons depend upon each case. What is essential is that reasons & hall be given by an appellate or revisional tribunal expressly or by reference to those given by the original tribunal.
