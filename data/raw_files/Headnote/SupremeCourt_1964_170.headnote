 Lured by a pamphlet advertising that, among other things, the appellant, a registered Homoeopathic medical practitioner, treated Naru (Guinea Worm), one D went to the clinic of the appellant. The appellant examined D and administered 24 drops of stramonium and a leaf of dhatura.
 After taking the medicine D started feeling restless and ill, various antidotes were given but she was not relieved.
 She vomited twice but the vomits were not preserved and sent for examination. Ultimately in the evening she died. The autopsy surgeon reported that the cause of the death could be ascertained only after the result of the chemical analy- sis was received and he sent to the chemical examiner the stomach with its contents and pieces of liver, spleen and kidney. The Chemical Examiner reported that no poison could be detected in any of these items. The appellant's contention that it has not been proved that death resulted from dhatura poisoning was negatived by both courts below, and the High Court confirmed his conviction under s. 302, Indian Penal Code. On appeal by special leave 
HELD : (i) On the facts the conclusion of the courts below that death was the result of Dhatura poison could not be said to be erroneous. [16D] (ii) The appellant was guilty under s. 304A, Indian Penal Code. On the facts, s. 299, Indian Penal Code, did not apply and the appellant must be acquitted of the charge under s. 302, Indian Penal Code. [19C] It seems that the appellant prescribed the medicine without thoroughly studying what would be the effect of giving 24 drops of stramonium and a leaf of dhatura. It is a rash and negligent act to prescribe poisonous medicines without studying their possible effect. [18H] John Oni Akerele v. The King A.I.R. 1943 P.C. 72, distinguished
