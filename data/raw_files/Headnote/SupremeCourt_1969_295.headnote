 In exercise of the power conferred by Art. 233 of the Constitution and in consultation with the High Court the Governor of Assam "appointed" a person belonging to the State Judicial Service (Junior Grade I) to officiate as Additional District & Sessions Judge. In a petition for a writ of quo warranto the High Court held the "appointment" void because in the view of the High Court this was a case of promotion of a person belonging to the Judicial Service of the State and the High Court was the authority to make the promotion under Art. 235.
 Also; the Assam Legislature amended the Civil Courts Act by Act XII of 1967 by which the designation of Subordinate Judge was altered to Assistant District Judge. The High Court was of opinion that by this device which the High Court described as "a fraud upon the Constitution" the power of promotion vested in the High Court under Art. 235 in respect of persons belonging to the Judicial Service, of a State and holding posts inferior to the post of the District Judge, was taken away.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) The expression District Judge includes an additional District Judge and an additional Sessions Judge and they rank above those persons whose promotion is vested in the High Court under Art. 235. Therefore, the promotion of persons to be additional District Judges or Additional Sessions Judges is not vested in the High Court. That is the function of the Governor under Art. 233. This follows from the language of the Article itself. The Article, if suitably expanded, reads :
 "Appointments of persons to be, and the posting and promotion of (persons to be), District Judges etc." It means that appointment as well as promotion of persons to be District Judges is a matter for the Governor in consultation with the High Court. The Article concerns initial appointment and initial promotion of persons to be either District Judges or any of the categories included in it. Further promotion of District Judges is a matter of control of the High Court. [932 E-G] (ii) The High Court is not right in thinking that it can ignore the hierarchy of courts in Assam as established by law and treat the change as of no consequence. The change made by the Assam Amendment Act XII of 1967 is likely to lead to an impairment of the independence of the 929 judiciary at lowest levels whose promotion which was vested by the Constitution in the High Court advisedly, will no longer be entirely in the hands of the High Court. But the remedy is not to go against the Civil Courts Act as amended, but to have the amendment rescinded. [934 B-C]
