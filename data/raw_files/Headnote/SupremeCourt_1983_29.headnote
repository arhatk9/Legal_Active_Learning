 Under Section 7 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, for the grant of a driving licence, a person (1) must not be disqualified as to age prescribed under Section 4; (ii) must submit a medical certificate in Form 'C', if he wishes to be a paid employee or to drive a transport vehicle, (iii) must not be suffering from an disease or disability noted in Second Schedule and (iv) must pass to the satisfaction of the licensing authority the test of competence to drive specified in the Third Schedule. Under sub-section 7 of Section 7, the test of competence to drive shall be carried out in a vehicle of the type to which the application refers, and, for the purposes of Part I of the test, (a) a person who passes the test in driving a heavy motor vehicle shall be deemed also to have passed the test in driving any medium motor vehicle and (b) a person who passes the test in driving a medium motor vehicle shall be deemed also to have passed the test in driving any light motor vehicle respectively.
 Sub-rules (2) and (3) of Rule 5 of the Karnataka Motor Vehicle Rules 1963 prescribing certain years of experience in driving before granting the licence was struck down by the Mysore High Court in Civil Lobo v. State of Mysore and Ors (1970) 2 Mys. L.J. 410 as repugnant to Sections 4 and 7 (8) of the M.V. Act After the amendment of Section 21 (2) of the M.V. Act, by Act LVI of 1969 substituting clause (aa) in section 25 (2) of the M.V. Act with effect from October 1, 1970 by the impugned Notification No. H.D. 16 TMR 73 dated July 7, 1976, the State of Karnatka introduced a new sub-rule (2) in Rule 5 to the effect :" No authorisation to drive a heavy motor vehicle shall be granted unless the applicant satisfies the licensing authority concerned that he has had at least two years experience in driving any medium motor vehicle".
 The applications for a licence for driving heavy motor vehicle of all the respondents who had either training earlier in a Government recognised Motor Training School or who were themselves running such schools and had trained many, were refused on the basis of sub-rule (2) of Rule 5.
 The High Court of Karnataka, following Civil Lobo's case once again struck down 666 the impugned Notification introducing the sub-rule (2) of Rule 5 as ultra vires Section 4 and 7(8) of the M.V. Act, 1939. Hence the appeals by the State.
 Dismissing the appeals, the Court ^ 
 HELD 1 : 1 Sub-rule (2) inserted in Rule 5 of the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Rules, 1963, by the Notification No. H.D. 16 TMR 73 dated July 7, 1976 was ultra vires the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939. [675 B-C] 1 : 2 Though the substituted clause (aa) inserted in sub-section (2) of Section 21 of the Act confers power upon State Government to make rules providing for the minimum qualifications of persons to whom licences to drive a transport vehicle are issued such power cannot include within its scope the power to make a rule contrary to the provisions of the Act conferring the rule making power. It is a well settled principle of interpretation of statutes that the conferment of rule-making power by an Act does not enable the rule making authority to make a rule which travels beyond the scope of the enabling Act or which is inconsistent therewith or repugnant thereto. [674 C-E] 1 : 3 The provision of sub-rule (2) of Rule 5 are obviously inconsistent with the provisions of sub-sections (7) and (8) of Section 7 of the MV Act. The said sub-rule does, not merely prescribe a qualification not provided in the Act, but prescribes a qualification which is contrary to that provided in the Act. Under sub-section (8) of Section 7 on satisfying the conditions provided in sections 4 and 7 and on the payment of the requisite fee, the applicant becomes entitled to the grant of a driving licence. This right of an applicant for a licence to drive a heavy motor vehicle is sought to be whittled down by the said rule 5(2) and that too by providing a condition contrary to the provisions of Section 7(7) (a). [674 A-C] Cyril Lobo v. The State of Mysore & Anr. (1970) 2 Mys.
 L.J.P. 410, approved.
 2 : 1 The disqualification for holding or obtaining a licence would not include disqualifications prescribed by a rule made by virtue of the power conferred by clause (aa) of Section 21(2). [674 F] 2 : 2 Sections 15 to 17 of the Act prescribe the cases in which a person can be disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence. Section 18(1) provides that a person in respect of whom any disqualification order is made shall be debarred to the extent and for the period specified in such order for holding or obtaining a driving licence and the driving licence, if any, held by such person at the date of the order shall cease to be effective to such extent and during such period. [674 G-H] 2:3 The words in sub-sections (1) and (8) of Section 7, therefore, refer to a disqualification for holding or obtaining a driving licence incurred under sections 15 to 17 of the Act and not to any disqualification provided for in the rules. Had the intention of the Legislature been to provide also for a disqualification prescribed by the rules, sub sections (1) and (8) of section 7 667 would have been suitably amended when clause (aa) was substituted for the old clause (aa) in Section 21(2) by inserting in the said sub-sections the words "under this Act or the rules made thereunder" or by inserting other appropriate words.
