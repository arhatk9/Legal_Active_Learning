 The defendants were the grandsons of G's brother between whom and G there had been division of Hindu undivided family property. G died in 1920 and his widow L entered into possession of his property, namely, land held in tenancy in the former Central Provinces. In 1936 L made a gift of the property to her daughter N. Thereupon K, G's daughter by his pre-deceased wife, filed a suit seeking declaration that the gift-deed was not binding on her. The suit was decreed in 1937. N died in 1941 and thereafter N's children entered into possession of the property. K died in 1943. The possession of N's children continued till June 1, 1951 when L wrongfully dispossessed them under the guise of enforcing the decree obtained by K. Thereafter L continued in exclusive possession of the suit property. In 1952 she gifted some of those properties to one R and the remaining properties she gifted to the defendants in 1957. She died in 1960. Meanwhile in 1956 the Hindu succession Act had come into force. The plaintiff after the death of L filed a suit claiming the properties in question as daughter's son and reversioner of G. The suit was decreed and the decree was upheld by the High Court. The High Court came to the conclusion that L's possession of the suit properties after June 1, 1951 was that of a trespasser, and as such she did not become an absolute owner of those properties on the coming into force of the Hindu Succession Act. It also held, that the plaintiff became entitled to the suit properties on the death of L as the nearest reversioner of G. In appeal to this Court by special leave it was contended on behalf of the appellants : (i) that 'as soon as L took possession of the suit properties from the children of N, her previous possession as widow of G sprang up again and thereafter she was holding the properties in her capacity as the widow of G and hence she became absolute owner of those properties when the Hindu Succession Act came into force;
 (ii) that the suit for possession of a holding by a person claiming to be tenant from which he had been dispossessed could be filed under s. 104(1) of the C.P. Tenancy Act, 1920 read with Art. 1 of the Second Schedule thereto only within three years of the date of dispossession., and the present suit not having been filed within that period, the result must be that L had acquired title to the suit properties by adverse possession.
 
HELD: (i) The gift made by L and in favour N was a valid gift and N came into possession of the suit properties on the strength of that gift. L could have no interest in those properties thereafter. Therefore, when L took possession of those properties in 1951, she did so as a trespasser, and she continued in possession thereafter only as a trespasser. As such, he could not be held to have acquired any right under the Hindu Succession Act because before any property can be said to be, "possessed" 299 by a Hindu woman as provided in s. 14(1) of the Hindu Succession Act. two things are necessary (a) she must have a right to the possession of that property and (b) she must have been in possession of that property either actually or constructively.

 C.A. No. 138/64 dt. 1-5-67. relied on.
 (ii) Article 1 of the Second Schedule read with s. 104(1) of the C.P. Tenancy Act was not applicable to the present suit as it had been filed not on the basis of wrongful dispossession of a tenant but on the basis of reversionary rights. There was nothing in the C.P. Tenancy Act to enable a trespasser to impose himself as a tenant on 'the landlord by means of adverse possession of the holding as against the tenant for a period of three years, Similarly, it was not possible to hold that the tenancy right could have been acquired in a holding so as to affect the rights of third parties by being in wrongful ',possession of that holding for a period of three years. If it was otherwise, valuable rights of third parties could have been jeopardised for no fault of theirs. [303 A-E] In 1951 the plaintiff had two different rights over the suit properties one under the gift referred to earlier and the other as reversioner. One was an existing right, the other was a prospective one. His right under the gift must be held to have been extinguished under Art. 1, Second Schedule read with s. 104(1) of the Act, but his right to those properties. as reversioner arose only after the death of L.
 That right could not have been barred even before it accrued. As against the prospective reversioners L was holding the suit properties as a trespasser. She had ac- quired no rights in those properties as against them. Till her death it was not possible under law to predicate who would have been her husband's nearest reversioner on the date of her death. [303 E-G]
