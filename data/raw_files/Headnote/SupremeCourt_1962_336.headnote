 A charge sheet was placed on 19-1-1951 before the Chief Presidency Magistrate, Calcutta, against the 1st respondent and others under s. 120-B read with s. 409 of the Indian Penal Code and s . 5 (2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. By an order of the Government the case was allotted to the Special judge under the West Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act. At the instance of the respondents, the Calcutta High Court quashed the allotment on 4-4-1952 on the ground that s. 4 (1) of the Act which enabled the Government to allot the case was unconstitutional. The Act was amended by an Ordinance and later the Ordinance was replaced by the West Bengal Act 12 of 1932. On the promulgation of the Ordinance the charge sheets against the respondents were refiled in the Court of the Special judge. This was again challenged and the High Court held that as the summons issued by the Special judge on the refiled charge sheet lapsed with the Ordinance and as neither the Act nor the Ordinance made a provision to save the proceedings instituted under the Ordinance, there could be no further proceedings against the respondents. The Government filed a fresh charge sheet on 18-6- 1953 against the respondents.
 The respondents questioned the jurisdiction of the Special judge on the ground that by reason of s. 12 of the Act of 1952 it was the Chief Presidency Magistrate alone who had jurisdiction over the case and that could not be legally allotted to the Special judge. The Special judge having over-ruled the objection, the matter was again taken up to the High Court in revision. The High Court dismissed the Revision Petition and this Court also declined to grant special leave at that stage. The respondents, again raised an objection before the Special Judge who this time upheld the objection and discharged the respondents. The Government without questioning the order of the Special Judge filed a charge sheet before the Chief Presidents Magistrate who issued process against the respondents. he first respondent again challenged this by way of a 543 revision in the High Court. On 19-12-56 the High Court set aside the order of the Chief Presidency Magistrate on the ground that the effect of the earlier order of the High Court dated 24-3-1953 was to uphold the jurisdiction of the Special judge and therefore the Chief Presidency Magistrate could not try the case. The Government filed a fresh charge sheet in the Court of the Special Judge to which the first respondent objected again and took it before the High Court for revision the High Court held that by reason of s. 12 of the Act, it was the Chief Presidency Magistrate who had jurisdiction and not the Special judge.
 Held, that the decision of the High Court regarding the unconstitutionality of s. 4 (1) of the first Act was binding between the parties and its correctness could not be collaterally or incidentally challenged there not having been an appeal taken from that decision.
 Held, further, that though the effect of quashing of the allotment by the High Court was to leave the charge sheet pending before the Chief Presidency Magistrate, the effect of the subsequent proceed resulting in the decision of the High Court date the December, 19, 1956, was that the Special judge had jurisdiction over the case and this decision bound the parties.
 Held, further, that the fresh charge sheet filed came within the prohibition of s. 12 and it could not be considered to be the initiation of a new proceeding.
