 The respondent was granted a licence for the construction of Kalyan Mantapcum-Lecture Hall within the limits of the municipality, subject to the provisions of the Madras Public Health Act, 1939 and the Scheme framed under the Madras Town Planning Act, 1920. The Municipal Committee, by a resolution, approved the plan for conversion of Kalyan Mantap-cum-Lecture Hall into a cinema theatre. In a petition under article 22 6 of the Constitution the High Court held that the cinema theatre could not be constructed in a place other than the specified localities without proper sanction, but since the third respondent had spent a large sum of money, it did not quash the impeached resolution.
 on appeal to this Court the appellant contended that the Town Planning Scheme forbade any cinema building at the place asked for and, therefore, the resolution was invalid.
 A owing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) The resolution of the municipality had no legal foundation. The illegal construction of a cinema building materially affects the right to or enjoyment of the property by persons residing in the residential area. The municipal authorities owe a duty and obligation under the statute to see that the residential area is not spoiled by unauthorised construction. A scheme in the residential area means planned orderliness in accordance with the requirements of the residents.
 [685H; 686E] (2) The High Court was not correct in holding that though the impeached resolution was in violation of the Town Planning Scheme, yet it could not be disturbed because the third respondent was likely to have spent money. The excess of statutory power could not be validated by acquiescence in or by the operation of estoppel. The Court declines to interfere for the assistance of persons who seek its aid to relieve them against express statutory provisions. [686D] Maddison V.
