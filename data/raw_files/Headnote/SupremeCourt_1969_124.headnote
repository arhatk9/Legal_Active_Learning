 The Madhya Pradesh Tendu Patta (Vyapar Viniyaman) Adhiniyam, 1964 was passed for regulating trade in tendu leaves in the public interest by creating a State monopoly in that trade, that is, in the purchase and sale of tendu leaves. Under- s. 5(1) when the Act is brought into force in an area, no person, except the Government, its authorised officer or agent in respect of the unit where the leaves are grown can purchase or transport them. Explanation I permits purchases from Government, its authorised officers and agents and s.
 5(2) permits two categories of persons to transport the leaves, namely : (a) a grower, from one place to another within the unit where they are grown; and (b) the purchaser, under Explanation 1, either for manufacturing bides within the State or for their export outside the State, under a permit in accordance with its terms and conditions. Rule 9 of the 1965 Rules made under the Act provides for the application to be made for a transport permit.
 The appellants had several branches in different areas of the State. Whenever they purchase the leaves they have to be moved to their warehouses outside and from there to their branches and then, to the sattedars, that is, independent contractors, who undertake to have bidis rolled through mazdoors to whom the sattedars distribute tobacco and the tendu leaves supplied by the appellants. There were 6 to 7 thousand such sattedars and the number of mazdoors employed by the sattedars was very large.
 The appellants applied for and obtained permits authorising them to transport the leaves purchased by them to their godowns situate outside the units. On June 4, 1965, the Divisional Forest Officer issued an order which forbade altogether movement of old leaves, that is, those which were in stock when the Rules came into force. The order also provided that permits issues by the Forest Department would be necessary for transport of the leaves from warehouses to branches, and from these to the sattedars, and when the sattedars distributed leaves to the mazdoors employed by him. On a representation by the appellants, pointing out the difficulties involved in obtaining such permits the branch managers of the bidi manufacturing firms were authorised to issue transport permits to the sattedars, but finding that the branch managers were issuing permits for bulk transport, the District Forest Officer rescinded the relaxation. The appellants thereupon challenged the validity of s. 5 and r.
 9 in the High Court as violating Art. 19(1)(f) and (g), and Arts. 301 and 304 of the Constitution. The High Court dismissed the petition.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : -What s. 5(2) and r. 9 are intended to require is that a manufacturer must have a permit to move the leaves purchased by him from the 401 unit where he has purchased them to his warehouse outside, from there to his branches and also when he transports then to his sattedars. But no such permit is intended to be necessary when the leaves are distributed for the manufacture of bidis by those sattedars to the mazdoors.
 Such a construction would make the restriction imposed reasonable within the meaning or Arts. 19(1) (5) and (6) and Art. 304(b). [412A-C] The Legislature thought that it was in the public interest to entrust the entire trade to the State which would fix reasonable prices in consultation with an advisory committee and make it, at the same time, compulsory for the State to purchase the entire stock which would be offered for sale at those prices. Considering the object of the Act, it cannot be said that such a monopoly was unreasonable. But transport of the leaves once purchased or sold would not prime facie be an integral part of monopoly in the trade and restrictions on such transport should be reasonable. It may be that free movement of leaves even after they are sold would create difficulty in effectively implementing the intended monopoly in the trade or that such free movement would make checking of illegitimate transactions in the leaves difficult and therefore some check on movement is necessary. But, considering the extraordinary inconvenience which would be caused to the manufacturer and balancing that with the mischief feared by the State, when s. 5 was enacted, it could not have been intended that the manufacturer should also obtain permits in respect of leaves distributed, to the vast number of mazdoors for rolling the bidis, by the sattedars who were themselves considerable in number. [41 OC; 411G] In the view, the restrictions against free transport cannot be held to be unreasonable except to the extent of its requiring a permit for distribution to the mazdoors. The order canceling the concession also could not be challenged as an unreasonable restriction. [412D]
