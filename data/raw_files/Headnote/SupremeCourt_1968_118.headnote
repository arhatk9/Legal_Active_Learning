 The appellant was a tenant in the respondent's house on a contractual rent of Rs. 300 per month. The respondent filed a suit claiming possession on the ground of non--payment of rent and claimed arrears of rent and mesne profits. The appellant filed his written statement, asking for fixation of the standard rent at Rs. 125 per month. He alleged that the respondent had recovered more than the, rent legitimately due and prayed for the dismissal of the suit.
 He; also filed a suit on 14th March 1957 claiming refund of rent paid between 14th March 1950 and 4th August 1954 at the rate of Rs. 300 per month, but he did not pay the standard rent due from him from 4th August 1954 nor was he ready and willing to pay it. The trial court decreed the respondent's suit for eviction. The appellate court set aside the decree holding that the standard rent was Rs. 125 and directed the respondent to render an account of the over payments made to him. In revision, the High Court accepted the finding of the appellate court that the standard rent was Rs. 125 but set aside the decree of the appellate court holding that the rent was in arrear from 4th August 1954 and directed the appellant to pay mesne profits at Rs. 125 per month.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended that (1) the High Court had no jurisdiction. to interfere with the decree of the appellate Court under s.115, Civil Procedure Code;(2) The rent was not in arrear and should be treated as paid by adjustment or deduction of the overpayments; and (3) the appellant was entitled to the protection of s. 12(1) and s.12 (3) (b) of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rents Control Act, 1947.
 
HELD : (1 ) On the pleadings in the respondent's suit, the appellate Court had acted illegally and with material irregularity as it had no power to pass a decree directing the respondent to render an account in respect of any overpayment of rent made to him. Therefore, the High Court had power to revise the decree. [61D] (2) Section 20 of the Act gives the tenant a general right to recovery of overpaid rent within 6 months from the date of payment. He may also adjust the overpayment by deduction from any rent payable by him, But if the amount is incapable of recovery because of the bar of limitation it cannot be recovered by deduction, that is. the right of recovery by deduction is barred at the same time as the right of recovery by suit. [62D] In the present case, the right of recovery of the excess rent paid before 4th August 1954 became barred on and after 4th February 1955. As the claim for recovery became barred.
 the appellant could not thereafter deduct it from the rent failing due. Since he never deducted it from the 59 rent at any time, but filed a suit for its recovery, the overpayment could not be deducted from or adjusted against the rent falling due after 4th August 1954, and therefore, the rent was in arrears. [63F--G] Sohrab Tavaria v. Jafferali, 58 Bom. L.R. 680, 687-88 and Karamsey Kanji v. Velji Virji, 56 Bom. L.R. 619, 626, approved.
 Bayley v-.Walker, [1925] 1 K.B. 447, referred to.
 (3) The appellant could not claim the protection of s.
 12(1) or s.12(3) (b) of the Act, because, (a) he was never ready or willing to pay the standard rent during the pendency of the suit, (b) he did not at the first hearing of the, suit or on any other date fixed by the trial court pay or tender the standard rent and (c) he did not thereafter continue to pay or deposit in Court such rent till the suit was finally decided [63H; 64A B]
