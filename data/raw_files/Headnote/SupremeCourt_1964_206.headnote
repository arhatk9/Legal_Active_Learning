 The appellant challenged the election of the respondent to the State Legislative Assembly by alleging corrupt practices against the respondent, his agents and other persons. The respondent raised a preliminary objection that the allegations regarding corrupt practices were vague and indefinite. The Tribunal held that the election petition suffered from those defects and was liable to be dismissed unless the appellant either applied for leave to amend the petition or amplified the particulars as to corrupt practices. The appellant filed a petition for amendment as well as an amended election petition. Thereupon, the respondent filed an application praying for the dismissal of the election petition on the grounds, that one of the persons who was alleged by the appellant to have been guilty of corrupt practices was a candidate for election, that he was therefore a necessary party to the petition and that as he was not made a party, the election petition was liable to be dismissed under s. 90(3) of the Representation of the People Act (43 of 1951). The Tribunal, after arguments, dismissed the election petition. The appeal to the High Court was unsuccessful. In the appeal to the Supreme Court it was contended that : (i) section 90(3) of the Act applied only to petitions as originally filed and not to amended petitions, (ii) there was no allegation of corrupt practice against the candidate who was not impleaded, (iii) the Tribunal had no power to allow or direct amendment of the election petition and (iv) the Tribunal should have either allowed the appellant to join as a respondent the candidate who was not impleaded or allowed him to further amend the petition by deleting all reference to that candidate.
 
HELD : (i) Section 90(3) give in independent power to the Tribunal to dismiss an election petition on the ground of non-compliance with the provisions of ss. 81 and 82 despite the fact that the Election Commission bid not chosen to dismiss it under s. 85. Since an election petition could be permitted by the Tribunal to be amended, a petition which had been amended would be the only petition before it and the Tribunal could exercise the powers conferred upon it by s. 90(3) with respect to such an amended petition. [399G-H].
 (ii) The allegations against the candidate who was not impleaded amounted to allegations Of currupt practice.
 [400E].
 (iii) The Tribunal was competent to allow or give an option to the appellant to amend the petition. By giving such option to amend or furnish better particulars the Tribunal was not enabling the appellant to remove the defect pertaining to the presentation of the petition or the joinder of parties under ss. 81 and 82 of the Act. [402A-B].
 394 Harish Chandra Bajpai v. Triloki Singh, [1956] INSC 84; [1957] S. C. R. 370, followed.
 (iv) Assuming that the Tribunal could permit joinder of parties, the presentation of the application of the appellant under O. I r. 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Act 5 of 1908) was beyond the period prescribed for presenting an election petition and therefore, could not be granted. In any event the matter was within the descretion of the Tribunal with which this Court would not lightly interfere. The Tribunal was also right in not allowing a further amendment, as to allow such an amendment for avoiding the penalty under s. 90(3) would have been grossly improper. [40 D-G].
