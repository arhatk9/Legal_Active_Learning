 The first accused borrowed money from the deceased and as the money was not repaid the deceased filed a suit against him. Angered by being drawn into litigation, A. 1 to A. 3 and three others came upon the deceased in a jeep driven by A. 4, and A. 1 to A. 3 getting down from the jeep stabbed the deceased with daggers and while the deceased was falling down carried him away in the jeep. The companion of the deceased at the time when the occurrence took place gave the first information to the police. Three days after the incident the dead body was recovered, and inquest was held.
 The four accused were charged with offences of murder and kidnapping, but the trial court acquitted them for the reasons : (i) the First Information did not contain the overt acts attributed to each of the accused; (ii) details of the overt acts were not mentioned in the Inquest Report and therefore it must be inferred that the eye witnesses did not mention the overt acts to the police; (iii) there was no reliable evidence identifying the dead body, and (iv) the motive was not sufficient to impel the accused to murder the deceased.
 On appeal the High Court convicted A. 1 to A. 3 for offences tinder s. 302 read with ss. 34 and 148 and under s. 364 read with s. 34 I.P.C.- A. 4 was convicted under s. 302 read with s. 149 and under s. 364 read with s.-34, I.P.C.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court of A. 1 to A. 3 and allowing that of A. 4, 
HELD : The High Court rightly believed the evidence of the prosecution witnesses and there was no error in its approach to the case. [91 A-B].
 (1) The witness who gave the first information must have been extremely perturbed having seen the attack on his companion. Even so, all the essential details which a first information should contain are there. The names of the accused and the circumstances of the murderous assault are mentioned. Shorn of minute detail the broad picture presented by the prosecution was mentioned in the first information which was lodged soon after the occurrence. it is neither customary nor necessary to mention every minute detail in the first information. [88 A-C] (2) The object of the inquest proceedings under s. 174 Cr.
 P.C. is merely to ascertain whether a person has died under suspicious circumstances or whether it was a case of unnatural death, and if so, what was the apparent cause of death. The question regarding the details as to how the deceased was assaulted or who assaulted him or under what circumstances is foreign to the proceedings. Therefore, neither in practice nor in law was it necessary for the police to have mentioned details of all the overt acts of the accused in the inquest report. From such absence of details in the inquest report it was wrong to presume that the witnesses did not mention the details to the police during investigation. [89 C-E] (3) The dead body was identifiable and was identified by the son of the deceased, the witness who gave the first information and a co-villager. [90 E] 85 (4) Various persons react to circumstances in different ways and it is difficult to say when a motive would be sufficient for a crime. Moreover, in view of the independent testimony of eye witnesses, whom the High Court has believed the question of motive become academic. [90G- H].
 (5) This is not a case where two views are possible. The only possible view is that taken by the High Court and the High Court rightly reversed the acquittal under s. 417 Cr.
 P. C. [91 C-D].
 6(a) The medical evidence showes that the deceased must have died before the body was put in the jeep and so the charge of kidnapping fails. [91D-E].
 (b) As regards A. 4 there is no reliable evidence to prove actual complicity in the murder. He is a young boy of 18 engaged as a driver. His name is not mentioned in the first information to the police as having taken any part in the assault. [91 H].
 (c) Therefore, he could not be convicted for murder. He could be guilty of the offence under s. 201 I. P. C. but he was acquitted of that charge by the trial court. The High Court had not convicted him under that section and no appeal against his acquittal has been filed in this Court and hence he could not be convicted of that offence either. [92 C-D].
