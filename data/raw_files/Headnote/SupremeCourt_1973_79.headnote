 The appellant firm according to its partnership deed was constituted of five partners one of whom was a minor represented by his father. One of the terms in the partnership deed was that the profit and loss of the busi- ness would be divided and borne between the partners in equal shares. The appellant firm made an application under s.26A of the Income-tax Act 1922 for the registration of the firm for the year 1956-57 on 30-6-1955, the last day for making the application. Along with the application as required by the rules, a copy of the partnership deed was submitted. On October 8, 1955 an application was made to the Registrar of Firms for registration of the firm under the Partnership Act. The Registrar raised an objection to the effect that the partnership was invalidunder s.30 of the Partnership Act as one of the partners was a minor.On December 18, 1955 the four adult partners informed the Registrar byletter that the minor was admitted to, the benefits of the partnership and was not liable to share losses. The Registrar thereafter registered the firm. The Income-tax Officer registered the firm for the assessment year 1956-57 and renewed its registration for subsequent years up to 1961-62. But the Commissioner of Income-tax in exercise of his power under S. 33B of the act set aside the orders made by the Income-tax Officer. The Tribunal and the High Court decided in favor of the Revenue. In appeal to this Court by special leave.
 
HELD : (i) _The assessee firm was not registered under the Indian Partnership Act before the application under s.26A of the Act was made, nor was the partnership deed registered under the Indian Registration Act. The partnership deed submitted along with the application for registration disclosed that the partnership constituted under that deed was void in view of s. 30 of the Partnership Act as one of the five partnership was a minor. Hence the application made for registration was an invalid application. The subsequent alteration of one of the terms of the partition deed, even if validity made, could not validate the application made because the alteration in question was made long after the time prescribed for making the application had expired and there was nothing to show that the Income- tax Officer had condoned the delay in exercise of his power under the proviso to Rule 2. If the original order of registration was unauthorised, the subsequent renewals of the registration must also be held to be unauthorised. [963 F] (ii)It was found by the Tribunal that both in the application made for registration of the firm as well as in the applications made for renewal of registration in column 6 of the form-letter 'P' was not mentioned. On the other hand the minor's share was shown as 1/5th which means his share both in the profits as well as in the loss. The record did not show whether 960 the Income-tax officer was informed of the letter written to the Registrar of Firms on 18-12-1955 and if so on what date he was informed about it. From the above facts it was clear that the applications made by the partners of the firm did not comply with the requirements of the rules. Hence those applications could not be considered as valid applications.
 [964 F] (iii) Since the applications for registration and renewal did not conform to the requirements of the law the registration and the renewals could not have been granted.
 (iv)Section 185(2) of the 1961 Act is not retrospective in operation nor were the requirements of that section complied with. The plea that substantial compliance with the rules is sufficient stands negatived by the decisions of this Court. [965G] Rao Bahadur Rayulu Subba Rao and Ors. v.
