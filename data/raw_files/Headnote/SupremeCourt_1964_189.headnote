 An Indian emigrated to Pakistan in February, 1950. In March, 1950 a petition was presented by his creditors for adjudicating him an insolvent and it was ordered.
 Thereafter in 1951 the Assistant Custodian of Evacuee Property issued a notice under s. 7(1) of the Administration of Evacuee Property Act (31 of 1950) to the interested persons to show cause why the emigrant's property should not be declared evacuee property. In spite of objections of the respondent (Official Receiver), the declaration was made in 1954, and the order was confirmed by the Deputy Custodian and the Custodian General. The respondent then moved the -High Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution. The High Court held that it must be shown at the time of the declaration that the property in question is evacuee property, and as the insolvent lost his title to the property which had vested in the Official Receiver, the property could not be declared evacuee property. 'De Deputy Custodian appealed to the Supreme Court.
 HELD : The appeal should be allowed.
 The construction of s. 7(1) presents a problem which can be resolved not merely by the adoption of the mechanical rule of construction based on grammar, but by a liberal construction which takes into account the bearing and purport of the relevant words used in the section considered in the light of the relevant provisions of the Act and the principal object of the Act. So construed, all that the section requires is, that the appropriate authority should consider whether the property in respect of which a decla- ration is about to be made was evacuee property under s.
 2(f) of the Administration of Evacuee Property Act and the fact that the property had vested in the Official Receiver before proceedings were commenced under s. 7(1) of the Act, would not affect the character of the property. [225G- H;
