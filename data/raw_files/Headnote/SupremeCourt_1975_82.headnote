 4 in Writ Petition No. 37 of 1970. By a declaration dated November 25, 1938, filed with the Registrar of Assurances at Bombay, petitioner no. 2 obtained protection for the user of the said pictorial representation of "Chhatrapati Shivaji" and for the use of the said trade name as the exclusive proprietor thereof. In due course under an agreement-dated June 29, 1967, the firm while retaining exclusive proprietary rights in respect of the Registered Trade Marks Nos. 12549 and 12550 gave exclusive right of user thereof to the company for valuable consideration. By a notification No. SO/1020 dated March 16, 1968, issued by the Central Government under section 8 of the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950, and published in the Gazette of India on March 23, 1968, in item No,. 9A in the Schedule to the Act after the words "pictorial representation of", the words "Chharapati Shivaji Maharaj or" were inserted. On the representation made by the petitioners, the Government allowed the petitioners to use the existing Trade Marks with the name and the pictorial representation of Chbatrapati Shivaji till May 31, 1969.
 The Joint Registrar of Trade Marks (Respondent No. 3) by Notice No. PR./ 2951 dated October 16, 1969, informed the firm that the use and registration of the name and the pictorial representation of "Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj" is prohibited by virtue of section 3 and 4 of the impugned Act and the registration of the aforesaid Trade Marks Nos. 12549 and 12550 offended the provisions of section 11 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act 1958 read with section 32(b) of 'the said Act, and, therefore, proposed to rectify the Register by expunging therefrom the said Trade Marks under section 56(4) of the said Act. The Registrar called upon the firm to submit objections if any. The petitioners applied for extension of time to show cause before the Registrar and ultimately moved these Writ applications challenging the constitutional validity of the Act and in particular of sections 3, 4 and 8 of the Act as well as of the Notification of the Central Government dated March 16, 10 1968. They have also prayed for quashing the Notice of the Registrar dated October 1 6, 1969. A rule nisi was obtained on March 2, 1970, with interim stay preventing the Government from enforcing the provisions of the Act.
 It was contended for the petitioners : (1) The Act is void for want of legislative competence, (ii) Sections 3, 4 and 8 of the Act suffer from the vice of excessive delegation of legislative power; (iii) The Act has become unworkable because no rules have been framed tinder section 9 of the Act; and (iv) The Notification tinder section 8 was not published in the name of the President and was issued by the Under Secretary who was not authorised to do so.
 Rejecting the contentions and dismissing the Writ Petitions 
HELD : (i) Entry 49 of List I may well supply the coverage for the Union legislative field so far as the Act is concerned. Trade marks, designs and merchandise marks may legitimately take in matters relating to their abuses and improper uses. Even otherwise the residuary entry 97 of List I is of wide amplitude to take care of the particular subject matter of legislation, namely, prevention of improper use of certain emblems and names for professional and/or commercial purposes. [14G] (ii)The scheme disclosed in the provisions of the Act read with the preamble, and the Objects and Reasons make it clear that there was imperative necessity for regulating the use of certain emblems and names. The fact that only improper use of the names and emblems is prohibited itself provides guidance. The original entries in the Schedule would also point to the nature and character of the names, emblems and entities. It is not possible for the Parliament to envisage the possibility of improper use of all names and emblems as time goes on. Nor is it possible to enumerate in the Schedule in exhaustive list of all the names, emblems and entities. Section 8, therefore, makes provision for empowering the Central Government to add to or alter the Schedule. In the nature of things, there is no abdication of legislative function by Parliament in delegating its power under section 8 in favour of the Central Government which will be the appropriate authority to consider from time to time as to the items to be included in or omitted from the Schedule in the light of knowledge and experience gathered from the nook and corner of the entire country.
 There is, therefore, no excessive delegation of legislative power by Parliament in favour of the Central Government.
 [16A-B] The petitioners' right to trade in bidis is not at all interfered with by the legislation. Section 3 in terms provides for enabling the affected persons to adjust their business or affairs inasmuch as the Central Government can permit some time to alter their emblems, designs, etc. to carry on with their trade. Indeed in the present case the petitioners on their own application obtained ,in extension of time presumably under section 3 of the Act and, therefore, cannot complain on that score. There is built-in safeguard in section 3 itself for mitigating any hardship to persons or any rigor of the law. The provisions are accordingly regulatory in nature and even, if at all, they impose only reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the petitioner-,' right under Article 19(1)(f) and (g).Section 4 is a consequential provision and validly co-exists with section 3. [16FG] (iii) From the scheme and machinery of the Act there is nothing to indicate that absence of rules will make the Act unworkable. [16G-H] (iv) The Notification is not an executive order but is a piece of subordinate legislation made by the Central Government under section 8 of the Act. It was duly published in the Gazette of India over the signature of the Under Secretary who was authorised for the purpose.
 'Therefore, the question of violation of Article 77 does not arise. [17A]
