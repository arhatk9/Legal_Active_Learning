 In this Writ petition, the constitutional validity of the Jammu and Kashmir Agrarian Reforms Act. 1972 and the rules framed thereunder has been challenged. The short question for determination is whether the Act is protected under Art.
 31A of the Constitution as applicable to the State of Jammu and Kashmir, providing for a scheme of agrarian reforms.
 According to the petitioners, who are landowners in the State of Jammu and Kashmir, they have been rendered landless by the Act. They further allege that ,the proposed compensation is illusory and the exclusion of an "Orchard" from the definition of land is motivated and that the Act is not a piece of legislation bearing on agrarian reform and therefore. it is not protected by Art. 31A of the ,Constitution.
 Dismissing the petition, 
HELD :-(1) From the provisions of the Act, it is clear that the Act contains a programme of agrarian reforms in taking stock of the land in the State which is not in personal cultivation and which though in personal cultivation is in excess of the ceiling area of 121 acres. The main focus of the Act is to See that the tillers, who form the backbone of the agricultural economy, are provided with ,land for the purpose of personal cultivation subject to the ceiling provision.
 [345H-346B] The Act makes effective provisions for creating a granary of land at the disposal of the State for equitable distribution subject to the limit, amongst the tillers of the soil and even the owners who would make 'personal cultivation' of the same within the meaning of the Act. [346B-C] (2)In the present case, there is no discrimination in favour of the orchard owners because in fixing the ceiling areas. land and orchards are both included and the definitions of 'land' and 'orchard' under the Act clearly permit of ,some special treatment to orchards in view of scheme of the entire Act. Further. there is reason for excluding 'orchards' which is a compact area having fruit trees, grown thereon in such number that they preclude it from 'being used for any other agricultural purpose.
 Further, orchards have special significance in the State.
 Therefore, there is no discrimination; and since the Act has been passed with the definite object of agrarian reforms, it cannot be successfully challenged on the ground of violation of Art. 14; 19 and Art. 31 of the Constitution. [346D-347C]
