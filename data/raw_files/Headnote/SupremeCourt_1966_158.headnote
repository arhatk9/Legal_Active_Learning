 By a will made in August 1931, P, who was the grandfather of the respondents, bequeathed certain immovable properties to his paternal uncle's daughter K. In January 1952, the respondents instituted a suit against several persons including K challenging inter alia the validity of the bequest made by P. In February 1952 K died leaving as her heir the .appellant who was, her husband's brother's son.
 On February 25, 1952, the appellant executed a deed in favour of the respondents, releasing the suit properties, including certain outstanding due from third parties, and ,this deed was registered on February 26, 1952. The respondents there.upon filed an 'application in their suit asking for an order that in view of the release deed, the properties covered by it be removed from the scope of the suit and the plaint amended accordingly; and this application was allowed by the Court.
 In January 1955, the appellant instituted the present suit asking for a decree setting aside the release deed of February 1952 on the ground that it was vitiated by misrepresentation, fraud, deceit and undue influence. He also alleged that the deed being a deed of release could not take effect as a conveyance and did not effectively pass title to the properties. The trial Court decreed the suit holding that the deed was procured by misrepresentation and also that it did not effectively convey the properties.
 However, the High Court, in -appeal, set aside the finding of the trial Court and dismissed the suit.
 In the appeal to this Court it was also contended, inter alia, on behalf of the appellant, that a release can only enlarge an existing title of the release and there can be no release in favour of a releasee who has no interest in the property.
 
HELD : (i) On the facts, the appellant had failed to establish that the deed was procured by misrepresentation.
 (ii) The release deed clearly showed an intention to transfer title and its operative words sufficiently conveyed the title. As the release was without any consideration, the deed, on its true construction, took effect as a gift.
 The gift was effectively made by a registered instrument signed by the donor and attested by more than two witnesses.

 followed.
 (iii) In the present case the deed was in favour of a person having no interest in, the property and it could not take effect as an enlargement of an existing estate. It was intended to be and was a transfer of ownership. A deed called a deed of release can, by using words of sufficient amplitude, transfer title to one having no title before the transfer.[279 C-D] Hutchi Gowder v.
