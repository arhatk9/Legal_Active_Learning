 In its issue dated December 13, 1977, Indian Express published a news item that the High Courts had reacted very strongly to the suggestion of introducing: a code of judicial ethics and propriety and that "so adverse has been the criticism that the Supreme Court Judges, some of whom had prepared the draft code, have disowned it." In its issue dated December 21, 1977 an article entitled "Behaving like a Judge" was published which inter alia stated that the, Supreme Court of India was "packed" by Mrs. Gandhi "with pliant and submissive judges except for a few". It was further stated that the suggestion that a code of ethics should be formulated by Judges themselves was "so utterly inimical to the independence of the judiciary, violative of the Constitutional safeguards in that respect, and offensive to the self-respect of the Judges as to make one wonder how it was conceived in the first place." A show cause notice had been issued to the Editor-in-Chief of the Newspaper why proceedings for contempt under Art. 129 of the Constitution should not be initiated against him in respect of the above two news items.
 Dropping the contempt proceedings 
HELD: Per Beg, C.J., Proceedings before the Court should be dropped without any finding against any individual. [171 H] 
1. National interest requires that all criticisms of the judiciary must bestrictly rational and sober and proceed from the highest motives without being coloured by any partisan spirit or tactics. This should be a part of national ethics. [169 G-H] 
2. The comments about Judges of the Supreme Court suggesting that they lack moral courage to the extent of having "disowned" what they had done or in other words, to the extent of uttering what was untrue, at least verge on con-tempt. None could say that such suggestions would not make Judges of this Court look ridiculous or even unworthy, in the estimation of the public, of the very high office they hold if they could so easily "disown" what they had done after having really done it. [166 A-B] 
3. Editors of responsible newspapers should be, aware that it is courts of law and not newspaper readers who have to try certain issues which Courts alone are empowered to determine. The character and the legal consequences of any publication about conduct of Judges are certainly matters for Courts to determine. Editors of newspapers are expected to know also something of the special place of this Court in the Republic's Constitution which amply protects its Judges so that they may not be exposed to opprobrious attacks by either malicious or ignorant persons. [166 B-D] 
4. The judiciary cannot be immune from criticism. But, when that criticism is based on obvious distortion or grossmis-statement and made in a manner which seems designed to lower respect for the judiciary and destroy public confidence in it, it cannot be ignored. Though action for contempt of Court, which is discretionary, should not be frequently or lightly taken the Court should not abstain from using this weapon even when its use is needed to correct 163 standards of behaviour in a grossly and repeatedly erring quarter. It may be better in many cases for the judiciary to adopt a magnanimously charitable attitude even when utterly uncharitable and unfair criticism of its operations is made out of bona-fide concern for improvement. But, when there appears some scheme and a design to bring about results which must damage confidence in the judicial system and demoralize Judges of the highest Court by making malicious attacks, anyone interested in maintaining high standards of fearless, impartial, and unbending justice will feel perturbed. [170 A-C] 
5. Although, the question whether an attack is malicious or ill intentioned, may be often difficult to determine, yet, the language in which it is made, the fairness, the factual accuracy, the logical soundness of it, the care taken in justly and properly analysing the materials before the maker of it, are important considerations. Moreover, in judging whether it constitutes a contempt of Court or not the Court is concerned more with the reasonable and probable effects of what is said or written than with the motives lying behind what is done. A decision on the question whether the discretion to take action for contempt of Court should be exercised in one way or the other must depend on the totality of facts and circumstances. [170 F-H] Per Krishna Iyer, J. concurring Precedentially validated judicial norms relating to contempt powers of Courts are : (1) The Court will act with seriousness and severity where justice is jeopardized by a gross and/or unfounded attack on the judges, where the attack is calculated to obstruct or destroy the judicial process; (2) The Court must harmonise the constitutional values of free criticism, and the need for a fearless curial process and its presiding functionary, the judge. To criticise a judge fairly albeit fiercely, is no crime but a necessary right. Where freedom of expression subserves public interest in reasonable measure, public justice cannot gag it or manacle it; (3) The Court must avoid confusion between personal protection of a libelled judge and.
 prevention of obstruction of public justice and the community's confidence in that great process. The former is not contempt, but later is, although overlapping spaces abound; (4) The fourth functional canon is that the Fourth Estate should be given free play within responsible limits even when the focus of its critical attention is the court, including the highest Court; (5) The fifth normative guideline for the Judges to observe is not o be hypersensitive even where distortions and criticisms overstep the limits, but to deflate vulgar denunciation by dignified bearing and (6) The sixth consideration is that, if the Court considers the attack on the judge or judges scurrilous, offensive, intimidatory or malicious beyond condonable limits, the strong arm of the law must strike a blow on him who challenges the supremacy of the rule of law by fouling its source and stream.
