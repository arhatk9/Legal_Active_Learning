 In dealing with appeals against acquittals the High Court has to bear in mind the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused person and cannot lose sight the fact that the said presumption is strengthened by the order of acquittal passed in his favour by the trial court, and so, the fact that the accused person is entitled to the benefit of a reasonable doubt must always be present in the mind of the High Court when it deals with the merits of the case.
 But, however circumspect and cautious the approach of the High Court may be in dealing with such appeals, it undoubtedly 'is entitled to reach its own conclusions upon the evidence adduced by the prosecution in respect of the guilt or innocence of the accused. The observations in the various decisions prescribing a cautious approach, on the part of the High Court, in dealing with appeals against acquittals, do not cut down, limit or qualify its statutory power under s. 423 (a) Cr.P.C., which is coextensive with that under cl. (b). It is not necessary that the High Court must hold that the trial Court's finding was perverse before reversing it. [581 A-D, F-H] This Court, on appeal from a judgment of conviction after setting aside an order of acquittal, would examine the evidence only for seeing that the High Court has approached the question properly and applied the principles correctly.
 Once it is found that the High Court has applied correct principles in dealing with appeals against acquittals then this Court would not ordinarily go further into the evidence and weigh it for itself tosubstitute its own opinion for that of the High Court merely as to itssufficiency to support the conclusions arrived at by the High Court. It will do so only if there is some serious, infirmity leading to grave injustice. In case the High Court's judgment suggests that the correct principles were not kept in view then it would. be open to this Court to examine the entire evidence for the purpose of assuring that justice does not fail [581 D-F] In the present case, in the judgment of the High Court there is no reference to the decisions of the Privy Council or of this Court laying down the principles which the appellate court is expected to keep in view when dealing with appeals against acquittal, but the judgment clearly shows that it went into all the aspects on which the prosecution evidence could be criticised and concluded that the evidence was fully trustworthy and that the medical evidence, though it might be shaky, did not throw any doubt on the trustworthiness of the prosecution witnesses as to the time, place, and circumstances in which the deceased was killed.
 The appreciation of the evidence by the High Court is unexceptionable and there is no question of any possibility of a reasonable doubt on the conclusions about the time and place of occurrence and the manner in, which the deceased met his death. [584 A-H] 572 But in cases like the present where there are party factions, there is a tendency to include the Innocent with the guilty and it is extremely difficult for the Court to guard against such a danger. The only real safeguard against the risk of condemning the innocent with the guilty lies in insisting on acceptable evidence which in some measure implicates such accused and satisfies the conscience of the court. [585 G-H] In the instant case, the eye witnesses have named all the appellants and the approver has even named those acquitted by.the High Court. But it would be safe only to convict those who are stated to have taken an active part and about whose identity there can be no reasonable doubt., [586 A-C] Bhubaneshwar Mandal v.
