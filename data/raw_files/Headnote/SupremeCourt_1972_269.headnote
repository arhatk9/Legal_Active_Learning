 Item 10 of the notification under s. 3A of U.P. Sales-tax Act, 1948, referred to 'dyes and colors' and compositions thereof, and item 37 to 'scents and perfumes'. The respondent (dealer) imported from outside U.P., food colors and syrup essences. The appellant held that the food colors fell under item 10 of the notification and syrup essences under item 37 of the notification, and that they should be taxed at six paise per rupee under the Act. The dealer contended that the tax on food colors and syrup essences should be at the rate of two paise per rupee as unclassified goods under s.3 of the Act. The High Court, in reference, agreed with the dealer's contention.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The words 'dyes and colors' and the words 'scent and perfumes' have to be construed in their context and in the sense as ordinarily understood and attributed to these words by people usually conversant with and dealing in such goods.
 Similarly, the words 'food colors' and 'syrup essences', which are descriptive of the class of goods, the sales of which are to be taxed under the Act, have to be construed in the sense in which they are popularly understood by those who deal in them and who purchase and use them. 'Food colors' and 'syrup essences' are edible goods, whereas 'dyes and colors' and 'scents and perfumes', as specified in entries 10 and 37, prima facie do not connote that they are edible goods. The scheme of the list in the notification also suggests that, apart from undoubted edible goods, in cases where the import of the specified goods is wide enough to include both edible and non-edible categories, then the intention has been clearly expressed whether or not to in- clude edible goods. Therefore, entries 10 and 37 are not intended to extend to edible colors like 'food colors' and edible essences like 'Syrup essences'. In any event, the view taken by the High Court is not so grossly erroneous that it should be interfered with in a special leave appeal under Art. 136.
