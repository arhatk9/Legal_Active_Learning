 The appellant Kirpal Singh was elected to the Punjab Legislative Assembly from Majitha constituency at the general elections held in 1972. His election was set aside by High Court in an Election Petition filed by one of the defeated candidates on the ground that the nomination paper of another candidate was improperly rejected by the Returning Officer for the reason that he was a development officer in the employment of the Life Insurance Corporation under whose Staff Regulations he was prohibited from seeking election. The High Court was of the view that the staff regulations could, at best, make Basant Singh liable to disciplinary action only. In the appeal under section 116A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, the Court passed an interim order enabling the appellant to attend the assembly and sign the register, without participating in the proceedings or voting, and without drawing any remuneration.
 Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, there were three general elections with the result the appeal became wholly infructuous.
 Disposing of the appeal, the Court, ^ 
 HELD : 1.1. Where an election is set aside for no fault of the duly elected candidate, such as a corrupt practice committed by him or his agent or a disqualification suffered by him, but on the ground that someone else's nomination had been improperly rejected, the more appropriate interim order would perhaps be to grant an absolute stay so that the Constituency may not go unrepresented for no fault of either the elected or those who elected. [624 C-D] 623 
 1.2 The awarding of the costs by the High Court, in such circumstances is uncalled for. The appellant will receive his remuneration for the period for which he was elected as a legislator. [626 C-D] 
 1.3 The clear and undoubted object of Article 191(1)(a) to (e) and the provisions of the Representation of the People Act (including section 10) is the preservation of the purity and integrity of the election process by preventing Government or State employees from taking part in the elections. Nowadays the activities of the State are so manifold and prolific that the State has been forced, in the interests of better management and administration and in order to further the Directive Principles of State Policy, to set up various Corporations which are but mere instrumentalities of the State. Whether the principle of Article 191(1)(a) has to be extended to employees of State Corporations and other Public Sector Undertakings by suitable legislation is a question of policy better left to, be decided by the elected representatives of the people themselves and not to the Court whose decision can only be confined to interpretation. [625 E-H; 626 A] The Court recommended to the Government to have several questions posed before it examined by the Law Commission early.)
