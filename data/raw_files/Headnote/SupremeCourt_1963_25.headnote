 The respondent, a partnership firm, brought a suit for recovery of the amount with interest due to it on account of the purchases and sales of cotton-seeds and bales of cotton on behalf of the appellant firm. In contesting the suit the appellant while admitting trade relations with the plaintiff firm disputed the correctness of the accounts. It was urged that the transactions were wagering contracts and so void in law, that they being forward transactions were prohibited by law and that the plaintiff firm which was registered at Lahore before the partition of India ceased to be a registered firm thereafter for purposes of the Indian Partnership Act.
 The trial court accepted the plaintiffs story as regards the transactions but held as regards the accounting that the plaintiffs were bound to give certain credits to the defendants and the price of 2300 bags of cotton seeds and 50 bales of 'cotton on the final sale was directed to be credited in favour of the defendant at the market rate on May 28, 1947. Other directions as regards calculations of incidental charges and interest were also given. The learned judge passed a final decree in favour of tile plaintiff with appropriate costs. Against this decree both the respondent and the appellant appealed to the High Court.
 The High Court dismissed the appellants appeal and allowed the respondent's appeal increasing the decretal amount.
 Two points of laws were raised by the appellant in this Court, namely, 996 (i) the requirement of s. 69 (2) of the Indian Partnership Act was not satisfied and (ii) the transaction being a forward transaction in cotton and edible oil seeds was illegal and thus prohibited by law.
 Held, that once there was registration under the Indian Partnership Act, it continues to be effective and valid under that Act in the area to which it applied before the partition of India so long as it was not cancelled in accordance with law.
 Bombay Cotton Export & Import Go. v. Bharat Sarvodaya Mill Co., r. L. R. Bom. (1958) 1351, approved.
 Held, further, that the forward contracts in cotton seeds were not prohibited by law. A cotton and cotton seeds are not included in the definition of essential commodity, any previous order with respect to them will be inconsistent with the new order and cannot continue under s. 5 of the Essential Supplies Act, 1946.
