 The respondent, a public servant, was tried by a Special Court constituted under the West Bengal Criminal Law Amendment (Special Courts) Act, 1949, for collecting premiums and issuing receipts on behalf of L.I.C. in respect of the policies of some Pakistani Policy Holders. He was charged for criminal breach of trust in respect of such premiums by making false adjustments of receipts of such premiums through the Bank in Pakistan in relevant books of accounts.
 Item 2 of the Schedule in the Act describes the offence as an "offence punishable u/s. 409 I.P.C. if committed by a public servant or by an agent of the Government in respect of property with which he is entrusted.
 The Special Court came to the conclusion that the respondent purported to act, at the relevant time, as a public servant, but as no money was entrusted to the respondent in his capacity as a public servant, the respondent was entitled to an acquittal for an alleged offence punishable u/s. 409 I.P.C. under the proviso to sec. 4(1) of the Act, there could be no conviction for that offence.
 Against the acquittal of the respondent, the Legal Remembrancer of West Bengal filed an appeal before the High Court. The High Court also held that the respondent, having no power to receive money in cash from the policy holders did not act in his capacity of a public servant while he received the money from the policy holders in cash in Calcutta. Although it did not quash the order of acquittal, the apparent result of its findings was that the trial of the respondent, being without jurisdiction, was null and void, so that the respondent could be retired.
 The only question for decision was whether the respondent be said to be acting in his capacity as a public servant when he received the monies from the policy-holders which he misappropriated. Allowing the appeal.
 
HELD : (i) The gravamen of the offence of Criminal breach of trust is the dishonest misappropriation of the money or property which comes into the possession or under the control of a public servant who has the ostensible authority to receive it, even though, technically speaking, from the point of view of the distribution of departmental duties under internal rules of an office, it may not be within the scope of his authority or duty to accept the money. The fact that a public servant acts fraudulently in the exercise of his duties as a public servant to get dominion or control over some property will be an aggravating and not an exculpating circumstance. The "entrustment" results from what the person handing over money or property is mads to think, understand and believe about the purpose for which he hands over money or property to a public servant. If this takes place because of and due to the exercise of the official authority, the requirements of S. 409 I.P.C. are satisfied. To constitute an offence u/s 409, I.P.C., it is not required that misappropriation must necessarily take place after the creation of a legally correct entrustment or dominion over property. S. 409 covers both types of cases, that is, those where the receipt of property is itself fraudulent or those where the public servant misappropriates it. All that is required is "entrustment". [353 B] (II) In the present case, there is evidence and findings of the Special Court to show that the respondent was actually representing to the policy holders that 349 they could make their payments in Calcutta to him and he issued receipts purporting to act in his official capacity.
 There is, therefore, nexus between the actual official capacity and the conduct of the Respondent to hold the Respondent guilty of the offence u/s 409 I.P.C. which could be tried by the special court.
