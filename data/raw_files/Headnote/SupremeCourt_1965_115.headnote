 A widow alienated her husband's estate and one of her daughters in a representative capacity on behalf of the reversioners instituted a suit impleading the alienees, the widow and her sister the appellant, as defendants, for a declaration that the alienation was null and void. The suit was decreed, and the alienees. preferred an appeal to the High Court impleading the widow, and her two daughters as respondents. During the pendency of the appeal the plaintiff died and the High Court directed that her sister the appellant would continue to be on record in her place.
 During the pendency of the appeal the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 came into force. and the High Court allowed the appeal, holding that there were no reversioners and no reversionary rights after the Act came into force. On the appellant's application, certificate under Art. 133 of the Constitution was granted. After the appeal was declared admitted, the widow died and no order of the High Court under 0. VXI r.
 12(a) of the Supreme Court Rules Substituting the heirs of the widow in her place was obtained. Later the appellant filed petition of appeal in this Court, in Which, the widow was also impleaded as a respondent. The alienee-respondents raised a prelicainary objection that the widow could not be shown as respondent in this appeal, as she was dead on the date of the filng of the appeal, and consequently the appeal was defectively constituted and not maintainable in the absence of the widow's heirs.
 HELD:On merits the appeal must be allowed.
 It is open to a reversioner to maintain a suit for a declaration that an dienation made by a Hindu female limited owner before the coining into orce of the Hindu Succession Act, was without legal necessity and was not binding upon the reversioners. [4 D-E] Gummalapura Taggina Matada Kotturuswami v. Serra Veeryya [1959] Supp. I S.C.R. 968 and Brahmadeo Singh v. Deomani Missir, C.A. No, 130/60, dated 15-10-62, followed.
 The appeal should proceed against the other respondents on the footing at the widow was not a party to the appeal. [5 E] In the case of the death of the widow during the pendency of the declaratory suit, the heirs of the widow are not necessary parties to be suit. Though the widow was joined as a party to the suit, no relief was claimed against her personally. On the death of the widow the entire estate of the last full owner is represented by the plaintiff suing in a representative capacity on behalf of all the reversioners, and the plaintiff can get effective relief against the alienee in the absence of the fires of the widow. The plaintiff is entitled to continue the declaratory bit without joining the heirs of the widow as parties to the suit. [6 B-B] As the reversioners were not entitled to the possession. of the prop it the time of the institution of the suit, the next reversioner could then 2 sue for a bare declaration and the proviso to s. 42 of the Specific Relief Act, did not constitute a bar to the suit.
 The declaratory suit does not become defective because during the pendency of the suit, the reversioners become entitled to further relief. But in the absence of an amend- ment of the plaint, a decree for possession of the property cannot be passed in the suit, and if the reversioners are to get any real benefit, they must institute a suit for possession of the property within the period of limitation.
