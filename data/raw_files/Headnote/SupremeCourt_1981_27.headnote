 Allowing the appeals by special leave, the Court, ^ 
 HELD: (1) When an earlier order of reversion was quashed on a technical ground, a second enquiry on merits could be held and it is open to the disciplinary authority to continue the proceedings in accordance with law. The order of reinstatement pursuant thereto is not a bar to the second enquiry.

 Jabalpur and Ors. v. Pratap Rai, [1978] INSC 92; [1978] 3 S.C.R. 729; Anand Narain Shukla v. State of Madhya Pradesh, A.I.R. 1979 S.C.
 1923, followed.
 (2) It is not at all necessary that the enquiry which had been held in part by more than one enquiry officers should be continued by the same enquiry officers until the end. The post which the members of the Inquiry Committee held originally might have been ceased to exist at a later stage, or one or more of the members of the Inquiry Committee may no longer be available either on account of retirement or due to any other cause. For that reason, it could not be held that the enquiry could not be continued at all. Therefore, there could be no valid objection to the supplementary enquiry being continued by the very two individuals, in the instant case even after they had ceased to hold their respective offices which they held at the time of the original enquiry.
