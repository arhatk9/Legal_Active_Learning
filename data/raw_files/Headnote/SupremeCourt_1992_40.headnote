 The appellant was a mortgagor and the respondent No. 1 defendant No. 4 was one of the mortgagees. The suit for redemption of mortgage filed by the appellant was decreed providing for payment of Rs. 500, and Rs. 943/9.2 towards improvements as a condition for redemption.
 The appellant court in appeal enhanced the sum for improvements by Rs. 256/8.4.
 583 When appellate filed an execution application, the respondent filed another application under the Kerala Compensation for Tenants Improvements Act, 1958 claiming a further sum for improvements.
 When it was pending, the appellant deposited the decretal amount including the enhanced sum decreed by the appellate court.
 The respondent's application was allowed and appellant was directed to pay a total amount of Rs. 4,149.66 paise inclusive of decretal amount.
 Thereafter, the respondents filed another application to reopen the decree u/s. 132 (3) of the Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1963 contending that he was a tenant u/s. 4A of the Act, having been continuously in possession for over 50 years and that, therefore, the decree of eviction cannot be executed against the respondent.
 The executing court dismissed it, but on revision, the High Court declared that the respondent was a `deemed tenant' u/s. 4A of the Kerala Land Reforms Act, against which this appeal was filed.
 The respondent No. 1 contended that he was a tenant u/s. 2 (57) of the Kerala Land Reforms Act and that u/s. 72 of the Act the appellant no longer was the holder of the land and the land stood vested in the State.
 Allowing the appeal of the mortgagor and dismissing the C.R.P., this Court, 
 HELD : 1.01. If there is a decree passed in one of the four Acts enumerated in sub-s. 2 of s. 132 and the decree remained unexecuted and pursuant to which possession was not effected, then on the commencement of the Kerala Land Reforms Act a tenant or landlord may make an application upon which the decree would be reopened and be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of Act. [588B] 1.02. The decree in question is only a redemption decree pursuant to which the mortgagor is entitled to possession, on redemption of mortgage, under s.60 of T.P.
 Act. Therefore, the very application to reopen the decree itself is misconceived, without jurisdiction and authority of law.
 [588B-C] 584 2.01. Section 2(57) of the Act, defined `tenant' means any person who has paid or has agreed to pay rent or other consideration for his being allowed to possess and enjoy any land by a person entitled to lease that land. There should exist jural relationship of landlord and tenant and pursuant to a lease for consideration possession was given and the lease remained in possession enjoying the land on payment of rent or other consideration. [588D-E] 2.02. The mortgagee in possession of the hypothica for a continuous period of not less than 50 years `immediately preceding' the commencement of the Amending Act 35 of 1969 is deemed to be a tenant under the Act. [589B] 2.03. The main part of s.2(57) does not apply to a mortgagor and mortgagee and the mortgagee cannot be treated to be a tenant. [588E] 2.04. By Amending Act 35 of 1969, s. 4A was introduced on the statute. It is prospective in operation. [588E-F] 2.05. The respondents had not had continuous minimum of 50 years possession immediately preceding Act 35/69 came into force. The mortgage amount of Rs. 500 together with the improvements determined in the appeal were deposited on June 21, 1961. A conjoint reading of s.60, s. 76(h) read with s. 83 of Transfer of Property Act would amplify that on deposit of the mortgage amount the contractual relationship of mortgagor and mortgagee ceases. [589B-D] Prithi Nath Singh & Ors. v. Suraj Ahir & Ors., [1963] 3 SCR 302, referred to.
 3.01. A conjoint reading of ss. 4 and 5 of the Kerala Compensation for Tenants Improvements Act, 1958 postulates that a decree of eviction passed against tenant, namely recovery of possession of land from the tenant, cannot be enforced until the compensation determined under the Improvements Act is paid. Until such payment of Compensation for improvements made by him or his predecessors in interest, etc., is made, the tenant shall be entitled to remain in possession and the decree of eviction shall not be executed. [591A-B] 3.02. Payment is a condition precedent u/s. 4 and s. 5 provides the procedure by which the right secured under the Act is to be enforced. The 585 right to compensation given under s. 4 is a right to the improvements made by a tenant while in possession and enjoyment of the land before decree of enjectment was passed against him. [591C] 3.03. The right to compensation springs into existence from his continuance in possession as a tenant before decree of eviction was passed and until the compensation is paid he is entitled to remain in possession. For the purpose of improvements, the mortgagee has been treated by fiction of law to be a tenant. [591D] 3.04. Section 4(2) preserves the pre-existing contract;
 the right and liabilities thereunder. The right to possession under s. 60 of the transfer of Property Act, on redemption kept uneffected. [591E] 4.01. The object of the Improvements Act is "to make provision for payment of compensation for improvement made by tenants". [591D-E] 4.02. The Improvements Act only hedges the right to eviction and gives right to remain as a mortgagee till the payment for improvements are made or deposited so that the mortgagee/tenant is not driven to a separate suit. [591F] 5.01. The assumption of the High Court that respondents' possession under the Improvements Act as a statutory mortgage and that he was in possession on the date s. 4A of the Act came into force and that, he is entitled to the protection from rejectment and the decree is liable to be reopened under s. 132(3) of the Kerala Land Reforms Act is clearly wrong.
 [592C-D] 5.02. Merely the respondents remained in possession as mortgagee, they cannot acquire the status as deemed `tenant' under s. 4A tagging the period from June 21, 1961 till date the Amending Act came into force and thereafter to compute continuous possession as mortgagee for not less than 50 years immediately preceding Amendment Act 35 of 1969 to the Act.
 [592A-B] 5.03. The entitlement to remain in possession as a condition for payment is different from the entitlement as a statutory tenancy under s. 4A of the Kerala Land Reforms Act. There is no non-obstenti clause in s.4 of the Improvements Act, unlike s.4A of the Kerala Land Reforms Act, which engrafts non-obstenti clause. The later is of little assistance to the respon- 586 dent, as he did not complete 50 years of continuous possession on the date when the Amending Act 35 of 1969 came into force. The High Court is in error in holding that the respondent is a deemed tenant under s. 4A.
 [592D-E] 
 6. The landholder's all rights, title and interest in respect of holdings held by cultivating tenant for fixity of tenure under s.13 and in respect of which certificates of purchase under s.54(2) have not been issued, shall subject to the provisions of the Act, vest in the Govt., free from all encumbrance created by the land owners etc. Therefore, it pertains to only lands held by tenants cultivating land under fixity of tenure under s. 13. The respondent is not a cultivating tenant under fixity of tenure. Therefore, the land does not vest in the Government. [592F-G] Raghavan v. Velayudhan, 1984 K. L. T. 713, over-ruled.
