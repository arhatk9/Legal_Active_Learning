 The respondent-landlords submitted two separate applications before the Rent Controller for permission to determine the tenancy of the appellant-tenant from their portions of the premises on the ground that the tenant had built a large house in the city and had thus secured alternative accommodation. The Rent Controller allowed the prayer. A Single Judge of the High Court dismissed the appellant's writ petition and his Letters Patent Appeal was also dismissed.
 Before this Court the appellant's main contention was that the provisions of clause l3 (3)(v) of the C.P. & Berar Letting of Houses and Rent Control Order, 1949 did not apply to non-residential buildings. The argument was that by the addition of the Explanation to clause l3(3)(v), non- residential buildings have been excluded from the purview of the sub-clause.
 Dismissing the appeals it was, 
 HELD: (1) It cannot be reasonably suggested that by the addition of the Explanation, which is confined to cases dealing with residential buildings, a non-residential building is excluded even where the tenant leaves the area for a period of four months and does not need the house.
 [342G-H] If the position in regard to the second category of cases remained unaffected, the Explanation cannot be construed to narrow down the scope of the first category of cases where the tenant secures alternative accommodation.[342H; 343A] (2) It is not possible to split the main sub-clause so as to apply it to non-residential buildings where the tenant leaves the area for four months and at the same time exclude it where he secures alternative accommodation as the sub- clause deals with the two situations in the same language without making any distinction. [343A-B] PG NO 339 PG NO 340 (3) The Explanation operates within a very narrow area and does not cover the entire field governed by the main sub-clause. By the use of the expression "shall be deemed" a legal fiction has been employed for the purpose of including a particular situation within the sweep of the sub-clause.
 l343D] (4) It cannot be legitimately suggested that since in the majority of other States, similar provisions in the statutes on rent law are limited in operation to residential buildings, the same must be presumed to be the intention of the author of the Control Order. It is a question of policy to be adopted by the different legislatures. [343G-H] Mansaram v. S. P. Pathak, [l984] 1 SCC 125 referred to.
