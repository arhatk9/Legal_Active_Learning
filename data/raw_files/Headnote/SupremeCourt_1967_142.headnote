 The appellant-company filed a suit against the State of U.P.
 and Union of India for a permanent injunction restraining the State from proceeding to realise cess and tax under the U.P. Sugar Cane Cess Act 1956 read with U.P. Sugar Cane Cess (Validation) Act, 1961 and the Sugar Cane Purchase Tax Act, 1961 on the ground that the Acts were invalid and void. On its plaint, the appellant paid court-fees under subs. (iv-B) (b) of s. 7 on the footing that the relief sought was an injunction. The respondent the Chief Inspector of Stamps objected, contending that court-fees payable were under sub- s. (iv-A) of s. 7 on the ground that the suit was for a declaratory decree, where consequential relief prayed for was an injunction or of adjudging void an instrument securing money or other property having such value. The trial Court rejected the respondent's objection, which the High Court reversed. In appeal, this Court, HELD : The court-fees payable on the plaint were tinder cl.
 (b) of sub-s. (iv-B) of s. 7 and neither cl. (a) of sub-s.
 (iv-A) of s. 7 nor sub-s. (iv-A) of s. 7 applied.
 The plaint when read as a whole showed that though the appellant alleged that the Acts were void and therefore non- est for the reasons set out therein, it did not seek any declaration that they were void. The plaint proceeded on the footing that the said Acts were void and that therefore the State of U.P. or its authorities had no power to realise the tax -and the cess. It may be that while deciding whether to grant the injunction or not, the court might have to consider the 'question as to the validity or otherwise of the said Acts. But that must happen in almost every case where an injunction is prayed for. If for the mere reason that the court might have to go into such a question, a prayer for injunction were to be treated as one for a declaratory decree of which the consequential relief is injunction all suits where injunction is prayed for would have to be treated as falling under cl. (a) of sub-s. (iv) of s. 7 and in that view cl. (b) of sub-s. (iv) of s. 7 would be superfluous. [924E-H] Ramanbhai Ashabhai Patel v.

 Ordinarily a statute is not an instrument unless as in the case of Conveyancing Act, 1881, the definition includes it or as in the case of s. 205 (1) (viii) of the Law of Property Act, 1925, the statute creates a settlement and such statute is for that 'reason treated as -,in instrument, so, the Acts alleged in the plaint to be void are not instruments within the meaning of sub-s. (iv-A) of s. 7.
