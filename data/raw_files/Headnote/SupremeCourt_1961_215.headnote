 The State Government granted mining licence to the appellant over an area of 83.18 acres as prayed for by him but the Union Government modified the order and directed that licence for 32 acres out of the whole area could not be granted and the licence should be restricted to the rest of the area. The licence for 32 acres was subsequently granted to Respondent No. 3. The appellant then filed an application under Art. 226 of the Constitution for quashing the order of the Union Government granting licence for 32 acres to Respondent No. 3 and for issuing directions that licence for that area be granted to him. The High Court dismissed the petition: On appeal by special leave.
 Held, that the order of the Union Government could not be quashed by the High Court as it did not exercise territorial jurisdiction over the Union Government and the direction prayed for could not be granted till the order of the Union Government was set aside.
