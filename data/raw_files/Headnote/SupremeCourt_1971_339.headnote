 The appellant was a member of the Indian Civil Service, and under F.R. 56(f) he was due to retire on November 25, 1970.
 The question whether a prima facie case against him was made out with respect to certain charges was referred to a Commission under the Commission of Enquiries Act, 1952, in October 1970. On November 3, 1970, he expressed his willingness to accept extension of service by 4 months and his service was extended till March 25, 1971. The appellant submitted his explanation to the Commission and the Commission after considering it, made an interim report in January 1971, that a prima facie case had been made out against the appellant. On March 23, 1971, an order was made Linder r. 3 (1) (a) of the All India Services (D & A) Rules, 1969 saying whereas disciplinary proceedings against Shri P.
 R. Nayak, I.C.S. are contemplated...... the President......
 hereby places the said Shri P. R. Nayak under suspension with immediate effect until further orders.
 " The appellant filed a petition for quashing the order of suspension but the High Court dismissed the petition.
 In appeal to this Court, it was contended that : (1) the order was violative of r. 3 of the All India Services (D & A) Rules; (2) Under F.R. 56(f) the date of retirement was fixed as rigid and the appellant having retired on November 25, 1970 no further action could be taken against him as a member of the I.C.S.; (3) his retention in the post only amounted to reemployment; (4) since he became Secretary in the Ministry of Works, Housing and Urban Development in 1969 he should have been retained in that post for full 5 years till 1974 under the proviso to F.R. 56(f), and the extension for four months only was illegal-, (5) the order of suspension without specifically denying his request to retire on March 25, 1971, was defective; and (6) F.R.
 56(ff)-by which an officer like the appellant under orders of suspension is not to be permitted to retire till the enquiry against him is concluded-is ultra vires.
 
HELD: (Per S. M. Sikri, C.J., J. M. Shelat, I. D. Dua and [G. Palekar, JJ.) : The appeal must succeed on the first contention, 709 D-E] (a) There is no inherent power of suspension in Government, and the only rule on which reliance was placed for the appellant's suspension is r. 3 of the All India Services (D 
 (b) An order of suspension which does not adversely affect the rights and privileges of a Government Servant, but merely restrains him from discharging his official duties may be within the general inherent compe- 696 tenice of the Government, but the impugned order seriously affects sonic of the appellant's rights and privileges under the conditions of his service. namely; (i) During the period of suspension he is not entitled to his full salary but only to some allowances; (ii) he is not permitted to retire;
 (iii) in order to get subsistence allowance he is prohibited from engaging in any other employment, profession or vocation and (iv) he is prohibited from leaving headquarters without prior permission of Government. Since these prejudicial consequences automatically flow from the order of suspension, the clear and explicit language of the rule must not be strained to the appellant's prejudice so as to authorise his suspension on mere contemplation of disciplinary proceedings. [714 D-H] Sub-rule (1) (a) of r. (3) empowers the Government which initiated any disciplinary proceeding to place under suspension a member of the service against whom such proceedings are started. The language is plane and unambiguous and does not suggest that suspension can be ordered merely because disciplinary proceedings are contemplated. The language of sub-rr. (4) to (7) also does not authorise suspension merely because disciplinary proceedings are contemplated. The scheme underlying r. 3 is indicative of the intention of the rule-making authority to restrict its operation to those cases in which Government has sufficient material, whether after preliminary investigation or otherwise, and the disciplinary proceedings have in fact commenced, and not merely when they are con- templated. [709 E-H; 710 A-C] (d) The view taken in Tarak Nath Ghosh's case [1971] INSC 50; (A.I.R. 1971 S.C. 823), that under r. 7(1) of the All India Services (D & A) Rules, 1955replaced by the present ir. 3(1) of the 1969- rules-the Government is entitled to suspend an officer when preliminary investigation has been made, but even before definite charges have been communicated, cannot be accepted.
 Reliance for the view taken in that decision was placed on Govinda Menon's case [1967] INSC 29; [1967] 2 S.C.R. 566, but in Govinda Menon's case the order of suspension was held also to be the order initiating disciplinary proceedings. The legality of a composite order both initiating disciplinary Proceedings and suspending Govinda Menon was not questioned in the case.
 [710 C-E; 712 G; 714 A-B] (e) Rule 12 of the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 195T, provides for suspension of a Government servant pending disciplinary proceedings or when a disciplinary proceeding is contemplated. This phraseology has been retained in the corresponding 1965- rule. just as the phraseology in r., 7 (dealing with suspension during disciplinary proceedings) in the All India Services (D & A) Rules, 1955, has been retained in the corresponding r. 3 of the 1969-rules. Courts may presume that the draftsman knew of the existence of the various rules, and if with that knowledge he used different phraseology in the respective rules. it can be assumed that the actual words used in the, different rules were purposely selected to express precisely intention of the rule making authority. [715 A-H; 716 A-B] (f) The existence of r. 40(1) of the Railway Protection Force Rules, 1959. providing for suspension of a member of the Force when investigation into charges against him is contemplated. further fortifies our interpretation of r. 3 of the All India Services (D & A) Rules, 1969. [716 In this view, the majority did not consider the other contentions.] (Per A. N. Ray and G. K. Mitter, JJ.) dissenting:
 The appeal must be dismissed.
 697 (1) (a) The three features of r., 3 of the All India Services (D & A) Rules, 1969, arc, (i) the authority which places a member of the service under suspension, namely, the Government which initials any disciplinary proceedings; (ii) the time when the order is made, namely, when the Government is satisfied that it is necessary or desirable to order suspension; and (iii) the person against whom 'the order is made, namely, the member of the service against whom such proceedings are started. The words 'which initiates any disciplinary proceedings' and 'against whom Rich proceedings are started' are merely descriptive of the Government and the member of the service, respectively. There is no restriction on the power of suspension by making it dependent on the condition precedent of the commencement of inquiry into articles of charge against the Government servant. The rule does not say that the Government which has initiated disciplinary proceedings may order suspension, or that a member against whom such proceedings have been started can be suspended. [731 C-F] (b) The provision cannot be interpreted by the consideration that tile powers may be abused by arbitrary exercise, because, the victim of any such arbitrary exercise has a right to come to court and the court will protect him against any mala fide action. [731 G-H] (c) The order of suspension indicates that President of India was satisfied that it was necessary and desirable to suspend the appellant on an objective consideration of all the available material and that the order was not passed merely to humiliate the appellant. [732 A, E-F] (d) The sub-rules to r. 3 establish that the power of suspension is exercisable in instances other than an enquiry under r. 8, for example, when criminal charges and investigation or trial are pending. That is, there can be suspension earlier than the trial during investigation. [733 A-B] (e) Rule 8 of the Rules provide,., that when it is proposed to bold an enquiry, the disciplinary authority shall draw up articles of charge, while r. 3 requires regard to the nature of charges. The meaning of the word charge' in the two expressions is not the same. Rule 3 is of wider amplitude as it deals with the stage of a prima facie case and the word charges have the wider meaning of accusations and amputations. [733 G-H] Govinda Menon v. Union of India, [1967] INSC 29; [1967] 2 S.C.R. 566, followed.
 (g) Rules 3, 7, 8 and 9 indicate the different stages of disciplinary proceedings. Therefore, disciplinary proceedings can be said to have been started when complaints about the misconduct of a Government servant are entertained followed by a preliminary enquiry culminating in the satisfaction of the Government that a prima facie case had been made out for framing formal charges. No formal order is necessary for initiation of disciplinary Proceedings and the order of suspension, in the context of the preliminary investigation and a prima facie case can itself be treated as an initiation of disciplinary proceedings. Such suspension is not a punishment, but is in aid of disciplinary proceedings and is ordered to facilitate free investigation and collection of evidence. When such an order of suspension itself shows that the Government was of the view that a prima facie case had been made out. the fact that the order also mentions that disciplinary proceedings are contemplated makes no difference. Also, the fact that in other rules of service an order of suspension may be made when disciplinary Proceedings are contemplated, does not require that a member of an All India Service should be dealt with differently [736 A-C; 737 G-H, 738 A-F] 698 S. Govinda Men on v. Union of India[1967] INSC 29; , [1967] 2 S.C.R. 566 and Government of India v. Tarak Nath Ghosh, [1971] INSC 50; A.I.R. 1971 S.C. 823, followed.
 Champaklal Chimanlal Shah v. Union of India, [1964] 5 S.C.R.
 190 and Kapur v. Union of India, [1963] INSC 224; [1964] 5 S.C.R. 431, referred to.
 (g) The explanation to r. 6 of the All India Services (Death-cum-Retirement Benefit) Rules, 1958, states that a disciplinary proceeding shall be deemed to be instituted when charges framed against the pensioner are issued to him, or, if he has been placed under suspension from an earlier date, on such date, This rule applies to all Government servants who can be placed under suspension under r. 3 of the All India Services (D & A) Rules-, 1969. It is illogical and incongruous to hold that in case of other Government servants disciplinary proceedings commenced when he is placed under suspension, but it will not be so in the case of at member of the Indian Civil Service. [733 H; 734 A-C] Therefore, on the facts and circumstances of the present case the order of suspension was properly and validly made.
 [738 G] (2) The contention that a member of the Indian Civil Service on completion of 35 years service retires compulsorily and that there cannot be any extension of service, is opposed to the language of F.R. 56(f) and inconsistent with the practice in the service. The present rule, and the earlier rules and regulations, indicate that there may be an extension of service beyond the date of compulsory retirement. The date of retirement in such a case is the extended date. [723 F-H] (3) Sanction of retention of post at the end of 35 years, which is mentioned in F.R. 56(f) contains intrinsic authority for extension of' service, and therefore the appellant's extension of service was not a new ,employment after retirement.. Nor is it a case of a fresh contract, be- cause, a valid contract of employment is to be in compliance with Art. 299 of the Constitution. There is no authority for saying that at the end of 35 years compulsory retirement has happened and is complete and there can be no extension in service. It is incomprehensible how one can be permitted to retain a post he was holding at the end of 35 years service, if ,one has already retired compulsorily at the end of 35 years. The facts that an officer, when he is retained in a post after 35 years service, could not have any promotion or that his leave lapses and that there is a change in his entitlement to leave, do not make the extension of service a new appointment. The service is continuous with such adjustments as to leave or promotion or posting as are permissible or possible. [724 A-D; 725 C-E] (4) (a) The contention of the appellant that he was entitled to an extension of 5 years is against the terms of t. 56(f). The appellant is estopped from challenging this extension till March 25, 1971. The appellant himself asked for the extension, and has proceeded, in the petition, on the basis of the extension and asked for a declaration that he retired from service on March 25, 1971. The estopped rightly raised against the appellant in regard to F.R. 56(f) and 56(ff) is that the order of suspension was passed at a time when the appellant was in service as a result of being permitted by the President to be retained in service for a period of 4 months, pursuant to the appellant's agreement to an extension. [725 F-H; 726 A-E; 736 G-H] (b) Though the order of extension did not state as to what post the appellant held, when his services were extended for 4 months, he was permitted to retain the post he was holding. These words mean that he 699 remained a member of the Indian Civil Service and that he was kept in the place or position held by him. The word 'post' means in effect 'office'. [728 E-H] (c) Retention of post with the sanction of the President under F.R. 56(f) is not a matter of right. The practice, shown by the various instances of extension of service establishes, (i) that the order of extension does not indicate that the person concerned is mentioned with reference to a particular post, and (ii) that the extension of service is in no case for 5 years.. Therefore, tinder F.R. 56(f) the extension in fact can be for any period, which together with the period for which he held the post does not exceed 5 years. [720 H; 730 A-C] (5) The order of suspension is under r. 3 of the All India Services (D & A) Rules, and F.R. 56(ff) is a rule laying down the consequences of the order of suspension. They are (i) F.R. 56(f) is deleted so as not to come into operation during the period of suspension inasmuch as the words used are, 'notwithstanding anything contained in cl. (f)', (ii) the member of the service shall not be required or permitted to retire, and (iii) the member shall be retained in service until the enquiry into the charges is concluded. When the date of compulsory retirement is allowed to pass by an extension of service under F.R. 56(f), the words 'reaching the date of compulsory retirement' in F.R. 56(ff) will apply to the postponed date of retirement, because the actual date of retirement is shifted. It will be illogical to hold that a member of the Indian Civil Service cannot retire because the order of suspension is before the date of compulsory retirement, but when he is on extension of service he can retire even when an order of suspension has been passed.
 Therefore, the order of suspension means that he is in service, but his services are temporarily suspended and hence, no retirement can take place. The prohibition against retirement is embedded in F.R. 56(ff) and therefore no separate order is required or necessary to the effect that the appellant shall not be required or permitted to retire. [739 A-H; 740 A-B] (6) Fundamental Rule 56(ff) does not violate Art.. 14 on the ground that under the Civil Service Regulation 351A, a Government servant against whom disciplinary proceedings were pending could be permitted to retire. But F.R. 56(ff) reintroduced in 1970 the old cl. (d) of the rule, which was deleted in 1962. Under F.R. 56(d) also a Government servant under suspension shall not be required or permitted to retire on reaching the date of compulsory retirement, but shall be retained in service until the enquiry is concluded.
