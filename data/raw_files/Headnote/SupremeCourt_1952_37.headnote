 Held by the Full Court (PATANJALI SASTRI C.J., MAHAJAN, MUKHERJEA, DAS and CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR JJ.).--The Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950, is valid in its entirety. The jurisdiction of the court to question its validity on the ground that it does not provide for payment of compensation is barred by arts. 31(4), 31-A and 31-B of the Constitution. The said Act is not a fraud on the Constitution; it does not delegate essential legislative power to the executive; and is not liable to be impugned on the ground of absence of a public purpose.
 Per MAHAJAN J.--(i) The expression "public purpose" is not capable of a precise definition and has not a rigid meaning. It can only be defined by a process of judicial inclusion and exclusion. The definition of the expression is elastic and takes its colour from the statute in which it occurs, the concept varying with the time and the state of society and its needs. The point to be determined in each case is whether it is in the interest of the community as distinguished from the private interest of an individual.
 (ii) There is nothing in law to prevent the subject-matter of a Crown grant being compulsorily acquired for a public purpose and land held by the taluqdars of Oudh does not therefore stand on a higher footing than that of other owners of Oudh.
 (iii) Property dedicated to charity by a private indi- vidual is not immune from the sovereign's power to compulso- rily acquire property for a public purpose.
 1057 (iv) Recourse cannot be had to the spirit of the Consti- tution when its provisions are explicit; and when the funda- mental law has not limited either in terms or by necessary implication the general powers conferred on the legislature it is not proper to deduce a limitation from something supposed to be inherent in the spirit of the Constitution.
 (v) The provisions of art. 31(2) do not stand revealed by art. 31-A. On the other hand the proviso to art. 31 -A keeps them alive. The only difference is that with regard to estates the President. has been constituted the sole judge for deciding whether a State law has complied with art. 3 1(2).
 (vi) When a whole estate is being acquired and payment of compensation is based on the net income of the whole estate, it cannot be said that the legislation is of a confiscatory character merely because there are non-income fetching properties also in the estate.
 DAS J.--(i)The existence of a public purpose and the necessity for payment of compensation cannot be said to be an inherent part of the spirit of any particular form of Government. The Indian Constitution has in art. 31 (2) recognised these two elements as a pre-requisite to the exercise of the power of eminent domain, and as the impugned Act has been expressly taken out of the operation of those provisions, the question of invoking any imaginary spirit of the Constitution cannot be entertained. The invocation of such an imaginary spirit will run counter to the express letter of arts. 31(4), 31-A and 31-B. (ii) The claim of the Rulers with regard to their private properties is not within art. 862; by offering compensation their ownership is recog- nised; in any event, art. 362 imposes no legal obligation on the Parliament or State Legislature, and art. 363 bars the jurisdiction of the court with respect to disputes arising out of covenants of merger.
