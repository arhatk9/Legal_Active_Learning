 A, the predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiff executed a thika patta in favour of B, in respect of a village for a term of 40 years from 1320 to 1959 fasli, the rent to be appropriated up to 1344 fasli towards satisfaction of debts owing from A to B and others. The patta B stipulated that B could not execute a lease in favour of any tenant for any term extending beyond 1359 fasli. B settled plots in the village with the predecessors-interest of the defendants.
 The first settlement was for 5 years from 1347 to 1351 fasli. The second settlement was for 5 years from 1352 to 1356 fasli. The tenants were settled raiyats of the village. After the expiry of the term of the thika patta, the plaintiff instituted a suit for recovery of possession of the plots. The Courts below dismissed the suit. In an appeal to this Court it was contended that (1) the thika patta was a mortgage and not a lease and the mortgagee B had no authority to induct raiyats, and (ii) that assuming that it was a lease, B had no authority to settle raiyats having occupancy rights enuring after the expiry of the lease. it was conceded that if the thika patta was a lease, B was a tenure-holder.
 
HELD: dismissing the appeal, (1) The thika patta was a lease and not a usufructory mortgage. The gist of the document was letting for the full term of 40 years. There was no express or implied grant of a right of redemption on repayment of the loan. The document was not intended to create relationship of debtor and creditor or a security for the repayment of a debt; [744 D] (2) The tenants of B, having acquired the right to hold land as cultivating tenants of a tenure-holder, were raiyats as defined in s. 5(2) of the Bihar Tenancy Act. The tenancies were lawful at their inception. B was not prohibited by the thika patta from inducting raiyats on the land. In spite of the stipulation in the patta that B would not execute a lease in favour of any tenant for a term extending beyond 1359 fasli, the tenants acquired the right to hold the land as raiyats. As settled raiyats of the village they got rights of occupancy in the lands under s.
 21(1) of the Act. [745 A-B] The general rule is that no one can confer on another a better title than he himself has. B could not make a grant of the right to occupy the lands after the expiry of the lease in its favour. But the right of occupancy is not the creation of any grant from B. It is conferred by s. 21 (1).
 As the tenants are raiyats, the law steps in and protects them from eviction. [745 B-C] Mahabir Gope v. Harbans Narain Singh, [1952] INSC 22; [1952] S.C.R. 775, distinguished.
