 The Deputy Commissioner of Police, Ahmedabad City served notices on the respondents in the two appeals on August 13, 1964 and July 28, 1964 under s. 59 of Bombay Police Act XXII of 1951 informing them that various allegations had been made against them under s. 56 of the Act and that it was proposed to remove them outside the District of Ahmedabad City and certain contiguous Districts. An opportunity was given to them of tendering their explanations in respect of the allegations on dates which were communicated to them in the notices. Each of the notices contained allegations, inter alia, to the effect that the respondents consumed eatables from places of public entertainment without payment and when legal dues were demanded from them, they beat up the persons concerned; and that the witnesses in respect of the various incidents and allegations were not willing to come forward to depose against the respondents in public by reason of apprehension on their part as regards the safety of their person and property. After the respondents had submitted their written explanations and produced evidence in their defence, the Deputy Commissioner passed orders on November 9, 1964 and February 9, 1965 directing the respondents to remove themselves from areas mentioned in the order for a period of two years and not to enter the same without permission in writing obtained from a competent authority.
 The respondents thereafter challenged the orders of the Deputy Commissioner in writ petitions under Arts. 226 and 227 of the Constitution and contended. inter alia, that the notices on which the subsequent orders of externment were passed were too vague both with regard to the time and places of their alleged activities; the allegations made against them were so general that they could not effectively offer any explanations or substantiate their defence; and that in effect the material allegations against them had not been set out in the notices and there was therefore no proper compliance with the provisions of.s. 59 so as to enable the Deputy Commissioner to take action under s. 56 of the Act. The High Court allowed the petitions holding that the notices were invalid as they were too general and vague.
 It also held that the definition of "a place of public entertainment" in the Act would take in the numerous places mentioned in s. 2(10) and accordingly the respondents could not have sufficient opportunity of explaining their conduct not knowing what particular places of public entertainment they were supposed to have visited where they were alleged to have committed various acts alleged against them. The High Court therefore quashed the notices under s. 59 as well as the orders of externment passed against the respondents.
 On appeal to this Court, 747 
HELD : The High Court was in error in holding that the notices under s. 59 and the orders of externment under s.
 56 were invalid.
 The view that the allegations against the respondents should have contained all the particulars of places of public entertainment or establishments they were supposed to have visited, was not warranted by the provisions of s. 59. The notices referred to the periods during which the acts were stated to have been committed, as well as the area where they were said to have been committed. The mere fact that the definition of the expression 'place of public entertainment', in s. 2(10) of the Act takes in various types of places, does not militate against the allegations in question being material allegations as contemplated under s. 59. [757 D-E] When a person against whom an order of externment is proposed to be passed has to tender an explanation to a notice under s. 59, he can only give an explanation of a general nature. It may be open to him to take a defence of the action being taken due to mala fides, malice or mistaken identity, or be may be able to tender proof of his general good conduct, or alibi, during the period covered by the notice and the like. The allegations made in the notices issued under s. 59 as against the respective respondents contained the general nature of the material allegations made against each of them in respect of which they had been given a reasonable opportunity of tendering an explanation.
