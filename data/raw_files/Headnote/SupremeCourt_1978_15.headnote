 The petitioners challenged the levy and collection of the municipal tax from them as landlords in respect of the huts constructed and occupied by their tenants on the lands leased to the latter. The Calcutta High Court, taking the view that S. 202 of the Municipal Act, 1951 provided for collection by the owner of the land of so much of the rate as is attributable to the hut which belongs not to the owner but to the tenant, directed, that in regard to each bit of land and hut thereon, there will be particularisation of the assessment separately on the consolidated. valuation.
 Dismissing the special leave petition, the Court 
HELD 1. S. 202 of the Calcutta Municipal Act, 1951 is more or less a self-contained code with the result that what is leviable under that provision cannot be prejudiced by the existence of any other provision.
 2.The Thika Tenancy Act does not come in the way of the petitioner in recovering what is permissible u/s 202 of the Municipal Act. Thika Tenancy Act deals with rents while s.
 202 deals with rates. The special provision must prevail so far as the rates are concerned.
 3.A special provision dealing with owners of bastis cannot be challenged as discriminatory and violative of Art.
 14 of the Constitution, when their position is protected by s. 202 of the Municipal Act.
