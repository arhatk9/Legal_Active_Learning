 The appellant claimed to have let out the property in dispute as owner in 1966. In 1974, he filed a suit for eviction of the tenant Habib and the sub-tenant Banda, first respondent in this case. This suit was decreed against both Habib and Banda. With the respondent's application for setting aside the eviction decree, and thereafter his revision petition being dismissed, according lo the appellant the eviction decree against Habib and the respondent became final on that date.
 However, Banda filed the present suit on the basis of his tide as owner of the property and claimed two reliefs : that the eviction decree was a nullity, and for an injunction that the present appellant be restrained from dispossessing him from the property. 'The Trial Court dismissed the suit On appeal the Civil Judge, District Mazaffarnagar decreed the suit A second appeal by the present appellant to the High Court was dismissed.
 199 In the Supreme Court, the appellant contended that the decree passed by a court of competent jurisdiction could not be declared as not binding on a person who was a party to the suit; and the view that the judgment of the Small Causes Court did not operate as res judicata between the parties because the Small Causes Court had no jurisdiction to decide title to the suit property, is erroneous in law.
 Dismissing the appeal, this Court, 
HELD : 1. The bar of the res judicata is not applicable to the determination of the issue with regard to the title to the property in the present suit (p.9) [204E] To operate as res judicata the first finding must be on an issue which has been directly and substantially in issue in the former suit. If the finding given is Incidentally while determining another issue which was directly and substantially in issue, such finding cannot be said to be on an issue which was directly and substantially in issue in the former suit.(p.10) [205C] Gangabai w/o Rambilas Gilda v. Chhabubai w/o Pukharajji Gandhi[1981] INSC 190; , [1982] 1 SCR 1176, followed.
 The so-called decision of the Small Causes Court does not refer to the present respondent or to the written statement riled by him where he had contended that he was the owner of the property and the suit was decreed ex parte. [205D] Not only has the Small Causes Court not given any finding, it has not even referred to the said issue in its so called decision. (pp.8 and 11) [205D] 2.In order to be binding, the order of the court disposing of the suit must amount to a decree. The definitions of decree, order and judgment given in the Code show that decree or order as the case may be, can come into existence only if there is an adjudication on the relevant issues, which conclusively determines the rights of the parties. (pp.11 and 12) [205D, 206A] 'Points for determination" in rule 4(1) are issues contemplated by Rules 1 and 3 of Order XIV of the Code.
 Since the matters were in controversy between the parties, it is only a judgment which could have given rise to a decree. The decision of the Small Causes Court which has 200 not stated the points for determination and given a finding thereon is not a judgment with S.2(9) of the CPC.(p.13) [206G-H] 3.Under S.17(1) of the Provincial Small Causes Court Act also it was obligatory for the Small Causes Court to state the points for determination and give its finding or decision on each of the said points.(p.14) [207B] 4.The decision of the Small Causes Court is non est as far as the respondent is concerned.(p.14) [207C] Mohammed Fasi v. Abdul Qyayum, AIR 1978 Allahabad 470;
