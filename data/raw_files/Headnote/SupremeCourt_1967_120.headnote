 On March 19, 1963 the first respondent, on behalf of some employees of the Grampanchayat, applied to the authority appointed under s. 20(1) of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, for a direction upon the Grampanchayat to pay to the employees certain overtime wages, etc.
 The Authority found that since January 2, 1961, the employees had been making complaints to the Government authorities 'regarding nonpayment of overtime wages and as a result, directions were given from time to time by the Government Officers concerned to the appellant to comply with the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder; that the officers assured the employees from time to time that the matter was receiving their attention and the employees, relying upon these assurances, refrained from making the application within six months as required under the first proviso to s. 20(2). By its order of September 18, 1963, in exercise of the power conferred by, the second proviso to s. 20(2) the authority therefore condoned the delay in the filing of the application on the 'ground that the employees had remained in the honest though mistaken belief that relief would 'be granted to them through the intervention of the officers and 'held that the application should be entertained in respect of the claims for the period Subsequent to January 1, 1961. A petition challenging this order under Art. 227 of the Constitution was summarily dismissed by the High Court.
 On appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The expression "sufficient cause" in the second proviso to s. 20(2) should receive the same liberal interpretation as in s. 5 of the Indian Limitation Act. It was not shown that in condoning the delay the Authority had acted arbitrarily or capriciously or in excess of its jurisdiction Pr that it committed any error apparent on the face of the record. This Court could not interfere under Art. 136 merely because it might take a different view of the facts and exercise its discretion differently. 1776 B;
