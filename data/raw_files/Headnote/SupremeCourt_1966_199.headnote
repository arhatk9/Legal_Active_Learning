 The appellant was a Government undertaking incorporated under the Indian Companies Act. Its registered office was in Maharashtra and its` main business the manufacture of antibiotics. The entire equity capital of the company was held by the President of India and his nominees and the entire Board of Directors was nominated by him. Service conditions of the workmen and other matters were subject to the approval of the President of India. Though the company was a limited one and therefore had a distinct corporate existence, it was in effect financed and controlled by the Central Government. On dispute arising between the workmen of the company and the management thereof the Government of Maharashtra made a reference under s. 10(1)(d) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 for its adjudication. The Industrial Tribunal gave its award in two parts and gave, inter alia, the following findings Rejecting the contention of the company that in fixing the wage scale,-, different considerations and standards should apply to public sector undertakings as distinct from private sector undertakings, the Tribunal fixed the wage scale on region-cum-industry basis. It found that the company was a very large and prosperous concern and its wage scales were on the low side particularly in regard to the lower categories of workers, taking into consideration the duties and qualification prescribed for them. The Tribunal fixed the wage scales having regard to the company's financial position, its productive capacity, a comparative study of its wage structure with that of its neighbouring industries and similar other relevant factors. It retained the existing dearness allowance scheme except for a small alteration in the slab of dearness allowance for the pay group Rs. 301-500; it merged a proportion of what would normally be paid in the shape of dearness allowance in the basic pay in the case of lower categories of workmen by giving increases wherever necessary for the basic pay only.
 It linked the dearness allowance with the cost of living index for Poona. It evolved a gratuity scheme far the workmen. It gave retrospective operation to the award.
 There were other findings on the various demands of the workmen. The company appealed to this Court under Art. 136.
 
HELD : (i) In dealing with appeals brought to this Court under Art. 136 of the Constitution against awards which construct wage structures, this Court would, not interfere with the actual provisions of the wage structure unless some general principles were involved. 'Mere was no justification for the argument that this Court had by convention and practice adopted a more liberal attitude in the case of appeals against awards than in other appeals.

 (ii) lf be object of Industrial law is two-fold namely, (i) to improve the service conditions of industrial labour so as to provide for them the ordinary amenities of life, and (ii) by that process to bring about industrial peace which would in its turn accelerate productive activity of the country resulting in its prosperity. The prosperity of the country in its condition of labour. By this process it is of labour can be proiressiviily raised from the stage of minimim wage, passing through need found wage, fair wage, to living wage.
 The principle of region-cum-industry,the rule of relevancy of comparable concerns, and the recognition of the totality of the basic wage and dearness allowance that should be borne in mind in the fixation of wage structure, are all well settled.[659 F-H] M/s.

 (iii)All the principles referred to above though accidentally evolved in industrial adjudication relating to industries born in the private sector apply equally well to industries in the public sector. There is no justification from the standpoint of the employee that different wage structure shall be adopted having regard to the fact that in one case the shares of the company are held wholly or partly by the Central Government or the State Government and in other cases by members of the public. The worker is interested in his pay packet and if he is given reasonable it is expected that a satisfied worker will contribute to the growth of the industry@ and ultimately the prosperity of the country. From this stand consideration, so long as the capacity of the character of the employer is irrelevant. In the r of the employer or the destination of fixation of wages. Whoever may be the employer, he has to pay a reasonable wage to the employees.[660 F.662 B] Constitutional, legislative, executive and opinion trends in that regard all go to,show that wages should normally be fixed on region-cum-industry basis. [662 C-668 F] The material on record further showed that there was no complete uniformity in pay scales in all public sector undertakings. The service conditions of the employees in public sector undertakings were also not similar to those of Government employees; there was no security of service; the fundamental rules did not apply to them; there was no constitutional protection; there was no pension; they were covered by standing orders; their service conditions were more similar to those of employees in the private sector than those in Government departments. The Pay Commission recommendations were not applicable to the employees of the Government undertakings in the public sector; indeed the Pay Commission Report did not deal with them. [668 G-669 A-B] There were no grounds for the fear that there would be any repercussions on other public sector undertakings situated in different parts of 654 the country because of the said differences in the wage structure of the Government undertakings in the public sector. [669-D] (iv)The doctrine of dearness allowance was only evolved in India. Instead of increasing wage as it is done in other countries, dearness allowance is paid to neutralist the rise in prices. This process was adopted in expectation that one day or other we would go back to the original price levels.
 But when it was found, that it was only a vain hope a part of the dearness allowance was added to the basic wages.
 While the Tribunal increased the wages in fixing the dearness allowance it looked into the overall picture namely, whether the total wage packet would approximate to the total packet wages in comparable industries. There was no question therefore of paying dearness allowance on dearness allowance, but it was only payment of dearness allowance in addition to the increased wages. Even on the basis of increased wages dearness allowance was necessary to neutratise the rise in prices. The Tribunal also introduced the slab system so that in the case of employees falling in the higher slabs the rise in prices was adequately neutralised. The Tribunal did not commit any error of principle. [671 - F; 672 D] (v)There was no double provision for house rent. 'Me fact that in the index for Poona one of the components was house rent only meant that the rise in the house rent was also taken into consideration in arriving. at the index. Unless it was established that the house rent was a major item which went in inflating the price index, it could not be said that the Tribunal by awarding house rent allowance had given a double advantage to the employees. [672 E] (vi)Gratuity is an additional form of relief for the worker to fall 'back upon. If the industry can bear the burden,, there is no reason why he should not be entitled to both the benefits-provident fund and gratuity. The Tribunal considered all the -relevant circumstances : the stability of the concern, the profits made by it in the past, its future prospects and its capacity and came to the conclusion that in the concern in question the labour should be provided with a gratuity scheme in addition to that of provident fund. There was no justification to disturb the conclusion. [674 D] In the nature of things a particular ceiling for gratuity cannot be fixed. If depends on the facts of each case. The scheme as prepared by the Tribunal was fair and equitable.
 [674 F] (vii)Only such of the item; which go directly to reduce the expenditure that would otherwise go into the family budget are relevant in fixing fair wages. The Tribunal had taken all the permissible fringe benefits in fixing the wage scales and dearness allowance. It could not therefore be said that the Tribunal went wrong in omitting any amenities in fixing the wages. [675 C] (viii)Having taken into account the relevant factors the Tribunal in its discretion came to the conclusion that the revised scales should coma into effect from 1st January 1962. There was no reason to interfere with its discretion.
 [675 G] (ix)It was common case that work in the 'closed area' involved greater physical strain on the workmen. Therefore when the Tribunal gave them a reasonable allowance it was not possible for this Court to take a different view. [675 H] (x)The Tribunal accepted the principles generally applied in fixing wages. It had not been shown that any principles had been violated. it 655 was true that in some cases the total emoluments of a particular category of employees of the company were higher than those of the other concerns, but the difference was not such as to be described as a flagrant violation of the :fixation of the wage structure. If no principle is violated this Court will not interfere on the ground that it would have fixed the wages at a lower level than the Tribunal did. [676 F-D] (xi) The finding of the Tribunal that a foreman was not a workman was on a consideration of his duties which it found to be of a managerial or administrative nature. The finding was one of fact and therefore must be accepted. [676 F] (xii) There was no error of principle in the rates fixed by the Tribunal in thecase of daily-rate workers. [677 A- B] (xiii) The Tribunal was not right in giving a discretion to the employers to continue or not to continue employees beyond the age of 58 years. Following the trend of judicial opinion the retirement age of the employees of the company should be raised to 60 years. [677 H] (xiv)The Tribunal had given linkage with effect from April 1, 1965. The employees had not made out any case for giving a further retrospective effect to the linkage. [678 B-C]
