 The brother of the petitioner had been detained under sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act 1974. In the writ petition to this Court under Article 32 it was contended that a case covering offences under Sections 307,411 and 414 of the Indian Penal Code was registered against the detenu, that those offences were the only acts which formed the basis of the detention order and that there is consequently no nexus between the unlawful activity attributed to the detenu and his incarceration.
 Allowing the writ petition, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The detention takes the character of punitive rather than preventive action, and is therefore vitiated.
 [141 A] 
 2. No reason has been put forward for the detenu not being taken into custody in pursuance of detention order right from January 2,1981 till July 10, 1981 although be appeared in Court on all the days of hearing fixed by the Magistrate during that period. [140 H; 141 A] 
 3. The offences which are said to have been committed by the detenu as far back as February 27, 1980 could hardly form a ground for his detention on a date as late as July 10, 1981, the gap between the two being about a year and a half. No explanation has been furnished by the State as to why action under the Act was not taken at the earliest possible after the alleged commission of the offences which are the foundation of the grounds for detention.
