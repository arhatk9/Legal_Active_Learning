 The respondent opened a Savings Bank Account being No. 90001 with the appellant's predecessor, the Imperial Bank of India at its Allahabad Branch, having been introduced to the Bank by one Kapil Deo Shukhla, an employee of the bank and a close neighbour of the respondent and a friend of her husband, Bhagwati Prasad. On a suspicion about the entries in the respondent's Pass Book made by the employees of the Bank, which had been confirming and ratifying them from time to time, the respondent sent a notice dated August 13, 1948 to the defendant bank. The appellant bank replied by its letter dated 14-8-1948 explaining the deposit of several items making up to Rs. 1932-2-0 and denied the alleged deposits of Rs. 105, Rs. 4000, Rs. 8000/- and Rs.
 100/said. to have been deposited through Kapil Dev Shukla.
 On November, 30, 1948, the respondent filed a suit in forma pauperis for the recovery of Rs. 1.5,547-10 As. together with pendente lite and future interest from the appellant's predecessors. The Trial Court found, except for the items of Rs. 105 and. Rs. 4000/- entered in the pass-book the respondent had deposited other amounts mentioned in it and that the bank was bound by those entries. Holding that the rules were strictly enforced by the bank and if the bank had accepted an amount larger than the sum of Rs. 5,000/- in contravention of its Rules, the respondent was not debarred from claiming such deposit, the Trial Court decreed the respondent's suit (in respect of two items) for Rs. 10,040- 10 As. together with simple interest on this amount from January 1st 1946 to August 14, 1947 @ Rs. 1-8-0 per cent per annum and from August 15, 1947 to December, 1948 at Rs. 7% per annum. It was further ordered that the respondent would' get simple interest on the decretal amount after deducting Rs. 1986-2-As. which have been paid during the pendency of the suit, at 6% per annum. Proportionate costs was also awarded to the respondent. Aggrieved by the said orders, the bank appealed to the Allahabad High Court and the respondent filed cross-objections in respect of the amount of Rs. 4,000/- and Rs. 105/disallowed by the Trial Court. The High Court, on reappreciation of the evidence dismissed the bank's appeal and allowed the respondent's cross objections decreeing the suit for Rs. 14145-10 annas together with simple interest thereon from January 1, 1946 to August 14, 1947 @ Rs. 1-8-0 % per annum and from August 15, 1947 to December 1, 1948 at 6% per annum. It was further directed that respondent could get pendente lite simple interest from the appellant on, the decretal amount at 6% per annum and as the amount of Rs. 1,986-2-0 had been paid to the respondent on September, 1950 it would be deducted from the total amount found due to the respondent and the decretal amount scaled down pro tanto.
 Allowing the defendant's appeal by certificate and dismissing the plaintiff's claim with regard to Rs. 11,000/- (consisting of items of Rs. 4,000/- plus Rs. 7,000/-) and interest thereon, the Court 
HELD : (1) The legal principle which governs the vicarious liability of an employer for the loss caused to a customer through the misdemeanour or negligence of an employee are :
 (a) The employer is not liable for the act of the servant if the cause of the loss or damage arose without his actual fault or privity or without the fault or neglect of his agents or servants in the course. of their employment; (b) the damage complained of must be shown to have been caused by any wrongful act of his servant or agent done within the scope or cou rse of the servant or agent's employment even if the wrongful Act 1010 amounted to a crime; and (c) a master is liable for his servants fraud perpetrated in the course of master's business whether the fraud was for the master's benefit or not, if it was committed by the servant in the course of his employment. There is no difference in the liability of the master for wrongs whether for fraud or any other wrong committed by a servant in the course of his employment and it is a question of fact in each case whether it was committed in the course of the employment. [1015 G-H, 1016 A, 1017 A-C] Leesh River Tea Co. Lid & Ors. v. British India Steam Navigation Co. Ltd., [1966] 3 All E.R. 593; Lloyd v. Grace Smith & Co., [1912] A.C. 636 and United Africa Co. Ltd. v, Saka Owoada, [1955] A.C. 130 referred to.
 (2) In the instant case, the appellant bank was not liable to make good the loss of Rs. 7,000/- (part of Rs. 8,000/- entry) caused to the respondent by the act of K. D. Shukla, who was acting as an agent of the dent and not within the scope of his employment with the bank. Nor could the fact that false and fictitious entries to cover his fraud were made by Shukla in the pass-book of the respondent and in the ledger account of Bhagwati Prasad and Sons make the embezzlement committed by Shukla an act committed in the course of his employment with the Bank. [1022 E-G] (b) The cheque for Rs. 7000/- drawn by Bhagwati Prasad was not handed over in the normal course of business in the defendant-bank for transfer to respondent's account in the regular manner. K. D. Shukla instead of depositing the cheque with the bank, as per the letter dated 7-10-1946 addressed to the bank manipulated to appropriate it himself.
 In such a situation, the act which caused the loss to the respondent could not be said to have been committed by Shukla in the course of his employment with the bank. At the most it could be said that the fact of his being an employee of the bank and a friend of Bhagwati Prasad gave him an opportunity to commit the fraud. [1022 B, D-E] Leesh River Tea Co. Ltd. & Ors. v. British India Steam Navigation Co. Ltd., [1966] 3 All E.R. 593 followed.
 (c) The onus was on the plaintiff to show that she paid the amount to an employee of the bank and was received by that employee in the course of employment. The false and fraudulent entry about the deposit of Rs. 4000/in the pass book could not shift the onus to the bank to prove the contrary. The alleged deposit of Rs. 4000/- by crossed cheque on 17-9-45 is not supported by the testimony of Bhagwati Prasad. There was no entry in the cash scroll and no receipt was produced in token of deposit. The entry is obviously false. [1019 C, H. 1020 A]
