 Sub-section 2(a) of s. 25 of the Bombay Police Act, 1951, inter alia authorises the Superintendent of Police to impose the punishment mentioned in subclause (1) on any Police officer subordinate to him. By clause (c) of s. 25(2) "the exercise of any power conferred" by subsection 2(a) "shall be subject always to such rules and orders as may be made by the State Government" in this behalf. In exercise of the power conferred under clause (c) the State Government framed Rule 17(2) of the Bombay Police (Punishment am(] Appeal) Rule-,, 1956, by which the Government invested itself with the power to call for records and to revise orders passed under sub-section 2(a) of s. 25 and to enhance the punishment.
 Pursuant to disciplinary proceedings against the respondent, a head constable, the Superintendent of Police demoted him as a police constable. The appeal to the D.I.G. police was dismissed. The respondent, thereafter, filet[ a revision before the State Government under Rule 17 of the Bombay Police (punishment and appeal)Rules, 1956. The Government, thereafter issued a show cause notice to the respondent stating as to why the punishment imposed upon him by the S.P. should not be enhanced. After hearing the respondent the Government enhanced the punishment to one of dismissal.
 Respondent filed a writ petition before the High Court. He urged that (i) the disciplinary proceedings were not conducted in accordance with law and (ii) that enhancement of punishment was beyond the competence of the Government, as Rule 17(2) was ultra vires s. 25(c) of the Bombay Police Act, 1951. The High Court held that the disciplinary proceedings were conducted in accordance with law, but the Government had no jurisdiction to enhance the punishment.
 The Court, therefore quashed the order of the Govt.
 enhancing the punishment. The State appealed. Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD :It is clear from the language of cl. (c) of s. 25(2) that only rul and orders which could be made under that clause are rules and orders for the exercise of the power conferred by s. 25(2). The words "the exercise of any power conferred by the sub-section shall be subject always to such rules and orders is may be made by the State Government", in s. 25(2)(c), would indicate that the Government have no power to make any rule and under arrogating to themselves a power of revision over an order of punishment passed under s. 25(2)(a). What is made subject to the rules and orders is "the exercise of any power" conferred under clause 2(a) of s. 25. Sub-section 2 (c) of s. 25 can only mean that the Government will have power to pass rules and orders for regulating the procedure or such other matters for the exercise of the power conferred by sub-section 2(a) of s. 25 by the officers mentioned therein. The power to enhance the punishment is a power which can be exercised only after the concerned officer has exercised his power under s. 25(2)(a).
 In other words, rules or orders can be made by the Government tinder s. 25(2)(c) only for guiding him either in the matter of procedure, -of. the manner of arriving at a decision. It is obvious from the language of 25(2)(a) that while that power exercisable under s. 25(2)(a) is subject to rules and orders made by the Government, the decision which . comes into being after the exercise of that power is not subject to the supervision of the Government by framing a rule or order making an order in that behalf. Once the exercise of such power results in the imposition of a punishment, the punishment becomes final, subject only to an appeal which is authorised under S. 27. The consequense is that rule 17(2) of the rules by which the Government sought to acquire power to call for the records and to revise orders passed 859 under s. 25(2) (a) and to enhance the punishment imposed, was clearly beyond its competence.
