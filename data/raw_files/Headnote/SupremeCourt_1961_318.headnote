 On September 14, 1954, the appellant sent a quantity of gold to a refinery in Bombay for the purpose of melting it. On receipt of information that the gold which was being melted was believed to be smuggled, the customs authorities made some enquiries at the refinery and seized the gold. The Collector of Customs found that the gold was of foreign origin and had been imported into India in contravention of the Foreign Exchange Regulations Act, 1947, and made an order confiscating it under s. 167(8) of the Sea Customs Act, 1878. The appellant filed a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution of India before the Punjab High Court challenging the legality of the order of confiscation on the ground that there was no evidence before the Collector of Customs to show that the gold had been imported after restrictions had been imposed in March 1947 by notification under the Foreign Exchange Regulations Act, 1947, and consequently the finding that the gold had been smuggled was unsustainable. In reaching the conclusion that the gold had been smuggled the Collector of Customs considered the credibility of the story put forward by the appellant about the purchase of the gold and the price at which the gold was stated to have been purchased which was less than the market price and also the conduct of the appellant in trying to get the gold melted at the refinery with a small bit of silver added so as to reduce the fineness of the gold and thus approximate the resultant product to licit gold found in the market.
 ^ Held, that though there was no direct evidence to show that the gold had been imported in contravention of the notification issued under the Foreign Exchange Regulations Act, 1947, the evidence relied on by the Collector of Customs in coming to the conclusion that the gold was smuggled could justify the finding and that the matter did not call for interference under Art.
 226 of the Constitution.
