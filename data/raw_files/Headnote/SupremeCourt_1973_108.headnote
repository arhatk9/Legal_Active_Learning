 The accused was convicted by the trial court under Ss. 366 and 376 I.P.C. On appeal, the High Court acquitted him of the offence under s. 376 I.P.C.; but upheld the conviction and sentence under s. 366 I.P . C. on the ground that the appellant had taken out a minor girl out of the keeping of her parents (her lawful guardian) with an intention that she may be seduced to illicit intercourse.
 On appeal to this Court, the appellant contended that since the girl left her parents' house out of her own accord due to the harsh treatment of her parents and as the appellant kept her in his house out of compassion and sympathy for the helpless girl, the charge under s. 366 I.P.C. was unsustainable.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) The legal position with respect of an offence under s. 366 I.P.C. is clear. In State of Haryana v. Raja Ram [1972] INSC 265; A.I.R. 1973 S.C. 819 it was observed by this Court that the object of Section 361 seems as much to protect the minor children from being seduced for improper purposes as to protect the rights and privileges of guardians having the lawful charges or custody of their minor wards. The gravamen of this (kidnapping) is the 'taking' or 'enticing' of a minor girl under the ages specified in the section, out of the keeping of the lawful guardian without his consent and section 366 provides for punishment of whoever kidnaps a woman for illicit intercourse or for the purpose of marriage against her will. [187C] (ii) The word 'takes' in section 361 I.P.C. does not necessarily connote taking by force and it is not confined only to use of force, actual or constructive. This word merely means "to cause to go", "to escort" or "to get into possession". The word "entice" means to involve the idea of inducement or allurement by giving rise to hope or desire in the other. If the minor leaves her parental home, influenced by any promise, offer or inducement emanating from the guilty party then the latter will be guilty of an offence as defined in s. 361 I.P.C. [187H] (iii) In the present case, the circumstances in which the appellant and the victim came close to each other and the manner in which be is stated to have given her presents etc. and the letters written by the victim to the appellant furnish very Important and essential background to the offence which the appellant committed. Therefore, the two courts blow have rightly convicted the appellant under sec.
 366 I.P.C. [188G] State of Haryana v. Raja Ram A.I.R., 1973 S.C. 819 referred to and S. Varadarajan v. State of Madras, [1965] 1 S.C.R.
