 The respondents were sought to be tried for offences under the India Penal Code, before the Additional Deputy Commissioner, Kohima, when objection was taken that the trial should be before the Court of Session after commitment, as the offences were triable exclusively by the Court of Session under the Code of Criminal Procedure. The Additional Deputy Commissioner overruled the objection on the ground that there were no Courts of Session in the Naga Hills District and the Criminal Procedure Code was also not in force. He ruled that committal proceedings and the trial before a session court was therefore not possible and the procedure laid down in the Rules for the Administration of Justice and Police in the Naga Hills District, 1937, would be followed. Thereupon the respondents filed writ petitions to quash the proceedings commenced under the Rules of 1937.
 The High court issued a writ directing the State not to proceed with the trial under the Rules of 1937.
 The area, where the trial was taking place was one of the backward tracts and it was for a century and more specially administered. The successive Criminal Procedure Codes, which ordinarily would have governed the trial of offences, were always withdrawn from this area and special rules for administration of criminal justice were promulgated instead.
 By the Government of India Act, 1870, the Governor-General and other authorities were conferred the power to make or propose laws and the Governor-General was allowed to legislate separately for the backward tracts. As difficulties arose in determining what laws were in force and in which area of backward tracts, the Scheduled Districts Act 1874 was passed. The position at the inauguration of the Government of India, 1935 was that the Governor-General in Council legislated for these backward areas and the Governor-General could direct that any Act of the Indian Legislatures should not apply at all or should apply with such exceptions and modifications as he might think fit. The 1937 Act provided for the ascertainment of the backward tracts and for making of laws in those areas and in 1936 an Order in Council was made specifying the backward tracts. The Scheduled District Act was repealed by the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1937. The Constitution of India, 1950 by Art. 244 made a special provision for the scheduled and tribal areas The State of Nagaland was formed by the State of Nagaland Act, 1965 comprising of Naga Hills- Tuensang Area and consisting of three distracts. The administration of the State of Nagaland was to be in accord- ance with the provisions of the State of Nagaland Act, which among other things provided for the continuance of existing laws and their adaptation The Government and administration of these areas was often not carried on directly under laws made by the Governor-General either by himself 831 or in his Council but through rules which were framed from time to time by other agencies. In 1937, the Governor of Assam prescribed revised Rules under the powers vested in him by s. 6 of the Scheduled Districts Act. These Rules of 1937 began by stating that they cancelled "all previous orders on the subject" but were on the pattern of earlier rules which laid down that in criminal trials the spirit of the Criminal Procedure Code was to be followed because the Code itself was not in force. In appeal to this Court, the main question that arose were whether the Rules of 1937 were validly enacted and they continued to be in force, whether the Scheduled Districts Act was bad because of excessive delegation, and whether the Rules of 1937 were rendered void by reason of Arts. 14 and 21 of the Constitution.
 
HELD : The Rules of 1937 were validly enacted and continued to be 'in force and governed the trial of the respondents.
 The Code of Criminal Procedure admittedly did not apply to that area and the Additional Deputy Commissioner was therefore right in holding the trial under the Rules of 1937, [854 E-F] The Rules of 1937 did survive the repeal of the Scheduled Districts Act, 1874 by virtue of the saving clause in the Adaptation of Laws Order which repealed the Act. The saving clause preserved all notifications and the Rules of 1937 were enacted by a notification. After the passing of the Government of India Act, 1935, the Rules of 1937 were successively preserved by ss. 292 and 293 of the Government of India Act, 1935, s. 18 of the Indian Independence Act, 1947 and Art. 372 of the Constitution. [847 G-848 A] There was no excessive delegation under the Scheduled Districts Act. The Legislature clearly indicated the policy and the manner of effectuating that policy. The Act conferred on the local Governments power to appoint officers for administration of civil and criminal justice within the Scheduled Districts and empowered the local Government to regulate the procedure of the officers so appointed and to confer on them authority and jurisdiction powers and duties incidental to the administration of civil and criminal justice. These provisions afforded sufficient guide to the local Government that the administration of Civil and Criminal justice was to be done under their control by the officers appointed by them and the procedure which they were to follow had to be laid down. Beside.,, there was sufficient guidance in the three sub-sections of a. 6 read as a whole with the preamble, and the Chief Commissioner's Rules made in 1872 and republished In 1874 by Governor- General in Council were also available as a further guide as the last were continued in force by 7. [849 G-850 D] By the Scheduled Districts Act the Governor-General in Council conferred on the local Government an equal or concurrent power and this was clearly indicated by the word "as the case may be' in s. 7 of the Act. Those words did not, show that the local Government could only amend its own Rules. They showed that whoever made the rules the authority of the Act made them binding. [851 A-B] Article 21 of the Constitution did not render the Rules of 1937 ineffective. In the backward tracts it was considered necessary that discretion should have greater play than technical rules and the provision that the spirit of the Code should apply was a law conceived in the best interests of the people. The discretion of the Presiding Officer was not subjected to rigid control because of the unsatisfactory state of defences which would be offered and which might fail if they did not comply with 83 2 some technical rule. The removal of technicalities, led to the advancement of the cause of justice in these backward tracts. On the other hand the imposition of the Code of Criminal Procedure would have retarded Justice as indeed the Governors-General, the Governors and the heads of local Government had always thought. [852 B-D] It was not discriminatory to administer different laws in different areas. These backward tracts were not found suitable for the application of the Criminal Procedure Code in, all its vigour and technicality and to say that they were to be governed, not by the technical rules of the Code, but by the substance of such rules was not to discriminate this area against the rest of India. [852 &G] The law had not attempted to control discretion by Rules in this area but had rightly left- discretion free so that the rule might not hamper the administration of justice. 'Mere was no vested right in procedure; therefore, the respondents could not claim to be tried under the Criminal Procedure code in this area where the, Code was excluded. 1853 G] No discrimination can be spelled out from the differences in the rules applicable to different areas in the backward tracts. The object was to bring these territories under the Code of Criminal Procedure applicable in the rest of India, by stages. Article 371 of the Constitution itself contemplates a different treatment of these tracts and the differences are justified by the vast differences between the needs of social conditions in Nagaland and the various stages of development of different parts of this area. [854 D] (Uniform set of Rules for the whole area suggested.)
