 The appellant Corporation passed a resolution deciding to send two of its members to a health conference at Harrogate in U.K. On the application of the respondent, the High Court of Bombay issued a write restraining the appellant from carrying out the resolution.
 Held, that s. 58 (s) of the Nagpur Corporation Act, 1948, which gave power to the appellant Corporation to provide for any matter likely to promote public health authorised the resolution and it was for the appellant Corporation to decide how a thing which it had the power to do was to be done. It was not a case where it could be said that the delegation would have been of no benefit to the appellant Corporation at all and that was enough to prevent an interference by the Courts in the method of the exercise of its undoubted power by the appellant Corporation.
 Mayor etc. of Westminster v. London & North Western Railway Company, [1905 A.C, 426] relied upon.
 601 The resolution could not be challenged on the ground that the budget did not provide for the expenses of the dele- gation. The budget in fact did so and even if it did not, there was power tinder s. 88 of the Act to alter the budget to make the necessary provision.
 Statutes cannot be confined only to thoughts prevalent at the time when they are enacted. They are put in general terms to embrace innovations. Even if in 1948 delegation by Corporation were not in contemplation, s. 58 (s) may be interpreted as including in "matters likely to promote a public health", the sending of the delegations.
