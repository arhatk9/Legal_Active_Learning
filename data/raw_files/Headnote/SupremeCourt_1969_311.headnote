 The appellants filed a suit for partition claiming their share in certain properties of the Venkatagiri Estate which did not vest in the State by virtue of the Madras Estates (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1948 and in the alternative for maintenance in terms of an agreement entered into in 1899. Their contention was that the Venkatagiri Estate became an impartible estate only under the agreement entered into in 1889 and became a statutory impartible estate by virtue of its inclusion in the schedule to the Impartible Estates Act, 1904 and on the repeal of that enactment by the Abolition Act, 1948, the estate became partible; that the properties claimed in the suit, though outside the territorial limits of the Zamindari, were held impartible only as appurtenant to the main estate and after the impartible character of the main estate was lost those properties became partible. The High Court held that the estate was impartible by custom and was not made impartible for the first time under the agreement of 1889 or by the Acts of 1902 or 1904 and the claim for partition was negatived. As regards the claim for maintenance the court held that a similar claim had been rejected by the judicial committee as not tenable either under the agreement of 1889 or under Hindu law or on the basis of custom. In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (i) There is no reason to differ from the finding of the High Court that the estate of Venkatagiri was an ancient impartible estate by custom and was not made impartible for the first time under the agreement of 1889 or by Madras Acts of 1902 or 1904.

 283 and Pushavathi Viziram Gajapathy Rai Maina v, Pushavathi Viseswar[1963] INSC 62; , [1964] 2 S.C.R. 403, (ii) In relation to Venkatagiri Zamindari the Madras Impartible Estates Act has been repealed so 'far as the Act applied to the Estate which by operation of s. 3(b) of the Abolition Act got transferred and became vested in the State Government. In 'relation to properties which have not become so vested in the Government the Madras impartible Estates Act, 1904 continues to be in force. Since the Abolition Act did not affect the plaint properties these have continued to be what they were at the time of incorporation with the Zamindari, namely. the properties retain their impartible character. The principle cossante ratione legis- 89 cessat ipsa lex has no application in the present case for many times custom outlives the condition of things which give it birth. The junior members of a joint family in the case of ancient impartible joint family estate take no right in the property by birth and, therefore, have; no right of partition having regard to the nature, of the estate which is impartible.

Raja Rajeshwara Rao, 68 I.A., 181, (iii) The agreement of 1889 in so far as it relates to payment of maintenance continues to be in force in spite of the coming into operation of the Abolition Act. In the absence of express words to the effect, it would not be right to attribute to the legislature an intention to free the properties not transferred to the Government by the operation of s. 3(b) of the Act from liability to contribute towards the maintenance of the, junior members under such a contract or family arrangement, and while leaving the land- holder in possession of those other properties, limit the, maintenance holders to a share of a fifth of the compensation amount.
