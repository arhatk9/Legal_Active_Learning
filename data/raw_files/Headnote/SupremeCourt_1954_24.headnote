 Held, that the provision for the search warrant under the first alternative of a. 96(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not offend art. 19(1)(f) of the Constitution.
 A search and seizure is only a temporary interference with the right to hold the property searched and the articles seized. Statutory recognition in this behalf is a necessary and reasonable restriction and cannot per se be considered to be unconstitutional.
 A compelled production of incriminating documents by a person against whom a First Information Report has been made is testimonial compulsion within the meaning of art. 20(3) of the Constitution. But a search and seizure of a document under the provisions of as. 94 and 96 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not a compelled production thereof within the meaning of art. 20 (3) and hence does not offend the said Article.
 A power of search and seizure is, in any system of jurisprudence, an overriding power of the State for the protection of social security and that power is necessarily regulated by law. When the Constitution makers have thought fit not to subject such regulation to constitutional limitations by recognition of the fundamental right to privacy, analogous to the American Fourth Amendment, there is no justification for importing into it, a totally different fundamental right by some process of strained construction.
