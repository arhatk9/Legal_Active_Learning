 The appellant originally belonged to the Police Service in the State of Patiala and was promoted to officiate at a Superintendent of Police in February 1950 in the erstwhile State of PEPSU. After the Indian Police Service Scheme was extended to PEPSU in 1950, the appellant was one of several persons interviewed by the Federal Public Service Commission and his name was placed on what was styled in List II in the Scheme. He continued working as an officiating Superintendent of Police without being confirmed in the post. On December 1, 1954, he was reverted to his substantive rank of Deputy Superintendent by an order of the Inspector-General of Police. The appellant thereafter filed a suit claiming that the order of reversion was bad. He alleged that the inclusion of his name in List 11 of the Scheme gave him a right to continue as an officiating Superintendent of Police for five years and his reversion within that period to his substantive post amounted to a punishment. He alleged there was thus non-compliance with Art.- 311 of the Constitution. He also ' complained that while he was reverted, persons who were junior to him, in the sense that their names had not been included in any of the Lists under the Scheme, were allowed to continue as officiating Superintendents of Police; there was therefore discrimination as against him. The case of the respondent State was that the reversion had been effected purely on administrative grounds as a Superintendent of Police who was returning to the State had to be accommodated, and there was no vacancy in which the appellant could be allowed to work as Superintendent of Police. The Trial Court held that the impugned order was not made by way of punishment and the plaintiff had failed to prove there was any discrimination against him. An appeal to the High Court was dismissed. On appeal to this Court, 
 HELD : The reversion was justified on administrative grounds and there was no bar to such reversion by reason of the inclusion of the appellant's name in List 11. The said list merely ensured that the officers whose name were borne thereon would be watched for the space of five years and they might be absorbed in the All India Service even within the said period as a result of periodical reviews. Although reversion on the ground of unfitness was mentioned in the scheme the possibility of such reversion when there was no available post in the cadre of Superintendents of Police was not ruled out. As the officers in List 11 had no tight to be absorbed in the Indian Police Service immediately, the direction in the scheme that "officers placed in List II will continue to hold their present post" merely meant that they would not be made to go out of their posts except on justifiable grounds. Holding a post in an officiating capacity as a Superintendent of Police did not entitled the appellant 551 to continue in that post even if officers senior to him who were on leave or had been sent out of the State on deputation were to come back to the State and there was no room in the cadre to absorb them all.
