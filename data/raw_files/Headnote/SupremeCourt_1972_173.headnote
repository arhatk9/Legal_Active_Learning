 The appellant, who was less than 21 years of age, was convicted for an offence under s. 326, read with 6. 140 I.P.C.. and was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment. On the question whether he could claim the benefit of s. 6 of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, 
HELD : (1) The Act was enacted with a view to provide 'for the release of, offenders of certain categories on probation or after due admonition with the object of preventing the conversion of youthful Offenders of less than 21 years age into obdurate criminals as a result of their association with hardened criminals of mature age in the jail. Where, however, the offence for which a person has been convicted is of a serious nature punishable with imprisonment for life, or is one of those specified in s. 18 of the Act, the benefit of the Act would not be available. [877G-H; 879A-C] (2) The appellant, on being convicted for the offence under a. 326 read with s. 149, I.P.C., was liable to be punished with imprisonment for life. Therefore, he would not be entitled to the benefit of S. 6 of *a Probation of Offenders Act., To hold otherwise would be treating the word but not with imprisonment for life' in the section, as otiose, contrary to rules of construction. [878E-G] (3) The 'fact that imprisonment for a lesser term can also be awarded for the offence would not take it out of the category of offences punishable with imprisonment for life.
