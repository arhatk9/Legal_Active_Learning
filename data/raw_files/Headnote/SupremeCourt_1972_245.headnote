 Under the U.P. Sales Tax Act 1948 as it originally stood the purchases of split or processed foodgrains and dal by dealers were sought to be brought to tax under s. 3-D of the principal Act read with the notification issued. in a writ petition relating to the assessment year 1966-67 (Tilok Chand Prasan Kumar v. Sale Tax Officer, Hathras 25 STC 118) the High Court of Allahabad struck down the levy holding that the dal purchased by the petitioner could not be said to be a commodity essentially different from the arhar dal purchased by the dal mills and accordingly the purchases effected by the petitioner could not be regarded as the first purchases. Thereafter the Governor of U.P. issued the Uttar Pradesh Sale Tax (Amendment and Validation) Ordinance,, 1970 adding inter alia Explanation to s. 3-D as well as a validating provision viz. s. 7 to the principal Act. The ordinance, was later enacted as the Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax Act (Amendment and Validation) Act 1970.
 Explanation II aforesaid provided that split or processed foodgrains such as in the form of dal shall be deemed to be different from unsplit or unprocessed foodgrains and accordingly tax could be levied on first purchases of split dal. In support of the writ petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution filed in the High Court by the appellant the validity of Explanation 11 of s. 3-D as well as s. 7 was challenged and it was contended that the amendments incorporated were not effective enough to bring to tax the first purchase of split or processed foodgrains and pulses.
 The High Court rejected these contentions and dismissed the writ petition. There after these recent appeals were brought with certificates, Dismissing the appeals.
 
HELD : (i) The source of the legislative power to levy sales of purchases tax on goods is Entry 54 of List II of the Constitution. It is well settled that subject to constitutional restrictions a power to legislate includes a power to legislate prospectively as well as retrospectively.
 In Chhotabhai Jethabhai Patel it was specifically decided by this Court that where the legislature can make a valid law, it can provide net only for the prospective operation of the material provisions of the said law but it can also provide for the retrospective operation of the said provisions. The contention that no fresh levy can be imposed by retrospective legislation must therefore be rejected. [509 E] The Union of India v. Madan Gopal Kamra, [1954] 3 S.C.R.

 (ii) It is open to the legislature to define the nature of the goods, the sale or purchase of which should be brought to tax.. Legislature was not incompetent to separate the processed or split pulses from the unsplit or unprocessed pulses and treat the two as separate and independent goods.
 There was no basis for the contention that the legislature cannot for the purpose of tax under the Act separate the split or processed from the unsplit or unprocessed. [510A-D] Jagannath and Ors. v. Union of India, [1961] INSC 171; [1962] 2 S.C.R. 118, referred to.
 (iii) There was no justification for the contention that the legislature had usurped any judicial power. The legislature had not purported either directly or by implication to overrule the decision of the Allahabad High Court in Tilok Chand Prasan Kumar's case On the other hand it had accepted that decision as correct; but had sought to remove the basis of that decision by retrospectively changing the law. Encroachment on the judicial power is outside the competence of the legislature but the nullification of the effect of a judicial decision by changing the law retrospectively, is within its permissible limits. From the statement of objects and reasons, it appears that in the principal Act, the legislative intent was not clearly brought out. By means of the Amending Act the legislature wanted to make clear its intent. [510 D] (iv) In a democratic set up it is for the legislature to decide what economic or social policy it should pursue or what administrative considerations it should bear in mind., The classification between the processed or split pulses and unprocessed or unsplit pulses is a reasonable classification. It is based on the use to which those goods can be put. Hence, the impugned classification was not violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution. [511 F] Khandige Sham and ors. v. The Agricultural Income Tax Officer[1962] INSC 245; , [1963] 3 S.C.R. 809 referred to.
 (v) The levy was not violative of Art. 19 (1) (f) and (g).
 amendment of the Act was necessitated because of the legislature's failure bring out clearly in the principal Act its intenion to separate the processed or split pulses from the unsplit or unprocessed pulses. Further the retrospective amendment became necessary as otherwise the State would have to refund large sums of money. The contention that the retrospective levy did Dot afford any opportunity to the dealers to pass on the tax payable to the consumers, has not much validity. The tax is levied on the dealers, the fact that he is allowed to pass on the tax to the consumers or he is generally in a position to pass on the same to the consumer has no relevance when legislative competence is under consideration. [511 G] (vi) Ordinarily a proviso to a section is intended to take out a part of the main section for special treatment. It is not expected to enlarge the main section. But cases have arisen in which this Court has held that despite the fact that a provision is called proviso, 'it is really a separate provision and the so called proviso has substantially altered the main section. If on a true reading of an Explanation it appears that it has widened the scope of the main section, effect must be given to the legislative intent not withstanding the fact that the legislature named that provision as an Explanation.

 and anr. v. Bank of Bihar and ors.[1966] INSC 216; , [1967] 1 S.C.R. 848 referred to.
 The contention thatExplanation 11 to s. 3 D did not widen the scope of s. 3-D could notbe accepted. Section 3-D as it originally stood dealt with foodgrainsand pulses. It did not treat the unprocessed or unsplit foodgrains and pulses as a separate item. The newly added Explanation brings to tax with retrospective effect the split or processed foodgrains as well. [513E] (vii) It cannot be said that because the notification under s. 3D continues to refer to foodgrains only, it was not possible to tax processed or split foodgrains under it.
 Section 3 D refers to foodgrains, but be..cause of Explanaticon II, the expression "foodgrains" has to be read as containing two different items processed or split foodgrains and upprocessed or unsplit foodgrains.
 Consequtntly while reading the expression "foodgrains" in the notification also the same approach must be adopted.
 This conclusion is also obvious from s. 7 which says in plain words that the notification must be deemed to have been issued under s. 3-D as amended. While a taxing statute must be strictly construed, but that ,does not mean that a provision in a taxing statute should not be read reasonably.
 [514 H] (viii) Section 3 -D does not suffer from the vice of delegation of legislative power to the executive.
 In the Act under s. 3 the legislature has sought to impose multi-point tax on all 'sales and purchase. After having done that it has given power to the executive, a high authority and which is presumed to command the majority support in the legislative, to select for special treatment dealings in certain class of goods. In the very nature of things, it is impossible for the legislature to enumerate goods, dealings in which sales tax or purchase tax should be imposed. it is also impossible for the legislature to select the goods which should be subjected to a single point sales or purchase tax. Before making such selections several aspects such as the impact of the levy on the society, economic consequences and the administrative convenience will have to he considered. These factors may change from time to time. Hence in the very nature of things, these details have got to be left to the executive. [515 B] Pt. Banarsi Das Bhanot and ors. v.
