 Some police officers of the State seized gold from the appellant in exercise of their statutory powers, but were negligent in dealing with its safe custody. As a result of such negligence the gold was not returned to the appellant and so, he filed the suit against the State claiming the value of the gold. The suit was decreed by the trial court but was dismissed by the High Court on appeal. In the appeal to the Supreme Court, 
HELD : The power to arrest a person, to search him. to seize property found with him, are powers conferred on specified officers by statute and are powers which could be properly characterised as sovereign powers. Therefore, though the negligent act was committed by the employees of the respondent-State during the course of their employment, the claim against the State could not be sustained, because, the employment in question was of the category which could claim the special characteristic of sovereign power.
