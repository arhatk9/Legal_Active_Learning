 A testator, who was childless, executed a will on April 28, 1937 and died on March 10, 1939, leaving him surviving his widow. In cl. 6 of the will he expressed his desire to adopt a boy and stated that in case he did not make an adoption during his life-time his wife shall adopt K. He also conferred authority, on his 122 956 wife to make an adoption in case K died before being adopted By cl. 11 of the will he provided that exclusive of the properties that might be given for T's wives, M. A. and K.
 A., and daughter and for his wife for being enjoyed by each during her lifetime, in respect of one-half of all the remaining properties of his family, his wife shall before making an adoption, execute in favour of K. S. a document under which he shall enjoy only the income from those properties during his lifetime and that after his lifetime his heirs shall get them with absolute rights, and she shall also make an arrangement to the effect that his adopted son similarly got and enjoyed only the remaining half. Clause 12 provided.. "Should myself and my wife die without making an adoption or should my wife predecease me or in case I do not adopt any boy or in case the boy adopted by me is not alive at the time of my death, the above K and the above K.
 S. shall get the whole of my properties in equal shares...... Should myself and my wife die without making an adoption as stated above and should the above K. S.
 predecease us, the above M. A. and K. A. shall get all the properties........" No adoption was made either by the testator before his death or by his widow thereafter. K instituted a suit for a declaration of his rights under the will basing his claim under Cl. 12 on the footing that under that clause when no adoption was made and until it was so made he had a vested interest in respect of half the properties subject to defeasance by subsequent adoption.
 Held, that on a true construction of the will dated April 28, 1937, cl. 12 was intended to operate at the time of the death of the testator and not later and that K would get an interest under that clause only if the widow of the testator predeceased the testator and there was no adoption by the testator before his death. In the circumstances K's rights were provided for by cl. 11 only and those rights could not come into existence unless and until he was adopted by the widow. On this view there was a postponement of vesting and a possibility of intestacy, but that cannot be avoided.
 The rules of construction of a will against a postponement of vesting and avoidance of intestacy are not absolute and the court cannot embark on the task of construing a will with a preconceived notion that intestacy must be avoided or vesting must not be postponed.
 The intention of the testator should be ascertained by construing the will as a whole and giving the relevant clauses in the will their plain grammatical meaning considered together.
