 A time schedule for the committal proceedings in RC 2/1977- CIA-1 on the file of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Delhi was-fixed by this Court on 2-2-1978. On the refusal by Committal Court to grant him further time to inspect the records u/s 208 of the Crl.P.C., the petitioner, a co- accused, moved an application for modification of this Court's order dated 2-2-78 on the ground that he was not a party before this Court in the earlier proceedings.
 Rejecting the petition, the Court 
HELD : 1. Where the offence is triable exclusively by the Court of Session, the, Committing Magistrate has no power to discharge the accused. Nor has he power to take oral evidence save where a specific provision like S. 306 enjoins. Hence cross examination by the accused out provisionfor the Magistrate save in the case of approvers.
 No Examination-in-Chief,no cross examination. [862 F] 
2. It is not open to the Committal Court to launch on a processof satisfying itself that a prima facie case has been made lout on the merits.The jurisdiction once vested in the Committing Magistrate under the earlier Code having been eliminated now under the present code, to hold that he can go into the merits even for a prima facie satisfaction is to frustrate Parliament's purpose in re-moulding S. 207-A (old code) into its present non-discretionary shape.
 Expedition intended by this change will be-defeated successfully, if interpretatively it is held that a dress rehearsal of a trial before the Magistrate is in order. The narrow inspection hole through which the Committee Magistrate has to look at the case limits him merely to ascertain whether the case, as disclosed by the police- report, appears to him to show an offence triable solely by the Court of Session. If, by error, a wrong section of the Penal Code is quoted be may look into that aspect. [862 G-H, 863 A-B] If made-up facts unsupported by any material are reported by the police and a Sessions offence is made to appear, it is perfectly open to the Sessions Court u/s 227 Crl.P.C. to discharge the accused. That provision takes care of grievance that the prosecution may stick a label mentioning a Sessions offence and the accused will then be denied a valuable opportunity to prove his ex-facto innocence.
