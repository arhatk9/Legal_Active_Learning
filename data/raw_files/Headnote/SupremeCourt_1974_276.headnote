 In the election to the State Legislative Assembly, the respondent was declared elected. The appellant who was the defeated candidate in 'he election, in her election petition alleged that the respondent had committed a number of corrupt practices, the most important of which related to the distribution of a pamphlet defamatory of her, falling under s. 123(4) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. The High Court dismissed her petition.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended that the High Court applied one standard in appreciating the evidence of the appellant's witnesses and an altogether different standard in appreciating the evidence of the respondent's witnesses.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) On an examination of the evidence it is satisfactorily established that the impugned pamphlet was printed and distributed at the instance of the respondent.
 [135H] (2) Where a corrupt practice is alleged against a returned candidate it must be scrutinised with considerable care because a finding to that effect has very serious consequences. It not merely sets aside the popular verdict but also subjects the successful candidate to the penalty of being disqualified for election and even criminal prosecution. [135 E] (3) This Court does not normally reappraise the evidence and come to a contrary conclusion from that of the trial judge if it is generally acceptable. But it must not be forgotten that an appeal under s. 116A of the Representation of the People Act is a first appeal and not one under the provisions of Art. 136 of' the Constitution and that an appeal is a rehearing. [135 F] In the instant case the evidence has been reassessed because the High Court had rejected the evidence of the appellant's witnesses wholesale mainly on the ground of their being partisan witnesses while no such standard has been applied to evidence of witnesses on behalf of the respondent except in two cases. Even in those cases it was done because the documentary evidence was too strong. The rejection of the evidence by the High Court in one important instance has led to a wrong approach in the appreciation of the oral evidence.
