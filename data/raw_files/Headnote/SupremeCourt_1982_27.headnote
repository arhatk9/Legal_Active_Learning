 Dr. Yogendra Singh Col was appointed Professor of Surgery in the Magadh Medical College and as per the Regulations of the University he was entitled to continue in service until he reached the age of superannuation, which was fixed at 62. Pursuant to the provisions of sub-section (2) of section 6 of the Bihar Private Medical Colleges (Taking Over) Act, 1978, the State Government appointed a Screening Committee which, inter alia, recommended the retirement of all teachers beyond the age of 58 years and their reemployment upto the age of 62 years only if there were no qualified substitutes available. On 11-9-1980, the Principal of the Magadh College, based on the circular dated 3-9-1980 issued by the State Government, after accepting the recommendation of the Screening Committee, issued a notice to Dr. Col. informing him that his services will be terminated with effect from 10-10-1980. A writ petition filed in the High Court of Patna challenging the said order of termination of his services was allowed by the High Court taking the view that by virtue of sub-section (3) of section 3, the obligation to continue Dr. Col in service upto the age of 62 years devolved on the State Government on the taking over of the Magadh Medical College under sub-section (1) of section 3 and the State Government had no power under sub-section (3) of section 6 to terminate his services prior to his attaining the age of superannuation and hence the order dated 11-9-1980 was invalid.
 Allowing the appeal of the State, the Court ^ HELD 1:1. The termination of the service of Dr. Col.
 was perfectly valid. Quite apart from the power expressly conferred under sub-section (3) of section 6, the State Government would have power to terminate the services of any person employed on an ad hoc basis. [339G-H, 340 A] 1:2. It is elementary that when a person is appointed on an ad hoc basis his tenure is precarious and he cannot claim to continue in service until the age of superannuation. From and after the date of notification under sub-section (1) of section 3 of the 1978 Act Dr. Col.
 continued to serve the Magadh Medical College on an ad hoc basis in terms of the proviso to sub-section (1) of section 6 which declared that the staff employed in the College "shall continue to serve the college on an ad hoc basis till a decision under sub-section (3) and (4) is taken by the State Government." In view of the clear and explicit terms of sub 333 section (1) of section 6 providing that as from the date of the notification issued, under sub-section (1) of section 3, "all the staff employed in the college shall cease to be employees of the college body", the contract of Dr. Col with the owners of the Magadh Medical College under the letter of appointment given to him did not devolve on the State Government but came to an end and he became the employee of the State on an ad hoc basis, disentling him to the benefit of retirement at the ago of 62. [338 C-G] It was within the competence of the Screening Committee to make recommendation in regard to the age of superannuation of the teaching staff of the medical colleges taken over by the State Government. Sub-section (2) of section 6 undoubtedly provides that the Committee of exports appointed under that provision will examine the bio-data of each member of the staff and ascertain whether appointment promotion or confirmation of such person was made in accordance with the University Regulations and in keeping with the guidelines laid down by the Medical Council of India and will also take into consideration all other relevant material including length of service in the college and submit its report to the State Government. But sub- section (3) of section 6 also makes it clear that the Committee of experts appointed under sub-section (2) of that section can make recommendations in regard to "rank, pay, allowances and other conditions of service" of the teaching staff. [338 H, 339 A-C] 
 3. The State Government was clearly within its powers under sub-section (3) of section 6 to re-determine the age of superannuation and to provide that the services of all the teachers in the medical colleges taken over by the State Government shall be terminated after giving them one month's notice, if they have attained the age of 62 years or more than 58 years, but less than 62 years, in consonance with the age of retirement of all other Government employees.
 Under sub-section (3) of section 6 the State Government had power to redetermine the rank, pay, allowances and other conditions of service of the teaching staff and "other conditions of service" would include the age of superannuation. [339 E-G]
