 The appellants and respondents are members of an association called the State Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Bihar. Respondent No. 1 filed a suit in the Court of the learned Munsif, 3rd Court, Patna in the capacity of a life member of the Society and obtained an injunction restraining the appellants and respondent No. 3 from interfering with the working of the Society. Having lost the appeal against the order of interim injunction before the Additional District Judge VI, Patna, the appellants filed a revision application before the High Court of Patna. On July 3, 1980, when the revision application came up for hearing before Mr. Justice S.K. Jha, Shri Bindeswari Chaudhury, Advocate appearing for the appellants took an adjournment for July 9, 1980. On July 8, 1980 the appellants changed their advocate and engaged Shri Sailendra Kumar Jha another advocate and son of Mr. Justice S K. Jha to appear for them. The learned Judge was surprised to find that the appearance of his son was filed in a case of which he was already seized. However, on July 9, 1980, instead of Sailendra Kumar Jha appearing for the appellants, Shri Bindeswari Chaudhury appeared and did not press the revision application saying that he would rather return the papers to his clients. The learned Judge dismissed the application since it was not pressed. Hence the appeal after obtaining Special Leave of the Court by the appellants.
 Dismissing the appeal, the Court ^ 
 HELD: 1. Since it is not quite clear whether the appellants made an untrue representation to Shri Sailendra Kumar Jha that the case was not ready for hearing and that it had not even appeared in the monthly cause list, the appellants and their advocate cannot be condemned unheard.

 2. There are a few black sheep in every profession, nay, in every walk of life. But few as they are, they tarnish, by their machinations, the fair name 610 of age-old institutions. Therefore, persons who occupy high public offices must take care to see that those who claim to be close to them are not allowed to exploit that closeness, alleged or real. On the facts of this case, it can only be said that Shri Sailendre Kumar Jha took a correct decision in not appearing in that case any further and, with respect, his father justice S.K. Jha acted in the best traditions of the Judiciary in seeing that his son withdrew from the case.
 It is better that in such circumstances the Advocate son.
 rather than the Judge father, withdraws from the case.
