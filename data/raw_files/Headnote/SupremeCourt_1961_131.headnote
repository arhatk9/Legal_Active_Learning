 In a verification proceeding held by him the Magistrate.
 prepared a memorandum recording his own observations as also the statements made to him by a prosecution witness but not in the manner prescribed by s. 164 Of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He proved the memorandum in court and gave his evidence. It was contended that the High Court was wrong in acting upon the said memorandum.
 Held, that although s. 164 Of the Code of Criminal Procedure and s. 9 of the Indian Evidence Act deal with two different matters, they must be read together and harmoniously con- strued so as to give full effect to both of them.
 So construed, there could be no doubt that the evidence of the Magistrate himself on the basis of the memorandum would be relevant under s. 9 of the Evidence Act and as such admissible in evidence but the statements made to him by the prosecution witness, having been recorded in contravention of the mandatory provisions of s. 164 Of the Code, must be excluded as inadmissible' on evidence.
