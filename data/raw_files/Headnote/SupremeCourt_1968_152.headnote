 The owner of a certain land executed a sale deed on 9th October, 1964 conveying the land to the first respondent and the sale deed was tendered for registration. On 14th November, 1964, the appellant obtained from the registering authority a certified copy of the sale deed, tendered. On 26th November, he filed an application under s. 16(3) of the Bihar Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling Area and Acquisition of Surplus Land) Act, 1962, in the office of the Collector, claiming to be entitled, as a co-sharer, to a right of reconveyance of the land. He annexed to his application the certified copy of the sale deed, a copy of the challan evidencing his having deposited the sale price and the additional sum of 10% thereof in compliance with the proviso to s. 16(3) (i) and r. 19 of the Bihar Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling Area and Acquisition of Surplus Land) Rules, 1963. On 30th November, the sale deed was re- gistered. On the same day, the Collector, on being satisfied that the application was proper, ordered possession to be given to the appellant under s. 16(3) (ii), pending disposal of the application. Thereafter, the Collector passed his order holding that the appellant was the cosharer of the vendor, that he was entitled to the right of reconveyance, and directed the transferee (the first respondent) to reconvey the land in appellant's favour. The Commissioner upheld the order, but the Board of Revenue set it aside. The appellant's writ petition for quashing the Board's order was dismissed by the High Court.
 In appeal to this Court, on the question : )"ether the Collector had no jurisdiction to entertain the application, because, (1) registration of the sale deed was not, completed on the date of filing the application and therefore, the transfer not having taken place on that date, the application was premature; and (2) the application was not maintainable as it was accompanied only by a certified copy of the sale deed tendered for registration and not by a copy of the registered sale deed as required by r. 19.
 
HELD : (1) The right of reconveyance had not accrued to the appellant on 26th November, 1964, the date of presentation of his application. because, the sale was, completed only when 'registration of the sale deed was completed as contemplated by s. 61 of the Registration Act, that is, on 30th November. Merely because under s. 47 of the Registration Act the transferee's title related back to 9th October, 1964, the date of execution of the sale deed, it could not be said that the transfer itself must. be deemed to have been completed on 9th October.

Khazan Singh, [1958] INSC 58; [1959] S.C.R. 878, followed.
 329 But a mere presentation of the -application in the sense of the appellant having handed it over to some subordinate in the collector's office could not mean that it was entertained by the Collector on that date. It could not therefore be contended by the respondent that the Collector had entertained the application either on the 26th when it was taken by the appellant to the collector's office or on the 28th when some subordinate in the office made an endorsement on it that it should be placed before the Collector. The Collector took cognizance of it only on 30th November when it was placed before him. Since registration of the sale deed and therefore the transfer had both become, complete on that date, the Collector had jurisdiction to entertain the application on that date and pass appropriate orders. [337 B-E] (2) Rule 19 provides that the application under s. 16(3) should be made in a particular form, that the applicant has to deposit the purchase money together with 10% thereof in the appropriate treasury and that a copy of the challan showing the deposit together with a copy of the registered deed, shall be filed along with the application. But the rule does not lay down the consequence of non-compliance with the provisions. The deposit in the relevant treasury, the applicant's readiness and willingness to have the land reconveyed to him on the same terms and conditions as in the sale deed, and the, completed transfer are conditions pre- cedent to the applicant acquiring the right of reconveyance and to the Collector's jurisdiction to try the application.
 But the prescription as to annexing a copy of the registered deed is not mandatory but only directory. [340 E-H] In a case where there is no express mention of the consequence of non-compliance with a statutory declaration, no rule can be laid down for determining whether the requirement is a mere direction involving no invalid consequence, or is an imperative mandate with an implied nullification for disobedience, except, that it depends on the scope and object of the enactment. The object of s.
 16(3) is to secure consolidation by giving a right of reconveyance to a co-sharer or a raiyat of an adjoining area so that the land can be used in the most advantageous manner and to prevent fragmentation; and that of r. 19 is to enable the Collector to ascertain the purchase price., the terms and conditions of the sale, the readiness and willingness of the applicant to have the land reconveyed to him on the same terms and conditions as in the, sale deed and that the requisite deposit had been made in the treasury. The purpose of pressing that a copy of the registered deed should accompany the application is that if such a copy is before the Collector there would be no scope for any controversy about the transfer, the sale price and the terms and conditions. But if this information is before the Collector otherwise, and the Collector is satisfied, failure to annex the copy of the registered deed cannot be fatal to the application. Further, s. 16 of the Act fixes three months from the date of registration as the period of limitation for making the application, but, if the registering authority does not furnish the copy of the registered deed within that period and if the requirement of annexing the copy is held to be mandatory, the applicant would be deprived of his statutory right of reconveyance.
 [337 -H; 338 A-B; 339' F-H] In the present case, the fact that a copy of the registered deed was not annexed to- the application was not fatal to the application, nor did such omission deprive the Collector of his jurisdiction to entertain it, because, annexing a certified copy of the sale deed when a copy of the registered deed was not available on account of the process of registration not having been completed was sufficient compliance with the directory prescription 330 as it furnished the information necessary for the Collector to proceed with the application.
