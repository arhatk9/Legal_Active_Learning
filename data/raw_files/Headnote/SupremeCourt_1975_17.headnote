 In pursuance of the order of detention made by the District Magistrate, West Dinajpur, on March 19, 1973, the petitioner was taken into custody. The order of detention was intended to prevent the petitioner from acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies essential to the community. The first ground related to the arrest of the petitioner and his associates while they were smuggling 65 KGs. of paddy from West Dinajpur District to Malda District.
 On being challenged by the patrol party he could not produce any valid document in support of his carrying paddy at West Dinajpur-Malda districts border. The second ground related to the smuggling of paddy on 11/12-3-73 mid-night in 6 bullock carts by the petitioner and his associates from West Dinajpur District to Malda District. On being challenged by the Resistance Group Members, the petitioner and his associates threatened to kill them and therefore, being thus terrorised, they dared not apprehend the petitioner and his associates.
 Dismissing the Writ Petition challenging the order of detention, 
HELD : (i) The counter affidavit disclosed that a criminal case had been instituted against the petitioner and his associates for offences of illegal transport of paddy, for resistance to the police, officers taking them into custody and for escape from lawful custody. It further stated that 'due to dangerous and desperate nature of the detenu and his associates' the witness declined to give evidence in open court for fear of their lives and that the final report was submitted in the said case. This means that the charge- sheet disclosed sufficient evidence to go before the Court and it was not a case of absence of reasonable grounds of suspicion. [403H-404B] (ii) So far as the second ground is concerned, the absence of material to show that a case has been charge-sheeted, in court is not destructive of the detention order provided there is some material for subjective satisfaction of the authority concerned. Whether the investigation was conducted properly or not, whether the District Magistrate should have pinned his faith on the- result of investigation and like questions are not for the court to consider. But the minimum which must be placed before the court is that there was some evidence gathered during investigation which, in some manner, roped in the petitioner. In the present case, there is some evidence for the District Magistrate to act. [404E-H] (iii) Rhetorical assertions that the Presidential proclamation of emergency has outlived its- reality and must be annulled. cannot be transformed into proof. The reasons given by this Court in Bhuth Nath's case A.I.R. 1974 S.C.
 806, holds good here too. [405E-F] Samsher Singh's case[1974] INSC 156; , A.I.R. 1974 S.C. 2192, referred to.
