 In the suit, for redemption of mortgage and recovery of possession, the appellant mortgagee in possession of the suit house w.e.f. 7-11-1953 by virtue of the Deed of Possessory mortgage dt. 21-5-1953 contested on the ground that, in view of the fact that he was a tenant prior to the mortgage, he was entitled to retain the possession even after the redemption. The trial court accepting the contention decreed only symbolical possession. On appeal by respondent No. 1 the mortgagor, the first appellate court reversed the decree and ordered recovery of possession of the property on deposit of the expenses towards repairs being a "clog on redemption". The High Court on Second Appeal confirmed the said orders holding that the Deed of Mortgage shows that the relationship between the appellant and the respondent was that of a mortgagee and mortgagor.
 Affirming the judgment of the High Court and dismissing the appeal by special leave, the court ^ 
HELD : (i) Ordinarily the doctrine of merger applies to extinction of mortgage security occuring by the merger of a lower in a higher security and by the merger of a lesser estate in a greater estate. Where the capacity in which a person in possession of the mortgagee's rights is something quite different from the capacity in which he is in possession of the equity of redemption, the mere fact that the two capacities are united in the same physical person cannot result in a merger. For a merger to arise it is necessary that a lesser estate and a higher estate should merge in one person at one and the same time and in the same right, and no interest in the property should remain outside. In the case of a lease the estate that is in the lessor is the reversion. In the case of a mortgage the estate that is outstanding being the equity of redemption of the mortgagor, there cannot be a merger of lease and mortgage in respect of the same property since neither of them is a higher or lesser estate. [793B-D] Narayan v. Ramchandra 65 Bom. L.R. p. 449 (approved) (ii) A surrender under clauses (e) and (f) of the Transfer of Property Act is an yielding up of the term of the lessee's interest to him who has the immediate reversion or the lessor's interest. Implied surrender by operation of law occurs by the creation of a new relationshin or relinquishment of possession, if the lessee accepts a new lease that in itself is a surrender. Surrender can also be implied from the consent of the parties or from such facts as the relinquishment of possession by the lessee and taking over possession by the lessor. Relinquishment of possession operates as an implied surrender. There must be taking of possession, not necessarily a physical taking, but something amounting to a virtual taking of possession. Whether this has occurred is a question of fact. [793H, 794A-B] (iii) (a) In the instant case, on the redemption of the mortgage the respondent had a right to record possession both on the terms of the mortgage deed and u/s 62 of the Transfer of Property Act (b) The provision for subletting in the Mortgage Deed, contrary to section 15 of the Bombay, Rents, Hotel and Lodging House. Rates Control Act, 1957 as it stood in 1953 shows that the character of tenant is lost;
 (c) Continuing the tenancy till 7-11-1953 790 and confirming the possession of the appellant as mortgagee w.e.f. that date is an unequivocal conduct showing that no tenancy was to exist from 7-11-1953, but the relationship was that of a mortgagor and mortgagee and (d) there would be no question of the tenancy being kept in abeyance or the tenancy reviving on the expiration of the period of mortgage.
