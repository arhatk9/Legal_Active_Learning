 The plaintiff-respondent filed a suit for evicting the defendants-appellants from the suit premises situated within the limits of Tirodha Municipality. The maintainability of the suit was challenged on the ground that previous permission of the Controller was not taken u/s. 8 of the C.P. and Berar Regulation of letting of Accommodation Act, 1946. The Court of First Appeal, dismissed the suit, but in appeal the High Court held that the Notification dated July 26, 1949, applied,only to the Municipalities existing on that date, and that as no fresh Notification extending Benefits of the Rent Control Order to the subsequently constituted Tirodha Municipality, was issued, the protection of cl. 13 was not available to the appellants. Allowing the appeal by special leave, the Court, 
HELD: The wordings of the notification dated July 26, 1949, provide that Chapter II of the Rent Control Order extends to "all the Municipalities" in the State. No fresh notification was therefore necessary to extend the benefit of the Rent Control Order to a subsequently constituted Municipality. Tirodha was constituted as a Municipality on June 12, 1956, and the provisions. of ChapterII became applicable to it, from that date. [239E-F]
