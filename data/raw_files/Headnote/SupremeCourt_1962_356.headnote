 In the year 1897, one Girdhari Lal executed a will bequething his property to his wife Mst. Kishen Dei and adopted son. The adopted son predeceased Girdhari Lal.
 After the death of Girdhari Lai his wife executed a will be- quething the property in dispute i. e. the house to her brother's grandson, the respondent, The appellant who was in occupation of a portion of the said house refused to execute a lease deed in favour of the respondent or pay him the rent after the death of Mst. Kishen Dei. The respondent filed a suit for eviction against the appellant. The appellant denied the title of the respondent as Mst. Kishen Dei did not get an absolute interest under the will of her husband and pleaded that Girdhari Lal; dedicated the said house to one Shiv Temple by executing a will and appointed him as a trustee. The Subordinate judge decreed the plaintiff respondent suit. On appeal the District judge set aside the decree of the Subordinate judge and dismissed the suit, holding that under the will of 1897, Kishen Dei got only a limited estate. The plaintiff-respondent preferred a second appeal to the High Court and the decree of the District judge was set aside and that of the Subordinate judge was restored and on construction of the will of 1897 it held that as the gift over failed, the life estate became an absolute estate and she got an absolute interest in the property. The appellant preferred a Letters Patent appeal before the Division Bench of the High Court and the judgment of the Single judge was confirmed.
 Held, that in construing a will the court should try its best to get at : (i) the intention of the testator by reading the will as a whole and if possible, such construction as would give to every expression some effect rather than that which could render any of the expression inoperative must be accepted;(ii) another rule is that the words occurring more than once in a will shall be presumed to be used always in the same sense 835 unless a contrary intention appears from the will; (iii) all parts of a will should be construed in relation to each other; (iv) the court will - look at the circumstances under which the testator makes his will, such as the state of his property, of his family and the like; (v) where apparently conflicting dispositions can be reconciled by giving full effect to every word used in a document, such a construction should be accepted instead of a. construction which would have the effect of cutting down the clear meaning of the words used by the testator; (vi) where one of the two resonable construction would lead to intestacy, that should be discarded in favour of a construction which does not create any such hiatus.
 On the above rule of construction, under the present will the gift over in favour of the son was only by way of defeasance and the widow had got an obsolute interest in the property.

 Held, further, that the expression 'Malik' has been con- sistently understood by courts as conveying the idea of absolute ownership and therefore, the testator used the word 'Malik' to describe his absolute interest in the property.
