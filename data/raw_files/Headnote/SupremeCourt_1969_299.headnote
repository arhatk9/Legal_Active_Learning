 Disputes between the appellant and the first respondent were referred to five arbitrators as per the agreement entered into between the parties. The agreement provided that the decision could be derived at by the arbitrators 'in whatever manner' they think. The arbitrators made their award, on the basis of their personal knowledge. The appellant filed a suit for passing a decree in terms of the award on November 1, 1955. Though the respondents had notice of the suit, they had no notice of the filing of the award into court. The respondent filed his written statement on February 3, 1956, challenging the validity of the award on certain grounds. While the first appellate court held that the arbitration agreement empowered the arbitrators to import their personal knowledge, the High Court, in revision held that it did not so empower, that the award was vitiated by legal misconduct, and that the objection to the award by the respondent was not barred by time.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD: (1) Article 158 of the Limitation Act, 1908, gives to the party 30 days time for applying to set aside an award from the date of the service of the notice of filing of the award. Since there was no such notice, the objection by the respondent was within time. [905 G-H] (2) Parties to an agreement of reference may include in it such clauses as they think fit, except those prohibited by law, but the phrase 'in whatever manner' they think does not mean that the arbitrators can decide the disputes on the basis of their personal knowledge. Further, arbitrators must act in accordance with the principles of natural justice, and inform the parties to the submission about the nature of their personal knowledge but in the present case, it was not done so. L906 F-G; 907 A-B, C-E] Chandris v. Isbrandtsen Moller Co. Inc., [1951] K. B. 240, referred to.
 (3) The decision of the High Court being eminently just, this Court will not interfere with it under Art. 136 of the Constitution, assuming that the High Court, in exercise of its revisional powers, could not have corrected the first appellate court's interpretation.
