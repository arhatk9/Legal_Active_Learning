The appellant challenged his election by an election petition on the grounds, inter alia, that prior to his election, the respondent, who was a Minister in the State Government and had available to him certain discretionary funds, had used these funds to bribe the voters; it was alleged that prior to the election be had visited several villages in his constituency and the voters had told him that they would not vote for him as he had done nothing for their uplift: he had therefore made various discretionary grants to Gram Panchayats. given funds for the construction of a sacred tank in one village, for building public utility works, community centres and for repairs of Harijan well in different villages. It was also alleged that be had used his position as Minister to favour some Of the villagers by providing certain irrigation facilities in some villages with a view to securing support for his candidature. The High Court dismissed the election petition.
 On appeal to this Court.
 
HELD : On the evidence before it, the High Court had rightly dismissed the petition.
 The law requires that a corrupt practice involving bribery must be fully established. The evidence must show clearly that the promise or gift directly or indirectly was made to an elector to vote or refrain from voting at an election.
 The position of a Minister is difficult. it is obvious that he cannot cease to function when his election is due. He must of necessity attend to the grievances, otherwise he must fail. He must improve the image of his administration before the public. If every one of his official acts done bona fide is to be construed against him and an ulterior motive is spelled out of them, the administration must necessarily come to a stand-still. [109 F-G] In the present case the money was not distributed among the voters directly but was given to Panchayats and the public at large. It was to he used for the good of those for and those against the candidate. No doubt this had the effect of pushing forward the respondent's claims but that was inevitable even if no money was spent but good administra- tion changed the people's condition. it could not therefore be held that there was any corrupt practice. If there was good evidence that the Minister bargained directly or indirectly for votes. the result might have been different, but there was no such evidence. [110 B-C] Case law referred to.
 Obiter . Election is something which must be conducted fairly. To arrange to spend money on the eve of elections in different constituencies, 103 although for general public good is, when all is said, and done,, an evil practice, even if it may not be corrupt practice. The dividing line between an evil practice and a corrupt practice is a very thin one. It should be understood that energy to do public good should be used not on the eve of elections but much earlier and that even slight evidence might change this evil practice into corrupt practice. Payments from discretionary grants on the eve of elections should be avoided. [110 D-E]
