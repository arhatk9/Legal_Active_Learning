 The respondent tenant made an application in 1956 for fixation of standard rent under section 11 of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947. In February, 1960, in the said proceedings, the contractual rent of Rs. 80/- per month was reduced to Rs. 54.25 per month in respect of the shop in dispute. The rent remained in arrears from 1956 to 1960. In June and July, 1960, the appellant landlord issued a notice to quit to the res- pondent. Nearly 5 months after the fixation of standard rent the respondent filed a Revision Application under section 115 of the Civil Procedure Code which was summarily dismissed by the High Court. In November, 1960, the appellant filed present suit for eviction. On 30-8-1962, issues were framed and therefore that was the first date of hearing. In June, 1963 the Trial Court held that since the dispute about the standard rent was pending when the suit was filed the provisions of section 12(3)(a) were not attracted. However, the appellant was entitled to a decree, under section 12(3) (b) since the respondent had not paid the rent regularly in accordance with the provisions of section 12(3)(b). The Appellate Court held that the case was governed by section 12(3)(a) and, therefore, the appellant was entitled to a decree of eviction. The Appellate Court further held that even if the case was governed by section 12(3)(b), since the respondent had not complied with its provisions the suit was bound to be decreed in accordance with the decision of this Court in the case of Shah Dhansukhlal. The Appellate Court also held that even if any discretion was vested in. the Court under section 12(3)(b) of the Act that discretion had been properly exercised by the Trial Court.
 The respondent filed a Writ Petition under Article 227 of the Constitution against the judgment of the Appellate Court. The Writ Petition succeeded before the High Court because the High Court thought that the view expressed by this Court in Shah Dhansukhlal's case still left room for the application of what was laid down by Chagla C. J. in Kalidas Bhavan's case. The original tenant of the shop in question having died during the course of litigation, the present respondent, who is the son of the original tenant was impleaded in the petition. Section 5(11)(c) of the Act defines a tenant as including any member of the tenant's family residing with him at the time of his death. The High Court took the view that section 5(11)(c) applies not only to residential premises but also to business premises and that, therefore, on the death of a tenant of business premises any member of the tenant's family residing with him at the time of his death would become a tenant.
 Al lowing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) It is difficult to see how in case of business premises the need for showing residence with the original tenant at the time of his death would be relevant. It is obvious from the language of section 5(11)(c) that the intention of the Legislature in giving protection to a member of the family of the tenant residing with him at the time of his death was to secure that on 199 the death of the tenant the member of his family residing with him at the time of his death is not thrown out. This protection would be necessary only in case of residential premises. When a tenant is in occupation of business pre- mises there would be no question of protecting against dispossession a member of his family. The tenant may be carrying on a business in which the member of his family residing with him may not have any interest at all and yet on the construction adopted by the High Court, such member of the family would become a tenant in respect of the business premises. Such a result could not have been intended to be brought about by the legislature. The basic postulate of the protection under the Rent Act is that the person who is sought to be protected must be in possession of the premises and his possession is protected by the legislation. But in case of business premises a member of the family of the tenant residing with him at the time of his death may not be in the possession of the business premises and yet, on the view taken by the High Court, he would become tenant in respect of the business premises with which he has no connection.

 (2) The Act interferes with the landlord's right to property and freedom of contract only for the limited purpose of protecting tenants against exercise of the landlord's power to evict them in these days of scarcity of accommodation by asserting superior rights in property or trying to exploit his position by extracting too high rents from helpless tenants. The object was not to deprive the landlord altogether of his rights in property which have also to be respected. Another object was to make possible eviction of tenants who fail to carry out their obligation to pay rent to the landlord despite opportunities given by law in that behalf. Thus, section 12(3)(a) makes it obligatory for the court to pass a decree when its conditions are satisfied. [205B-C] Hatilal Balabhai Nazar v. Ranchodbhai Shankrbhai Patel and Ors., A.I.R. 1968 Gujarat p. 172. approved.
 If there is statutory default or neglect on the part of the tenant whatever may be its cause the landlord acquires a right under section 12(3)(a) to get a decree for eviction but where the conditions of section 12(3)(a) are not satisfied there is a further opportunity given to the tenant to protect himself against eviction. He can comply with the conditions set out in section 12(3)(b) and defeat the landlord's claim for eviction. If, however, he does not fulfil those conditions he cannot claim protection of section 12(3)(b) and in that event there being no other protection available to him a decree for eviction would have to go against him. It is difficult to see how by any judi- cial velour discretion exercisable in favour of the tenant can be found in section 12(3)(b) even where the conditions laid down by, it are not satisfied. [205-C-E] Kalidas v. Bhavan Bhagwandas, 60 Bombay L.R. 1359 overruled.
 Section 12(3)(b) does not create any discretionary jurisdiction in the Court. It provides protection to the tenant on certain conditions and these conditions have to be strictly observed by the tenant who seeks the benefit of this section. If the statutory provisions do not go far enough to relieve the hardship of the tenant the remedy lies with the legislature. It is not in the hands of the Court.
 1205-F-G] (3) The High Court committed a gross error in interfering with what was a just and proper exercise of discretion by the Court of small Causes, in exercise of its power under Article 227 of the Constitution. The High Court without even considering or setting aside the findings of the Court in regard to the circumstances calling for the exercise of a discretion in favour of the appellant allowed the application under Article 227. This was quite unwarranted.

 A finding as to whether circumstances justified the exercise of discretion or not, unless clearly perverse and patently unreasonable, is, after all, a finding of fact only and it cannot be interfered with either under Article 226 or 227 of the Constitution [206 C-D]
