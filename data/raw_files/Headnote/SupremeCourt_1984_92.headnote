 The two respondents were convicted under s. 302 read with s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced to life imprisonment by the sessions Judge. On appeal, the High Court was informed that both the parties were closely related and they had come to some sort of arrangement under which one accused had made a gift of some land to the widow as compensation for the loss of life of her husband. The High Court acquitted one of the accused and converted the conviction of the other from one under s. 302 to one under s. 304 and reduced the sentence to two years. The so called arrangement between the parties was the only reason for what the High Court did.
 Setting aside the judgment of the High Court and remanding the matter for rehearing, this Court, ^ 
 HELD: The entire system of administration of Criminal justice is reduced to a mockery by the judgment of the High Court. If it is upheld, it is as if a person who can afford to make gifts of land or money to the heirs of the victim may get away even with a charge of murder. Courts are to dispense justice, not to dispense with justice. And, justice to be dispensed is not palm-tree justice or idiosyncratic justice. The judgment of the High Court cannot stand a second's scrutiny. [641 H; 642 A-B]
