 In a complaint filed before the Judicial Magistrate the appellant (bride's father) alleged that during the marriage ceremonies the first respondent (bride groom's father) had demanded a large sum of money to be paid to him as dowry and threatened that if the appellant did not pay the sum he would stop further marriage ceremonies, that even after his daughter. had gone to the first respondent's house after the marriage the respondent's continued to demand payment of money and that this constituted an offence under section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.
 After verifying the complaint the Judicial Magistrate issued processes to the respondents and sent summons is to the United States where the respondents were, Allowing the respondent's application impugning the order of the Magistrate issuing summonses, the High Court held that since there was no allegation in the complaint that the respondents first demanded the dowry and the appellant had agreed to pay it and the respondents thereafter demanded it again, no offence under section 4 was made out.
 In the appeal to this Court it was contended on- behalf of the appellant that a mere demand for dowry, even if there was no consent to comply with that demand, would constitute an offence under section 4 of the Act.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: From a reading of section 2 of the Act, it would appear that consent to comply with demand for payment of any property or valuable securities as 'consideration' for the marriage would alone make the property or valuable security given or agreed to be given directly or indirectly "dowry" 763 within the meaning of the Act. But having regard to the dominant purpose of the Act the entries definition of "dowry" should not be imported into section 4. The dictionary meaning of the word 'bride' is a woman about to marry or has just been married and a `bridegroom' is a man who is about to marry or has just been married. If the literal-meaning of these words is given to the words bride and bridegroom used in the section any property or valuable security demanded and contented to be given before the woman had become a bride or the man had become a bridegroom may not be dowry. The avowed object of the Act being to eradicate the evil of demanding dowry, a liberal construction has to be given to the word "dowry" to mean any property or valuable security which if consented to be given on demand would be dowry within the meaning of section 2.
 There is, therefore, no warrant for the respondents' contention that initial demand for dowry would not constitute an offence but that it would be an offence only when the demand was made again after the party on whom it was made had agreed to comply with it.

 The inherent power of the High Court must be exercised sparingly and with circumspection when there is reason to believe that the process of law is being misused to harass a citizen. In this case the High Court should have refused to involve its inherent power at the threshold to quash the proceedings.
