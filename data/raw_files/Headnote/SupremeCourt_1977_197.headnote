 The appellant was the lessee of the premises "Jairam Theatre" in the town of Raipur and his lease expired on May 21, 1960. Since the appellant did not vacate the premises on the expiry of the lease by efflux of time u/s. 111 (a) of the Transfer of Property Act, the respondent-landlord filed a suit against the appellant on June 25, 1960 for eviction, rent and mesne profits. The trial court passed the decree for eviction on November 3, 1962. The High Court dismissed the appeal on February 26, 1964 which was affirmed by this Court on September 25, 1964. The appellant vacated the suit premises on October 4, 1964. In the proceedings for fixation of mesne profits, the trial court awarded a final decree for mesne profits at Rs. 4,000/- per month from the date of determination of the lease, i.e., from May 22,1960 to October 4, 1964. The High Court affirmed the decree. In appeal by certificate the appellant contended, (i) that according to the definition of the "tenant" in cl. ( 1 ) of s. 2 of the Madhya Pradesh Control Act, 1961, the appellant, even after the termination of the lease, continued in possession of the accommodation as a "tenant" under the Act which is conveniently called a statutory tenant. The occupation of the accommodation by the appellant became unauthorised and wrongful on and from November 3, 1962 when a decree, for eviction was passed by the Trial Court and not before that. Mesne profits could be awarded only from the said date; and (ii) that the courts below were not justified in awarding damages at Rs. 4,000/- per month when the agreed rent as per the lease was only Rs. 1600/per month.
 Dismissing the appeal, the Court, 
HELD : (1) The definition of the term "tenant" in s. 2(1) of the Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act, 1961 is retroactive in the sense that it embraces within its ambit even a person who continued in possession of the accommodation after the termination of his tenancy, whether the said termination was before or after the commencement of the Act. It would apply and was meant to cover a case where the contractual tenancy terminated before the commencement of the 1961 Act, but the suit was filed after the commencement.
 In the instant case, the suit in question was not filed under the Act of 1955 because the accommodation was exempt from the operation of that Act. The suit filed in accordance with the Transfer of Property Act continued to govern the rights and liabilities even after the coming into force of the Act. The retroactivity or retrospectivity of the definition of the term "tenant" was not sufficient to make the appellant a tenant within the meaning of the Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act, 1961. His continuance in occupation of the accommodation on and from 22nd May 1960 was unauthorised and wrongful and a decree for damages or mesne profits has rightly been awarded. [712 G-H,713 A-D] Smt.
