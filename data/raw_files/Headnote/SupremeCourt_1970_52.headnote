 The appellant and respondents 2, 3 and 4 were superintendents in the State Secretariat service, the appellant being junior to the three respondents. In 1959, the appellant was appointed as Personal Assistant to the Chairman of the Legislative Council, and shortly thereafter, the three respondents were promoted as Under Secretaries.
 In 1963, the appellant was transferred to the Secretariat as Under Secretary. In 1964, the three respondents were promoted as Deputy Secretaries.
 On the question, whether by appointment as P.A. to the Chairman of the Legislative Council the appellant was senior to the respondents, and hence, was entitled to be also appointed as Deputy Secretary, 
HELD : Under the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Council Secretariat (Regulation and Conditions of Service) Rules, 1959, a P.A. to the Chairman of the Legislative Council is equated to a P.A. to a Minister who is equated to an Under Secretary. But, in the present case, the appellant was not promoted to the post of P.A. to the Chairman. He was only selected to serve as P.A. and such selection did not confer on him any privilege beyond holding that post as long as the Chairman would have him. Under r. 24 of the Rules also, it is the substantive post that matters and,there the appellant was junior to the respondents. [879 E-F. G-H; 880 A-B]
