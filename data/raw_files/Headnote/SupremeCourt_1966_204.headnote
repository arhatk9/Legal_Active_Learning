 In an election to a seat to the U.P. Legislative Council in accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of single transferable vote, the respondent was declared elected. The appellant, who was also a candidate challenged the election by an election petition. He alleged that certain ballot papers counted in favour of the respondent were invalid, because in violation of r. 73(2) of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, they bore the Roman numeral I instead of the Arabic numeral 1. The Election Tribunal upheld the contention. The respondent appealed to the High Court and in that appeal the appellant took a preliminary objection that the appeal should be dismissed as it was not accompanied by a copy of a decree containing details of cost directed to be prepared by the Tribunal.
 The High Court dismissed the preliminary objection and allowed the appeal.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (i) The High Court rightly dismissed the preliminary objection; in an appeal to the High Court under s. 116-A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, -all that is necessary to be filed is a copy of judgment of the Tribunal and no more. [758 E] There is no provision in Part VI of the Act for the passing of a decree: by the Election Tribunal. Section 98 which refers to the decision of the Tribunal provides in specific terms that the Tribunal shall make an order at the conclusion of the trial and indicates the three types of orders that the Tribunal is entitled to make. Section 116-A provides for an appeal not from a decree of the tribunal but from an order passed by it, under s. 98. What may be prepared on the basis of an order for costs passed by a tribunal would be a memorandum of costs and not a 'decree'.
 The fact that under s. 90(1) an election has to be tried as nearly as may be in accordance with the procedure applicable under the Code of Civil Procedure to the trial of suits does not mean that a decree should be prepared by the Tribunal in the same manner as a decree is prepared by a civil court at the end of the trial of a suit. [756 B, H; 757 C] Rule 2 in Chapter XIV-A of the Rules of the Allahabad High Court with respect to appeals from orders of election tribunal is also in accordance with the scheme of the Act and does not require a copy of any decree to be filed with the appeal. [758 B] (ii)Rule 73(2) of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 does not require that the figure 1 must be marked in the Arabic form. Where figure 1 is marked on the ballot paper, whether it be in one form or other including the Roman form, that is in full compliance with the rule, and the ballot paper would not be invalid in the circumstances. [758 H; 759 G] 753 Any other word like "st" after the Roman figure I or the word "one' in brackets thereafter would not invalidate the vote for the figure "I" would show the first preference.
