 Pursuant to the scheme for construction of houses for industrial workers to be let to them at a subsidised rent framed by the Government of India in 1946, the State of Bombay passed the Bombay Housing Board Act, 1948. 'Section 66 of the Act empowered the State Government to make rules for carrying out the purposes of the said Act. Section 67 provided that the 'Housing Board, a statutory body, created under s. 3 of the Act "may from time to time with the previous sanction of the State Government, make regulations consistent with this Act and that of any rule made under this Act." Section 68 also empowered the Board to make its bye-laws. Section 73A of the Act further provided that 'the State Government may give the Board such directions as in its opinion are necessary and expedient for carrying out the purposes of the Act. It shall be the duty of the Board to comply with such directions." The Board framed u/s 67 the relevant regulations for implementing the scheme.
 Regulation 3 classified the residential tenements into (i) those exclusively reserved for industrial workers and (ii) those open to the general public for the low income groups (including industrial workers). As per Regulation 3 "tenements in class (i) shall be let at such subsidised rates as Government may by special orders fix, while tenements in class (ii) shall be let at the economic rent calculated in accordance with the formula decided by Government from time to time.". Eligibility for the unreserved tenements as per regulation 6 was limited by the maximum total income of all the earning. members of the applicant's family proposing to lodge together. Under regulation 7 "the maximum limit of family income in relation to subsidised Tents shall be Rs. 350/- per mensem and in relation to economic rent Rs. 500/- per mensem." As per regulation 19 the successful applicants were required to execute an agreement in Form 11 and also give an undertaking to pay the rent and service charges including water tax and other charges as may, from time to time, be levied and or fixed by or on behalf of the Board and also to accept its addition as final and binding.
 The appellants are industrial workers, who were allotted tenements in 1959 as per the tenancy agreements executed by them in accordance with the regulation 19 in Form II and were paying a subsidised rent of Rs. 27/plus the monthly service charges. They have also given the prescribed under- taking. As per the decision taken at the Housing Ministers" Conference in December 1964 regarding retention of house built under the subsidised industrial schemes by allottees on their crossing the wage limit of Rs. 350/per month and communicated by the Government of India through its letter No. 524/62/H-1 dt. 20th April 1966, the State Government, in its turn, wrote to the Board on 8-7-1967, to the effect that, consequent to the clarifications of the Government of India that tenements constructed under the subsidised industrial housing schemes are to be allotted to the industrial workers whose monthly income does not exceed Rs.
 350/- on payment of subsidised rent only and that those who have crossed the wage limit of Rs. 350/- per mensem subsequently are neither entitled to retain the tenements, nor to get subsidy in rent beyond three months' from the date of crossing, it has considered sympathetically the question of eviction of workers who had crossed the prescribed wage limit of Rs. 350/- per mensem and decided that such tenants who have exceeded wage limit of Rs. 350/- should be allowed to retain the tenements by charging them graded increase. Notices were, therefore, 194 issued by the Board on 10-10-1972 and 31-1-73 to appellants 2 and 1 calling: upon them to pay the enhanced rent with effect from 20th April 1966 and 1-2-1968 respectively. The appellants filed a writ petition in the High Court of Bombay challenging enhanced demand of rent from them both for the past and the future periods which was dismissed. The writ appeal failed before the Division Bench in view of the other Division Bench decision of the same High Court This Court granted special leave restricting only to the question as to whether the enhancement of rent could be made with retrospective effect.
 Dismissing the appeal, the Court, 
HELD : (1) The High Court took a wrong view that the regulations are not statutory regulations and hence have not the force as such. [199 H] Sukhdev Singh & Ors. v. Bhagat Ram Sardar Singh Raghubanshi
