 The appellant was charged with an offence under s. 302, Indian Penal Code of murdering three persons. The trial court found that there was enough evidence to show that the appellant was one of murderers of one of the three, men and sentenced him to life imprisonment. The High Court enhanced the sentence to one for death on the grounds: that, the motive was to avenge murder of the appellant's brother in- law committed some years prior to the occurrence so that there could be no immediate provocation; that, the three murders were committed in very coldblooded and brutal manner when the deceased were sleeping on their cots; that, two shots from a 12 bore gun had been fired at each of the three murdered men indicating the determination to give no chance of survival to anyone; that, the time selected for the murder was such that no possible help could be rendered to prevent the death of any of the three deceased and no obstruction could be possible to carry out the design of committing these murders.
 Allowing the appeal in part, 
HELD : A criminal case is not tied down to a particular version as a civil case is by the pleading of the parties.
 Moreover, there is so much of explicable inaccuracy often intermingled with imagination and exaggeration by witnesses who are convinced of the guilt of a particular accused person that courts dealing with criminal cases cannot throw the whole case over-board simply because parts of it are im- probable. To hold that a version is improbable is not to disbelieve entirely or to find it to be false. It may be that facts are sometimes stranger than fiction. Prudence, however compels courts to test the version advanced in the light of what is reasonably to be expected from the ordinary or usual norms of human conduct and the common course of natural events so as to infer What may have actually happened. In a criminal case conviction must rest on a proof so strong that the court must be convinced that what is concluded must necessarily have happened and is not really explicable in any other way. [492A-D] In the instant case although the appellant was guilty of an offence punishable under s. 302 Indian Penal Code, all the reasons given by the High Court for awarding the death sentence have not been substantiated.. The evidence only disclosed that it was more likely that the appellant was one of the several murderers and that he caused the death of only one man with his gun, the other having been killed by others who were not recognised, and, therefore, nothing, apart from the occurrence, proved about the character of the appellant. Nothing was disclosed about the antecedents of the appellant. Therefore, the real basis adopted by the High Court for enhancing the sentence of the appellant would disappear. [493A-C]
