 The appellant was tried in respect of the following charges: (i) causing the death of A and thereby committing an offence punishable under s. 302, Penal Code, (ii) firing a shot at B and 372 C with the intention of causing their death and thereby committing an offence punishable under s. 307, Penal Code, and (iii) firing a shot at D with the intention of killing him and thereby committing an offence punishable under s.
 307, Penal Code. It was contended on his behalf that there was a misjoinder of charges as the second charge was really a charge in respect of two offences viz., attempt to murder B and attempt to murder C and the accused had therefore been charged with, and tried for, more than three offences in contravention of s. 234 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code :.Held, that there was nothing wrong in the trial as the single act of firing a shot at B and C is one offence and not two offences and the trial was not bad for misjoinder of charges. [Their Lordships however observed that they should not be understood as laying down the wide proposition that in no case can a single act constitute more than one of- fence.] Promotha Natha Roy v. King Emperor (17 C.W.N. 479), Johan Subarna v. King Emperor (10 C.W.N. 520), Poonit Singh v. Madho Bhot (I.L.R. 13 Cal. 270) and Sudheendra Kumar Roy v. Emperor (I.L.R. 60 Cal. 643) approved.
