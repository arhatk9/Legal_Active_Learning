 Section 5 (4) of the Punjab Municipality Act, 1911 enacts:
 "when any local area has been included in a municipality under sub-section (3) of this section of this Act, and, except as the State Government may otherwise by notification direct all rules, bye-laws, orders, directions and powers made, or conferred under this Act and in force throughout the whole municipality at the time shall apply to such area." By a notification the industrial area within which the appellants' factory was situated was included within the municipality of Sonepat. Thereafter, the respondent- municipality purported to impose, levy and collect from the appellant octroi. The appellant filed a writ petition in the High Court for restraining the municipality from levying and collecting the octroi. The municipality relied upon the provisions contained in s. 5 (4) of the Act in support of the contention that the notification dated 3rd November 1942 issued under s. 62 (10) of the Act notifying the imposition of octroi within the octroi limits of the Sonepat municipal limits became applicable to the areas included. The High Court dismissed the petition. It came to the conclusion that by reason of the provisions contained in s. 5 (4) of the Act the taxes would "automatically become leviable" to new areas included in the municipal limits. Allowing the appeals, 
HELD: The High Court was wrong in holding that the municipality was competent to levy and collect octroi from the appellants by reason of the provision contained in s. 5 (4) of the Act.
 (i) Section 5 (4) of the Act speaks of rules, bye-laws, conducts, directions and powers and does not significantly, mention notification. The Act speaks of notification ceasing to apply to excluded areas, whereas, in the case of inclusion of areas the Act significantly omits any notifi- cation being applicable to such areas. The legislative intent is, therefore, unambiguous that notifications would not be applicable to an included area on the strength of s.
 5 (4). And s. 62 (10) of the Act speaks of notification for the imposition of taxes and such a notification is the statutory basis of the imposition and levy of tax. [133 H] (ii) The word 'notification' is not synonymous with rules, bye laws, orders, directions and powers. The power to issue notifications orders, rules or bye-laws refers to different and separate methods of expression of exercise of power under the statute. Bye-laws are entirely 128 different from notifications imposing tax and the bye-laws fixing the 'limits and prescribing the routes by Which articles which are subject to octroi may be imported obviously cannot be equated with notification of imposition of octroi.
