 The respondent was a lessee of 1401 bighas of land and was carrying on mining operations on the land for winning coal.
 On 9th October 1963, the appellant-Government issued a notification under s. 4(1) of the Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition and Development) Act, 1957, giving .notice of the Government's intention to prospect for coal in, 1200 bighas of the leasehold land. These 1200 bighas covered land, on which, amongst other buildings, a railway siding, boiler rooms, office rooms, fan house and air shaft premises were situate.
 On 23rd March 1964, the respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging the notification as contravening s. 4(4) of the Act and the High Court quashed the notification.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) In the premises notified, processes ancillary to the getting, dressing or preparation for sale of coal obtained as a result of the mining operations were being carried on, and therefore the impugned notification violated the second limb of s. 4(4) and was invalid. [787 D-E] (2) Though no specific case under the second part of s.
 4(4) was pleaded in the writ petition, all the facts necessary for determining the question were before the Court and the matter was fully argued in the High Court without any objection. Therefore, it could not be urged that it was open to this Court to consider that aspect of the case. [787 F. 788 A] (3) Under s. 5 of the Act the effect of the notification was to require the respondent to bring to a halt all his operations in the notified area till action was taken under s. 7 or till the period prescribed in that ,Section came to an end. Therefore, the respondent was aggrieved by the impugned notification. [787 B] (4) The delay in filing the writ petition was not sufficient to refuse relief to the respondent. [786 G] (5) If the notification was invalid, it is not for this Court to decide whether any other area of the leasehold could have been notified. [788 B]
