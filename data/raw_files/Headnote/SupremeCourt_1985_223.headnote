 The Central Government had in the year 1949 demarcated the press area along the Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, New Delhi.
 It consisted of plots Nos.. 1 to 10 known as Press Enclave as a commercial complex. These plots were alloted to various newspapers like the Indian Express, Times of India, Patriot, National Herald etc. Petitioner No.1, Express Newspapers Private Ltd., engaged in the business of printing and publishing a national newspaper, Indian Express (Delhi Edition), was alloted plot nos 9-10 Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, New Delhi by an indenture styled as an "agreement for lease executed on May 26, 1954 between the petitioner and the Secretary (Local self-government) to the Chief Commissioner of Delhi by the orders and directions of the President of India for the construction of a four storeyed building meant to be used for a newspaper.
 384 At the time of construction of buildings in the press area there were no restrictions as to the Floor Area Ratio (FAR) permissible along the Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg and the only restriction on construction of building in that area was that the allottees of the plots should construct buildings up to a height of 60 feet. The Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. was allowed to build upon the entire area of plots Nos. 9 and 10 with a ground coverage of 100%, that is, edge to edge, a structure with a minimum of five storeys including the ground floor for the purpose of installation of a printing press for publication of a Hindi newspaper.
 This permission was granted in response to the plans submitted by the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. and approved in writing by the Chief Commissioner of Delhi acting for and on behalf of the lessor, that 18, the Union of India.
 During the preliminary work of construction by the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. an underground sewer line was found to be running diagonally across plot nos. 9 and 10. It was agreed between the parties vide lease agreement dated November 19 1957 that in view of the underground drain running through the plots the Express Buildings would be constructed only to the East of the drain till the drain was diverted. In effect, an area of 2740 square yards to the West of the drain had to be left open as residual plot of the land out of a total area of 5703 square yards. The Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd.
 constructed the old Express Building to the East of the sewer line with an FAR of 260 with reference to the entire plot leased to lt i.e.. plots Nos. 9 ant 10 although the building occupied only half of the area. On March 17, 1958 another perpetual lease was executed by Assistant Secretary (LSG) to the Chief Commissioner, Delhi by the order and direction of the President of India demising on behalf of the Union of India in perpetuity the Nazul land described therein in consideration of payment of a premium and yearly rent. Likewise, the earlier agreement dated November 19, 1957 80 also the supplementary agreement of May 26, 1954 were also executed by the salt Officer in the same manner.
 Both the agreements stipulated that the rules, regulations ant laws of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi relating to buildings which may be in force from time to time shall be confirmed to by the lessee.
 On November 6, 1959 all functions relating to administration of leases of Government lands in Delhi were transferred from the Chief Commissioner of Delhi (LSG) to the Ministry of Works 6 Housing.
 In the year 1977, petitioner No.l, the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd., approached the Municipal Corporation of Delhi for 385 shifting the sewer line outside plots 08. 9 and 10 and also moved the lessor, the Union of India, Ministry of Works and housing for grant of requisite sanction to construct the new Express Building with an FAR of 40. The Chief Engineer, Delhi Water Supply ant Sewage Disposal Undertaking granted approval to the diversion of the sewer line at the cost of petitioner No-l. Thereafter, petitioner No.1, informed the Ministry of Works and Housing about the aforesaid approval granted by the Municipal l Corporation of Delhi and requested the Ministry for advice on the FAR permissible for the said building. The matter was processed in the Ministry of Works and Housing at various leveling ultimately on October 21, 1978, the Vice-Chairman , Delhi Development authority took the following decision (a) to amalgamate plots Nos.9 and 10.and taking into account the existing built-up area would permit the FAR of 360 overall; (b) to allow the residual area of plots Nos.9 and 10 to be built in line with the Times of India and Shama Building; (c) to exclude the basement from the calculation of the FAR provided the basements are for office purposes; (d) to per lt permit on the service road in the same manner as it was for the other building in this line. The Vice-Chairman further directed that the aforesaid order was to be treated as one under special appeal. He accordingly gave instruction for issuing 'No Objection' to petitioner No-l for construction on the residual area and to make a reference- to the Government of India asking for confirmation of the action proposed in view of the order of the Minister for Works and Housing to clear the cases immediately and to obtain his ex post facto sanction. On November 4, 1978 the Joint Director (Buildings) Delhi Development Authority issued a "No Objection Certificate to the petitioners and the Ministry of Works ant Housing granted it ex post facto approval on November 24, 1978. Thereafter, petitioner KNOB constructed its new Express Building.
 On February 17, 1980, respondent No.2 Jagmohan assumed office at the Lt. Governor of Delhi and on the same evening, he summoned the Commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and called for the files relating to the construction of the new Express Building at Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, New Delhi. On the next day, the necessary files were made available. On February 20, 1980, some important files of the Delhi Development Authority relating to the Express Buildings were sent to respondent No.2. On February 29, 1980, respondent No.2 through the Commissioner MUNICIPAL Corporation of Delhi caused the locks of the office and cupboards of the Zonal Engineer (Building) to be broken open to 386 take away the file relating to the new Express Building. On March 1, 1980 respondent No.2 convened a press conference in which he handed over a press release alleging (1) that the new Express Building put up by the petitioner FAS in contravention of law in several respects; (11) that he had ordered an inquiry to be made by a committee of three of his subordinate officials and (111) that the new Express Building might have to be demolished. On the same day, although the relevant files had been removed from his office, the Zonal Engineer (Buildings), City Zone, Municipal Corporation of Delhi served a notice on petitioner No.1, to show cause why action should not be taken for demolition of the Express Buildings under 88. 343 and 344 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957. On March 4, 1980, a second press release was issued from the Raj Nivas, to justify the action of respondent No.2 in initiating the inquiry. The issue of show cause notice again figured in a third press release dated March 8, 1980. The Ministry of Works and Housing also submitted the files relating to the construction of the New Express Building to respondent No.2 on March 7, 1980. On March 1, 1980 the Engineer Officer in the Land and Development Office under the Ministry of Works and Housing also issued a notice to the petitioners to show cause within 30 days as to why the property should not be re-entered under clause 5 of the perpetual lease on the grounds: (1) that the construction of the New Express Building was without permission from the lessor under the terms of lease; (ii) that the plans were not submitted for the sanction under the terms of lease by the lessor; and (iii) that the plans were in contravention of cl.2(5) and 2(14) of the lease deed. On March 12, 1980 at a specially convened Press Conference, respondent No.2 released the report of the Committee of his subordinates which substantiated the view of respondent No.2 and also found that petitioner No.1 was liable to pay Rs. 35 lacs as conversion charges.
 The petitioners challenged the validity of the aforesaid two notices before the Supreme Court under Art.32 of the Constitution on the grounds: (i) That the Lt.Governor appointed by the President under Art. 239(1) of the Constitution 18 an Administrator and he discharges such functions as are entrusted to him by the President of India and in the absence of a notification under Art. 239(1), the Lt. Governor cannot usurp the functions of the Union of India in relation to the properties of the Union: (11) that the Lieutenant-Governor 1 not a successor of the Chief Commissioner of Delhi. There was notification issued by the President under Art. 239(1) of the Constitution for 387 the conferral of any power on the Lt. Governor to administer the lease in question; (ill) that lt is inconceivable that after October 1, 1959 when the administrative control over the Land Development Officer was transferred from the Delhi Administration to the Ministry of Works Housing and by virtue of a notification issued under Art. 299(1) the Secretary, Ministry of Works Housing was made the competent authority tc act for the President with regard to any contract, grant or as assurance or property of the Union, the Lt.Governor could still arrogate to himself the powers of the Union of India, Ministry of Works Housing in relation to the lease; (lv) that respondent No.2, Jagmohan, is actuated with personal bias against the Indian Express which had published an article in the Indian Express in April 1977 with regard to his role during the period of Emergency in Turkman Gate demolitions. The proposed action of re-entry by the lessor i.e. the Union of India Ministry of works & Housing at the instance of the Lt. Governor of Delhi is an act of political vendetta. The impugned notices have been issued with an evil eye and an unequal hand and with a deliberate design to compel the petitioners to close down the Express Group of Newspapers in general and the Indian Express in particular. The said notice are ex-facie illegal and without prediction and are contrary to facts and legal provision . The arbitrary and discriminatory initiation of executive action under the guise of alleged infraction of the terms of the lease auditor the Master Plan of Delhi and or the Municipal building bye-law is violative of the petitioners' fundamental rights under Arts.14,19(1) (a) and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution; (v) that the impugned notice issued by the Zonal Engineer (Building) City Zone, Municipal Corporation of Delhi Dated March 1,1980 was illegal and void as he did not apply his mind at all to the question at issue but merely issued the same at the instance of respondent No.2. The construction of the said building was not without or contrary to the sanction referred to in s.336 or in contravention of any of the provisions of the Act or bye- laws mate thereunder; (vi) that the erection of the double basement or a working platform in a printing press like the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. is a compoundable deviation from the sanctioned plan and the insistence of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to demolish the same suffers from the vice of hostile discrimination. (vii) that the construction of the new express Building its an increased FAR of 360 was in conformity with clause 2(5) of the perpetual lease dated March 17,1958 inasmuch as it was with the express sanction of the lessor i.e. the Union of India. In terms of the Government of India (Allocation of Business Rule, 1961 as well 388 as under a notification issued under Art.299(1), the Ministry of Works & Housing with the Minister at the head was and is the ultimate authority responsible to deal with the property of the Union and to enter into all contractual obligations relating thereto. The Minister had not only full authority, power and jurisdiction to grant permission to the petitioners to construct the new Express building with an increased FAR of 360 with a double basement for the installation of the printing press, but the action taken by the then Government was in good faith after taking into consideration all the circumstances attendant at all levels. (viii) that there could be no objection to the construction of the new Express Building with an increased FAR of 360 as it allowed the residual area of plots Nos. 9 and 10 to be built in line with other building along the Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg.
 Further, the Master Plan for Delhi subsequently approved by the Central Government in the year 1962 does not mention the pre area on the Bahadur Shah Zafar are comprising of the press enclave. although specified as a commercial area, it is not listed in the list of already built-up commercial areas because it is relates to the walled city of old Delhi.
 The Zonal development plan for D-II area within which the pre- plots are located also permitted an FAR of 400 for the press area in the Bahadur Shah Zafar marg. Therefore , all that the then Minister for Works & Housing did was to restore to the petitioners the right that they acquired under the perpetual lease dated March 17, 1958 i.e. to be treated alike alongwith other plot-holders in that area and a denial of such equal terms would be opposed to the principles of equality besides being violative of Art.14 of the Constitution. (ix) That the Express Building at 9-10 Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg forms the nerve-centre of the Express Group of Newspapers as the editorials and the leading articles of the Indian press are sent out and the editorial policy laid down from Delhi office to ten centres all over India. In this factual background, the impugned notices have a direct impact on the freedom of the press and being in excess of governmental authority and colourable exercise of statutory powers, are liable to be struck down is offending Art.l9(1)(a) red with Art.14 of the Constitution. (X) that the lessor i.e. the Union of India is estoppel by the doctrine of promissory estoppel and cannot therefore go back upon all assurances given and actions taken by the previous government, particularly when the petitioners had acted upon the decisions so reached and had constructed the new Express Building with a cost of approximately Rs. 1.30 crores by February 1980 which at present would cost more than Rs 3 crores.
 389 It was contended on behalf of respondent No.1, the Union of India; (1) that the right to occupy the land leased for the construction of a building for installation of a printing press is not within Art. 19(1)(a) nor within Art.
 19(1)(g) but such a right is derived from a grant or contract; (2) That the right arising out of a statute or out of a contract cannot be a fundamental right itself. Once a contract is entered into or a grant is mate, the rights and obligations of the parties are not government by Part III of the Constitution but by the term of the document embodying the contract or the grant, and any complaint about its breach cannot be a matter for grant of a writ, direction or order under Art. 226 of the Constitution, such less and.
 Art.32, ant since the petitioners are seeking to enforce a contractual right, lt cannot be decided on a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution. (3) That the content of Art.
 19(1)(g) of the constitution would not include the right which 1 guarantee by other clauses of Art.19 (4). That the argument of the petitioners that the building in question is necessary for running the press and any statutory or executive action to pull it down or forfeit the lease would directly impinge on the right of freedom of speech ant expression under Art. 19(1)(g) 18 wholly misconceived inasmuch as every activity that may be necessary for exercise of freedom of speech and expression or that may facilitate such exercise or make lt meaningful ant effective cannot be elevated to the status of a fundamental right. (5) That the right to the land and the right to construct buildings thereon for running a printing press are not derived from Art. 19(1) (a) but spring from the terms of the grant of such lands by the Government under the provisions of the Government grants Act, 1895 and regulated by other laws governing the subject viz. the Delhi Development Act, 1957 the Master Plan ant the Zonal Development Plan framed thereunder, the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 and the Delhi Municipal Corporation (Building) Bye-laws, 1959 which regulate construction of buildings in the Union Territory of Delhi irrespective of the purpose for which the building 18 constructed. (6) That the right to run a press may be a fundamental right guaranteed under . Art. 19(1)(a) or Art. 19(1)(g) but the right to use a particular building for running a press is altogether another thing inasmuch as no particular building is equally fit for the running of the press and the person desiring to run a press or already running the press is at liberty to acquire another suitable building for that purpose. Further, even if the buildings in question were necessary for the enjoyment of the rights under Art-19(1)(a) or Art. 19(1)(R) 'a right to use a particular building does not 390 become an integral part of the right to freedom of speech and expression' or the 'right to carry on any trade of business in printing and publishing a newspaper' and clearly therefore the petitions under Art. 32 are not maintainable.
 (7) That even on a question of fact, the direct impact of the impugned notices will not be on the double basement wherein printing press is installed but will be wholly or in part on the two upper storeys which are not intended to be used in relation to the press or for publication of the intended Hindi newspaper but only for the purpose of letting out the same for profit; the only other possible effect any be the removal of the upper basement which the petitioners call a working platform which has been constructed in violation of the building regulations. (8) That there was no imminent danger of demolition of the Express Building nor was the impugned notice dated March 10, 1980 issued by the Engineer Officer, Land & Development Office, a notice of re- entry upon forfeiture of lease. It was merely a notice of an exploratory nature requiring the petitioners to show cause why the lease should not be forfeited under cl.5 of the lease-deed for alleged breaches of cls.- 2(5) and 2(14) thereof. The Petitioners should have therefore entered appearance before the Land & development Officer and showed cause against the action proposed. It was only if the Land & Development Officer was not satisfied with their explanation, that he would put up the papers before the Lt.
 Governor for necessary action. It would then be for the lessor i.e. the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing to decide whether or not the lease should be forfeited under cl.5 of the lease-deed. (9) That the impugned notice by the Engineer Officer purporting to act on behalf of the lessor i.e. the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing was not based either on the report of the Three-Member Committee obtained by the Lt.Governor or on the basis of any communication from him, (10) That the Lt.Governor had no powers in relation to the properties of the Union and, therefore, the Union of India 1 not bound by the acts of the Lt. Governor. The Lt. Governor had no power in relation to the lease and, therefore, he could not usurp to himself the powers and functions of the Union of India in relation to the lease deed. However the Lt.Governor as the Administrator had to keep himself informed and cannot be said to have acted malafide merely because of any possible personal malus animus on his part, if the quality of the action was itself in complete accord with the law. (11) That the Government itself was in possession of relevant records and applied its mind to them and the impugned notice issued by the Engineer Officer who was empowered to act on behalf of the President under Act.299(1) of the Constitution 391 having been authenticated in the manner required by Art.77(3), it must be deemed to be the decision of the President on the advice of the Council of Ministers as enjoined by Art.74(2) and the Court was precluded from making any investigation into the circumstances thereto.
 (12) That it was the respondent No.2 to meet the charges of malafides levelled against him.
 On behalf of respondent No.2, the Lt.Governor of Delhi, it was argued: (1) That the Administrator appointed by the President under Art.239(1), as amended by the Seventh Amendment, could be called by any designation, that the Chief Commissioner of Delhi continued to be the Administrator of the Union Territory of Delhi under Art.239(1) after November 1, 1956 when the Government of Part States Act, 1951 was replaced by 8.130 of the States Reorganisation Act, 1956 and that he functioned as such till September 6, 1966 since the Delhi Administration Act, 1966 continued to use the nomenclature of Administrator appointed by the President under Art.239(1). It was for the first time on September 7, 966 that the Administrator of the Union Territory of Delhi who used to be designated as the Chief Commissioner was re-designated as the Lt.Governor. (2) that the Lt.Governor was successor of the Chief Commissioner and, therefore, all the powers exercisable by the Chief Commissioner in relation to the lease vested in him. (3) That the Lt. Governor was the alter ego of the President in relation to such territory which he is called upon to administer on behalf of the President. One of the primary functions of the Lt. Governor, as the Administrator, was to be aware of facts brought to his knowledge and therefore respondent No.2 could not have turned a blind eye to the action of Sikander Bakht, the then Minister for Works Housing in making a highly fraudulent, illegal and improper grant of sanction to petitioner No.1, the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. to build the new Express Building with an increased FAR of 360. (4) That the Lt. Governor as the appointed agent or nominee of the President was entitled to act on behalf of the lessor i.e. the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing in relation to the lease and therefore, he was well within his rights (a) in calling for and making perusal of the respective files from the Ministry of Works & Housing Delhi Development Authority and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi pertaining to the construction of the Express Building with an increased FAR of 360; (b) in constituting a Three-Member Committee to inquire into the circumstances 392 relating to the grant of sanction by the then Minister of Work & Housing and to take necessary steps as regards the unauthorised construction of the new Express Building; and (c) in forwarding the report of the Three-Member Committee to the concerned authority, meaning the Minister for Works & Housing for taking necessary steps. (5) that the transfer of administrative control of the L & O on October 1, 1958 to the Ministry of Works & Housing did not divest the Chief Commissioner of his contractual powers given under the lease and he alone represented the lessor i.e. the Union of India and not the Ministry of Works & Housing (6) That being the Lt. Governor of Delhi, he was responsible for the administration of the Union Territory of Delhi and, as such, he was acting within his power to direct all the authorities concerned to prevent violation of laws by any person or institution. He further asserted that he, as the Lt.
 Governor of Delhi, was fully competent to appoint the Inquiry Committee under the Commissioner of Inquiry Act, 1952. (7) that the Union of India or the Lt. Governor of Delhi never intended to inflict a reprisal on the petitioners for the independent stand of the newspapers they publish. (8) that the respondents had no personal animosity towards the Express Group of Newspapers and the criminal complaint for defamation was instituted by respondent No.2 because the Indian Express was guilty of fabricating and publishing false, motivated, scandalous stories about respondent No.2 and others. (9) That he had not ordered the issuance of the notice in question and that the Land & Development Officer was an authority independent of the administrative control and supervision of the Lt. Governor.
 As regards the impugned show cause notice issued by the Zonal- Engineer (Building) City Zone, Municipal Corporation of Delhi, lt was asserted that the same had been issued by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi in exercise of its statutory powers under 88. 343 and 344 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act after verification of the allegations. (10) That the perpetual lease-deed dated March 18, 1958 governs the relationship effectively between the Union of India and the Lt. Governor on the one hand and the petitioners on the other i.e... the contractual relations between the parties. (11) That the sewer, according to the terms of the lease-deed, could not be diverted without the consent of the Chief Commissioner and the approval of the Ministry of Works & Housing was a nullity being without jurisdiction and legal competence. (12) that for the commercial user of the residual area to be kept as 'green' it is only the Chief Commissioner (Lt. Governor) who could give 393 sanction to construct for the commercial user at the residual area; the petitioners were liable to pay commercial realization changes; and (13) that lt is for the Chief Commissioner (Lt. Governor) to decide if the breaches were remediable or as to the nature of the remedies required for the breach. Since the breaches are not remediable breaches, the impugned notice dated March 10, 1980 issued by the Engineer Officer, L & O for re-entry upon the land on forfeiture of the lease for breach of the conditions was valid and proper.
 Counsel for respondent No.4, Municipal Corporation of Delhi, urged (1) that the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. have no right to construct the upper basement particularly when the Corporation refused to accord sanction to it and that, in any event, it was not such an unavoidable necessity as to break the Law; and (2) that even if some receiving floor may perhaps be necessary to receive the printed newspapers from the machine, it would be achieved by locating the machines on a suitable pedestal or by laying the floor of the basement in such a manner as to discharge the newspaper on the ground floor; and (3) that under the Master Plan and the Building Bye-laws, not more than one basement is permissible and that any basement more than one will have to be reckoned for the purpose of FAR.
 Counsel for respondent No.5 Land & Development Officer contended (1) that under the terms of the lease deed of 1958, previous consent of either the President of India or the Chief Commissioner (Lt. Governor) or such officer or body as the lessor (President of India) or the Chief Commissioner of Delhi authorised was necessary for building activity on the residual area of the plots (2740 sq. yards).
 The Ministry of Works & Housing did not represent the lessor or the Chief Commissioner and (2) that the Land 6 Development Officer is not a functionary under the Ministry of Works & Housing. He is the officer appointed on behalf of the lessor to administer the lease. At no stage the petitioners approached the office of Land & Development for permission to construct on the residual area of 2740 sq.yards to the west of the pipe-line and no approval was obtained from the office of L & O for construction of a building in contravention of clauses 2(5), (9) and (14) of the lease. The so-called permissions and approvals obtained by the petitioner- have no legal competence or authority under the terms of the lease-deed 394 which governed the relationship between the petitioners and respondent no.1.
 Allowing the writ petitions, ^ 
 HELD : By the Court (Per A.P. Sen, E.S. Vankataramiah & R.B. Misra, J.) (1) The writ petitions under Art.32 of the Constitution must succeed and are allowed with costs. The notice issued by the Engineer Officer, Land & Development Office dated March 10, 1980 purporting to act on behalf of the Government of India, Ministry of Works & Housing requiring the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. to show cause why the lessor i.e. the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing should not re- enter upon and take possession of plots nos. 9 and 10, Bahadurshah Zafar Marg, New Delhi together with the Express Buildings built thereon, under cl.5 of the indenture of lease dated Mar h 17, 1958 for alleged breaches of cls.2(5) and 2(14) thereof, and the earlier notice dated March 1, 1980 issued by the Zonal Engineer (Building), City Zone, Municipal Corporation, Delhi requiring them to show cause why the aforesaid buildings should not be demolished under 88.343 and 344 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957, are quashed. It is declared that the construction of the new Express Building on the residual portion of 2740 square yards on the western side of plots no 8. 9 and 10, Bahadurshah Zafar Marg with an increased FAR of 360 with a double basement for installation of a printing press for publication of a Hindi daily newspaper was with toe permission of the lessor i.e.. the Union of India Ministry of Works & Housing and did not constitute a breach of clauses 2(5) and 2(14) of the lease-deed. 554 E-; 555 Al (2) The Lt. Governor failed to make a distinction in this case between the power with respect to the subject 'Property of the Union and the revenue therefrom' which is in Entry 32 of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and the general powers of administration entrusted to him under Article 239 of the Constitution as the administrator of the Union Territory of Delhi. The property in question 18 a part of the estate of the Central Government. Mere nearness to the seat of the Central 395 Government does not clothe the Lt. Governor of Delhi with any power in respect of the property of the Central Government. He can discharge only those powers which are entrusted to him by the Constitution ant the Laws. It is also not correct to claim that all the powers of the former Chief Commissioner of Delhi have devolved on the Lt.Governor and continue to vest in him. [556 B-D] Per A.P.Sen, J.
 1(i) Freedom of the press is comprehended within the right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Art.19(1)(a). The freedom of thought and expression, and the freedom of the press are not only valuable freedoms in themselves but are basic to a democratic from of Government which proceeds on the theory that problems of the Government can be solved by the free exchange of thought and by public discussion of the various issues facing the nation. It is necessary to emphasize and one must not forget that the vital importance of freedom of speech and expression involves the freedom to dissent to a free democracy Like ours. Democracy relies on the freedom of the press. It is the inalienable right of everyone to comment freely upon any matter of public importance. This right is on of the pillars of individual Liberty-freedom of speech, which Supreme Court has always unfailingly guarded. Howsoever precious and cherished the freedom of speech is under Art.19(1)(a), this freedom is not absolute and unlimited at all times and under all circumstances but is subject to the restrictions contained in Art.19(2). That must be 80 because unrestricted freedom of the press and is wholly free from restraints, amounts to uncontrolled licence which would lead to disorder and anarchy and lt would be hazardous to ignore the vital importance of our social and national interest in public order and security of the State. 474 C-D; 475 D-G 1(ii) The extent of permissible limitations on this freedom are indicated by the fundamental law of the land itself viz. Art.19(2) of the Constitution. But, permissible restrictions on any fundamental right guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution have to be imposed by a duly enacted law and must not be excessive i.e. they must not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the object of the law under which they are sought to be imposed. The power to imposed restrictions on fundamental 396 right is essentially a power to 'regulate' the exercise of these rights. In fact, 'regulation' and not extinction of that which 18 to be regulated 18, generally speaking, the extent to which permissible restrictions any go LPN order to satisfy the test of reasonableness. The t. t laid down by the Supreme Court 18 whether the direct and immediate impact of the impugned action 18 on the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Art.l9(1)(a) which includes the freedom of the press.
 In the instant case, the very threat 18 to the existence of a free and independent press. The impugned notices of re-entry upon forfeiture of lease ant of the threatened demolition of the Express Buildings are intended and meant to silence the voice of the Indian Express. It must logically follow that the impugned notices constitute a direct ant immediate threat to the freedom of the press ant are thus violative of Art.l9(1)(a) read with Art.14 of the Constitution. It must accordingly be held that these petitions under Art.32 of the Constitution are maintainable.

Section 3 declare that all provisions, any such grant or transfer as aforesaid shall be valid NT shall take effect according to their tenor, notwithstanding any rule of law, statute or enactment of the Legislature to the contrary. A series of judicial decisions pave determined the overriding effect of s.3 making lt amply clear that a grant of property by the Government partakes of the nature of law since lt overrides even legal provisions which are contrary to the tenor of the document. [478 D-E] (4)(ii) There can be no doubt whatever on a true construction of the impugned notice dated March 10, 1980 that the Engineer Officer, Land & Development Office purporting to act on behalf of the lessor i.e.. the Union of India, Ministry of Works Housing served a notice of re-entry upon forfeiture of lease under cl.5 of the lease-deed. There was no question of the said motley being construed to be of an exploratory nature. Since respondent No.2 is not the successor of the Chief Commissioner of Delhi nor has any function in relation to the lease, there is no warrant for the suggestion that prior approval of the Lt. Governor is a condition precedent to the right of the lessor i.e. the Union of India to exercise its right of re-entry upon forfeiture of lease under cl.5 of the lease-deed. [480 B-D] 4.(iii) The Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. having acted upon the grant of permission by the lessor i.e. the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing to construct the new Express Building with an increased FAR of 360 together with a double basement was clearly not an unauthorized occupant within the meaning of s.2(g) of the Act. The Express Buildings constricted by Express- Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. with the sanction of the lessor i.e. the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing on plots No-. 9 ant 10 Bahadurshah Zafar Marg demised on perpetual lease by registered lease-deed dated March 17, 1958 can, by no process of reasoning, be regarded as public premises belonging to the Central Government ouster s.2(g). That being so, there is no question of the lessor applying for eviction of the Express- Newspapers Pvt.
 398 Ltd. under 6.5(1) of the Public Premises (Eviction of unauthorized Occupants) Act, 1971 nor has the Estate Officer any authority or jurisdiction to direct their eviction under sub-s.(2) thereof by summary process. Due process of law in a case like the present necessarily implies the filing of suit by the lessor i.e. the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing for the enforcement of the alleged right of re-entry if any, upon forfeiture of lease due to breach of the terms of the lease. However, the Government has the power to take recourse to the provisions of the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorized Occupants) Act, 1971 where admittedly there is Unauthorized construction by a lessee or by any other person on Government land which is public premises within the meaning of s.2(e) and such person is in unauthorized occupation thereof.

 5(i) Under the Constitution of India, Delhi became a Part 'C' State w.e.f. January 26, 1960 and it was provided by Art. 239(1) that a State specified in Part 'C' of the First Schedule shall be administered by the President acting to such extent as he thinks fit through a Chief Commissioner or Lt. Governor to be appointed by him. [491 E-F] Art. 239(1) of the Constitution differed from the provision contained in s.94(3) of the Government of India Act. 1935 to the extent that the appointment of a Chief Commissioner or Lt. Governor as an Administrator irrespective of the designation and entrustment of powers, functions and duties to him by the President, were not to be in his discretion but had to be exercised on the advice of the Council of Ministers. Except for this, 8.94(3) of the Government of India Act, 1935 and Art.239(1) of the Constitution as enacted were identical in respect of the provisions for the administration of Delhi as a Chief 399 Commissioner's province under the 1935 Act and as a Part 'C' State under the Constitution, by the Governor-General under 28.94(3) and under Art. 239(1) by the President acting to such extent as he thought fit, `through the Chief Commissioner or the Lt. Governor as an Administrator irrespective of the designation 491 H; 492 A-B] 5(ii) Art. 239(1) of the Constitution was amended by the Constitution (7th Amendment) Act, 1956 w.e.f. November 1, 1956 and for the words 'through a Chief Commissioner or a Lt. Governor to be appointed by him' in Art.239(1) as originally enacted, the words substituted are 'through a-n administrator appointed by him with such designation as he may specify'. Therefore, the Administrator appointed by the President under Art. 239(1) whether with the designation of the Chief Commissioner or of the Lt. Governor could exercise only such powers, functions and duties as were entrusted to him by the President i.e. there have to be specific entrustment of powers by the President under Art.239(1).
 From November l, 1956 Part 'C' States ceased to exist by virtue of the Seventh Amendment and in their place Union Territories were substituted in the First Schedule to the Constitution, including the Union Territory of Delhi i.e.
 the territories which immediately before the commencement of the Constitution were comprised in the Chief Commissioner's province of Delhi. [493 A-B; D-E; 493 F-G] 5(iii) On October 1, 1959 decision was taken by the Government of India to transfer. the administrative control of the office Of Land & Development Officer, New Delhi from the Delhi Administration to Ministry of Works, Housing & Supply w.e.f. October l, 1959. This decision was duly communicated to the Chief Commissioner of Delhi and to the Land & Development Officer, New Delhi. The President of India on February 1, 1966 issued an order under Art.299(1) of the Constitution which inter alia directed that in the case of Land L Development Office (1) all contracts and assurances of property relating to batter falling within the jurisdiction of Land L Development Officer, (2) all contracts, deeds and other instruments relating to ant for the purpose of enforcement of the terms and conditions of the sale/lease-deed of the government property in Delhi/New Delhi, etc. made in exercise of the executive power of the Union may be executed on his behalf by the Land & Development Officer. Therefore, neither the Chief 400 Commissioner nor the Lt. Governor hat anything to do with the Office of the Land & Development or the administration of nazul lands in the Union Territory of Delhi after October 1, 1959. They have not been conferred any authority by the President under Art. 299(1) to enter into any contracts mate in the exercise of the executive power of the Union or to act 'on behalf of' the President in relation to such contract or assurance of property i.e. to act on behalf of the President for the enforcement of the terms ant conditions thereof. There is also no notification under Art.
 239(1) by the President vesting Chief Commissioner or the Lt. Governor with any power, functions and duty in relation to the property of the Union Territory of Delhi. [495 C-D;
 F-G; E; 497 A-B] 5(iv) It would therefore, appear that the territory of Delhi as a Part 'C' State under the First Schedule to the Constitution was a separate and distinct constitutional entity as from that of a Chief Commissioner Province under the Government of India Act, 1935, and this is equally true of the Union Territory of Delhi. It must logically follow that with the transformation of the territory of Delhi from a Chief Commissioner's Province under s.94(3) of the Government of India Act, 1935 into that of a Part 'C' State under the Constitution and after the seventh Amendment into the Union Territory Delhi, the office of the Chief Commissioner of Delhi disappeared and that of an Administrator appointed by the President under Art.239(1) with such designation as he may specify, came into existence. The necessary concomitant is that the Administrator of the Union Territory of Delhi derived only such powers, functions ant duties as were entrusted to him by the President under Art.239(1). [501 C-E] 5-(v) There was no Order in Council issued by the Governor General under 8.94(3) of the Government of India Act, 1935 nor any Order issued by the President under Art.
 239(1) of the Constitution investing the Chief Commissioner of Delhi to deal with the property of the Union. The matters relating to the property of the Union of India are included in the seductive power of the Union under Art.53 of the Constitution read with Art.298 which expressly provides that the seductive power of the Union shall extent to the acquisition, holding ant disposal of 401 property and the making of contracts for any purpose. Such executive power of the Union is vested in the President under Art.53(1) and shall be exercised by him either directly or through officers subordinate to him in accordance with the Constitution. All executive actions of the Government of India shall be expressly taken in the name of the President under Art.77(1). Under cl.(2) thereof, orders and other instruments made and executed in the name of the President shall be authenticated as may be specified in rules to be made by the President i.e. in the manner specified under the Authentication (Orders and other Instruments) Rules, 1958 framed under Art. 72(2). In terms of the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961, all matters relating to the property of the Union, allotment of Government lands in Delhi, administration of Government estates under the control of the Ministry of Works & Housing and the administration of the Land & Development office, are matters exclusively vested in the Ministry of Works & Housing vide Entries 1,6 and 23(1) in the Second Schedule under the head `Ministry of Works & Housing'. In the light of the said directive, as further confirmed by the constitutionally enacted regulations, the power over the allotment of nazul lands, administration of leases in Delhi and the control and administration of Land & Development office in particular and the property of the Union in general are subjects vested solely under the control of the Ministry of Works & Housing. In the premises, by such transfer of authority, the Chief Commissioner of Delhi and necessarily his successor, the Lt. Governor, became bereft of his powers to control and administer the lease and any attempt by respondent No.2 to set up a claim that the Lt. Governor is the authority empowered to administer the lease is wholly frivolous and untenable and must be rejected. [502 F; 503 A-C; E-G] Mohd. Maqbool Damnoo v.

 6(i)The impugned notices dated March 1, 1980 and March 10, 1980 were not issued bona fide in the ordinary course of official business for implementation of the law or for securing justice but were actuated with an ulterior and extraneous purpose ant thus were wholly mala fide and politically motivated. [519 C] 6(ii)Fraud on power voids the order if it is not exercised bona fide for the end design. There is a distinction 402 between exercise of power in good faith and misuse in bad faith. The former arises when an authority misuses its power in breach of law, say, by taking into account bona fide, and with best of intentions, some extraneous matters or by ignoring relevant matters. That would render the impugned act or order ultra vires. It would be a case of fraud on powers. The misuse in bad faith arises when the power is exercised for an improper motive, say, to satisfy a private or personal grudge or for wreaking vengeance of a Minister.
 A power is exercised maliciously if its repository is motivated by personal animosity towards those who are directly affected by its exercise. Use of a power for an `alien' purpose other than the one for which the power is conferred is mala fide use of that power. Some is the position when an order is made for a purpose other than that which finds place in the order. The ulterior or alien purpose clearly speaks of the misuse of the power. [507 F-H] 6(iii) It is not for the parties to say what is relevant or not. The matter is one for the Court to decide.
 Mala fides on the part of the Government in power or its functionaries would be sufficient to invalidate the impugned notices. [505 F] 6(iv) The petitioners have alleged several facts imputing improper motives which have not been specifically denied and there is only a bare denial with the assertion that the facts are not relevant. Mere denial of allegations does not debar the courts from inquiring into the allegations. It is quite evident that no action was contemplated against the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. by any of the respondents prior to February 17, 1980. Respondent No.2 upon assumption of his office as the Lt. Governor of Delhi on that day immediately set on a course of action against the Indian Express which culminated in the issue of the impugned notices. It cannot be doubted that is initiative to call for the files from the Municipal Corporation relating to the construction of the new Express Building was an action of his own not provoked by anyone, much less at the instance of respondent No.1, the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing. The sequence of events set in motion immediately after his assumption of office as the Lt. Governor demonstrate the extent to which and the keenness with which he pursued the matter. It would appear that the entire administrative machinery was geared into action by respondent no.2 and he `activated' the taking of steps culminating in the issue of the impugned notices. [509 A-B; 515 A-B] 403 6(v) The dominant purpose which actuated respondent no.2 in initiating governmental action was not so much for implementation of the provisions of the Master Plan or the Zonal Development Plans framed under the Delhi Development Act or the observance of the relevant Municipal Bye-laws under the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, but to use these provisions for an `alien' purpose and in bad faith i.e. for demolition of the Express Buildings with mark of retribution or political vendetta for the role of Indian Express during the period of Emergency and thereafter and thereby to bring about closure of the Indian Express. [512 D-E] 6(vi) It was Somewhat strange that the Land & Development Officer who was a minor functionary of the Ministry of Works & Housing should have filed a counter supporting the action of respondent no.2. There is no doubt that the Land & Development Officer deliberately made an inaccurate statement that he is not under the administrative control of the Ministry. [518 B] 6(vii) The contention that there was imminent danger of demolition of the Express. Building nor was the impugned notice by the Engineer Officer a notice of re-entry upon forfeiture of lease, is against the very terms of the impugned notice. There is a categoric averment that the grant of sanction by the then Minister for Works & Housing was illegal, improper and irregular. It is therefore futile to contend that the impugned notice dated March 10, 1980 was not a notice of re-entry upon forfeiture of lease but merely a notice of an exploratory nature requiring Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. to show cause why the lease should not be forfeiture under cl.5 of the lease-deed. [518 C-E] C.S. Rowjee & Ors. v. A.P. State Road Transport Corporation [1964] 4 S.C.R. 330 relied upon.

 7(i) The construction of the new Express Building with an increased FAR of 360 for starting a Hindi Newspaper and the installation of the printing press in double basement was allowed by the Delhi Development Authority, in accordance with the provisions of the Master Plan. [520 H] 7(ii) The Press Enclave on Bahadurshah Zafar Marg otherwise known as the Mathura Road Commercial Complex is not a `development area' within the meaning of s.2(3) of the Delhi Development Act, 1957. The Master Plan does not prescribe any FAR for the press enclave situate on Mathura Road commercial area nor does such area fall within the `already built-up commercial are `as defined in the Master Plan i.e. commercial area falling within the walled city of Old Delhi. Apparently, the contention that the FAR of no commercial area in Delhi can exceed 400 is wholly misconceived inasmuch as the Master Plan in express terms permits FAR of the commercial areas in Minto Road and Ranjit Singh Road at 400. The Zonal Development Plan for the D-II area approved by the Central Government in November 1966 mentions four commercial areas, namely (1) Asaf Ali Road commercial area (2) Minto Road commercial area (3) Mathura Road commercial area, and (4) Circular Road commercial area (opposite Ramlila Ground). Although in the Zonal Development Plan for D-II area, Asaf Ali Road commercial area is described as fully developed with no room for expansion, the FAR of which is admittedly 400, there could be still a further increase in FAR subject to payment of premium. This could only be under the provisions of the Zonal Development Plan for D-II area and therefore it must logically follow that the FAR prescribed in the Zonal Development Plan for Mathura Road commercial area where the press enclave is situate is 400. The press area is not far from Asaf Ali Road commercial area. It not only falls in the same D-II area but is treated as part of a complex of four commercial areas in the Zonal Development Plan for D-II area. This press area is not even described as fully commercialized. If FAR 400 is prescribed and allowed for asaf Ali Road commercial area which is fully developed, it could not possibly be impermissible for the press area which although fully commercialized was still not fully developed. [520 D; 524 C- E; 526 D-G] 7(iii) The floor area ratio or FAR is the restriction on the number of floors in a building with reference to the plot area. Where FAR is not specified in the Master Plan which 405 admittedly is the case in regard to press area on Bahadurshah Zafar Marg, the only bye-law applicable would be bye-laws 21 and 22. Bye-law 21(1) restricts the height of a building to 70 feet. This height is to be measured from the centre of the adjacent portion of the `nearest street'.
 Admittedly as is clear from the sanction plan, the height of the new Express Building is about 47 feet. The adjacent portion which is the service road is on level with the plinth of the additional construction. Taking Mathura Road as the 'nearest street' the level of Mathura Road stretches from 2 ft. to 5 ft. higher than the plinth level of the additional construction. In any view of the matter, the additional construction could therefore be permissible if it did not exceed a height of 63 feet. This is because of bye- law 21(1) and also because of FAR with which is linked the ground floor coverage is not specified in the Master Plan.
 In order to avoid congestion the maximum height is further restricted under bye-law 22 in proportion to the width of the abutting street. In the instant case, Mathura Road which is the abutting street measure in width 150 feet. This is apart from the immediately abutting service road which, even if reckoned as an abutting street, is 63 feet in width.
 Therefore, applying bye-law 22(4) read with bye-law 21(1), it is the service road of the street that governs the height of the buildings in the press area as well as the number of floors, the minimum floor height being already specified in bye-law 19. The restriction on the height of buildings is therefore governed by the width of the street subject to the maximum height of 70 feet and this is the measure adopted where FAR for a particular area is not specified in the Master Plan. [529 C, E-F; 530 A-C; F-H; 531 A] 7(iv) Bye-law 25(2)(IV-B) only applies to "already built up commercial areas as indicated in the Master Plan such other areas as may be declared as commercial areas by the appropriate authority from time to time. The list of already build-up commercial area as defined in the Master Plan admittedly does not include the press area on the Mathura Road. At the time of construction of buildings in the press area, there were also no restrictions as to the FAR along the Mathura Road and the only restriction on construction of such buildings was that the allottees of the plots in the press area should construct buildings upto a height of 60 ft. [533 E-F] 7(v) It must therefore be held that the permission granted by Sikander Bakht, the then Minister for Works & Housing for the construction of the w Express Building with an increased FAR of 360 with a double basement for Installation of the printing press was not in violation of the Master Plan for Delhi or the Zonal Development Plan for D-II area or the Delhi Municipal Corporation 406 (Buildings) Bye-laws, 1959 inasmuch as ex facie by-law 26 read with 25(2)(IV-B) was not applicable to the press area on the Mathura Road. Admittedly, the Master Plan does not prescribe any FAR for the Press enclave. The Zonal Development Plan for the first time prescribed FAR for the four commercial areas for general business and commercial areas. All these commercial areas fall within D-II area for which the Zonal Development Plan prescribes an FAR of 400.
 [535 E-F] 8(i) The non-obstante clause in section 53(A)(l) of the Delhi Development Act clearly gives an overriding effect to the sanction granted by the Delhi Development Authority for the construction of the new Express Building with an increased FAR of 360 and a double basement for Installation of printing press or the working platform. The effect of grant of such permission by the Authority was to modify the sanctioned plans of the Municipal Corporation to that .
 tent. That apart the term development as defined in section 2(t) of the Act includes . the carrying out of buildings........ in, on, over or under land in any building etc. and is wide enough to include the structures. in question. As the Authority approved each of these structures for which the impugned show cause notice under ss. 343 and 344 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 had been Issued by the Zonal Engineer (Buildings), City Zone, Municipal Corporation, it is clear that he had acted beyond his authority and power. [537 A-C] 8(ii) There is no dispute that all the structures are below the ground. The main purpose of the upper basement i.e. a working platform measuring 6000 sq.ft. was meant to work the printing press. If the upper basement or the working platform constructed by the Express Newspapers Pvt.
 Ltd. is demolished, the Installation of the printing press itself in the lower basement with the sanction of the Delhi Development Authority under the appropriate statutory provision would be nullified and the Express Newspapers Pvt.
 Ltd. would not be in a position to operate the printing press at all. Without the water storage tank the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. would not get the completion certificate and it is difficult to understand how the underground tunnel passage, to connect the old and new Express Building would cause traffic hazard. At any rate, such minor deviation would not result in a demolition of the Express Building. The manner in which the impugned notice was got issued by the Municipal Corporation at the direction of respondent no.2 shows that it was done with an ulterior purpose. The illegality of the action is writ large and the manner in which it was done creates a ground for belief that the action was motivated. [538 C-E] 407 8(iii) It 18 evident from page 16 of the Printed Master Plan and the Zonal Development Plan for D-II area at pages 935 and 936 that semi-basement, meaning a second basement is permissible under the Master-Plan as well as the Zonal Development Plan. The Bye-laws of the Delhi Municipal Corporation do not prohibit second basement and on the contrary bye-law 54 use the term `basements'. Moreover, double basements have, in fact, been permitted in the case of many hotels by the Delhi Development Authority. [543 B-D] 8(iv) It is difficult to conceive how the huge printing press with a height of 24 ft. could be placed on a pedestal or be laid on the floor of the basement in such a manner as to discharge the newspapers on the ground floor. It is common ground that there is a working platform in all the other printing presses in the same line of buildings like that of the Times of India, the National Herald, Patriot and the old Indian Express Building . In all these buildings, the printing presses are Installed in the lower basement and there is an over-hanging platform in the printing press in each of the buildings to receive the printed material.
 Therefore, there is no Justification of the working platform. If the Municipal Bye-laws do not permit the construction of a double basement then they would be clearly violative of Art.14, 19(1)(a) and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. [543 F-H; 544 A] 9(i) The basic principle of estoppel is that a person who by some statement or representation of fact causes another to act to his detriment in reliance on the truth of it is not allowed to deny it later, even though it is wrong.
 Justice here prevails over truth. Estoppel is often described as a rule of evidence, but more correctly it is a principle of law. As a principle of common law it applies only to representation about past or present facts. But there is also an equitable principle of `promissory estoppel' which can apply to public authorities. [545 E-F] 9(ii) In public law, the most obvious limitation on the doctrine of estoppel is that lt cannot be evoked 80 as to give an overriding u power which lt does not in law possess.
 In other words, no sextuple can legitimate action which 18 ultra vires. Another limitation is that the principle of estoppel does not operate at the level of Government policy.
 Estoppels have however been allowed to operate against public authority in minor matters of formality where no question of ultra vires arises. [548 A-C] In the instant case, the then Minister for Works & Housing acted within the scope of his authority in granting permission of 408 the lessor i.e. the Union of India, Ministry of Works & Housing to the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. to construct new Express Building with an increased FAR of 360 with a double basement for inst installation of a printing press for publication of a Hindi newspaper under the Rules of Business framed by the President under Art.77(3). Therefore, the doctrine of ultra vires does not come into operation. In view of this, respondent no.1 the Union of India is precluded by the doctrine of promissory estoppel from questioning the authority of the Minister in granting such permission. In that view, the successor Government was clearly bound by the decision taken by the Minister particularly when it had been acted upon- [548 D-Fl Robertson v. Minister of Pensions L.R. [1949] I K.B.

 (10) The Express Newspapers Pvt.

 1(i) The material available is sufficient to hold that the impugned notices suffer from arbitrariness and non- application of mind. They are violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. Hence they are liable to be quashed. It is not necessary therefore to express any opinion on the contentions based on Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.
 [556 F] 409 1(ii) The said notices were issued by the authorities concerned under the Pressure of the second respondent. The question whether the notices should be issued or not does not appear to have been considered independently by the concerned administrative authorities before issuing them.
 [555 F] 1(iii) The Lt. Governor failed to make a distinction between the power with respect to the subject 'Property of the Union and the revenue therefrom' which is in Entry 32 of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and the general powers of administration entrusted to him under Article 239 of the Constitution as the Administrator of the Union Territory of Delhi. The property in question is a part of the estate of the Central Government. Mere nearness to the seat of the Central Government does not clothe the Lt.
 Governor of Delhi with any power` in respect of the property of the Central Government. He can discharge only those powers which are entrusted to him by the Constitution and the laws. Moreover, all the powers of the former Chief Commissioner of Delhi have not devolved on the Lt. Governor and continue to vest in him. [556 B-D] 2(i) The question arising out of the lease, such as, whether there has been breach of the covenants under the lease, whether the lease can be forfeited, whether relief against forfeiture can be granted etc. are foreign to the scope of Article 32 of the Constitution. They cannot be decided just on affidavits. These are matters which should be tried in a regular civil proceeding. One should remember that the property belongs to the Union of India and the rights in its cannot be bartered away in accordance with the sweet will of an officer or a Minister or a Lt. Governor but they should be dealt with in accordance with law. At the same time a person who has acquired rights in such property cannot also be deprived of them except in accordance with law. The stakes in this case are very high for both the parties and neither of them can take law into his own hands.
 [1556 H; 557 A-B] 2(ii) No opinion is expressed on the rights of the parties under the lease and all other questions argued in this case.
