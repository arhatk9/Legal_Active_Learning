 By a notification issued under s. 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, the State Government declared that the appellant's lands were needed for the public purpose of construction of an Industrial Estate by the Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation. The officer on special duty informed the,appellant that if he had any objection to the acquisition he might file objections on or before a particular date and, that he or his counsel would be heard at the time of filing the objections. The appellant filed his objections and prayed that the officers of the Corporation may be summoned for the purpose of cross- examination to show that the proposed acquisition was not for a public purpose and that there was no need to acquire his land, and that a personal hearing may be granted to him.
 The hearing was fixed for a particular date and the date was extended from time to time but the appellant did not appear on those dates nor did he apply for any, further extension of time. His written objection were considered by the officer and included in his report to the Government under s. 5A.
 On the question whether the report was vitiated because the officer had not granted an opportunity to the appellant to cross-examine the officers of the Corporation, 
HELD:The question whether the inquiry was administrative or quasi-judicial did not arise. Rules had been framed under s. 55 of the Act for the guidance of officers dealing with objections under s. 5A, and the rules had been complied with in the present case. The appellant was given an opportunity to be heard personally but he did not choose to avail himself of that opportunity. He could not, under the rules, claim to cross-examine officers of the Corporation when they had not given any evidence before the officer on special duty and there was no principle which entitled the, appellant to claim such right.
