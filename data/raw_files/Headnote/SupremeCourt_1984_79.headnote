 The petitioner, who was facing a Sessions trial for offences under section 302 read with sections 120B, 386 and 511 of the Indian Penal Code, was allowed to be enlarged on bail by the High Court. But before the petitioner was released, the District Magistrate passed an order on August 16, 1983 under section 12 (2) of the Bihar Control of Crimes Act 1981 for detention of the petitioner, in order to prevent him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. The grounds of detention supplied to the petitioner related to the incidents which took place in 1975 and 1982 and also the incident which gave rise to the above-mentioned trial. The petitioner challenged the order of detention before the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution. The High Court dismissed the petition on a technical ground. Hence this petition under Article 32 of the Constitution. The petitioner contended:
 (1) that the impugned order of detention was void under Article 22 (5) of the Constitution as one of the grounds was too remote and not proximate in point of time and had therefore no rational connection for the subjective satisfaction of the District Magistrate under section 12 (2) of the Act, and (2) that the impugned order of detention was male fide and consti- 436 tuted a flagrant abuse of power on the part of the District Magistrate as it was meant to subvert judicial process by trying to circumvent the order passed by the High Court enlarging the petitioner on bail.

 HELD: (Per Venkataramiah and Chinnappa Reddy, JJ.) The law of preventive detention is a hard law and therefore it should be strictly construed. Care should be taken that the liberty of a person is not jeopardised unless his case falls squarely within the four corners of the relevant law. The law of preventive detention should not be used merely to clip the wings of an accused who is involved in a criminal prosecution. It is not intended for the purpose of keeping a man under detention when under ordinary criminal law it may not be possible to resist the issue of orders of bail, unless the material available is such as would satisfy the requirements of the legal provisions authorising such detention. When a person is enlarged on bail by a competent criminal court, great caution should be exercised in scrutinising the validity of an order of preventive detention which is based on the very same charge which is to be tried by the criminal court. [459C-D] Section 12 of the Bihar Control of Crimes Act, 1981 makes provision for the detention of an anti-social element.
 The detaining authority should, therefore, be satisfied that the person against whom an order is made under section 12 of the Act is an anti-social element as defined in section 2 (d) of the Act. The two sub-clauses of section 2 (d) which are relevant for the purposes of this case are sub-clause (i) and sub-clause (iv). Under sub-clause (i) a person who either by himself or as a member of or leader of a gang habitually commits or attempts to commit or abets the commission of offences punishable under Chapter XVI dealing with offences affecting the human body or Chapter XVII dealing with offences against property, of the Indian Penal Code is considered to be an antisocial element. Under sub- clause (iv) a person who has been habitually passing indecent remarks to, or teasing women or girls, is an anti- social element. In both these sub-clauses, the word 'habitually' is used. The expression 'habitually' means 'repeatedly' or 'persistently'. It implies a thread of continuity stringing together similar repetitive acts.
 Repeated, persistent and similar, but not isolated, individual and dissimilar acts are necessary to justify an inference of habit. It connotes frequent commission of acts or omissions of the same kind referred to in each of the said subclauses or an aggregate of similar acts or omissions. Whereas under sub-clause (iii) or sub-clause (v) of section 2 (d) a single act or omission referred to in them may be enough to treat the person concerned as an 'anti-social element', in the case of sub-clause (i), sub- clause (ii) or sub-clause (iv), there should be a repetition of acts or omissions of the same kind referred to in sub- clause (i), sub-clause (ii) or in sub-clause (iv) by the person concerned to treat him as an anti-social element'.
 This appears to be clear from the use of the word 'habitually' separately in sub-clause (i), sub-clause (ii) and sub-clause (iv) of section 2 (d) and not in sub-clauses (iii) and (v) of section 2 (d). If the acts or omissions in question are not of the same kind or even if they are of the same kind when 437 they are committed with a long interval of time between them they cannot be treated as habitual ones. [457B-458C] In the present case the District Magistrate has relied on three incidents to hold that the petitioner is an anti- social element. They are-(o) that on April 15, 1975 the petitioner alongwith his associates had gone to the shop of a cloth dealer of Bhagalpur Town armed with an unlicensed pistol and had forcibly demanded subscription at the point of gun and (ii) that on June 17/18, 1982 the petitioner was found teasing and misbehaving with females returning from a cinema hall. The third ground is the criminal case now pending against the petitioner in the Sessions Court. The first incident is of the year 1975. It is not stated how the criminal case filed on the basis of that charge ended. The next incident relates to the year 1982. The detaining authority does not state how the criminal case filed in that connection terminated. If they have both ended in favour of the petitioner finding him clearly not guilty, they cannot certainly constitute acts or omissions habitually committed by the petitioner Moreover, the said two incidents are of different kinds altogether. Whereas the first one may fall under sub-clause (i) of section 2 (d) of the Act, the second one falls under sub-clause (iv) thereof. They are, even if true, not repetitions of acts or omissions of the same kind.
 The third ground which is based on the pending Sessions case is no doubt of the nature of acts or omissions referred to in sub-clause (i) of section 2 (d). but the interval between the first ground which falls under this sub-clause and this one is nearly eight years and cannot, therefore, make the petitioner a habitual offender of the type falling under sub-clause (i) of section 2 (d). Therefore, it is not possible to hold that the petitioner can be called an 'anti- social element' as defined by section 2 (d) of the Act. The order of detention impugned in this case therefore, could not have been passed under section 12 (2) of the Act which authorises the detention of anti-social elements only.
 [458D-459D] (Per Chinnappa Reddy J. concurring) I do not agree with the view of my brother Sen J. that 'those who are responsible for the national security or for the maintenance of public order must be the sole judges of what the national security or public order requires.' It is too perilous a proposition. Our Constitution does not give a carta blanche to any organ of the State to be the sole arbiter in such matters. Preventive detention is considered so raeacherous and such an anathema to civilized thought and democratic polity that safeguards against dndue exercise of the power to detain without trial, have been built into the Constitution itself and incorporated as Fundamental Rights.
 There are two sentinels, one at either end. The Legislature is required to make the law circumscribing the limits within which persons may be preventively detained and providing for the safeguards prescribed by the Constitution and the courts are required to examine, when demanded; whether there has been any excessive detention, that is, whether the limits set by the Constitution and the legislature have been transgressed. Preventive detention is not beyond judicial scrutiny. While adequacy or sufficiency may not be a ground of challenge, relevancy and proximity are 438 tertainly grounds of challenge. Nor is it for the court to put itself in the position of the detaining authority and to satisfy itself that the untested facts reveal a path of crime. [440E-441B] I am of the view that the decision in Kamalkar Prasad Chaturvedi's case and the host of earlier cases are not distinguishable. This Court has always taken the view that remoteness in point of time makes a ground of detention irrelevant. [441D] Shibban Lal Saksena v. State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors., [1953] INSC 78; [1954] SCR 418 and Kamlakar Prasad Chaturvedi v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr., [1983]4 SCC 433 referred to (Per Sen J. dissenting) On the facts set out in the grounds of detention the petitioner answers the description of an anti-social element as defined in s. 2 (d) of the Act. [444F] The word 'habitually' connotes some degree of frequency and continuity. 'Habitually' requires a continuance and permanence of some tendency, something that was developed into a propensity, that is, present from day-to-day. A person is a habitual criminal who by force of habit or inward disposition, inherent or latent in him, has grown accustomed to lead a life of crime. It is the force of habit inherent or latent in an individual with a criminal instinct, with a criminal disposition of mind, that makes him dangerous to the society in general. In simple language the word 'habitually' means 'by force of habit'. [444G-445E] Stroud's Judicial Dictionary' 4th end., vol. 2, p. 1204 and Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, vol. 1. p. 910, referred to.
 It is not necessary that because of the word 'habitually' in sub-cl. (i), sub-cl. (ii) or sub-cl. (iv), there should be a repetition of same class of acts or omissions referred to in sub-cl. (i), sub-cl. (ii) or in sub-cl. (iv) by the person concerned before he can be treated to be an anti-social element and detained by the District Magistrate under s. 12 (2) of the Act. It is not required that the nature or character of the anti-social acts should be the same or similar. There may be commission or attempt to commit or abetment of diverse nature of facts constituting offences under Chapter XVI or Chapter XVII of the Indian Penal Code. What has to be 'repetitive' are the anti-social acts. [447B-C] The operation of s. 12 (2) of the Act cannot be confined against habitual criminals who have a certain number of prior convictions for offences of the 'character' specified. The definition of 'anti-social element' in s. 2 (d) of the Act nowhere requires that there should be a number of prior convictions of a person in respect of offences of a particular type.
 439 It is not correct to say that merely because there was an acquittal of a person, the detaining authority cannot take the act complained of leading to his trial into consideration. It may be that the trial of a dangerous person may end in an acquittal for paucity of evidence due to unwillingness of witnesses to come forward and depose against him out of fright. If a person with criminal tendencies consistently or persistently or repeatedly commits or attempts to commit or abets the commission of offences under Chapter XVI dealing with offences affecting human body or Chapter XVI dealing with offences against property of the Indian Penal Code, there is no reason why he should not be considered to be an 'antisocial element'.
 [446G-H] Those who are responsible for the national security or for the maintenance of public order must be the sole judges of what the national security or public order requires.
 Sufficiency of the grounds is not for the court but for the detaining authority for the formation of his subjective satisfaction that the detention of a person is necessary with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. The sufficiency of the grounds upon which the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority is based, provided they have a rational probative value and are not extraneous to the scope or purpose of the legislative provision, cannot be challenged in the court accept on the ground of mala fides. It is not for the court to examine whether the grounds upon which the detention order is based are good or bad nor can it attempt to assess in what manner and to what extent each of the grounds operated on the mind of the appropriate authority and contributed to the creation of the satisfaction on the basis of which the detention order was based. [447D-449E] Keshov Talpade v. The King-Emperor, [1943] FCR 88, referred to Shibban Lal Saksena v. State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors., [1954] SCR 318 and Kamlakar Prasad Chaturvedi v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr., [1983] INSC 150; [1983] 4 SCC 443, distinguished The past conduct or the antecedent history of a person can properly be taken into account in making order of detention. It is usually from prior events showing tendencies or inclinations of a man that an inference can be drawn whether he is likely, in the future, to act in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.
 [451B] Merely because there is pending prosecution and the accused is in jail, that is no impediment for his detention, if the detaining authority is satisfied that his being enlarged on bail would be prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.
