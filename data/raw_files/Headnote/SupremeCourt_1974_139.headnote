 In April,1959, the testator's wife died leaving behind four daughters and a son. Two of the daughters were married to persons in affluent circumstances. The son was not living with his father at the time of his death and the other two daughters were living with the brother. The relations between father on the one hand, and the son (the first appellant) and the two daughters on the other, were strained and bitter, and in fact,there was positive hostility between them. The testator even apprehended danger to his life and he filed criminal complaints against the son. In September, 1960, the testator advertised for a wife in a newspaper and the mother of the first respondent replied to it, on behalf of the 1st respondent, and asked for particulars. But even before the testator and the 1st respondent met, the testator entered into an agreement with the 1st appellant, in October, 1960, and in that agreement, he made provision for the maintenance and marriage of one daughter and also provided for the maintenance and residence of the other daughter though no mention was made about her marriage.
 There was also no provision for the maintenance of the mother of the testator who was then living with him. After some correspondence between the testator and the relations of the first respondent the parties met and the testator and the first respondent were married on February 7, 1961. On the very next day, the testator executed a will. by which he bequeathed his entire property to his wife, the 1st respondent. The will was-attested by the brother of the 1st respondent and a friend. The testator did not make any provision for the maintenance of his mother and the marriage of his youngest daughter. The testator lived for three years thereafter and died in January, 1964. The 1st respondent filed an application for probate of the will and the 1st appellant contested the application. The trial court granted probate to the 1st respondent and the judgment was confirmed in appeal by the High Court.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The will was genuine and all the formalities that were required were fully satisfied as it was executed by the testator in a sound disposing state of mind and was duly attested as required by law.
 (1) The propounder of a will has to show that the will was signed by the testator, that he was at the relevant time in a sound disposing state of mind, that he understood the nature and effect of the dispositions, that he put his signature to the testament of his free will and that he had signed it in the presence of two witnesses who attested it in his presence and in the presence of each other. once these elements are established the onus resting on the propounder is discharged. If the caveator alleges undue influence, fraud and coercion the onus is on him to prove the same. If the caveator does not discharge this burden probate of the will must necessarily be granted if it is established that the testator had full testamentary capacity and had, in fact, executed it validly with a free will and mind. A man may act foolishly and even heartlessly but if he acts with full comprehension of what he is doing the Court will not interfere with the exercise of his volition.
 There may however be cases in which the execution of the will is surrounded by suspicious circumstances such as where the signature is doubtful, the testator is of feeble mind or is overawed by powerful minds interested in getting his property or where, in the light of the relevant circumstances, the dispositions appear to be unnatural, improbable t and unfair; or; where there are other reasons for doubting that the dispositions in the will were not the result of the testator's free will and mind. In all such cases the suspicious circumstances must be reviewed and satisfactorily explained by the propounder before the will is accepted as genuine. Again, in cases where the pro- pounder has himself taken a prominent part in the execution of the will which 688 confers on him a substantial benefit, that is itself a suspicious circumstance which he must remove by clear and satisfactory evidence.[692 C-E; 093 A-C] H.

 (2) In the present case, the 1st respondent was merely present at the time of the execution of the will and did not have anything to do with its execution. In order to understand what the testator intended and why he intended so, one has to sit in his arm chair to ascertain his frame of mind and the circumstances in which he de the will.
 After the testator's marriage with the 1st respondent and before the 1st appellant and his two unmarried daughters came to know about the will they had definitely behaved shabbily and in a very hostile manner to the testator. The testator was completely ignored at the time of the marriage of one of the daughters and the son and daughters never came to see him even when he was dying. The 1st appellant did not take his son to see the grandfather even though the 1st appellant admitted that his father was anxious to see his grandson. With a family so hostile towards the 1st respondent, it is but natural for the testator to provide for his newly wed wife even without her asking him or importuning him to do so. The 1st respondent was herself a doctor of 13 years standing and there is no evidence that she was a gold digger. The correspondence shows that the only consideration that prevailed between the parties was companionship. There was no suggestion that the testator was feeble minded or so completely deprived of his power of independent thought and judgment as to faithfully carry out the wishes of the 1st respondent to whom he became engaged and got married. On the contrary, it appears that it was he who offered the inducement voluntarily to her.
 (3) The reason why he did not provide for the marriage of the youngest daughter might be that he did not think that he would die so soon. He must have thought that he would be able to perform the marriage himself, or he never doubted that the 1st respondent would not discharge that obligation.
 The reason for not providing for his mother might have been that he must have thought that he would survive her.
 (4) If an objective and rational deduction of a principle emerges from a decision of a foreign country rendered on legislative provisions in pari materia with those of this country and which is applicable to the conditions prevailing in this country, such a decision will assist the court in arriving at a proper conclusion. But it is dangerous to apply blindly statements of law enunciated and propounded for meeting the conditions existing in countries in which they are applicable, without a critical examination of the principles and their applicability to the conditions, social norms, and attitudes existing in this country, and without considering the background and various other considerations.
 Apart from general considerations emerging from the nature of a will and the circumstances which not infrequently surround its execution there are other matters which are peculiar to the times, the society and the person making the will and his or her family. Inferences arising from relationships between a testator and a legatee are so dependent upon the peculiarities of the society or community to which they belong, their habits and customs, their values, their mores, their ways of thinking and feeling, and their susceptibilities to particular kinds of pressures, influences or inducements, that it is difficult to reduce them to a general rule applicable at all times and everywhere so as to raise a presumption of undue influence from a particular type of relationships. In this country, even to-day a marriage is an arranged affair and even in the instant case when an advertisement was resorted to by the testator it was the first respondent's mother who replied.
 Therefore whatever may be the position in England as to the presumption of undue influence in the case of parties engaged to be married (such a presumption is referred to in Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol. 17, p. 681, Art. 31 1) it would be hardly applicable to conditions in this country.
 [697 D; 698 A-C, G; 699 H-700 B] (5) Unlike the position in England at the time when the courts recognised the presumption between a man and a woman engaged to be married the law of evidence is codified in this country in the Indian Evidence Act. Every presumption, barring 689 some special ones created by other enactments, has to be related to a provision of the Evidence Act. The only kinds of relationship giving rise to such presumptions are those contemplated in s. 1 1 1 of the Evidence Act. Any other presumption from a relationship must, to be acceptable, be capable of being raised under s. 114 of that Act. Such presumptions are really optional inferences from proof of a frequently recurring set of facts which make a particular inference from such facts reasonable and natural. The instant case does not fall within s. 111. The plea of undue influence is a special plea, and under s. 103 of the Evidence Act, the burden of substantiating such a plea is on the party who sets it up. [700 B-E] (6) There is no proof that the will was executed before marriage. Even if the date had been altered from 7th Feb.
 to 8th Feb. it was altered by the testator and he must have done so because he made a mistake. People often put a wrong date and immediately correct it. Further the evidence of the two attestors which has been accepted by both the courts, shows that the execution and attestation of the will was on the same day, namely 8th February. [700 F-G] (7) Even if it was executed on 7th February there was nothing to show that it was executed before the marriage on that day. It is unlikely that the first respondent would make a stipulation that the property should be bequeathed to her, as she must have known that a will is ambulatory and a marriage with such a condition would only beget dissension between the parties.
