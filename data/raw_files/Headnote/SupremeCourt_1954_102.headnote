 The word 'discovers' in s. 15 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, is not limited to facts discovered, which existed during the relevant chargeable accounting period for which assessment is reopened under the section but also includes facts so discovered which came into existence subsequent to such accounting period.
 Allowance was granted to an assessee by the Central Board of Revenue under s. 26(3) of the Act for the chargeable accounting period during the war on the ground that certain buildings, plant and machinery provided for production of war materials will not be required for the purposes of assessee's business after the termination of the war. But it was discovered that even after the termination of war the buildings, plant and machinery in question were actually used by the assessee for his business.
 Held, that the Excess Profits Tax Officer had ample power to proceed against the assessee to reassess him under s. 15 of the Act.
