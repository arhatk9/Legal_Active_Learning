 The dispute between the respondent company and its workmen was voluntarily referred to arbitration by their agreement dated December 3, 1959, under s. 10A of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. Section 10A(2) prescribed the form of agreement which required that the parties should state that they had agreed to refer the subsisting industrial dispute to the arbitration of the persons to be named in the form.
 Section 18(2) provided that the arbitration award shall be binding on the parties to the agreement. The arbitrator named by the parties entered. upon the reference on December 14, 1959, and pronounced his award on April 8, 1960. The appellants seeking to challenge the validity of the award applied for and obtained special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the arbitrator. The respondent pleaded that the appeal was not competent because the arbitrator was not a tribunal under Art. 136 of the Constitution of India.
 Held, that the decision of an arbitrator to whom industrial disputes are voluntarily referred under s. 10A of the Indus- trial Disputes Act, 1947, is quasi-judicial in character and amounts to a determination or order under Art. 136(1) of the Constitution of India, but the arbitrator is not a tribunal within the meaning of that Article because the State has not invested him with its inherent judicial power and the power of adjudication which he exercises is derived by him from the agreement of the parties. Consequently, an appeal against the decision of an arbitrator under s. 10A of the Act does not lie under Art. 136 of the Constitution.

 Semble, Art. 226 of the Constitution of India under which a writ of certiorari can be issued in an appropriate case is wider than Art. 136 because the power conferred on the High Court to issue, certain writs is not conditioned or limited by the requirement that the said writs can be issued only against the orders of courts or tribunals.
