 The first respondent filed a suit against the appellant company and one R for recovery of a sum of money. The court acting under O.XXIX r. 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure directed J one of the directors of the company to appear before it and answer certain material questions in relation to the suit and when he did not appear the appellant was directed to produce him, with the same result. The Court after giving notice to the appellant struck off its defence in purported exercise of its inherent powers under s. 151 of the Code. The High Court dismissed the appellant's revision petition whereupon it appealed to this Court by special leave. It was contended on behalf of the appellant that inherent power could not be invoked in the circumstances of the case.
 
HELD : (i) Whatever limitations are imposed by construction on the provisions of s. 151 of the Code, they do not control the undoubted power of the court conferred under s. 151 of the Code to make a suitable order to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court. [860] Padam Sen v. State of Uttar Pradesh, [1960] INSC 162; [1961] 1 S.C.R. 884, Manohar Lal Chopra v. Rai Bahadur Rao Raja Seth Hiralal, [1962] Supp. 1 S.C.R. 450 and Arjun Singh v. Mohindra Kumar, [1963] INSC 251; [1964] 5 S.C.R. 946, applied.
 (ii)There is nothing in O.XXIX of the Code which expressly or by necessary implication, precludes the exercise of the inherent power of the Court under s. 151 of the Code. In a case of default made by a director who failed to appear in court when he was so required under the aforesaid rule, the court can make a suitable consequential order under s. 151 of the Code as may be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court. [861 E] (iii)'Any director' in O.XXIX r. 3 need not be the same director who has signed and verified a pleading or on whom summons had been served. He can be any one of the directors who will be in a position to answer material questions relating to the suit. [861 A-B] (iv)In the present case the court was justified in striking off the defence of the appellant company. Unless there was a finding of collusion between the appellant and the director in that the former prevented the latter from appearing in court it was difficult to make the company constructively liable for the default of one of its directors. A director's acts outside the scope of his powers could not bind the company and it was not possible to hold that the director in refusing to respond to the notice given by the court wag acting within the scope of the powers conferred on him.
