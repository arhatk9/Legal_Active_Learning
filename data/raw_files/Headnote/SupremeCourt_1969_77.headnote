 After the death of the appellant's husband who was an attorney-at law, the first respondent filed a suit on the original side of the Calcutta High Court against the appellant and her minor son, for a decree for Rs. 15,000 and interest claiming that the amount was deposited with the appellant's husband for the purpose of investing it and that the appellant's husband agreed to pay interest at certain rates. The appellant filed a written statement denying the claim in its entirety. The first respondent produced extracts of bank accounts to show that the money had passed but there was no documentary evidence supporting the case relating to the agreement between him and the appellant's husband. To prove his case and the terms of the deposit which according to him were orally agreed upon, the first respondent examined himself and three other witnesses. The appellant appeared by counsel and the cross-examination on behalf of the appellant was elaborate and showed that the claim was contested fully and that the defence was not confined to the extent of the appellant's liability. The trial Judge gave a personal decree against the appellant but did not frame any issues or record any reasons in support of his conclusion. In appeal under the Letters Patent, though several grounds on the merits were raised in the memorandum of appeal the appellate Bench also did not give any reasons but merely modified the decree by limiting it to the estate inherited by the appellant.
 In appeal to this Court, HELD : Under O. X-LIX, r. 3 (5), Civil Procedure Code, rr.
 1 to 8 of O. XX do not apply to a Chartered High Court in the exercise of its ordinary or extraordinary original jurisdiction, and hence, a Judge of a Chartered High Court is not obliged to record a judgment giving reasons in accordance with the provisions of O. XX, rr. 4(2) and 5. But the High Court must exercise judicial discretion in exercising that power, because, the recording of reasons is intended to ensure that the decision was not the result of a whim or fancy but of a judicial approach, that the adjudication was according to law and procedure established by law, and that when the judgment is subject to appeal, the Appellate Court may have adequate material on which it may determine whether the facts were properly ascertained and the law has been correctly applied resulting in a just decision. The privilege of not recording 'reasons is intended to apply where the action is undefended, where the parties are not at issue on any substantial matter in a summary trial where leave to defend is not granted, in making interlocutory Orders or in disposing of formal proceedings. [979 F-H; 980 F-H] In the present case, since there was a contest on merits, in the absence of any documentary evidence in the hand-writing of the appellants husband, the burden of proving his claim lay on the first Respondent, and the oral testimony adduced by him had to be examined in the context 977 of : (a) absence of Correspondence relating to the transactions between the first respondent and the appellant's husband; (b) absence of books of account in support of the transaction; (c) improbability of such a transaction between an attorney and his client; (d) absence of previous business or professional relationship between the first respondent and appellant's husband; (e) absence of vouchers supporting the alleged payment of interest, and similar weighty circumstances. In reaching his conclusion, the trial Judge had to consider the probabilities and circumstances of the case and hence, there should have been a full record of the reasons for his conclusion.[980 A-E;
