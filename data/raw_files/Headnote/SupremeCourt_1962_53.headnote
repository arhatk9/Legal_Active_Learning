 Banwari armed with a gun and Ram Charan armed with an axe were going together when they met Lakhan. After some talk Banwari shot at and killed Lakhan. They then proceeded together for some distance when they met Bhagwan. After some talk Banwari shot at and killed Bhagwan. Thereupon the villagers started pursuing them and they ran and Banwari shot and injured Narayan. One report was lodged of the three incidents and the police sent up three charge sheets.
 The Magistrate made three orders of commitment framing charges against the two appellants under s. 302 and s.307 read with s. 34 Indian Penal Code respectively in respect of the first incident, under s. 302 read with s. 34 in respect of the second incident and under s. 307 read with s. 34 in respect of the third incident. The Sessions judge framed certain charges describing them as amended charges, under s.
 302 read with s. 34 against both accused for the murder of Lakhan, under s. 302 against Banwari for the murder of Bhagwan and under s. 307, against Banwari for the attempted murder of Narayan. He recorded the entire evidence in one trial and by a common judgment convicted Banwari and Ram Charan and sentenced the former to death and the latter to imprisonment for life. The appellants contended that the trials were illegal as the procedure followed by the Sessions judge was not warranted by law, that Ram Charan's conviction for the murder of Bhagwan and attempted murder of Narayan was bad as he was not tried for those offenses and that the conviction of Ram Charan with the aid of s. 34 was bad as he had no common intention with Banwari to commit any of the offenses.
 Held, that though the procedure of recording evidence in one trial with respect to offenses which were the subject of different trials was unwarranted the trials were not vitiated 181 on this account. The procedural error 'Was curable under ss. 537 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
 The three offenses with which the appellants were charged were of the same kind and one joint trial of those offenses was justifiable under s. 234 Code of Criminal Procedure. A joint trial of both the appellants for the three offenses each of which was alleged to be committed by them jointly within twelve months would have been justifiable under ss.
 231 and 239 of the Code. Even if there were three committal orders the Sessions judge could try the accused at one trial if the provisions of ss. 234 to 239 permitted a joint trial.
 In the present case the Sessions judge did not purport to consolidate the committal orders and try the accused at one trial though really that is what actually happened when he recorded evidence in one case only and presumably examined the accused also once. The trial was not vitiated by any procedural error nor had any prejudice been shown to have been caused to the appellants.
 Payare Lal v. The State of Punjab, (1962) 3 S.C.R. 328, referred to.
 Ram Charan had been charged for all the offenses for which be was convicted. The so-called amended charges framed by the Sessions judge were really additional charges and not in substitution of the charges framed by the Magistrate. The Sessions judge had no power to drop any charges under which the accused had been committed for trial ; he could frame a charge, or add to or otherwise alter the charge as the case may be where a person was committed for try without a charge or with an imperfect or erroneous charge. But the conviction of Ram Charan could not be sustained. He did nothing in any of the three incidents. The facts and circumstances of the case did not establish that he had a common intention with Banwarl to commit any of the offenses.
 There was no allegation that he had enmity with any of the victims or that there was any preconcert between him and Banwari From the fact that he was in the company of Banwari all along no inference of common intention could be drawn.
 The question of his dissociating from Banwari did not arise when he had not associated himself in the first instance with him.
