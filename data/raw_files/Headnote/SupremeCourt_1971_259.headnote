 In income-tax proceedings to the taxable income shown by the respondent in its return two items among others were added on the basis that there were illicit sales of alcohol and that certain sales bad not been properly accounted 'for.
 Thereafter, the Income-tax Officer, Special Investigation Circle, issued notice that he proposed to levy a penalty under s. 28(1) (r) of the Income-tax Act, 1922, as the respondent had concealed particulars of its income and deliberately furnished inaccurate particulars. He rejected the explanation of the assessee and levied a penalty. In the order levying penalty the Income-tax Officer stated that the reasons for adding the disputed amounts in the total income of the assessee had been already discussed in the original order of assessment and that there was no need to repeat them. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner in appeal confirmed the penalty. His approach to the case was not different and was based upon a guess that because there were many contiguous dry areas the respondent would have surreptitiously sold alcohol. The Appellate Tribunal considered the circumstances under which the additions came to be made by the Department in the assessment proceedings, and the various points which were pressed before it and the Appellate Assistant Commissioner on behalf of the assessee, and held that though there might be certain doubtful transactions it could not be stated that assessee had made any deliberate attempt at concealment regarding its pharmaceutical section, and that, though there might be justification for making additions in the original assessment order those additions by themselves could not lead to the conclusion that the respondent had concealed its income or that it had furnished deliberately inaccurate particulars. On the basis of those findings the Appellate Tribunal set aside the order levying penalty. Thereafter, the Appellate Tribunal, holding that the reasons given by it for setting aside the penalty proceedings were all based on findings of fact and that no question of law arose out of those findings, rejected an application by the appellant for referring the question as to whether the Appellate Tribunal was right in cancelling the penalty. The appellant then filed an application under s. 66(2) of the Act but the High Court dismissed it on the same ground.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : The penalty proceedings being penal in character the Department must establish that the receipt of the amount in dispute constitutes income of the assessee. Apart from the falsity of any explanation given by the assessee the Department must have before it, be-fore levying a penalty, cogent material or evidence from which it could he inferred that the assessee had consciously concealed the particulars of his income or had deliberately furnished inaccurate particulars. The original assessment proceeding for computing the tax is evidence in the penalty proceeding, but the penalty cannot be levied solely on the basis-'of the reasons given in the original assessment order. [853 B-D] 847 In the present case, except the reasons given in the original assessment order for including the disputed items in the total income, the Department had no other material or evidence from which it could be reasonably inferred that the assessee had consciously concealed particulars of his income or had deliberately furnished inaccurate particulars. The Appellate Tribunal made a correct and judicial approach in considering the question whether the penalty provisions were attracted as against the respondent. The conclusions drawn by the Appellate Tribunal were findings of fact recorded against the Department. Since on those findings of fact no question of law arose the High Court was justified in rejecting the application filed by the appellant under s.
 66(2) of the Act. [852 B-E 853 E-F] Commissioner of Income-tax West Bengal-1 v. Anwar Ali, [1970] 76 I.T.R. 696, followed.
