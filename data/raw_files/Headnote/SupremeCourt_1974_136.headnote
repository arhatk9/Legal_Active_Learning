 In the General Election to a State Assembly held from a constituency where the voting strength of Muslims was preponderant, the appellant was declared elected. The first respondent, who was a sitting minister before his defeat, challenged the election on various grounds of corrupt practices. The High Court set aside the appellant's election holding that he committed corrupt practices under s. 123(1) to (4) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. The High Court found (i) that the appellant placed at the disposal of another contesting candidate a car 'with a promise that the expenses incur-red in hiring and running it in connection with his election campaign would be met by the appellant, so that, he may continue to contest the election and wean away the Harijan votes from the first respondent;
 and (ii) that the appellant, and his supporters with his consent, delivered speeches appealing to the Muslim voters to vote for the appellant because he was a true Muslim while the first respondent *as a Kafir ; that they distributed handbills containing the allegations that (a) the first respondent, though a Muslim got the grave of another Muslim dug up on account of personal enmity; (b) as health minister he violated the modesty of lady doctors and nurses; (q) he got certain Muslims arrested on allegations of cow slaughter and forced them to eat pork; and (d) if the voters voted for the first respondent they would become subject to divine displeasure.
 
HELD :-(1) An appeal is a re-hearing but the trial Court's finding will be upset only when it is found that it is wrong. [647 D] Laxminarayan v. Returning Officer, [1973] INSC 181; A.I.R. 1974 S.C. 66, 78, Karemore's Case[1973] INSC 219; , A.I.R. 1974 S.C. 405, 413, 420 followed.
 (2) After an election had been held defeated candidates or disgruntled electors should not be allowed to treat it in a light-hearted manner by filing election petitions on unsubstantial grounds and irresponsible evidence. Courts must respect the verdict rendered by the electorate and show extreme reluctance to set it aside or declare it void unless clear and cogent testimony, compelling the court to uphold the corrupt practice alleged against the returned candidate, is adduced. Further, where corrupt practices are imputed the proceedings are of a quasi-criminal nature where strict proof is necessary and the burden is heavy on him who assails the election. in agents cases where the witnesses are partisans, being the polling agents or counting or workers of the candidates ; or of the turn coat type, who claimed to be the polling agents, counting agents or workers of the returned candidate till the election over, but, in the post-election period, when the defeated candidate's party had formed a government, shifted their loyalty and gave evidence in proof of the averments in the petition ; or officials working under sitting Ministries who are candidates for election, the Court must scan the evidence of the corrupt practices alleged with scrupulous care and severity. [650 E-H, 655 F-H] (3) The corrupt practice of bribery under s.. 123(1) by placing a car at the disposal of another candidate, is not proved. Assuming that such candidate got the use of a car at the expense of the appellant such financial aid would not amount to corrupt practice unless it was to induce that candidate not to withdraw from the election.
 644 In the present case, there is no proof on this aspect and there is no finding to that effect by the High Court. [652 H, 654 B-C] (4) Divine displeasure on account of prandial impropriety and undue influence for fear of forced pork eating, cannot be inferred from the allegations in the handbill. No one in India to-day will shiver with fear that a candidate, when he wins an election, will force down his throat distasteful pork. Such chimerical apprehensions are unreal and cannot receive judicial approval. Therefore, the corrupt practice alleged under s. 123(2) is not proved. [669 F-H] (5) But the hand bills exhort Muslims to support the appellant in the name of religion and contain allegations amounting to character assassination and so, the appellant is guilty of the corrupt practices under s. 123 (3) and (4).
 [670 A-B] (a) There is no credible proof that speeches had been made by the appellant or his supporters at meetings. [655-C-F] (b) But on the distribution of the damaging handbills there is acceptable, direct and circumstantial testimony. The appellant had a motive for publishing the handbills and there is evidence to show that the handbills existed at the relevant time. The circumstances of the case and the evidence of disinterested witnesses show that hand bills were distributed with the knowledge and consent of the appellant. [668F-H] (c) Neither s. 87 nor s.83 nor r. 94(a) and Form 25 require that the names of the witnesses should be mentioned as sources of information or as part of particulars. Rule 12 framed by the High Court for the trial of election petitions requires the source of information to be mentioned at the earlier stage in order to prevent afterthoughts. But, every witness need not be mentioned as a source and every source informant need not be examined necessarily. Whether the omission to do so in a given case reflects on the credibility of the evidence depends on the facts and circumstances of the case. While the court must be careful to insist that the means of knowledge are mentioned right in the beginning to avoid convenient embellishments and irresponsible charges, it should not stifle good and reliable testimony or thwart proof of corrupt practices by technicalities of procedure, especially when no prejudice, on account of deficiency in particulars, is made out. [664 C-E, F-G] (d) What is appeal to religion depends on time and circumstances, the ethos of a community, the bearing of the deviation on the cardinal tenets of the eligion and other variables. Law being a secular social process, the Court must avoid over solicitude for ultra-orthodoxies. [660 A-B.
 D-E] (e) Since the first respondent has called the various allegations relating to womanizing as false and the appellant has agreed that he does not believe them to be true, the corrupt practice under s. 123(4) must be held to have been made out.

 (6) If a blatant corrupt practice is committed during an election there is now no clear statutory mechanism which can contemporaneously be set in motion by the affected party, so that, when it is raw, a record and an instant summary probe is possible through an independent semi-.judicial instrumentality. Violations thrive where prompt check is unavailable. Effective contemporaneous machinery providing for such chocks would greatly curtail subsequent election disputes and even act as a deterrent to the commission of corrupt practices. Elections are the cornerstone of the parliamentary system and electoral purity can be maintained only when the virus of corrupt practices is controlled by comprehensive systematic changes in law with emphasis on a fearless enforcement instrumentality and a national politi- cal consensus to abide by norms. [670 D-F, 672 A-B] In the present case, the handbill does not contain the name of the printer and publisher although the election law so required. There is no agency to take prompt action after due investigation, and a propagandist is able successfully to spread 645 scandal without a trace of the source, knowing that nothing will happen until long after the election the question is raised in an election petition. [665 F-G] (7) The High Court having found the commission of corrupt practices by the appellant and one of his supporters, who is a sitting member of Parliament, and a large number of other persons, was under the statutory duty to name all those who have been proved at the trial to have been guilty of corrupt practices, under s. 99(a) (ii) after following the prescribed procedure. If only courts would name all those involved in the pollution of the electoral process, there would be some hesitation on their part to indulge in such improper practices. No such action is however necessary by this Court in the present case, because this Court found only the appellant guilty of corrupt practice. [670 F-671 H] D. P. Mishra v. K. N.
