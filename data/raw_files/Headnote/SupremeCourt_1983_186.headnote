 The workmen working in the establishment of the first respondent were being paid `attendance bonus'. The question whether the workmen were entitled to payment of bonus under the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965, over and above the `attendance bonus' was referred to adjudication under Section 10 of the Industrial Disputes Act 1947. The Tribunal held in favour of the workmen. Before the High Court the employer contended that when bonus was being paid under the Act the workmen were not entitled to separate `attendance bonus'. The High Court, relying on the decision of this Court in Sanghi Jeevaraj Ghewar Chand & Ors. v. Secretary, Madras Chillies, Grains Kirana Merchants Workers' Union & Anr. [1968] INSC 155; (1969) 1 S.C.R. 366 held that the workmen were not entitled to payment of `attendance bonus'.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: 1. Both the Tribunal and the High Court concurrently held that the workmen in the establishment had been receiving `attendance bonus' from before. `Attendance bonus' being outside the purview of the Bonus Act, the High Court was not right in vacating the award of the Tribunal.
 [928 E-F, 931 A] 
 2. In Ghewar Chand's case on which the High Court relied, the question was not whether after the Bonus Act came into force, the other types of bonus hitherto paid caused to be payable. This question was directly considered in Mumbai Kamgar Sabha, Bombay v M/s Abdulbhai Faizullabhai & Ors.(1976) 3 SCR 591 and held that the Act leaves untouched customary bonus. [929 A-B, 930 H] 
 3. In the instant case, if the employer had not challenged the award the workmen would have had the benefit of the bonus more than a decade back. That justifies the awarding of interest at 9% per annum. [931 B-C] 928
