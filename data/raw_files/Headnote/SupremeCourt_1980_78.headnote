 One Sri Ahluwalia, 4th respondent herein became a Deputy Superintendent of Police in Himachal Pradesh (which was then a Union Territory) by the end of 1956. In 1962, the Central Government constituted a common police service for the Union Territory of Delhi and Himachal Pradesh called the Delhi and Himachal Pradesh Police Service, and later, in 1964, respondent No. 4 was absorbed into that service on a regular basis. The usual avenue of promotion for a Deputy Superintendent of Police is the post of Superintendent of Police, but Superintendents of Police are borne on the cadre of the Indian Police Service and the exercise which results in the inclusion in the Indian Police Service is governed by the Indian Police Service (Appointment by Promotion) Regulations. 1955 framed under section 3(4) of the All India Services Act, 1951. The first step is to prepare a select list from among eligible officers of the State concerned, in the present case the Union Territories of Delhi and Himachal Pradesh. Sometimes, it happens that although the post of a Superintendent of Police is a cadre post, if no hands are readily available for being posted from the I.P.S., Deputy Superintendent of Police from the Select List is promoted provisionally subject to certain formalities. The 4th respondent (Ahluwalia) was brought into the Select List in 1965 and later appointed Superintendent of Police in October 1965 and he worked as Superintendent of Police in one place or the other, until December 25, 1967, when he went on Earned Leave from 26-12-67 to 25-3-68 and, even thereafter i.e. from 26-3-68 onwards, he continued as Superintendent of Police right down to January 1971, when on January 30, 1971, he was appointed to the I.P.S. and confirmed as such. The year of allotment was fixed as 1965. For ascertaining the period of allotment under rule 3(3) (b) of the Regulation of Seniority Rules. 1954, the period of his officiating service in the cadre post from 1-8-68 to 12-10-69 was not taken into account under Regulations 7 to 9 of the Indian Police Service (Appointment by Promotion) Regulations, 1955, in view of the fact that one Mr. Sahney who was senior to him in the Select List happened to be posted in an ex-cadre post. The 4th respondent who had a case that the law and justice of his case entitled him to 1961 as year of allotment, challenged the order of the Central Government allotting him the 486 year 1965. The High Court considered the matter with reference to the relevant rules and allowed the writ petitions with a direction to the Union of India to refix his seniority after assigning him the year of allotment as 1961. The Central Government reconsidered the matter even earlier, and, by its order dated 27-7-1979, refixed the seniority of the 4th respondent by assigning 1961 as his year of allotment. Aggrieved by this development the appellants have come up in appeal.
 Dismissing the appeal by special leave, the Court ^ 
 HELD : 1. The Officer Sri Ahluwalia was rightly assigned 1961 as the year of allotment. There was continuous officiation by him in a cadre post right down to 1971. There was no fault on his part. There was no illegality. There was no outwitting at the instance of Ahluwalia, of the claims of any other candidate. [494H, 495A] 
 2. The real line of distinction between a State and the Union of India might well be blurred a little when it is a Union Territory. Moreover, there is the circumstance that the entire Service was in the melting pot for a few years because the All India Services were being switched from Himachal Pradesh and Delhi into all the Union Territories.
 Even more; since uncertainty prevailed while the question of a part of Punjab being tacked on to Himachal Pradesh came to engage the Administration. Amidst these fluctuating factors, the solecism committed by the Union Territory of Himachal Pradesh in not having reported to the Central Government about continuing Ahluwalia, beyond 3 months, in a cadre post, was a venial sin for which the candidate was free from blame. [495C-E] 
 3. The argument, based on Sahney, a senior to Ahluwalia, being in a ex-cadre post and therefore, Ahluwalia's service during that period not being regular, also cannot be exaggerated out of proportion. Technically, the C.B.I. posts are ex-cadre posts, but it is a Central Government Department and nothing is suggested that there was something suspicious in Sahney being kept in the C.B.I.
 to facilitate Ahluwalia's continuance in Cadre post.
 Everything in this case is straightforward and, therefore, if there was any administrative lapse, Ahluwalia could not be victimized. Indeed, an unwitting hardship inflicted on a member of the Service under such circumstances can be relieved by exercise of the residuary power of Central Government under Rule 3 of the All India Services (Conditions of Service Residuary Matters) Rules, 1960. After full and second consideration, the Central Government passed Annexure 'Y' dated 1-12-78 whereby Ahluwalia was given the benefit of 1961 as the year of the allotment. The period of officiation of Ahluwalia between 1-8-1968 and 19-10-1969 was approved by the Central Government after consultation with the U.P.S.C. This retrospectively cured the infirmity that existed in Ahluwalia's officiation, beyond 3 months or 6 months, in a cadre post without consultation with the U.P.S.C. The contravention of Regulation 8 was, thus, relieved against. [495E-H, 497F-G] 
 4. In substance the exercise prescribed by Rule 9 of the India Police Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954 is that, when the cadre post is vacant and no Cadre Officer is available, a non-cadre officer may fill the vacancy for a period beyond three months if the State Government reports to the Central Government the reasons therefor and it is not ordered to be terminated. The Central 487 Government may permit a non-cadre officer to fill a Cadre post for a period exceeding six months provided it reports the full facts to the U.P.S.C. and acts responsibly in the light of the advice of the Commission. In the present case, no such report by the State Government to the Central Government was sent, no consultation by the Central Government with the Commission was done. Bypassing the Public Service Commission bespeaks prima facie impropriety, but it is not destructive of the officiation of Ahluwalia in the special conspectus of facts present here. For one thing, Ahluwalia has nothing to do with the error; for another, no senior of Ahluwalia suffered, thirdly, the Central Government, in exercise of its power to relax the Rules, in good faith and, indeed in equity, did relieve the officer against this violation. [498A-E] 
 5. Under Rule 3(iii)(b) of the Indian Police Service Regulation of Seniority Rules, 1954 continuous officiation is the decisive factor. Assuming that what is needed is regular officiation and not physical officiation, it is perfectly open for the Central Government to relax any irregularity by relaxing any particular rule or regulation.
 That power under All India Services (Conditions of Service Residuary Matters) Rules 1960, to relax is not arbitrary because the Rule contains guidelines. Government must be satisfied, not subjectively but objectively, that any rule or regulation affecting the conditions of service of a member of the All India Services causes undue hardship then the iniquitous consequence thereof may be relieved against by relaxation of the concerned Rule or Regulation; There must be undue hardship and, further the relaxation must promote the dealing with the case "in a just and equitable manner". These are perfectly sensible guidelines. What is more, there is implicit in the Rule, the compliance with natural justice so that nobody may be adversely affected even by administrative action without a hearing. There is nothing unreasonable, capricious or deprivatory of the rights of anyone in this residuary power vested in the Central Government. Indeed, the present case is an excellent illustration of the proper exercise of the power. [498E-H, 499A]
