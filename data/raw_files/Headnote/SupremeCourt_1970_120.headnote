 (1)A Regional Transport Authority is not required under s.
 47(3) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 to take into consideration any representations of the nature mentioned in s. 47(1) of the Act because there is first total absence in s. 47(3) of any reference to representations mentioned in s.
 47(1) and secondly the Regional Transport Authority while acting under s. 47(3) does not deal with any dispute between operators and is confined to its own administrative policy.
 [480 A. D-F] Neither the provision of a right of appeal under s. 64 read with r. 147(2) to a 'person aggrieved' by an order under s. 47(3) nor the right to apply for a revision under s.
 64A, is itself decisive of the true function of the Regional Transport Authority under s. 47(3), and as to whether the said authority has to grant hearing to persons at the time of fixing the number of permits. While acting under s.
 47(3) the Regional Transport Authority is the master of its own procedure, because it does not deal with individual or competing rights of operators, but is required to arrive objectively at its own conclusion independent of any application or representation by operators. [481 B-E] Therefore, the Regional Transport Authority is not obliged to hear operators while exercising jurisdiction under s.
 47(3) in fixing the limit of number of permits. [481 E] (2)When the Regional Transport Authority approves a proposal of the Secretary of the Authority to open a new route or to have an additional permit on an existing route and, therefore notifications under s. 57(2) are made in respect of grant of permit on a new route or an ' additional permit on an existing route, it can reasonably be held that there has been a valid order under s. 47(3), because, it is not the form but the substance of the order that has to be considered. [487 D-E; A-C] (3)The limit of number of permits fixed by the Regional Transport Authority under s. 47(3) cannot be modified by the Regional Transport Authority when exercising the separate power of granting permits under s. 48, or even by the State Appellate Transport Authority dealing with appeals against the grant of permits. Section 48 begins with the words ,subject to the provisions of s. 47 meaning thereby that the jurisdiction to grant permits is subject to the determination of the limit of number of permits. It is in the scheme of the Act that limit should be fixed before the grant of permits and proper effect can be given to these provisions by deciding upon the limit of number of permits before application for grant 4 75 of permits are invited under s. 57(2) of the Act and in other cases before application for grant of permits are published under s. 57(3) of the Act to enable persons to make representations. The central idea is that applicants and those who make representations should all know the limit of number of permits to be granted in order to ensure free and fair competition [485 A-G, D; 501 A-C] (4)Though the scheme of the statute has not been followed in all the appeals in the present case, the Regional Transport Authority fixed the limit of number of permits before it actually considered the applications for grant of permit and all parties competed for the grant on that basis and no one expressed any grievance at the time. In the facts and circumstances of the present appeals it was found that there was a valid order under s. 47(3) of the Act and further there was a notification under s. 57(2) of the Act.

 (5)Section 47(3) will not apply to inter-State, permits, because, the provision relates to a Regional Transport Authority limiting the number of permits in the region or in any specified area or on any specified route within the region. It is confined in its operation in or within the region-.Sections 45 and 63 establish that in the case of an inter-State permit an application has to be made to the concerned Regional Transport Authority under s. 45 and the permit has to be countersigned by the appropriate authority concerned of the other State under s. 63, and the provisions of s. 57 need not be followed for the grant of counter- signatures. Section 63A, 63B and 63C refer to inter-State Transport Commission to be established by the Central Government for dealing with inter-State permits. In the absence of directions by such Commission or rules by the Central Government, the only way of harmonising the powers and functions of Road Transport Authorities in relation to inter-State routes, is that they should exercise their powers within their respective spheres of granting and counter-signing permits by agreement and accord. [483 D-H] Similarly, in view of the fact that s. 47(3) in restricted in its field in or within the region, its provisions do not apply to inter--regional permits also. Section contemplates rules and conditions subject to which and the extent to which, a permit shall be valid in another region within the State without counter-signature, but in the absence of such rules, the relevant authorities will have to ensure agreement and act in concert. [484 F-H] The number of permits in a region can be fixed by the Regional Transport Authority of that region but it will be for that region only. 'Me number of permits for inter-State as well as inter-regional routes, beyond the frontier of the region, can only be determined by agreement. When the authorities in the two regions have thus agreed to open a new route or to have an additional vehicle and applications are invited for the grant of a permit in the case of inter- State or inter-regional permits, though s. 47(3) does not apply, to such routes, it will amount to an order, deciding upon the number of permits arrived at by agreement, before granting the permits.
