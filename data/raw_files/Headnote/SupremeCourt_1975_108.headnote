 The appellant a candidate of Muslim League defeated respondent No. 3 Shauket Chagla, the Congress candidate in the Maharashtra State in Assembly Election,.
 Respondent No. 1, a voter filed an Election Petition, inter alia, alleging that the appellant appealed to the voters to refrain from voting for respondent No. 2 on the ground of religion and that the appellant promoted feelings of enmity or hatred between different classes of the citizens of India on grounds of religion.
 The appellant made the following appeal to the voters in his various election speeches :
 (1)Muslim personal law was a matter of religious faith for Muslims and that it extended to the mode of disposing of bodies of the dead. The voters were told that if they voted for Chagla they would have to cremate the bodies of their de-ad instead of burying them because Chagla had cremated the dead body of his sister.
 (2) The appellant entreated hi$ audience not to vote for those who stood against their religion.
 (3) Chagla was not true to his religion and that the appellant was a true Muslim.
 (4) If Muslim personal law may be considered a personal matter by Chagla it was considered to be "the law of God" by Muslims who would not tolerate any attempts to amend it as that would raise a religious question.
 (5) If the Congress Government brought any amendments in Muslim religious law the battle would be fought in every street.
 (6) Chagla advocated intercommunal or inter- caste marriages and that he wanted a Hindu to be a member of the Haj Committee.
 (7) There were references to riots in which only Muslims were alleged to have been killed.
 (8) The appellant claimed that he would die for Islam and further said that "God has blessed us that every drop of our blood would give birth to thousands of Bukharis." (9) "At the moment we are in such a war in which our opponent is such a person who is playing with our religious affairs. He considers us to be a community whose conscience is dead." (10)"We have not signed any deed of slavery for the Government. When we find that the Government is working against us, our rights are being crushed, our religious affairs are being interfered with, then we will rise openly against it. We would rise like a wall cemented with lead. Then who would bang with this wall, would get his hand broken. No harm would be done to us." 282 (11)Chagla's wife Nalini was a Hindu and his son was named Ashok. Chagla used to attend the mosque as well as the temple and he should be excluded from Muslim localities.
 (12)Chagla was neither a good Hindu nor a true Muslim so that neither God nor Bhagwan was pleased with him.
 The High Court allowed the petition and set aside the election of the appellant. The High Court awarded costs of Rs. 12,000 to the first respondent and costs of Rs. 3,000 to the second respondent.
 In the present statutory appeal the appellant contended (1) The affidavit filed by the election petitioner was not in proper form since it does not give the sources of information of the corrupt practices.
 (2) The High Court erred in not framing issue on the vagueness of the petition.
 (3) The High Court erroneously allowed the amendment of the Election petition.
 (4) The High Court ought not to have relied on the cassettes of tape records.
 (5) The appellant merely asked the voters to support one who opposed any change in muslim personal law as against another who wanted to change' 'it. If change of personal law is a secular matter opposition to its change could not become an appeal on grounds of religion.
 (6) The order of costs passed by the High Court was very excessive.
 (7) The appellant did not get a fair trial.
 
HELD : Our Constitution-makers intended to set up a Secular Democratic Republic. Our political history made it particularly necessary that the basis of religion, race, caste, community, culture, creed and language which can generate powerful emotions depriving people of their powers of rational thought, and action should not be permitted to be exploited lest the imperative conditions for preservation of democratic freedoms are disturbed. Section 123(2), (3) and (3A) were enacted to eliminate from the electoral process appeals to those decisive factors which arouse irrational passions that run counter to the basic tenets of our Constitution. Due respect for the religious belief and practices, race, creed, culture and language of other citizens is one, of the basic postulates of our democratic system. The line has to be drawn by the court between what is permissible and what is prohibited after taking into account the facts and circumstances of each case interpreted in the context in which the statements or acts complained of were/made. The court has to determine the effect of statements made by the candidate upon the minds and feelings of the ordinary average voters of this country. [298A-F] The High Court was right in holding that tape records of the speeches were documents and were admissible in evidence, provided the voice of the speaker was identified, accuracy of the actual recording ascertained-and the relevancy of the subject matter established. [290A-B] The High Court rightly considered the tape records to be reliable for the following three reasons: firstly, the tape records have been prepared by an independent authority, the police ; secondly, transcripts from the tape records were duly prepared very soon after the tape records were made which made the subsequent tampering easy to detect ; and thirdly, the police had made the tape records as part of its routine duties and not for the purpose of laying any trap to procure evidence. [290G-H, 291A] The High Court rightly treated the shorthand notes and shorthand transcripts made by those who heard the speeches as corroborative evidence and which could be used by the witness to refresh his memory. [291-F] 283 The High Court rightly held that the various speeches made by the appellant violated the provisions of section 123(2), (3) and (3A). We do not consider such speeches have any place in a democratic set up in our Constitution. Our democracy can only survive if those who aspire to become people's representatives and leaders understand the spirit of secular democracy. If such propaganda was permitted it would injure the interests of the members of the, religious minority groups more than those of others. [293 BF, 294 E, G, 295 E, H, 296 B] The objection that the affidavit was not in proper form is, wholly untenable. The alleged defect is one of lack of particulars which was given up by the appellant in the High Court. [286 A & C] There is no substance in the objection that the High Court did not frame an issue on the question of vagueness of the petition. The real objection is that the particulars of the speeches made by the appellant were given in great detail in the statements annexed to the petition with the necessary affidavit. The law does not require the whole evidence to be set out in the petition in the form of particulars. [286 CDE] The trial court by allowing the amendment merely removed the vagueness from the petition by confining the allegation of corrupt practice against the appellant himself. [286 G-H] Various allegations have been made of unfairness against the trial Judge. There is no substance in those allegations.
 The nature of these allegations discloses an unreasonable attitude of the appellant's. counsel, which was also exhi- bited during the course of the trial. [287-F] The order of costs appears to err on the side 'of severity.
 The order of costs in favour of respondent No. 2 was set aside since the petition was filed by respondent No. 1. The costs awarded in favour of respondent No. 1 was red-,iced from Rs. 12,000 to Rs. 6,000. [298 E, FG]
