 The appellant-Bank had granted a Packing Credit facility to the extent of Rupees one lakh to the Respondent No. 1 - Firm, consisting of Respondent No. 2 and the deceased son of Respondent No. 3. Respondent No. 2 had created an equitable mortgage of his shop as security and Respondent No. 4, father of the deceased partner, had executed a Deed of Guarantee in favour of the appellant- Bank.
 The appellant-Bank filed a suit against the respondents including Respondent No. 3 who was impleaded in place of her deceased son, for a money decree and also for a preliminary decree against Respondent No. 2, and for a direction that if he committed default, a final decree be passed against him, with permission to the appellant to apply for a personal decree against him for any deficiency after the sale of the mortgaged property. The suit was decreed by the trial court.
 No appeal was filed by the Respondent No. 4 - Guarantor, and the decree became final. At the time of execution of the decree Respondent No. 4 objected to it on the ground that since no steps were taken against the mortgaged property i.e. shop, no action by way of execution could be taken 1032 for proceeding against the guarantor till the mortgaged shop was sold and only if the realisation from the sale of the shop was deficient, then the balance could be recovered from the judgment-debtors personally.
 The Additional District Judge held that since it was a composite decree, and the mortgaged property was also involved, the decree-holder should have proceeded first against the mortgaged shop and, since it had not done so, the execution application against the objector (guarantor) did not lie. The appellant-decree-holder challenged this decision before the High Court which also dismissed the revision petition. Hence the appeal by the decree- holder.
 Allowing the Appeal, this Court, 
 HELD : 1. The decree is a money decree against all the defendants-respondents and a mortgage decree only against defendant-respondent No. 2 so far as the shop is concerned.
 The decree does not put any fetter on the right of the decree-holder to execute it against any party, whether as a money decree or as a mortgage decree. The execution of the money decree is not made dependent on first applying for execution of the mortgage decree. The choice is left entirely with the decree-holder. There is no preliminary mortgage decree either. It is a final mortgage decree for sale of shop after three months. The decree is not in the prescribed Form No. 5 of Appendix `D' to the Code of Civil Procedure. The decree does not postpone the execution. It is simultaneous and is jointly and severally against all the defendants-respondents, including the guarantor. It is the right of the decree-holder to proceed with it in a way he likes. There is nothing in law which provides a composite decree to be first executed only against the property. [1037 C-E, 1038 E] 
 1.2 The decree for money is a simple decree against the judgment-debtors, including the guarantor and in no way subject to the execution of the mortgage decree against the judgment debtor No. 2-Respondent No. 2. If, on principle, a guarantor could be sued without even suing the principal- debtor there is no reason, even if the decretal amount is covered by the mortgage decree to force the decree-holder to proceed against the mortgaged property first and then to proceed against the guarantor.
 [1040 H, 1041 A] 
 1.3 If the composite decree is a decree which is both a personal 1033 decree as well as a mortgage decree, without any limitation on its execution, the decree-holder, in principle, cannot be forced to first exhaust the remedy by way of execution of the mortgage decree alone and told that only if the amount recovered is insufficient, he can be permitted to take recourse to the execution of the personal decree. For a simple mortgage decree as prescribed in Form No. 5 of Appendix `D' of the Code of Civil Procedure it could be so because the decree provides like that. It is only when the sum realised on sale of the mortgaged property is insufficient then the judgment-debtor can be proceeded with personally. [1041 C-D] Union Bank of India v.

 In the instant case, the guarantor never took any plea in the suit to the effect that his liability is only contingent if remedies against the principal debtors fail to satisfy the dues of the decree-holder. If such a plea had been taken and the court trying the suit had considered the plea and gave and finding in favour of the guarantor, then it would have been a different position. But on the face of the decree, which has become final, the court cannot construe it otherwise than its tenor. No executing court can go beyond the decree. All such pleas as to the rights which the guarantor had, had to be taken during trial and not after the decree while execution is being levied. [1042 G, 1043 A]
