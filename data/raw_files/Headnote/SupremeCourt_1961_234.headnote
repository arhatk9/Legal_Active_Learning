 The award made by the Industrial Tribunal, to which the dispute between the appellant, a hotel in new Delhi, and its workmen was referred, was challenged by the appellant on the grounds inter alia (1) that the workmen got a share in the service charges and also some amount by way of tips from the customers and so no bonus could be awarded to them, and (2) that the Tribunal was not justified in awarding 15 days casual-cum-sickness leave in view of the fact that s. 22 of the Delhi Shops and Establishments Act, 1954, provided only for a maximum of 12 days for such leave. It was not disputed that the workmen in the present case had contributed to the earning of profits for the years in question, that on a consideration of the wages paid to the workmen by the appellant there was a wide gap between their existing wages and the living wages, and that the amounts received through the distribution of service charges and tips were quite inadequate to bring the wages to the level of a living wage.
 Held, that it is well-settled that bonus is paid to workmen out of the available surplus of profits in order to fill in the gap between the existing wage and the living wage, provided that the workmen have contributed to the earning of profits, and that, in the present case, if there was an available surplus of profits in accordance with the Full Bench formula, the workmen would be entitled to bonus.

 Held, further, that the Tribunal was in error in awarding 15 days' casual-cum-sickness leave contrary to the provisions of s. 22 of the Delhi Shops and Establishments Act, 1954, and that the amount of leave must be reduced to 12 days as provided in the Act.
