 The appellant entered into a contract in September 1960 with the respondent through the Director-General, Supplies and Disposals, whereby he agreed to sell 500 bales Twills on terms and conditions contained in an exchange of letters.
 The date of delivery was fixed as November 30, 1960 and after the contract was entered into, the appellant deposited with the Reserve Bank of India an amount by way of security deposit in accordance with the terms of the contract. On November 30, the appellant informed the respondent that the contract was void and illegal being in violation of the provisions of the Forward Contract (Regulation) Act 74 of 1952 and that the security deposit should therefore be refunded. The respondent however took I the position that the contract was legal and binding and as the appellant had failed to deliver the goods as stipulated, it would purchase the goods elsewhere at the risk of the appellant. The respondent thereafter incurred an extra expenditure of about Rs. 76,000 and after giving credit to the appellant for the amount of security deposit claimed the balance amount of 'about Rs. 56,000 from the appellant. Upon the latter's failure to pay, the respondent took recourse to the arbitration clause of the contract and appointed an arbitrator to determine the dispute.
 Before the arbitrator could give his award, the appellant filed an application before the High Court under s. 33 of the Arbitration Act, praying for a declaration that the arbitration clause was illegal and void and for an injunction restraining the respondent from prosecuting the arbitration proceedings. The High Court dismissed the application holding that the contract was a "non- transferable specific delivery contract" and was not hit by the provisions of the Act.
 On appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (dismissing the appeal) The question as to whether the contract was a transferable or non-transferable specific delivery contact is, a question which ultimately depends on a reasonable construction of the contract. On a proper construction of the terms of the contract and having regard to the surrounding circumstances, there was an implied agreement between the parties that the rights and liabilities under the contract were not to be transferred and the bill of lading relating to the contract was also not to be transferred. It follows therefore, that the contract in question was a non-transferable specific delivery contract within the meaning of s' 2(f) of the Act and was not hit by the notification issued on March 29, 1958 issued by the Central Government under s. 15 (1) of the Act relating to jute/goods.
