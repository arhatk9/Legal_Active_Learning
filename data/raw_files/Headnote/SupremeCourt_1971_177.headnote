 The assessees made donations to a Charity Trust and claimed that the amount should be considered as "amounts actually spent for charitable purposes" under r. 2 of the rules framed under the Assam Agricultural Income-tax Act, 1939, and therefore exempt from assessment to tax. The Income-tax Officer rejected the claim but on appeal, the Assistant Commissioner granted exemption to the extent of 60% of the amounts donated. The Department bad no further right of appeal, but the assessees exercised their right of appeal to the Board of Revenue claiming full exemption. The Board of Revenue held that, (1) the assessees were not entitled to any exemption under the Act, but as the order of the Assistant Commissioner had become final, the assessees were entitled to retain the exemption granted; and (2) even if they were entitled to some exemption, what was granted was more than what they were entitled to.
 The High Court, on reference, held that : (1) the Board was not competent in the assessees' appeal to question the finding of the Assistant Commissioner that the amounts donated to the Charity Trust were actually spent for charitable purposes and (2) the Board was not justified in holding that only 60% of the amounts donated, were admissible as deduction Allowing the appeals, 
HELD : (1) Since there was no right of appeal to the Depart- ment an exemption granted by the Assistant Commissioner could not be interfered with by the Board, but while considering whether the assessees were entitled to the full exemption claimed, the Board had to examine the true legal position under the Act and the rules for the purpose of deciding the matter in issue. Therefore the Board was competent to determine whether the Assistant Commissioner took the correct view in law. [20B-D] (2)Under r. 2 (1) read with s. 8 (g) of the Act an assessee is entitled to deduct from his income only the sum actually spent by him for charitable purposes as defined in the rule. Assuming that an assessee may rely on an expenditure through an agency and not 18 by himself, and that the objects of the Charity Trust are charitable purposes as defined, it had to be established to the satisfaction of the assessing authority that the amounts were actually spent for such charitable purposes. Mere contribution to a charity fund would not entitle an assessee to the exemption when it was not proved that the Charity Trust had in fact expended the amounts donated for any such charitable purpose.
