 Under r. 3 of the Indian Police Service (Regulation of Seniority) Rules, 1954, issued under s. 3(1) of the All India Services Act, 1951, he mode of determining the seniority of officers of the Indian Police Service is as follows : The officers are divided into categories : (1) those in the Service at the commencement of the Rules, and (2) those appointed to the Service after the commencement of the Rules. The second category is divided into two sub- categories : (a) officers appointed as a result of a competitive examination, and (b) officers appointed by promotion in accordance with r. 9 of the Recruitment Rules.
 The year of allotment of an office which determines his seniority, is determined according to r. 3(3)(a) or (b).
 But if an officer started officiating continuously in a senior post from a date earlier than the date on which any of the officers was recruited to the Service by competition, the year of allotment had to be determined ad hoc by the Central Government, under proviso (1) to r. 3(3)(b), and under proviso (2) to r. 3(3)(b) the period of officiation before the date of inclusion of the name of an officer in the Select List prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Indian Police Service (Appointment by Promotion) Regulations. would be counted, only if such period was approved by the Central Government in consultation with the Public Service Commission.
 The appellant was officiating as Superintendent of Police from June 1947, that is from a date earlier than the date of any officer recruited by competition, and was appointed to the Indian Police Service by promotion in 1955 after the commencement of the Seniority Rules. His name was included in the Select List in 1956. The Government passed an order on 25th August 1955, that officers promoted to the Indian Police Service should be allowed the benefit of their continuous officiation with effect only from 19th May 1951.
 The appellant challenged the order by a petition under Art.
 226, because the period of his officiation from June 1947 to May 1951 has excluded for the purpose of fixation of his seniority. The High Court dismissed the petition.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD: The impugned order dated 25th August, 1955 should be quashed and the Central Government directed to fix the year of allotment and seniority of the appellant according to law.
 The date 19th May 1951, was an artificial and arbitrary date having nothing to, do with the application of the first and the second provisos to r. 3(3). It has some relevance for the Indian Administrative Service, but why it should be applied to the Indian Police Service was not adequately explained. Under the two provisos, the Central Government had to determine ad hoc the year of allotment after approving or not approving the period of officiation in consultation with the Public 'Service Commission taking into consideration all the relevant facts. The Central 326 Government cannot pick out a date and say that a period prior to that date would not be deemed to be approved by the Central Government within the second proviso. [331 B, E-G] (2) In view of the facts that he was officiating for eight years, that he had never been reverted and that he was appointed to the post when vacancies fell,. it could not be held that the appellant's continuous officiation a mere temporary or local or stop-gap arrangement, within the meaning of Explanation 1 to r. 3 (3) (b).
