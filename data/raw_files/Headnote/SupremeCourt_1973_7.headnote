 The detenu was arrested on June 15, 1972 under section 3(1)(a)(i) Arid (ii) of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971. The order was issued on the same date on which he was arrested under sections 107/117/151 of the Cr. P.C.
 The order was to expire on the 26th June, 1972 as the same was not approved under s. 3(3) by the Government. On 25-6- 1972, a fresh order of detention was passed which was served on the detenu on 26-6-1972 while in jail. The second order did not mention any fresh grounds of detentions. Both the detention order were challenged on the groups (i) that no fresh facts were disclosed for the fresh detention as required by s. 14(2) of act and (iii)that the orders were mala fide. Granting the writ of habeas corpus and directing the release of the petitioner.
 
HELD : The second detention order was made without alleging any fresh facts after the expiry of the first order. The power of preventive detention is an extraordinary power intended to be exercised in extraordinary emergent circumstances. The legislative scheme of ss. 13 and 14 of the Act suggest that the detaining authority is expected to know and to take into account all the exising grounds and make one order of detention which must not go beyond the period fixed and fix the maximum period of detention upto 12 months from the date of detention. It is to effectuate this restriction on the maximum period and to ensure that it is not rendered nugatory or ineffective by resorting to camouflage of making a fresh order operative so-on aft& the expiry of the period of detention, and also. to minimise the resort to detention orders, that s. 14 restricts the detention of a person on given set of facts to the original order and does not permit a fresh order to be made on the same grounds which were in existence when the original order was made.

 If the grounds are relevant and germane to the object of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, then merely because the objectionable activities covered thereby also attract the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Cr. P.C., the preventive detention cannot for that reason alone be considered to be malafide provided the authority con is satisfied of the necessity of the detention as contemplated by the Act.

 Merely because a person concerned has been served with a fresh detention order while in custody, that service cannot invalidate the order of detention. Although the past conduct, activities and antecedent history should be proximate in point of time and should have rational connection withthe necessity for detention, what period of past activity should beconsidered is within the discretion of the detaining authority.
