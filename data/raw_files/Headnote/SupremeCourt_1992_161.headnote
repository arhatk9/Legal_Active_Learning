 Certain plots of land of the claimant-appellants were acquired under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The Collector gave the award on 10.6.1968 and the reference Court on 30.8.1972. The claimants filed appeal before the High Court for enhancing the compensation. The entire land was categorised in 6 belts according to its quality and situation. The High Court allowed the compensation at different rates for each of the 6 belts.
 In the appeal by special leave to this Court it was contended on behalf of the claimant-appellants that the High Court committed an error in not awarding compensation for the entire land under acquisition at least at the rate of Rs. 1.75 per sq. yard as was awarded by it and affirmed by this Court in respect of land in Survey Nos. 1033 to 1035, because there was no distinction between the two lands which were acquired by one and 395 the same notification. As regards the interest it was contended that in the event of this Court enhancing the compensation, the claimants were entitled to enhanced rate of interest on the enhanced amount of compensation with effect from the date of possession.
 On behalf of the respondent, it was contended that the award being given by the Collector on 10.6.1968 and by the reference Court on 30.8.1972 no benefit of the enhanced rate of interest introduced by the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1984 can be given to the claimants.
 Allowing the appeal in part and referring the matter to a larger Bench with regard to the interest, this Court, HELD : (by the Court) :
 (i) For the land falling in the four belts i.e. 1,2,3 and 4 the compensation ought to have been awarded at the rate of Rs. 1.75 per sq. yard uniformly as they are similarly circumstanced as Survey Nos. 1033, 1034, and 1035.
 As regards the land falling in the fifth belt, reasonable compensation should be Rs. 2,000 per acre. As regards the land falling in sixth belt measuring 661 acres 4 guntas, it is proved on record that the area consists of hillocks and such the High court was correct in awarding the compensation at the rate of Rs.500 per acre. [pp.399 EF; 405G] (ii) The Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1984 extends benefit of the enhanced solatium to cases where the award by the Collector or by the Court is made between April 30, 1982, and September 24, 1984 or to appeals against such awards decided by the High Court or the Supreme Court whether the decisions of the High Court or the Supreme Court are rendered before September 24, 1984 or after that date.

 (iii) Since the Collector gave the award on 10.6.1968 and the court (Chief Judge, City Civil Court) on 30.8.1972 the claimants/appellants are 396 entitled to solatium at the rate of 15 per cent only on the enhanced amount of compensation. [pp. 401H; 402A; 405GH 406A 407F] (iv) The claimants would be entitled to interest at the rate of 6 per centum per annum up to 23.9.1984. [p.407 F] Union of India v. Raghubir Singh [1989] INSC 192; [1989] 2 SCC 754, followed.
 (v) There being disagreement with regard to the rate of interest to be allowed at 6 or 9 per centum per annum from 24.9.1984 till the actual payment in the Court and also in respect of the direction that if such amount is not paid within three months from the date of the order, the claimants would be entitled to interest at the rate of 6 per centum or 15 per centum per annum, the matter would be referred to a larger Bench.
 [pp. 407 F-H; 408A] PER KASLIWAL, J.
 
 1.1 The solatium is given on account of compulsory acquisition while the interest is awarded to compensate the delayed payment of the amount of compensation to which the claimant becomes entitled as soon as possession is taken from him till the entire amount is paid. The grant of solatium comes into operation on the date when award is given by the Collector or the Court and the rate of solatium would be governed according to the rate prevailing on that date. But so far as payment of compensation is concerned, the grievance continues till the entire amount is paid to the claimant. [p.404 C-E] 
 1.2 Harmonising the relevant provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, keeping in view the intention of the legislature in enhancing the rate of interest under the Land Acquisition (Amendment) ACt, 1984, and to do complete justice between the parties, the claimants would be entitled to interest on the enhanced amount of compensation at the rate of 6 per centum per annum from 24.6.1968 the date of taking possession up to 23.9.1984 and at 9 per centum per annum from 24.9.1984 till the payment of such amount in the Court. [p.405 A-D] 
 1.3 As the provision of granting interest at the rate of 15 per centum per annum after the date of expiry of a period of one year from the date on which possession is taken cannot be applied in terms and the amount of compensation has been enhanced by this Court and the State had no opportunity to 397 make the payment earlier, it would be reasonable to allow three months time to the State to make the payment and on its failure to do so, the claimants would be entitled to interest at 15 per centum per annum, from the date of this order. [p.405 D-F] PER PUNCCHI, J.
 1.1. Right from 24.6.1968, the date of taking possession, till payment of such amount is made in Court, the claimant-appellants would be entitled to 6 per centum per annum as interest. Neither the claimant-appellants are entitled to 9 per centum per annum interest from 24.4.1984 till payment of such amount in Court nor is any time to be granted to the State to pay it within three months at the pain of being liable to pay interest at 15 per centum per annum after three months. [p.407 C-D] 
 1.2 The amended Section 28 of the Land Aquisition Act, 1894 cannot be interpreted to entitle the claimant- appellants 9 per centum interest in the first year and 15 per centum interest thereafter till payment in Court. The interpretation of the provision or its harmonizing cannot be so elastic or go to such length so as to violate its clear intendment in the drive to `do complete justice' or to meet `the ends of justice'. [p.406 A-B] 
 1.3 The expression "any such award" occurring in s.30(2) of the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1984 was interpreted by this Court* in the context to exclude the benefit of enhanced solatium at the appellate level of the High Court or the Supreme Court unless the appeal arose against an award of the Collector or of the Court of a District Judge rendered between April 30, 1982 and September 24, 1984. It can have no two meanings, one towards the award of interest and the other towards solatium. Whatever be the intrinsic quality of payment on account of solatium and contrastingly that of the interest payable, claims to both arise from the date of taking possession till the payment is made in Court. If the governing rate of solatium would be that as prevailing on the date of the award made by the Collector or the Court, a fortiorari the governing rate of interest would too be the one prevailing on the date of he award made by the Collector or the Reference Court.
 Inescapably the language of the statute and the spirit mandates so. [p.406 C-G] *Union of India v. Raghubir Singh [1989] INSC 192; [1989] 2 SCC 754, referred to.
 
 2. The High Court at its level and this Court as the last appellate, are courts of correction and in the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction 398 are empowered to correct the award of the District Judge, as if the decision made by it would have been the award of the District Judge.
