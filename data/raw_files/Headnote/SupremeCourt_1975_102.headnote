 The appellant was elected to the U.P. Legislative Assembly.
 The appellant defeated respondent No. 1 by a margin of 94 Votes. The respondent No. 1 in his election petition made an application for inspection of the ballot papers on the ground that there were improper reception and rejection of votes. That the election staff was suffering from serious physical strain as they had to work without any rest. There were arithmetical mistakes in the counting. That the staff was drowsy and was dozing.
 The respondent no. 1 made an application praying for a sample inspection of the ballot papers. He examined some witnesses and counting agents, and filed some affidavits.
 The appellant also produced some evidence. The respondent did not give serial number of a single ballot paper which is said to have been improperly accepted or rejected. Nor did he file an application for recounting of votes.
 The High Court without going into the merits of the application ordered a sample inspection of the ballot paper.
 The High Court did not give any finding whether the evidence or the material adduced by the respondent no. 1 was sufficient for the prima facie satisfaction of the High Court.
 
HELD : An order for inspection could not be granted as a matter of routine, but only tinder special circumstances.
 Inspection of ballot paper should not be allowed in such a way so as to make a roving or fishing inquiry in order to discover material for declaring the election void. [205F-G, 206D] The following conditionss are imperative before a Court can grant inspection or sample inspection of the ballot pepers :- (1)That it is important to maintain the secrecy of the ballot which is sacrosanct and should not be allowed to be violated on frivolous, vague and indefinite allegations (2)That before inspection is allowed, the allegations made against the elected candidate must be clear and specific and must be Supported by adequate statements of material facts;
 (3)The Court must be prima facie satisfied on the materials produced before the Court regarding the truth of the allegations made for a recount ;
 (4)That the discretion conferred on the Court should not be exercised in such a way so as to enable the applicant to indulge in a roving inquiry with a view to fish materials for declaring the election to be void; and (5)That on the special facts of a given case sample inspection may be ordered to lend further assurance to the prima facie satisfaction of the Court regarding the truth of the allegations made for a recount, and not for the purpose of fishing out materials. [230E-H, 231A-B] Further held that what appeared to have weighed with the High Court was the solitary circumstance that the appellant bad succeeded by a narrow margin and that was a sufficient ground for ordering sample inspection. The Court, however, was unable to agree, with this broad statement of the law by the High Court because if a person is duly elected even by a narrow 203 margin of votes there is no presumption that there has been illegality or irregularity in the election. This is a fact which has to be proved by a person who challenges the election of the duly elected candidate. After all in a large democracy such as our's where we have a multiparty system, where the number of voters is huge and diverse, where the voting is free and fair and where in quite a few cases the contest is close and neck to neck, a marginal victory by a successful candidate over his rival can sometimes be treated as a tremendous triumph so as to give a feeling of satisfaction to the victorious candidate. The Court cannot lightly brush aside the success of the duly elected candidate on an election petition based on vague and indefinite allegations or frivolous and flimsy grounds.
 [212B-C DE] Held further, in the instant case, the High Court while passing the order of sample inspection made no attempt to apply the above principles. The High Court actually noticed some of the important decisions and yet did not apply them.
 The High Court did not record any satisfaction. Allowing the appeal, the matter was remanded to the High Court for disposing of the application for inspection of the ballot papers in the light of the observations made in the judgment. [205 D-F. 211 C-D]
