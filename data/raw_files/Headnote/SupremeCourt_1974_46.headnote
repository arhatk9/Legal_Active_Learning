 Under s. 5A, West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act, 1953 if it was found after an enquiry that a transfer made after May 5, 1953, was not bonafide, the transfer shall stand cancelled.
 Under 5A (7), a transfer shall be held to be not bonafide if it was made principally or partially with the object of increasing the amount of land which a person may retain, or with the object of increasing the amount of compensation payable. Under s. 6, an intermediary, holding land under a trust may retain such land; and under s. 16, in determining the net income of an intermediary, for purposes of determining the compensation payable to him, one of the items to be deducted from the gross income is the amount payable intermediary to a religious or chair table trust, out of the income of the estate.
 In 1928, a charge had been created upon an estate for the maintenance and seva puja of a family deity and for the performance of certain specified charitable purposes. In October 1953, the appellant, who had inherited a half share of the estate executed a document whereby a half share in his share of the estate was set apart exclusively for the purpose for which the charge had been created earlier and the rest of the property was to be treated as absolutely free and absolved from the claims in respect of the religious and charitable purposes. The appellant appointed him self as a trustee in respect of the property set apart for the religious and charitable purposes. He transferred his interest in the remaining portion of the estate to his son and wife. The Settlement Officer held, under the Act, that the 1953-document executed by the appellant was not bonafide.. His appeal, and petition in the High Court, failed Allowing the appeal to this Court, and remanding the matter to the High Court for disposal afresh, 
HELD : (1) If the substance of the transaction of 1953 by which properties are endowed in favour of the deity is looked into there is no reason what should not be called a gift. Therefore, the transaction was a transfer within the meaning of the Act [539 B-C] Champa Bibi v. Panchiram Nahata AIR 1963 Cal. 551 approved.
 (2) The High Court and the authorities below erred in holding that the transfer was not bonafide.
 (a) The Settlement Officer found that the total expenditure on seva and charitable purposes was Rs. 30,000 and appellant's share therein would be Rs. 15,000/-. It was also found that the income of the land absolutely transferred for the religious and charitable purposes under the deed of 1953, is Rs. 23,000/-. But for the execution of the document the appellant would have been in possession of the whole of his share of the estate with only a charge amounting to Rs. 15,000/- But the result of the document was that land yielding a larger income was transferred absolutely to the deity the Settlement Officer should therefore, have given his reason as to how he arrived at the conclusion that the transfer would enable the appellant to retain a larger extent of land or entitle him to a larger amount of compensation. The Special Judge in appeal and the High Court did not go into the question at all. [539F-H, 540B] (b) Whether the appellant was entitled to free a portion of the estate from the charge and confine the charge to only a portion of the estate does not affect the question whether the transfer was bonafide in terms of the Act. [539H] (c) Merely because he transferred 'the remaining portion to his son and wife could not establish want of bona fides.
 [539H] 537 (3) No question under S. 6(1) (i) of the Act arises on the facts of this case.[540 B-C] Fazlul Rabbi Pradhan v. State of West Bengal [1965] INSC 59; [1965] 3 SCR 307, followed.
