 Under s. 115(5) of the States Reorganisation Act, 1956., the Central Government may establish one or more Advisory Committees for the purpose of assisting it in regard to, (a) the division and integration of services among the new Stites, and (b) the ensuring of fair and equitable treatment to all persons affected. Under s. 177 the Central Government may give such directions to any such State Government as may appear to be necessary for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of the Act and the State Government shall comply with such directions. Accordingly, a meeting of the Chief Secretaries of the various States that were to be effected by the reorganisation was held in May, 1956, at the invitation of the Central Government, and certain decisions were taken as to the general principles that should be observed with regard to the integration work The Central Government thereafter informed the State Governments that they had decided that the work of integration of services, equation of posts and relative seniority should be dealt with by the State Governments in the light of those general principles. In 1962, the Central Government, after considering the representations of the officers made under s. 115(5) of the Act, in modification of the earlier principle excluding periods for which an appointment is held as a purely 'stop gap or' fortuitous arrangement in fixing seniority, decided that the officers allocated to Kerala State from the former Madras State may be allowed benefit of emergency service towards seniority in the equated category if such service would have been regularised from the date of their emergency appointment and counted for seniority in Madras, on 1st November, 1956, had those officers remained in Madras. The respondent-State accepted this decision of the Central Government.
 The appellant was selected as a District Munsiff by the Madras Public Service Commission and was posted as such on May 26. 1951. and he has been in continuous service since then. Consequent upon a decision of the Supreme Court of India, the Madras State Judicial Service Rules (Madras Rules) were framed in 1953, but were given retrospective effect from March 1951, and the service of the appellant and others was regularised as from October 6, 1951. The State of Kerala came into being on November 1, 1956, and the appellant was finally allotted Kerala with effect from October 24, 1956. On March 26, 1966, the respondent State published the final integrated list of the Travancore-Cochin and Madras personnel of the Judicial Officers as on November 1, 1956, showing respondents 6 and 7, whose dates of commencement of continuous service were July 20, 1951, and October 1, 1951, respectively, as senior to the appellant, on the basis that October 6, 1951, was assigned to him as the date of commencement of his continuous service being-the date of his appointment to the post in the equated category as on November 1, 1956. The respondent-State, on October 20, 1959, also provided that some posts of District and Sub- divisional Magistrate of 'executive origin' would be constituted as a separate service outside the civil judiciary, while being eligible for appointment as subordinate judges and Munsiffs respectively. The appellant filed a writ petition in the High Court questioning inter alia (1) the rank and place of seniority given to him in the final list, on the ground that the date of commencement of his continuous service is May 26, 1951; and (2) the order of the respondent-State providing a special cadre for magistrates of executive origin, on the ground that, if that order was implemented there was the likelihood of sub- divisional Magistrates securing promotion over munsiffs with longer service. The High Court dismissed the petition.- 868 in appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) (a) Rule II of the Madras Rules deals with temporary appointments. But it is not at all relevant for the purpose of fixing the seniority of the appellant. it is inapplicable to the appellant alter his final allotment to the State of kerala and after the clear decision of the Government of India allowing the benefit of emergency service in regard to seniority, which was accepted by the Kerala Government. [875 H] (b) Assuming that the rule and the earlier decision of the Government of India in conformity with the agreement with the Chief Secretaries referring to purely stop-gap or fortuitous arrangements may be invoked, they are inapplicable to the appellant, because, it cannot be held that the appellant's service is either filled 'owing to an emergency' or that it was held as a 'purely stop-gap or fortuitous arrangement.' The appellant had been appointed in a regular manner through the public Service Commission and his appointment could not have been made as a purely stop- gap or fortuitous' one. The Government of India had also accepted the position that an allotted employee should not suffer any disadvantage if he would not have been subjected to a like handicap in his parent State. The correspondence between the Madras and Kerala Governments after the Central Government communicated its decision that the allocated officers should be allowed the benefit of emergency service in regard to seniority, showed that the position in Madras State was that continuous service of the officer, whether regular, temporary or emergency, would have been taken into account for the purpose of seniority. The appellant had been in continuous service from May 26, 1951. Therefore, the conclusion is irresistible, that the appellant was entitled to the assignment of May 26, 1951, for the purpose of seniority, and the appellant in the connected appeal, would be entitled to the assignment of February 12, 1955.[876 C-G] (2) There is no force in the contention regarding the reservation of the separate cadre for the District Magistrate and sub-divisional Magistrates of executive origin. It is open to the State Government to constitute as many cadres as they Choose according to administrative convenience and expediency. [876 H] (3) As regards the appellant in the connected appeal he would not be entitled to an earlier date as the date of continuous appointment on the ground that an officer junior to him who was provisionally allotted to the State of Kerala along with him at initial stage when the new State was constituted was assigned 1-7-1954 as his date of continuous service; because, the 'KLM principle' was not applicable to that appellant. According to the principle the seniority of the Travancore personnel as between themselves, or of the Cochin personnel as between themselves could not disturbed while' determining the relative seniority of the Travancore and Cochin personnel in any class. But the officer who was junior to the appellant had arranged for a mutual transfer with an officer from Madras 'and could not be held to be in service in Kerala for the purpose of the final integrated list. The question of inter se seniority cannot arise when there is nothing. to fix such inter se seniority of the appellant vis-a-vis his junior. Therefore the benefit of the principle cannot, be claimed by the appellant. [877C]
