 Under s. 115 of the States Re-organisation Act, 1956, the Central Government has to determine the principles governing the equation of posts and prepare a common gradation list by integration of services in different States which have been reorganised. The Central Government is bound to ensure a fair and equitable treatment to officers in the matter of integration of services and the preparation of the gradation list. It must give full and fair opportunity to the parties affected to make representations and must give proper consideration to, those representations.To assist the Central Government in this task and for a proper considera- tion of the representations the Central Government is empowered to establish an Advisory Committee. It is not for the Court to lay down the principles to be adopted for the purpose of equation so long as the Central Government Acts properly according to the provisions of the Act. The power of the Court is only to see that the authority has acted properly in accordance with the statute; and it cannot go into the merits of the equation of posts which is a matter within the province of the Central Government., Further, in the case of equation of posts, especially among officers who are allotted from other States, it cannot be done with any mathematical accuracy. There will be some hardship or other caused to the officers of one particular region or the other. That is inevitable when service conditions of the officers coming from different regions vary. However, if a particular decision is "mala fide or arrived on totally irrelevant or extraneous considerations such a decision can be interferred with by Courts. [722B-G] In the present case, certain sales-tax officers of the Madhya Pradesh State were equated to grade II officers of the Maharashtra State. The officers of the Bombay State filed a writ petition challenging the order of the Central Government, on the ground that they were not given an opportunity to make representations and that the decision had been arrived at taking into consideration irrelevant and extraneous matters, and that the Madhya Pradesh officers should have been equated to grade III officers of the Maharashtra State. The proceedings were adjourned by the High Court to enable the Central Government to consider any representations that may be made by the concerned officers.
 After such consideration the Central Government expressed the view that the equation already made was correct. The High Court, however, quashed the decisions of the Central Government. on the grounds that relevant matters were not considered and that irrelevant and extraneous matters were taken into account.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) It is true that a decision taken by the Central Government without giving an opportunity to the officers affected to make representations is not a valid one. But the earlier order in the present case 715 has been struck down by the High Court, not on the ground that the Bombay Officers (petitioners) had not been given opportunity to make representations, but on other grounds which are not tenable. [724B-C] (2) Assuming the Central Government did not give an opportunity to the Bombay Officers to make their representations before passing the earlier order the defect was rectified by the fresh order passed later. [724C] (3) The later order shows that the Central Government had considered only very relevant factors and that the decision had been taken in conformity with, the provisions of the Act. The Central Government had constituted a Central Advisory Committee composed of the Chairman of the Union Public Service Commission, a retired Judge of the High Court and a retired Law Secretary to the Government of India. It was after taking into account the views of that Committee and having regard to the comments of the State Governments and the representations made by the officers concerned that the Central Government took the decision. The four factors which had to be taken into account as per the decision at the conference of the representatives of the State Governments and Government of India were all duly considered by the Central Government, and no irrelevant or extraneous matters have influenced the decision of the Central Government. No. mala fides were urged against the authorities [722G; 723D-F; 725A-E] (4) Section 115(5)(b) refers to a proper consideration of any representation made by any officer. This was satisfied in this case. There is no further obligation to give a personal hearing to the officers concerned. [726G-H] (5) The fact that the State Government took steps to comply with the directions of the High Court cannot lead to the inference that the appeal by the Union had become unfructuous. [727C-D] [In the circumstances it is not necessary to consider the point raised by the appellant that where all the four relevant factors decided upon had been taken into consideration, the fact that certain other additional matters relevant to the question had also been taken into account by the Central Government would not make the order of the Central Government erroneous].
