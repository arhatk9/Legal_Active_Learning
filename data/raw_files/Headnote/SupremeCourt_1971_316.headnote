 The suit was instituted by the plaintiffs in a representative capacity as Bhakats. According to the allegations in the plaint, a grant of rent free land of approximately 316 bighas was made by a Kim,, during the pre- British period in the name of one G, for the establishment of a vaishnavic institution. It was made for the propagation of Name Dharma and for continuance of Sravana- Kirtana-Dharma.
 Defendants I to 20 were alleged to be the heirs of G. The plaintiffs claimed that they were the descendants of the 10 Bhakats who were mentioned in the copper plate creating the endowment. in the copper plate, the grant was termed as Brahmottar. According to the plaintiffs, the grant was a Dharmottar grant though called Brahmottar in the copper plate. In other words, it was an endowment created for religious and charitable purposes and it did not confer benefit only on the grantee or his heirs. It was asserted by the plaintiffs that the defendants were interfering with their rights relating to the institution and were also not properly repairing the Nanighar (the place of worship). The relief claimed was for a declaration that the disputed land was a gift to the institution (sat sanghee satra) and for possession.
 In tile written statement. it was contended, inter alia, that the disputed land was not Dharmottar. It was a property gifted to late G, the predecessors of the defendants from generation to generation and that the suit, according to the defendants, was not maintainable because the provisions of' s. 92. Civil Procedure Code had not been complied with.
 The trial court held that the Suit was not maintainable because s. 92 of the Civil Procedure Code was not followed and that the Suit property was Brahmottar and not Dharmottar.
 In appeal the Additional District Judge held that the suit did not fall within s. 92 C.P.C., and so was maintainable and that the suit property was Dharmottar and not Brahmottar. According to the learned Judge, the plain meaning of the grant was that G, was made the medhi (high priest) for the satra. The grant was contemporaneous with the establishment of the Satra. The Purpose for which the grant was made was specifically for the propagation of Sravanakirtana-Dharma. The word 'Brahmottar' had been qualified by "Punvarthe", which meant "for piety". The grant was, therefore. not a personal grant. Accordingly, he held the plaintiffs entitled to file the suit and the appeal was allowed.
 The Defendants filed an appeal to the High Court.
 Dismissing the appeal, the High Court held that the relief claimed did not come within the provisions of s. 92 C.P.C., and the High Court agreed with the translation made by the learned Addl. District Judge of the relevant passage of the copper plate.
 493 on an appeal by certificate, 
HELD : (1) In the facts and circumstances of the case, s. 92 of the Code of Civil Procedure did not apply. It is well settled that a suit under s. 92 C.P.C., is of a special nature which presupposes the existence of a Public trust of a religious or charitable character. Such suit can proceed only on the allegation that there is a breach of such trust or that directions from the court are necessary for the administration of the trust. In the suit. there must be a prayer for one or other of the reliefs that are specifically mentioned in the section. In the present case, none of the reliefs claimed by the plaintiffs fell within the section.
 The declarations which were sought could not therefore attract s. 92 of the Civil Procedure Code. [499 D] (2) As regards the correct- translation of the copper plate on which the grant was made there was no reason to doubt the correctness of the translation appearing ,in the judgment of the Addl. District Judge which was affirmed by the High Court. Both the Addl. District Judge and the High Court were more familiar with the language and the origin of the establishment of satras and its historical background.
 'They were in a better position to interpret the terms of the grant than others. Therefore, there was no reason why this Court should interfere with the conclusions arrived at by both tile Courts below especially when this Court also was inclined to the view that the grant was not a personal grant made in favour of the high priest. The word 'Brahmottar' was used in the grant but mere use of that word would not change the essential character of the grant, namely. that it was a Dharmottar grant made for the propagation of SravanaKirtana Dharma and not to the high priest and his own brothers in their personal capacity.
