 The appellant was the trustee of a temple, which was an endowment for the public by his ancestors, and the respondents were its Pujaris with hereditary rights.
 Dissatisfaction with the management of the temple having arisen a suit under s. 92 of the Code of Civil Procedure was filed in which it was finally decided that the office of the Pujaris was hereditary and they were subject to the control of the appellant. Some of the Pujaris were not parties to the suit but they were bound by the scheme framed therein as members of the worshiping public. Subsequently again trouble arose and on the report of a commissioner appointed to investigate the working of the temple, the District Judge passed an order by which he revised the scheme which was then in force. The Pujaris went to the High Court in revision which was allowed. On appeal by special leave the main question arising for decision was how far it was open to the Court to amend a scheme once framed under S. 92 of the Code of Civil Procedure where a power to amend the scheme is reserved in the Scheme itself.
 Held, that in a suit under S. 92 for the settlement of a scheme it was open to provide in the scheme for modifying it whenever necessary by inserting a clause to the effect.
 A suit for the settlement of a scheme is analogous to an administration suit and so long as the modification in the scheme is for the purpose of administration, such modification can be made by an application under the relevant clause of the scheme without the necessity of a separate suit under s. 92 of the Code of Civil Procedure the provisions of which are not violated by such a procedure.

 Veeraraghavachariar v. The Advocate-General of Madras [1928] I.L.R. 51 Mad. 31, disapproved.
 A suit under s. 92 is a representative suit and binds not only the parties to the suit but all those who are interested in the trust. The mere fact that the Pujaris were not parties to the suit would not take away the jurisdiction of the District Judge to modify the scheme, if the modification was with respect to the administration of the trust and if it did not affect the private rights of the Pujaris.
