 The scope of Rule l(f) (iii) and (iv) of the seniority Rules of the Income-Tax Officers (Class I Grade 11) service Recruitment Rules and also Rule 4 of the Rules of Promotion of the Board of Revenue Office Procedure Manual came to be considered in "Jaisinghani's case" [1967] INSC 38; [1967] (2) SCR 703 and the Supreme Court while rejecting the contention that the rule was violative of Art 14 and 16 of the Constitution issued a manzdamus to prepare a fresh seniority rule based on the "quota rule" of 2 : 1 between the direct recruits and the "Promotees" for the year 1952-56. The Government under- stood the mandamuss as also for the years' upto 1967 and prepared a fresh seniority list dated 15-7-1968 and the appellants challenged the same as violative of the mandamus issued by the Court 
HELD : It was for the Government under rule 4 of the Income- Tax Officers Class 1, Grade 11 Service Recruitment Rules to determine the method or methods to be employed for the purposes of filling any particular vacancies and the number of vacancies and the number of candidates to be recruited by each method. It is wrong to assume that this Court would take upon itself to do what the Government is required to do under rule 4. The mandamus was really confined to the period between 1951-1956. [495-H] Rule 4 of the Income-Tax Class 1, Grade 11 Service Recruitment Rules also refers to recruitment of candidates to vacancies in the service. The vacancies for any particular year being ascertained not more than 1/3rd of the same were to go to the promotees and the rest to the direct recruits. The ratio was not made dependent on whether any direct recruit was appointed in any particular year or not.
 The promotees were entitled to 1/3rd of the vacancies in any particular year whether or not there was direct recruitment but competitive examination in that year. [499G-H] It is true that the quota rule refers to vacancies but the vacancies are those vacancies which the Government wants to fill. It is the prerogative of the Government, reflected further in Rule 4, whether any vacancy may be filled tit all or not. Therefore, when the quota rule refers to vacancies it is implicit in the rule that the vacancies are vacancies, which the Government want to fill, whatever may be the actual number of vacancies. [50D-F] There is no sufficient warrant for the contention that the vacancies referred to in the quota rule are vacancies only in the permanent cadre. [502D-E] S. G. Jaisinghani V.
