 The proper method of approach in the matters of references under s. 307 of the Criminal Procedure Code as finally settled is that the High Court will only interfere with the verdict of the jury if it finds the verdict perverse in the sense of being unreasonable, manifestly wrong or against the weight of evidence.
 If the facts and circumstances of the case are such that a reasonable body of men could arrive at one conclusion or the -other, it is not competent to the Sessions Judge or the High Court to substitute their verdict in place of the verdict which has been given by the jury. The jury are the sole judges of the facts and it is the right of the accused to have the benefit of the verdict of the jury. Even if the Sessions Judge or the High Court would, if left to themselves, have arrived at a different verdict, it is not competent to the Sessions Judge to make a reference nor to the High ,Court to accept the same and substitute their own verdict for the -verdict of the jury provided the verdict was such as could be arrived at by a reasonable body of men on the facts and circumstances of the case.
