 In Mysore there were two Acts bearing on acquisition of private land for public purposes, namely, the Mysore Land Acquisition Act, 1894, and City of Bangalore Improvement Act, 1945. A notification under s. 4 of the Mysore Land Acquisition Act, 1894, was issued for acquisition of the respondents' plots in Bangalore. The procedure in the Acquisition Act is a shortened procedure which is prejudicial to the owner of property acquired. The respondents challenged the acquisition in the High Court on various grounds and the High Court allowed the petitions.
 The State appealed to this Court and while the appeal was pending the Bangalore Acquisition of Lands (Validation) Act, 1962, was passed and received the assent of the President, as required by the Constitution on May 4, 1963. It validates all acquisitions made, proceedings held, noti- fications issued or orders made in connection therewith, by the State Government purporting to act under the Mysore Land Acquisition Act, before the Validating Act came into force, for the purpose of improvement, expansion or development of the City of Bangalore. It also provides that pending proceedings may be continued under the Mysore Land Acquisition Act. The provisions are to be effective notwithstanding the City of Bangalore Improvement Act, or any other law, judgment, decree or order of any court.
 Section 2(1) of the Validation Act, provides, that no order made under the Mysore Land Acquisition Act is to be called in question on the ground that the State Government was not competent to make acquisition for the Purpose of improvement or on any ground whatsoever, and s. 2(2) provides that a notification or order may be questioned in accordance with the provisions of the Mysore Land Acquisition Act -and the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, and the rules made thereunder.
 In this Court in spite of the Validating Act the respondents sought to support the judgment of the High Court on the grounds that : (1) there were still two Acts which covered the same field but prescribed two different procedures, and that the notifications issued following the more prejudicial procedure in the Mysore Land Acquisition Act were unconstitutional as that Act was discriminatory; (2) an acquisition or anything done, previously hit by Art. 14 cannot be validated unless the vice of unreasonable classification is removed, and so, the Validating Act was ineffective; (3) the Mysore Land Acquisition Act and the Land Acquisition Act. 1894, are general laws which must give way to the special law in the Improvement Act; and (4) There is still discrimination, because. there are two classes of cases one, in whose case the Validating Act dispenses with the procedure of the Improvement Act and' those, in whose case that procedure will be followed 56 
HELD : (1) The supremacy of the Legislatures in India, within the constitutional limits of their jurisdiction is complete. By the non-obstante clause ' in the Validating Act, the Improvement Act is put out of the way as if it were repealed or as if it had not been passed. The Legislature, has made retrospectively a single law for the acquisition of property and rendered all acquisitions, made before the Validating Act was passed, to be governed by the Mysore Land Acquisition Act alone. Objections based on breach of Constitution or fundamental rights could be raised in spite of the words 'or on any ground whatsoever' in the Validating Act, but, objections on the ground that there has been nonobservance of the provisions of the Improvement Act must fail. [62 A-C; 63 A-B] (2) It is wrong to assume that a discrimination arising from selection of one law for action rather than another, where two procedures are available, can never be righted by removing retrospectively one of the competing laws from the field. If there is legislative competence, the Legislature can always put out of action retrospectively one of the pro- cedures leaving one procedure only available, namely, the one that was followed and thus get over the discrimination.
 In the present case, the only curb on the Legislature's powers was the requirement of the President's assent and that was obtained. [63 B] Piara Dusadh v. King Emperor, [1944] F.C.R. 61, applied.
 (3) There is no question of general Acts giving way to a special Act because, after the Validating Act was passed there was no Improvement Act to consider. [63 E-F] (4) All Validating Acts lead to two distinct classes those in which validation is necessary and those in which it is not. Such class legislation is permissible and the Legislature is competent to validate procedural defects. [63 H]
