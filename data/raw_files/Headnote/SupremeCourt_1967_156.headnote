 The two agreed to cohabit. Pursuant to the agreement each rendered services to the other. Her services were given in exchange for his promise under which she obtained) similar services. In view of her services, he promised to give his services only and not his properties. Having once operated as the consideration for his earlier promise. her past services could not be treated under s. 2(d) of the Indian Contract Act as a subsisting consideration for the properties to her. The past cohabitation was the motive and not the consideration for the transfers which were without consideration and were by way of gifts. The gifts were not hit by s. 6(h) of the Transfer of property Act, by reason of the fact that they were motivated by a desire to compensate the concubine for her past services. [45E-G] The invalid gifts were not validated by the disruption of the joint family in 1947. After the disruption of the joint family, V was free to make a gift of his divided interest in the coparcenary properties to the appellant, but he did not make any such gift. [46D] Balo v.
