 The respondent company dismissed three of its workmen and retrenched another employee. Some of the workers demanded the reinstatement of the dismissed workmen and payment of retrenchment compensation to the retrenched workmen and raised a dispute about the matter. The- State Government referred the dispute to the Labour Court The management raised the objection that there was no industrial dispute in as much as the cause of the workmen had not been espoused by a substantial body of the workmen of the company. The Labour Court rejected the objection. In a writ petition, the High Court held that there were 60 workmen in the employment of the respondent company, out of whom only 18 workmen have espoused the cause of the dismissed and retrenched employees, and even out of these 18 workmen 13 had already been dismissed and that therefore, only 5 out of 60 workmen had espoused the cause of the dismissed and retrenched workmen; and hence, it could not be said that a substantial body of the workmen had espoused the cause of the workmen and therefore, there was no industrial dispute which could be referred.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD: The State Government will have jurisdiction to make a reference only if there is an industrial dispute.
 As the espousal of the dispute in the present case was only by five out of sixty employees it could not be said that there has been an espousal of the dispute in this case by an appreciable body of the workmen of the respondent-company so as to make it an industrial dispute. Since there was no industrial dispute. the reference made by the State Government had been rightly held by the High Court to be incompetent. [161E-F] Workmen of Rohtak General Transport Company v.
