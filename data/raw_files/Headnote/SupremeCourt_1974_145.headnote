 Two persons, Tribeni Sahai and Radhey were shot dead in the town of Dataganj, District Budaun. The four appellants were tried along with two others by the learned Sessions Judge, Budaun, for various offences in connection with the incident. Balak Ram was convicted under sec. 302 IPC and sentenced to death. He was also convicted and sentenced under sec. 337 read with sec. 149 for causing injuries to Jhilmili and Ram Prakash and under sec. 148 IPC. The other five were acquitted of all the charges. Sentence of death imposed on Balak Ram was confirmed by the High Court. But in the appeal filed by the State against the order of acquittal passed by the Sessions Court, the High Court confirmed the acquittal of Kailash, but convicted Nathoo, Dr. R. P. Kohli and Mohd. Sayeed Khan and Danney Khan under sections 302 and 307 read with sec. 149. It further convicted Nathoo and Dr. Kohli under section 148 and Banney Khan under section 147 of the Penal Code. The three accused have been sentenced by the High Court to imprisonment for life for their participation in the murder of Tribeni Sahai and Radhey and concurrently to ten years' rigorous imprisonment for causing injuries to Jhilmili and Ram Prakash. Balak Ram Nathoo, Dr. Kohli and Banney Khan, have filed four separate appeals by special leave of this Court.
 The prosecution case was that at about 9-15 p.m. on May the 27 the six accused along with 15 or 20 of their followers went about canvassing for them candidates put up by the Congress (0). A little later, they went southwards through a lane which leads to the house of the deceased Tribeni Sahai. He was having an after-dinner stroll with Radhey and as he reached the inter-section of a cement road passing by his house and the line by which the processionists were proceeding, the appellants who were leading the processions started raising offensive slogans against him. Tribeni Sahai protested and a wrangle ensued.While hot words were being exchanged, Dr. Kohli, Banney Khan and Pearey Mian exhorted Balak Ram to fire. Balak Ram stepped out, stood on the raised ground to the east of the lane and fired a shot at Tribeni Sahai with a licensed pistol which he was carrying. Tribeni Sahai had sensed danger and was trying to escape but he was hit by a bullet on the right scapular region. Radhey who was a few paces behind Tribeni Sahai ran forward to protect him when Balak Ram, Nathoo and Dr. Kohli fired four or five shots. Radhey received a pistol injury on the. left back. Jhilmili and Ram Prakash who live 2-L192SupCI /75 754 nearby came running in protest but they also received injuries as a result of the shots fired by Balak Ram, Nathoo and Dr. Kohli. Nathoo, like Balak Ram, was carrying a pistol while Dr. Kohli was armed with a licensed revolver.
 Jhilmili received an injury on his left thigh while Ram Prakash was found to have a superficial burn on the right side of his abdomen, According to the prosecution, Rajendra Kumar Misra gave information of the incident at 4-45 p.m. at the Police Station which is about two furlongs away. The Station House Officer. Yogendra Sharma, asked a head constable to record the First Information Report. The S.H.O. signed the report and hurried to the scene of occurrence. The S.H.O. claims to have taken down the dying declaration of Tribeni Sahai in the case diary which he had taken with him while leaving the police station. This is the second of the three dying declarations. The first one is said to have been made to Dharam Pal, the rival candidate of the appellant Balak Ram.
 The third one was in the Budaun Hospital before the Sub- Divisional Magistrate. These four appeals have been filed by special leave of this Court.
 It was contended (i) the High Court had no sufficient reasons for interfering with the order of acquittal passed by the Sessions Court in favour of Nathoo. Dr. Kohli and Banney Khan and (ii) the High Court was not justified in upholding the conviction of Balak Ram and the sentence of death imposed on him by the Sessions Court.
 Dismissing the appeal of Balak Ram and allowing the other three appeals, 
HELD: (i) If the High Court has set aside an order of acquittal the Supreme Court in an appeal under Art. 136 will examine the evidence only if the High Court has failed to apply correctly the principles governing appeals against acquittal. The powers of the High Court are as full and wide in appeals against acquittal as in appeals against conviction, but, amongst other things, if two views of the evidence are reasonably possible the High Court ought not to interfere with the order of acquittal passed by the trial court.[762A-C] Ram jag amd Ors. v. The State of U.P. [1973] INSC 255; (1974) 4 S.C.C. 201 relied on.
 An examination of the various items of evidence on record discloses that the conclusion to which the learned Sessions Judge came was a reasonable conclusion to come to. It cannot be denied that two views of the evidence are reasonably possible in regard to the participation of Nathoo, Dr. Kohli and Banney Khan. The High Court, therefore, ought not to have interfered with the judgment of the Sessions Court in their favour. [770F-G] (ii) In the F.I.R. Rajendra Kumar mentioned that Loki, Ganga Ram and Aryendra had seen the incident. Neither Ganga Ram nor Loki was examined by the prosecution and the learned public prosecutor stated that Loki had been won over by the defence. Such a bold assertion, unsupported by any data, is insufficient to absolve the prosecution of its duty to examine witnesses whose evidence is necessary for unfolding its case. [764F-H] (iii)The Statements of three prosecution witnesses were recorded under 164 Cr.P.C. soon after the incident. The Investigating Officer said that be got the statements recorded by way of precaution. 'Mat could be true and it would be wrong to find fault with him merely because he got the statements of these Witnesses recorded under ec. 164.
 Nor can the evidence of a witness be discarded for the mere reason that his statement was recorded under sec. 164. But the High Court overlooked that the evidence of these witness must be approached with caution. Such witnesses feel tied to their previous statements given on oath and hive but a theoretical freedom to depart from the earlier version. A prosecution for perjury could be the price of that freedom.
 it is open to the court to accept the evidence of witness whose statement was recorded under sec. 164 but the salient rule of caution must always be borne in mind. That is all the more necessary when almost all the eye-witnesses are subjected to this tying-up process. [768B-E] 755 (iv) The powers of the Supreme Court under Article 136 of the Constitution are wide but in criminal appeals the Supreme Court does not interfere with the concurrent findings of fact save in exceptional circumstances.
 Normally the High Court is a final court of appeal and the Supreme Court is only a Court of special jurisdiction. This Court would not, therefore, re-appraise the evidence unless, for example the forms of legal process are disregarded or principles of natural Justice are violated or substantial and grave injustice has otherwise resulted. [761G-H] Ramabhupala Reddy and Ors. v. The State of Andhra Pradesh A.I.R. 1971 SC 460 relied on.
 (v) Balak Ram examined two witnesses, D.W. 7 and D.W. 9 to establislh his plea of alibi but the evidence was rightly rejected by the trial court. It is in the least degree likely that Balak Ram who was contesting the election for Chairmanship of the Committee would be away from the hubbub of politics on the eve of elections. All the same. the High Court ought to have considered that evidence for what it was worth. In a reference for confirmation of the death sentence under sec. 374 Cr.P.C. the High Court must examine the entire evidence for itself, independent of the Sessions Court. [772G-H] Bhupendra Singh v. The State of Punjab [1968] INSC 60; [1968] 3 SCR 404 and Jumman and Ors. v. The State of Punjab AIR 1957 SC 469.
