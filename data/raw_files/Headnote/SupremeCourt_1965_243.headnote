 At the general elections for a seat in the U.P. Legislative Assembly, the appellant was declared elected. The name of the 1st respondent who was a defeated candidate,, was inaccurately printed in the ballot papers issued as "Udai Bhan Pratap Singh" though his symbol was correctly shown.
 Alleging that the incorrect printing of his name had materially prejudiced his prospects of securing the votes of all his supporters, he challenged the appellant's election by an election petition. The Election Tribunal, and the High Court on appeal, set aside the appellants election.
 The High Court rejected the 1st respondent's contentions -that the misprinting constituted an irregularity in the form or the design of the ballot paper and that therefore r.
 56(2)(g) of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, had been.
 contravened. The High Court, however, held that the misprinting of the 1st respondent's name on the ballot papers rendered the appellant's election void under s.
 100(1)(d)(iv) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.
 In the appeal to this Court, 
HELD: The appeal should be allowed and the election petition dismissed. [572 E] The design to which r. 56(2) (g) refers is the form, the pattern or the outline of the ballot paper and not its contents.. The High Court was therefore right in holding that r. 56(2) (g) had not been contravened by the misprinting. [572 B-C] The High Court and the Election Tribunal were in error when they came to the conclusion that the appellant's election had been rendered void under s. 1 00 ( 1) (d) (iv) by reason of the fact that the 1st respondents same had been misprinted on the ballot papers. The misprinting was an irregularity which fell under the section as it amounted to non-compliance of r. 22 of the Rules. But the proof of such noncompliance did not necessarily or automatically render the appellant's election void. To make the election void, the 1st respondent had to prove the non-compliance and its material effect on the election. Since he had failed to prove the latter fact, his challenge to the validity of the appellant's election could not be sustained. [570 B; 572 C- D]
