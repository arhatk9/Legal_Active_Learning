 A dispute arising, subsequent to a contract for sale of land, about the particular form in which the warranty of title should be inserted in the sale deed cannot affect the completeness of the contract already made, nor can it amount to a repudiation of the contract when the party who wanted a particular form to be adopted does not persist in it and expresses his readiness and willingness to perform the contract agreed to. Even it a party insists on a particular form that would not affect the contract, though it may in certain circumstances disentitle him to specific performance.
 Bindeshri Prasad v. Mahant Jairam Gir (I.L.R. 9 All. 705) referred to.
 In a suit instituted by a purchaser against the vendor and a subsequent purchaser for specific performance of the contract of sale, if the plaintiff succeeds, the proper form of the decree to be passed is to direct specific performance of the contract between the vendor and the plaintiff and direct the subsequent transferee to join in the conveyance so as to pass on the title which resides in him to the plaintiff. He does not join in any special covenants made between the Plaintiff and his vendor; all he does is to pass on his title to the plaintiff.
 Kafiladdin v. Samiraddin (A.I.R. 1931 Cal. 67), Potter v.
 Sanders [1846] EngR 1005; (67 E.R. 1057) and Kali Charan v. Janak Deo (A.I.R.
 1932 All. 694) referred to.
 In such a suit it would not be right to lay down that in every case the balance of the purchase money should be paid to the subsequent transferee up to the extent of the consideration paid by him. There may be equities between the vendor and the subsequent transferee which would make that improper, and unless these are also raised and decided in the case, the normal rule should be to direct the money to be paid to the vendor.
