 The appellant was awarded maintenance for herself and her son to be paid by respondent No. 1, her husband, under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, by the Metropolitan Magistrate. The husband did not pay the maintenance allowance and it fell into arrears. The appellant moved an application for execution of the order for maintenance. In the course of enforcement of the order of maintenance the husband was sentenced to suffer simple imprisonment for one month by the Metropolitan Magistrate.
 The appellant again prayed for recovery of the arrears. The Metropolitan Magistrate rejected her prayer on the ground that the claim for arrears stood satisfied upon the husband having been sent to jail. The appellant filed a revisional application in the High Court. The High Court rejected the revisional application summarily without a speaking order.
 Hence this appeal by special leave.
 Allowing the appeal, this Court, 
 HELD: A distinction has to be drawn between a mode of enforcing recovery on the one hand and effecting actual recovery of the amount of monthly maintenance allowance which has fallen in arrears on the other. Sentencing a person to jail is a `mode of enforcement'. It is not a `mode of satisfaction' of the liability. The liability can be satisfied only by making actual payment of the arrears. The whole purpose of sending to Jail is to oblige a person PG NO 762 PG NO 763 liable to pay the monthly allowance who refuses to comply with the order without sufficient cause, to obey the order and to make the payment. The purpose of sending him to Jail not to wipe out the liability which he has refused to discharge. be it also realised that a person ordered pay monthly allowance can be sent to jail on if he fails pay monthly allowance 1without sufficient cause' comply with the order. I would indeed be strange to hold that a person who without reasonable cause' refuses to comply with the order of the court to maintain his neglected wife or child would be absolved of his liability merely because he prefers to go to jail. A sentence of jail is no substitute for the revocery of the amount of monthly allowance which has fallen in arrears, Monthly allowance is paid in order to enable the wife and child to live b providing with the essential economic wherewithal. Neither the neglected wife nor the neglected child can live without funds for purchasing food and the essential articles to enable them to live. Instead of providing them with the funds, no useful purpose would be served by sending he husband to jail, Sentencing to jail, is the means for achieving the end of enforcing the order by recovering the amount of arrears. It is no a mode of discharging liability. The order for monthly allowance can be discharged only upon the monthly allowance being recovered. [767B-G]
