 A scheme was prepared and confirmed tinder s. 20 of the East Punjab Holdings ( Consolidation and Prevention of Fragmentation) Act, 1948, providing that the owners of permanent ghers or enclosures would be permitted to retain them in their possession. The respondent, tinder s. 42 of the Act, reconsidered this matter and ordered that the plot of the appellant, who had made a gher, should be kept for non-proprietors and consolidation records should be changed 'to that effect.
 The appellant successfully challenged the respondent's order in a writ petition, which in appeal was reversed. In appeal to this Court, the appellant contended that (i) the power of the State Government under s. 42 was controlled by the procedure prescribed under s. 36 if it involved a variation of the confirmed scheme and the order of the respondent wag ultra vires since the procedure contemplated by s. 36 had not been followed, and (ii) the respondent's order was illegal as it violated s. 18(c) and Rule 16(ii) because under- Rule 16(ii) only a fraction of each proprietors' land could be taken and formed into a common pool so that the whole may be used for the common needs and benefits of the estate and there was no such reason mentioned in the impugned order as required by s. 18.
 HELD : (i) The power conferred on the State Government by s.
 42 is not controlled by s. 36 and the procedure of publication and hearing objections contemplated by ss. 19 and 20 of the Act is not necessary. Sections 36 and 42 envisage two different situations and the intention of the Act is to give powers respectively to the Confirming Authority and to the State Government to act under these sections in their discretion in any particular case. The reason for two different provisions in ss. 36 and 42 of the Act is also clear for if a scheme is varied or revoked by the authority confirming it, then the new scheme has to be published so that interested parties may object and their objection ,decided by competent authorities set up under the Act those decisions being finally appealable to the State Government. But when a scheme is to be varied 'by the State Government itself under s. 42 of the Act, there is no requirement of the statute that the varied scheme should be published. The State Government is only required to give notice and to give an opportunity to the interested parties to be hear[( before the variation is made. (293G-294B] (ii) The respondent's order was illegal. In view of the decision in Ajit Singh v. The State of Punjab, [1966] INSC 257; [1967] 2 S.C.R. 143 the wide interpretation of s. 18(c) would make the operation of the section unconstitutional. It is I well established rule that a statute has to be so read as to make it valid,, it has to be construed ut res magis valent quam pareat. Applying the principle to the present case, it is manifest that 287 s. 18(c) must be read in a restricted sense and the authority of the Consolidation Officer to reserve land for the common purpose under 18(c) of the Act must be restricted and it must be held that the Consolidation Officer has power under the section to take the land out of the common pool of the village only according to the rateable share from the proprietors and other right-holders for any common purpose including the extension of the village abadi. It is also clear that the power of the ,State Government to make reservation of land for common purposes under s. 42 is co- terminus with the power of the Consolidation Officer under s. 18(c).
