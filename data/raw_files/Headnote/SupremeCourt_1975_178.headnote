 In June, 1966, the Central Government, in exercise of the powers conferred by s. 5 of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. delegated its power to make Orders to the State Governments with respect to certain matters specified in s.
 3(2) in relation to all essential commodities other than certain specified commodities. Tyres and Tubes were not essential commodities under s. 2(a)(i) to (x), nor were they declared to be essential commodities by the Central Government under s. 2(a)(xi) at the time of the delegation;
 but, subsequent to the delegation of the power to the State Governments, certain types of tyres and tubes were declared to be essential commodities under s. 2(a) (xi).
 In exercise of the delegated power the State of Andhra Pradesh issued the Andhra Pradesh Tyres and Tubes Dealers' Licensing Order, 1973. The respondents, who are dealers in tyres and tubes, challenged the validity of the Order on the ground that the State Government had no power to issue an Order with regard to tyres and tubes which were declared by the Central Government to be essential commodities after the delegation of powers to the State Government. The High Court struck down the Order.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court.
 ^ 
 HELD : There is nothing in s. 5 to limit the power of delegation in favour of the State Government only to the commodities specified in s. 2(a)(i) to (x) or to those commodities declared essential under s. 2(a)(xi) up to the date of delegation. Delegation under s. 5 is a general delegation and will enure in favour of exercise of power by the State Government with respect to commodities declared essential by the Central Government from time to time under s. 2(a)(xi) even subsequent to the delegation. It is not necessary that every time the Central Government declares an essential commodity, it has also to pass an order of delegation with regard to that commodity. It will be sufficient in law if on the date the State Government duly empowered under s. 5, makes notification under s. 3 with regard to an essential commodity within the meaning of s.
 2(a) including the residuary cl. (xi) thereof. [425D- G]
