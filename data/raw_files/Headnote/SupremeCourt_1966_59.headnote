 A lease in perpetuity in respect of certain lands belonging to a ghatwali estate situated in the area of present West Bengal was granted in 1873 of the predecessors-in-interest of the appellant for the purpose of erecting dwelling houses. The lease was executed on behalf of the Estate, which was under the management of the Court of Wards, by the Deputy Commissioner of Santal Pargana. In 1952 the lease was challenged by the Ghatwal as being void. According to the Bengal Ghatwali Lands Act 1859 (Act V of 1859) such a lease could be executed by the Court of Wards for certain specified purposes which included the erection of dwelling houses. Under the Court of Wards Act 1870 (Act IV of 1870) the Court of Wards could grant such a lease with the sanction of the Board of Revenue. The trial court held that the lease was void as it was not sanctioned by the Board of Revenue. The High Court held that the case must be decided on the provisions of Act V of 1859 which was a special Act overriding the general Act i.e., Act IV of 1870. According to the High Court the lease was void under Act V of 1859 because it was not executed by the Court of Wards. Even under Act IV of 1870 it was void for want of sanction of the Board of Revenue. In appeal to this Court, HELD : The lease was valid.
 (i) The Bengal Ghatwali Lands Act, 1859 was a special Act dealing with ghatwali lands. The Court of Wards Act, 1870 was a general enactment. On the principle generalia specialibus non derogant the provisions of the former Act in respect of leases of ghatwali lands would prevail over the provisions of the latter Act regarding lease of land under the management of the Court of Wards. [669 B-C] (ii) The lease in question was for the purpose of raising dwelling houses and thus one of the conditions in s. 2 of the Act of 1859 was satisfied. The other condition that the lease must be executed by the Court of Wards was also satisfied in the case inasmuch as under s. 114 of the Indian Evidence Act the official act of execution of the lease by the Deputy Commissioner must be presumed to have been regularly performed i.e., with due authority from the Court of Wards. [669 G, H] (iii) Even on the footing that the Court of Wards Act, 1870 was applicable to the case, the lease could not be said to be void. A combined reading of ss. 8, 9 and 13 of the said Act showed that the Collector (or Deputy Commissioner, since the terms are synonymous) could grant a lease of land in the management of the Court of Wards in his district; he could grant a lease in perpetuity with the sanction of the Board of Revenue. In the present case it could be presumed under s. 114 of the Evidence Act that the sanction of the Board of Revenue was duly obtained. [670 D] 663 664
