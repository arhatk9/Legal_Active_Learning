 The assessee was a Hindu undivided family. Three members of he family namely, S and his two sons were shareholders in a private limited company which was not a company in which the public were substantially interested within the meaning of s. 23A of the Income-tax Act, 1922. the account years 'relevant to the assessment years 1955-56, and 1956-57 the company advanced certain loans to the aforesaid Hindu undivided family The question arose whether these loans could be considered as 'dividend' within the meaning of that expression in s. 2(6A)(e) of the Act. The Income-tax Appellate Tribunal found as a fact that the loans in question had been granted to the H.U.F. It further held that the loans advanced to the H.U.F. could not be considered as loans advanced to the 'shareholders' within the meaning of s. 2(6A) (e). The High Court in reference upheld the view taken by the Tribunal. In appeal to this Court by the Revenue, 
HELD : It is well settled that an HUF cannot be a shareholder of a company, The shareholder of a company is the individual who is registered as the shareholder in the books of the company. The H.U.F., the assessee in the present case, was not registered as a shareholder in bocks of the company nor could it have been so registered. Hence, there was no gainsaying the fact that the H.U.F. was not the shareholder of the company. [1081 B-C] Section 2(6A) (e) gives an artificial definition of 'dividend'. It does not take in dividend actually declared or received. The dividend taken note of by that provision is a 'deemed dividend and not a real dividend. The loan granted to a shareholder has to be returned to the company.
 It does not become the income of the shareholder. For certain purposes the legislature has deemed, such a loan as 'dividend'. Hence s. 2(6A)(e) must necessarily receive a strict construction. When s. 2(6A)(e) speaks of 'shareholders' it refers to the registered shareholder and not to the beneficial owner. The HUF cannot be considered as a shareholder either under s. 2(6A)(e) or under s. 23A or s. 16(2) read with s. 18(5) of the Act. Hence a loan given to an HUF cannot be considered as a loan advanced to a 'shareholder' of a company [1081 D-E] In the present case since no loans were advanced to the shareholder., .s. 2(6A)(e) was inapplicable. The appeal is dismissed. [1083 B] Howrah Trading Co. Ltd. v. C.I.T., Central Calcutta, 36 I.T.R. 215 and C.I.T., Bombay City II v. Shakuntala & Ors., 43 I.T.R. 352, relied on.
