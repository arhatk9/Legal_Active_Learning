 In the winding up proceedings of a company in liquidation, the official liquidator and a share-holder sought permission of the High Court for the sale of immovable and movable properties and actionable claims of the company. The company Judge appointed commissioners for the sale in accordance with the terms and conditions mentioned in his order. One of the conditions was that the proclamation of sale was to be advertised twice in each of 5 leading daily newspapers. The commissioners had the proclamation published in only 4 dailies and it was only in two of them that there were two insertions. No offer having been received, the time fixed was extended when the appellant made his offer as the sole offeror. The commissioners applied to the Judge for confirmation of sale, but before the sale in favour of the appellant was confirmed another person made an offer of a larger amount complaining that he could not make the offer earlier as there was no adequate publicity. The Judge thereupon arranged an open bid in the Court itself on that very day, as between the appellant and the now offeror. The appellant became the highest bidder and the appellant was directed to pay the balance of amount by a particular date, but again, before the sale in his favour could be confirmed, a third person made an application offering a still large amount, complaining of the want of adequate publicity and advertisement of the sale. The.Judge rejected the application and confirmed the sale in favour of the appellant. In appeal, the Letters Patent Bench set aside the order of the single Judge and directed that he should take fresh steps for sale of the property either by calling for sealed tenders or by auction in accordance with law.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : When the acceptance of an offer by the commissioner is subject to confirmation by the court, the,offeror does not by mere acceptance get any vested right in the property and be cannot demand automatic confirmation of his offer.
 It is the duty of the court to satisfy itself that having regard to the market value of the property the price offered is reasonable, even though there is no suggestion of irregularity or fraud. Otherwise, the act of confirmation of the sale would not be a proper exercise of judicial discretion. But once the court comes to the conclusion that the price offered is adequate, no subsequent higher offer can constitute a valid around for refusing confirmation of the sale or offer already received. [5 b-F; 6 A-B] In the present case, the publicity was not as wide as originally proposed. Therefore, the single Judge was right in refusing to confirm the first offer of the appellant, and holding an auction. But he erred in confining the auction to two persons only. The auction was no doubt conducted in a public place but it was not open to the general public, 2 nor was it held after due publicity. Therefore, the sale was not a public sale, which implies, a sale after giving notice to the public with liberty to the public to participate. Rule 273 of the Companies (Court) Rules, pro- vides that all sales shall be made by public auction, or by inviting sealed tenders, or in such manner as the Judge may direct. Since there was want of publicity and there was lack of opportunity to the public to take part in the auction, and there was inherent prejudice in the method adopted by the Judge, the acceptance of the appellant's bid by the Judge was not a sound exercise of discretion and the Division Bench was right in directing a fresh sale.
