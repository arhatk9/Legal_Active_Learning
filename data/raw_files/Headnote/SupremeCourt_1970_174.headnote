 The appellant, a breeder of horses imported into India a mare "Jury Maid", for purpose of breeding. The customs authorities objected on the ground that the mare had been imported in contravention of the provisions of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act. 1947 and confiscated the mare.
 On the questions, (i) whether the mare was a "pet animal" within the meaning of that expression in the notification dated January 2, 1961 issued by the Government and therefore exempt as personal baggage acd (ii) whether the expression "prohibition" contained in s. 111(d) of the Customs Act, 1962 includes prohibition of imports Coupled with it power to permit importation under certain conditions, 
HELD : (i) The mare "Jury Maid" was not a 'pet animal'. A pet is "any animal tamed and fondled". There was no evidence to show that jury maid was tamed or treated with fondness by the appellant. He obtained that animal on lease for certain specified purpose and in respect of that animal he had only a business connection.
 (ii)The expression "any prohibition" in s. 111 (d) of the Customs Act, 1962, includes restrictions. Merely because s.
 3 of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, 1947, uses three different expressions "prohibiting", 'restricting" cr "otherwise controlling," the amplitude of the word any prohibition in s. 111 (d) of the Act cannot be cut down.
 "Any prohibition" means every prohibition and restriction is one type of prohibition. From item (1) of Sch. I Part IV to Import Control Order. 1955, it is clear that import of living animals of all sorts is prohibited. But Certain exceptions art, provided for. But none the less the prohi- bition continues.
