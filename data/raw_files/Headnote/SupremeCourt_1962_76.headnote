 By a deed February 19, 1948 the respondent sold his house to the appellant in consideration of discharging liability to repay alone of Rs, 1500/- borrowed by the respondent. Two other documents relating to the house were executed on the same day II) a deed by the appellant agreeing to reconvey the house if the respondent paid Rs. 1500/- in these two years ; (2) a rent note by the respondent and his father agreeing to pay Rs. 26-4-0 per mensem as rent for occupation of the house. Under the of reconveyance the exercise of the right to reconveyance was subject to two conditions, firstly, that the right must be exercised within 2 years and secondly, that the rent payable under the rent note should not remain in arrears for more than six months at any time.
 When that respondent demanded specific performance of the agreement of reconveyance, the first condition was fulfilled but the second was not. The suit for specific performance of the agreement of reconveyance was dismissed, for in the view of the trial court the conditions of the agreement had not been strictly complied with, and the agreement stood cancelled. The High Court in second appeal reversed the decree and ordered specific performance.
 Held, that the covenant for reconveyance was in the nature of a concession granted by the purchaser.
 Held, further that the concession being subject to certain conditions were not fulfilled the right to demand recon- veyance could not be enforced. The court had no equitable jurisdiction to relieve against the extinction of the right to demand reconveyence.
