 The appellant, a medical practitioner who also maintained a dispensary was prosecuted for non-maintenance of a register of employees as required by r. 23(1) of the rules made under the Bombay Shops and Establishments Act, 1948. He contended that he could not be prosecuted because his dispensary was not a 'commercial establishment' as defined in s. 2(4) of the Act. He was acquitted by the trial magistrate but the High Court, on appeal by the State convicted him. In appeal by special leave to this Court, 
HELD : Section 2(4) has used words of very wide import and' grammatically it may even include the consulting room where a doctor examines his patients with the help of a solitary nurse or attendant. But the language of s. 2(4) must be construed on the principle noscitur a sociis. i.e. when two or more words susceptible of analogous meaning are coupled together the words take their colour from each other and the more general are restricted to 'a sense analogous to less general. [240 A--C] The words 'commercial establishment' and 'profession' in s.
 2(4) are used along with the words 'business 'and trade' and must therefore be restricted to activity analogous to business or trade. Professional activity cannot be treated as within the definition of s. 2(4) unless it is organised as trade and business are organised i.e. the activity as systematically or habitually undertaken for rendering material services to the community at large or a part of such community with the help of the employees and such an activity generally involves cooperation of the employer and the employees. [244 C-E] Tested in the light of these principles the appellant did not fall within. the purview of the Act and his conviction was illegal.
