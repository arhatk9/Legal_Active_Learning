 The appellant which runs a sugar factory, treated the retaining allowance paid to the workmen during the off- season as part of their wages for the purpose of the Employees' Provident Fund Act, 1972, but not for the purpose of the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965. On a reference of an industrial dispute, the Industrial Court, Gujarat made an award holding that the allowance cannot be included in wages or remuneration for the purpose of calculation of bonus. The Gujarat High Court set aside the award in writ petition and held that the allowance fell within the definition of the expression `salary or wage' in s. 2(21) of the Act. The appellant sought special leave to appeal under Art. 136 of the Constitution.
 Dismissing the special leave petition, the Court.
 ^ 
 HELD : The retaining allowance paid to the employees during the off-season in the sugar industry partakes the nature of deferred wages on a lower scale and falls within the definition of the expression `salary or wage' within the meaning of s.2(21) of the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965 and, therefore, must be taken into account for the purpose of calculation of bonus payable under s.10 of the Act. The definition of the expression `salary or wage' as given in s.2(21) of the Act is wide enough to cover the retaining allowance granted to the workmen during the off-season. The retaining allowance is nothing but remuneration correlated to service and it would be a misnomer to call it an allowance. It does not fall within the purview of clause (i) of the exclusionary clause of s.2(21) but comes within the substantive part of the definition of `salary or wage' in s.
 2(21) of the Act. [741A-D]
