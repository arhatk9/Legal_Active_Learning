 A suit by the respondents for a declaration that certain lands were communal lands was decreed by the High Court in appeal. In appeal to this Court, it was contended that :
 (1) the Collector held under s. 20A of the Madras Estates Land Act, 1908, that the lands were no longer required for the purpose for which they were originally intended; (2) the first appellant had been in possession of the lands after obtaining a grant from the Zamindar; (3) after the abolition of Estate under the Estates Abolition Act, 1948, the lands were granted to him by the Estates Manager; (4) during the pendency of the suit, the Assistant Settlement Officer granted a patta to him under s. 1 1 of the Abolition Act;
 (5) the decision of the Assistant Settlement Officer was final under s. 56 of the Abolition Act(6) the Civil Court had no jurisdiction under s. 189(1) of the Estates Land Act;
 and (7) that under s. 3 of the Abolition Act, the communal rights were abolished.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) Under s. 20A of the Estates Land Act. before the Collector can order diversion of the use of any communal land, he should first declare that the land is no longer required for any of the purposes referred to in s. 3 (16) (a) and (b), then direct by order in writing that the land be used for any other specified communal purpose, and if it is not so required, then it may be converted into ryotwari land or landholder's ryoti land according as the reversionary right vested in the Government or the landholder. In the present case, the Collector, apart from making the order that the lands were no longer 'required for the original purpose, did not make any other order in writing. [178 G-H; 179 A-B] (2) In view of ss. 20 and 20A of the Estates Land Act, the Zamindar did not have any right to deal with the communal lands. [176 D-E] (3) The order of the Estates Manager is ineffective because it proceeded on the erroneous assumption that the lands had already been converted into ryotwari lands. [179 C-D] (4) The lands in dispute are not lanka lands, nor were they declared to be ryoti lands either under the Abolition Act or the Estates Land Act. The Assistant Settlement Officer has no power to convert communal land into ryoti land.
 Therefore, he has no competence under s. 11 of the Abolition Act to grant, the ryotwari patta. [18OD-E] Valathar Moopananri v. Board of Revenue 1966 (I) M. L. J.
 approved.
 173 (5) Under s. 56 of the Abolition Act, the decision of the Settlement Officer is made final only with respect to matters referred to in s. 56(1) but the question whether the lands in dispute continued to be communal lands does not fall within its scope. [181 B-C] (6) Under s. 189(1) of the Estates Land Act the jurisdiction of the civil courts is taken away only in respect of suits or applications of the nature specified in Parts A and B of the Schedule to the Act. Item 5 of Part B of the Schedule refers to a decision of the Collector under s. 20A(1), but, in the present case, there is no such order in writing. [181 F-G] (7) Under s. 3 of the Abolition Act, the lands vest in the Government, but the rights of the community over the lands were not taken away. Under the Act, only the rights created by the principal or other land holder were abrogated, but the rights of the community over the lands were not such rights. [182D-E]
