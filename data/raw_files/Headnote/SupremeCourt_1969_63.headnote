 The U.P. (Temporary) Control of Rent & Eviction Act, 1947, restricts the rights of landlords to institute suits for eviction of their tenants to cases covered by s. 3 (1) (a) to (g) except with the permission of the District Magistrate. The District Magistrates order granting the permission is expressly made subject to any order by the Commissioner under s. 3(2) provided the aggreived party applies within 30 days to the Commissioner to revise the order. The Commissioner must ordinarily dispose of the application within six weeks. Section 7-F of the Act confers revisionary powers on-the State Government in any case granting or refusing to grant permission, and under s.
 3(4) the order of the Commissioner under s. 3 (3) is to be final subject to the order under s. 7-F. The respondent- landlord obtained permission of the District Magistrate to file a suit for eviction of the appellant-tenant under s.
 3(1) of the Act. The tenant applied to the Commissioner under s. 3(2) and the Commissioner dismissed the application. The tenant then filed a further revision application to the State Government under s. 7-F. Before the disposal of the last revision application, the landlord filed a suit for ejectment in pursuance of the permission given by the Commissioner. Thereafter the State Coovernment set aside the order of the Commissioner and revoked the permission granted to the landlord. On the question whether the suit filed, after obtaining the permission of the Commissioner became incompetent on the making of an order by the State Government under s. 7-F cancelling the permission to sue given by the Commissioner, this Court, 
HELD : The suit validly instituted after obtaining permission as required by s. 3 did not cease to be maintainable even if the State Government thereafter revoked the permission granted.
 Under sub-s. (1) of s. 3 the maintainability of a suit on grounds other than those mentioned in cls. (a) to (g) is made expressly 'subject to an order under sub-s. (3). The Legislature did not provide that the right to file a suit would be subject to or dependent upon an order under s. 7-F in the same way as an order under s. 3(3). [898 A] When a landlord files a suit for eviction only with the permission of the District Magistrate, he is conscious of the fact that such permission may be revoked by the Commissioner at the instance of the tenant within ten weeks of its institution. But 'so far as the revisional powers of the State Goverment are concerned, there is no time limit fixed either for application by an aggrieved party or for the disposal thereof. It may be made at any time and the State Government is further authorised by this section (s.
 7-F) to act suo motu. In such a state of affairs, it cannot be held that the landlord must wait indefinitely and find out whether the 895 permission granted to him will be upheld by the State Government should the tenant make an application for revision of the order of the Commissioner. [898 C] Apart from the above consideration, the words in s. 7-F indicate that the State Government can only exercise its Jurisdiction to revise the order of the Commissioner before the actual institution of the suit. The language of s. 7-F does not seem to be aimed at invalidating a suit already instituted and can only operate at a stage before the landlord launches his proceedings. There is nothing in sub- s. (4) of s. 3 read with s. 7-F to show that the landlord should wait till the powers of the revising. authorities have been exhausted. If the Legislature had so intended, it could have used suitable words in sub-s. (1) of s. 3 to indicate that the grant of permission by the District Magistrate would also be subject to an order under s. 7-F.
 [898 F] The Legislature had provided for a decree for eviction of a tenant passed before the commencement of the Act liable to be rendered inexecutable unless it was based on any of the grounds mentioned in sub-s. (3). The Legislature might, if so advised, have provided for a similar result in a case where the State Government had revoked the permission to sue granted by the Commissioner. It would make a mockery of the judicial process if it were to be held on the language of the sections as they stood,. that irrespective of a decree being passed by the trial court being upheld in appeal by the High Court or by this Court, the order of the State Government would nullify all proceedings. Once the jurisdiction under s. 16 was properly exercised the Court cannot examine the propriety of the order made thereunder.
