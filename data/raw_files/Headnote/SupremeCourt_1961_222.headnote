 The respondents obtained a lease for plucking tendu leaves from the Government of Vindhya Pradesh. Later, the Government cancelled the lease and sought to recover the balance of the lease money. The respondents filed a suit for damages and for injunction restraining the Government from recovering the balance of the lease money and impleaded the State of Vindhya Pradesh as the defendant. They contended that the suit was incompetent as the proper defendant was the Union of India and not the State of Vindhya Pradesh.
 Held, that the State of Vindhya Pradesh was the proper defendant to be sued and that the suit was properly filed.
 Under s. 3 (58 of the General Clauses Act "State" meant inter alia a Part C State and under Art. 239 (1) the Part C State was administered by a Lieutenant Governor if the President so ordered. Thus Part C States had a separate existence and were not merged with the Central Government.
 Though 'State Government' was defined by s. 3(60) ibid in relation to a Part C State as the Central Government the definition of 'Central Government' in relation to the administration of a Part C State meant the Lieutenant Governor within the scope of the authority under Art. 239 and thus the State Government. Thus cl. (b) of s. 79 applied and not cl. (a).
