 Torts: Vicarious Liability--Death of child due to beat- ing by Police--State directed to pay compensation to mother.
 In the Writ Petitions filed on behalf of two women, who were severely beaten by the alleged landlord, in collusion with the local police, in their attempts to get the rooms occupied by them vacated, the petitioners prayed for direc- tions to the respondents to pay exemplary charges to one of the women for the death of her son but to injuries inflicted on him by the police.
 It was alleged that the landlord's son, accompanied by the Station House Officer and other police personnel severe- ly beat the woman, and her nine year old son, who was cling- ing to her to protect her, as a result of which the child suffered severe injuries and died in the hospital.
 A medico-legal case was registered. The case was inves- tigated by the Inspector of Crime Branch, who submitted his report according to which there was a high level conspiracy of the police with the accused in getting the rooms occupied by the women vacated and opposed grant of bail as it was a clear case under Section 302/120B I.P.C.
 A counter-affidavit on behalf of Respondent No. 1 was filed stating that the Station House Officer himself took part in the beatings and the minor child was also not spared and the child sustained severe injury in the left leg, which was opined as a grievous one, and that the injuries inflict- ed on the child caused fever and pneumonitis, resulting in the death of the child, and a case under Sections 308/34 I.P.C. which was later altered to 304/34 I.P.C. was regis- tered and one of the accused arrested.
 489 Disposing of the Writ Petitions, this Court, 
 HELD: 1.1 An action for damages lies for bodily harm which includes battery, assault, false imprisonment, physi- cal injuries and death. In cases of assault, battery and false imprisonment, the damages are large and represent a solatium for the mental pain, distress, indignity, loss of liberty and death. [494E] 
 1.2 It is well settled that the State is responsible for the tortious acts of its employees. [494F] In the instant case, it is apparent, from the report of the Inspector of the Crime Branch and the counter-affidavit fried on behalf of the Commissioner of Police and also from the fact that the prosecution has been launched in connec- tion with death of the child that the child was done to death on account of the beating and assault by the agency of the sovereign power acting in violation and excess of the power vested in such agency. The mother of the child is, therefore, entitled to get compensation from respondent No.
 2, which is liable for payment of compensation for the death of the child due to beating by the Police officials con- cerned. It is, therefore, just and proper to direct respond- ent No. 2 to pay compensation to the mother of the deceased child, a sum of Rs.75,000. [494C-D; 495F] [Respondent No. 2 may take appropriate steps for recov- ery of the amount paid as compensation or part thereof from the officers, who will be found responsible, if they are so advised. As the Police Officers are not parties before the Court, any observation made by the Court in justification of this order shall not have any bearing in any proceedings specially criminal prosecution pending against the police officials in connection with the death of the child.
