 The respondent made an application under s. 33A of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, which, inter alia, stated that there was no reason for retrenchment on account of the closure of a ration shop, and that at any rate he was longer in service than others who had been retained, and, therefore, the principle of " last come, first go " had been violated. The Tribunal dismissed the application whereupon the respondent appealed to the Appellate Tribunal which allowed the appeal and refused permission to retrench.
 The Appellant Company was granted special leave to appeal only on the limited question as to whether an order of re- instatement can be made on an application under s. 33A of the Act.
 Held, that the complaint under S. 33A of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, is as good as a reference under s. 10 of the Act and the Tribunal has all the powers to deal with it as it would have in dealing with a reference under s. 10 of the Act and it is open to the Tribunal in proper case to order reinstatement.
