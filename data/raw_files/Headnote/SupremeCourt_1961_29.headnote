 Payment of bonus being based on the contribution of workmen to the profits of the company, that contribution, it is well settled, has to be taken into consideration as a whole and it is not relevant to enquire which class or section of the workmen contributed how much to the profits.

 Looked at from that stand-point, it is not fair, in the absence of any overriding consideration, to make a distinction as to the rate of bonus payable to different classes of workmen such as clerks and operatives, for it is ordinarily impossible to say which class contributed more to the prosperity of the industry than another.
 Nor can it be laid down as an inflexible rule that the clerical and the labour staff must always be paid at the same rate. The Industrial Tribunals must have wide discretion in the matter, which this Court would be reluctant to interfere with unless arbitrarily exercised.
 Consequently, where the Industrial Tribunal, on a full con- sideration of the difference in the wage scales of labour and the clerical staff, came to the conclusion that it would be improper to award lower rate of bonus to the clerical staff who belonged to the middle class and suffered more than the labour staff from the rise of price, and there was nothing to show that this was not so, the decision of the Tribunal was reasonable and must be upheld.
