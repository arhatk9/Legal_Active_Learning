 To nationalise the Saharanpur - Shahdara - Delhi route a draft scheme dated 26 th February, 1959 was published, and the approved scheme published on September 29, 1959 was quashed by the high Court by judgments dated October 31, 1961 and February 7, 1962 as against 50 operators and being upheld against other 50 operators. The State Govt. was permitted to given fresh hearing to the 50 objectors, on the basis of the original proposal which was upheld in Jeewan Nath Bahl & Ors. v. State of U.P.
 Out of the 50 operators some filed successive suits and obtained 379 injuction from different courts scuttling the hearing and keeping it pending for well over 25 years.
 A writ petition was filed in this Court assailing, that the delay in approving the scheme amounts to an abuse of process of law, and that public interest thereby suffered, and the Court held in Shri Chand etc. v. Govt. of U.P. & Ors., [1985] Suppl. 2 SCR 688 that the delay of 26 years in disposing of the objections resulted in violation of Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution, and accordingly quashed the draft scheme dated February 26, 1959. The Government was directed to frame the scheme afresh, if necessary.
 Pursuant thereto the U.P. State Road Corporation published the draft scheme on February 13, 1986. While it was pending the Motor Vehicles Act 59 of 1988 came into force with effect from July 1, 1989. Bulandshahr to Delhi route was also nationalised in the approved scheme published in the State Gazette dated September 27, 1986.
 After the 1988 Act came into force, the respondents applied for and were granted permits for Saharanpur to Ghaziabad via Shahdara routes etc.
 The appellants filed the writ petitions in the High Court and the same were dismissed by judgment dated July 23, 1990. The draft scheme published in 1986 was held by the hearing authority to have been lapsed by operation of Section 100(4) of the Act.
 In the writ petition filed by the S.T.U. the High Court by its judgment dated March 16, 1990 held that the draft scheme stood lapsed within one year from the date of the publication of the draft scheme, and accordingly upheld the order of the hearing authority. S.L.P. No. 6300/91 was filed against this judgment.
 Special Leave Petition Nos. 9701/90, 9702/90 and 2083/91 were filed against the High Court's judgment dismissing the writ petitions in which grant of permits under Section 80 of the Motor Vehicles Act on the Muzaffarnagar - Chausana; Ghaziabad to Shahdra. Saharanpur to Ghaziabad covered and partly overlapping nationalised routes were questioned.
 On the questions : (1) what is the effect of Shri Chand etc. v. Govt.
 380 of U.P. over Jeevan Nath Bahl & Ors. v. State of U.P. and (2) whether the draft scheme dated February 13, 1986 stood lapsed under Section 100(4) of the Act.
 Granting special leave and allowing the appeals the Court, Held : 1(a) Consistent law laid down by this Court is that draft scheme under Section 68-C and approved under Section 68-D of Chapter IVA of the Repealed Act (Chapter VI of the Act), is a law and it has overriding effect over Chapter IV of the repealed Act (Chapter V of the Act). It operates against everyone unless it is modified. It excludes private operators from the area or route or a portion thereof covered under the scheme except to the extent excluded under that scheme itself. The right of private operators to apply for and to obtain permits under Chapter IV of the repealed Act (Chapter V of the Act) has been frozen and prohibited. [389B-C] (b) The nationalisation of Saharanpur - Shahdara - Delhi route approved and published on September 29, 1959 became final and to that extent it cannot be said to have been quashed by this Court in Sri Chand's case. The approved scheme is law operating against everyone except 50 objectors/operators and the writ issued by this Court cannot have the effect of annuling the law. What was quashed and issue of fresh draft scheme pursuant thereto, relate to only of original draft scheme operative against 50 objectors/operators and no more. Even no principle, the decision of a Bench of two Judges cannot have the effect of overruling the decision of a Bench of three Judges. The fresh draft scheme under Section 68-C dated February 13, 1986 must, therefore, be construed to be only in relation to 50 existing operators as per the directions that ultimately emerged in Jeevan Nath Bahl's case.

State of U.P. & Ors., [1985] Suppl. 3 SCR 661; H.C. Narayanappa & Ors. v. State of Mysore & Ors., [1960] INSC 93; [1960] 3 SCR 742; Nehru Motor Transport Co-op. Soc. & Ors.
 V. State of Rajasthan & Ors.,[1964] 1 SCR 220 and S. Abdul Khader Saheb v. Mysore Revenue Appellate Tribunal & Ors., [1972] INSC 273; [1973] 1 SCC 357, referred to.
 2(a) On harmonious construction of ss.217(2)(e) and 100(4) of the Act, the draft scheme published under s. 68-C of the Repealed Act would 381 stand lapsed only if it is not approved within one year from the date when the Act came into force i.e. with effect from July 1, 1989 by which date it was pending before the hearing authority and one year had not expired. The hearing authority, therefore, wrongly concluded that the draft scheme stood lapsed. The High Court also equally committed illegality following its earlier view which stood overruled by this court in Krishana Kumar's case. The view of the High Court and the hearing authority is therefore clearly illegal. [389H-390B] Krishna Kumar v. State of Rajasthan & Ors., [1991] 4 SCC 258, referred to.
 (b) The nationalisation of Saharanpur - Shahdara - Delhi route by publication of the approved scheme on September 29, 1959 is operating to the total exclusion of every private operator except U.P. State Road Transport Corporation and 50 operators including the appellants whose objection were upheld by the High Court in the first instance and merged in the judgment of this Court in Jeevan Nath Bahl's case. [390C] (c) Under Section 80 of the Act no private operator has right to apply for and obtain permits to ply the stage carriages on the approved or notified route/routes or areas or portion thereof. The grant of permits to the private operators on the respective routes or part, or portion thereof to provide transport service is therefore clearly illegal and without jurisdiction. [390E] Mithlesh Garg & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors., [1991] INSC 307; [1992] 1 SCC 168, referred to.
 (d) By operation of Section 98 of the Act, Chapter VI overrides Chapter V and other law and shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in Chapter V or any other law for the time being inforce or any instrument having effect by virtue of such law. The result is that even under the Act existing scheme under the repealed Act or made under Chapter VI of the Act shall have over-riding effect on Chapter V notwithstanding any right given to private operators in Chapter V of the Act. No corridor protection to private operators is permissible.
 [390G-391A] (e) The 50 operators including the appellants/private operators have been running their stage carriage by blatant abuse of the process of the 382 court by delaying the hearing as directed in Jeevan Nath Bahl's case and the High Court earlier thereto. As a fact, on the expiry of the initial period of grant after September 29, 1959 they lost the right to obtain renewal or to ply their vehicles, as this court declared the scheme to be operative. However, by sheer abuse of the process of law they are continuing to ply their vehicles pending hearing of the objections. [391D] (f) While exercising its jurisdiction this Court would do complete justice and neutralise the unfair advantage gained by the 50 operators including the appellant in dragging the litigation to run the stage carriages on the approved route on area or portion thereof and forfeited their right to hearing of the objections filed by them to the draft scheme dated February 26, 1959. [391F] (g) Moreover, since this court in Jeevan Nath Bahl's case upheld the approved scheme and held to be operative the hearing of objections would be a procedural formality with no tangible result. Therefore, the objection outlived their purpose. They are, therefore, not entitled to any hearing before the hearing authority. [391G-H] Grindlays Bank Ltd. v. Income Tax Officer & Ors., [1980] INSC 3; [1980] 2 SCC 191, referred to.
 
 3. The grant of permits to all the respondents/private operators and respondents Nos. 7 to 28 in S.L.P. No. 9701/90 under Section 80 of the Act or any others on the respective routes, parts or portions of the nationalised routes of February 13, 1986 draft scheme are quashed. The hearing authority shall lodge the objections of the 50 operators including the appellants in the appeals. The competent authority shall approve the drafts scheme of 1986 within a period of 30 days and publish the approved scheme in the gazette. The permits granted to the 50 operators or any others shall stand cancelled from that date, if not having expired in the meanwhile. No permits shall be renewed.
 Action should be taken by respondents 3 to 4 in S.L.P. No.
 9701/90 to see that all the permits granted to the 50 operators including the appellants are seized and cancelled.
 The U.P. State Transport Corporation shall obtain the required additional permits, if need be, and put the stage carriages on the routes to provide transport service to the travelling public immediately on publication of the approved draft scheme in the State Gazette. [392A-D] 383
