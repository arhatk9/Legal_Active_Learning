 The appellant is assessed to income tax in the status of an individual. He runs a printing press and a daily language newspaper. For the year 1962-63, he filed a return of income showing a loss. The Income-tax Officer discovered that various remittances from abroad had been received by the assessee as Vice-President of the India Gospel Mission.
 On an enquiry he found that a major part of the funds credited to the account maintained by the assessee in the name of the Mission had been turned over to the newspaper and a sizeable part of it had been utilised for his household expenses. He rejected the claim of the assessee that the newspaper had been taken over by the Mission or that the drawings from the account, on which no interest had been charged, constituted loans taken by him in his individual capacity to be repaid in subsequent years, and being of the view that the remittances had been made to the assessee entirely because of his business and personal activities and that the funds of the Mission and the newspaper had all been mixed up and treated together as one unit, and the assessee had been operating upon all these funds as the individual owner of both the newspaper and the funds, held that the entire receipts of cash from abroad were relatable to the business activities of the assessee and were assessable to tax as his income.
 The Appellate Assistant Commissioner allowing the assessee's appeal observed that the amounts withdrawn from the funds were merely loans repayable by the assessee to the Mission, without however recording any definite finding on that question or as to whether the remittances constituted income of the assessee.
 875 The Appellate Tribunal confirmed this order in appeal by the Revenue holding that the receipts did not constitute income of the assessee.
 The High Court, following its decision in C.I.T. v. Dr.
 K. George Thomas, [1974] 94 I.T.R., 11, answered the Reference in favour of the Revenue and against the assessee holding that the amount was assessable as the income of the assessee.
 Similar questions were raised in Appeal Nos. 2918 and 2919 of 1977 in respect of the assessment years 1963-64 and 1964-65 respectively, and Appeal No. 2917 of 1977 assailed the legality and correctness of the levy of penalty for not having submitted a return for the assessment year 1962-63, but no separate submissions were made in those appeals.
 Dismissing the appeals by certificate, the Court, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The receipts cannot be regarded as of casual and non-recurring nature not arising from the assessee's business or the exercise of his profession or occupation within the meaning of s. 10(3) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 for the reasons set forth in Dr. K. George Thomas v. C.I.T.
 Kerala, [1985] 156 I.T.R. 412 and are assessable to tax as the assessee's income. [879 G-H] P. Krishna Menon v. Commissioner of Income-tax, [1959 35 I.T.R. 48, referred to.
 The distinction sought to be drawn between the case for the assessment year 1960-61 and 1961-62 and the case for the assessment year 1962-63 on the factum that in the former the remittances were entered in the personal name of the assessee while in the latter the remittances have been shown in a separate account standing in the name of the India Gospel Mission is wholly without substance. [879 D-E] In the instant case, the assessee had treated both the accounts as his personal accounts from which heavy drawings were made from time to time entirely for his personal objectives. The drawings from the account in the name of the Mission did not constitute loans. The assessee had treated that account as an intimate part of his personal funds. [879 E-G] 876
