 The validity of the appointment of respondents 2 to 6 as District judges was challenged in a petition filed by the appellant under Art. 226 of the Constitution of India before the High Court of Punjab, on the ground, inter alia, that the appointment was made in contravention of Art. 233(2) of the Constitution of India which lays down that "a person not already in the service of the Union or of the State shall only be eligible to be appointed a district judge if he has been for not less than seven years an advocate or a pleader..." The respondents had been enrolled as advocates of the Lahore High Court on various dates between 1933 and 1940, and while respondents 2, 4 and 5 had their names on the roll of advocates of the Punjab High Court and were practising as advocates at the time they were appointed as District Judges in 1950 and 1952, respondents 3 and 6 did not have their names factually on the roll when they were appointed as District judges in 1957 and 1958. Respondent 6 had his name so enrolled after his appointment.
 Under a notification dated September 28, 1948, ss. 3 to 16 of the Bar Councils Act, 1926, came into force in respect of the East Punjab High Court, by virtue of which a Bar Council was constituted and a roll of advocates had to be prepared and maintained by the High Court in accordance with s. 8 of the Act. The proviso to sub-s. (2) of S. 8 of the Act required them to deposit a fee of Rs. 10 payable to the Bar Council. The appellant's contention was that after' the partition of the country, which led to the establishment of a separate High Court for the province of East Punjab the Punjab High Court was established only on August 15 1947, under the High Courts (Punjab) Order, 1947, and as the respondents did not have seven years' standing as advocates with reference to their right of practice in a court in India after that date, they did not fulfil the requirements of Art. 233(2) When they were appointed as District Judges and, therefore, their appointments were constitutionally invalid. The question was whether the period of seven years referred to in Art. 233(2) must be counted as the 875 standing of the advocate or pleader with reference to his right of practice in a court in the territory of India as defined in Art. of the Constitution, or whether any right of practice in a court Rat, which was in India before the partition of the country in 1947 but which was not in India since partition, could also be taken into consideration for the purpose of counting the period of seven years.
 Held, that under cl. (6) of the High Courts (Punjab) Order, 1947, read with s. 8(3) of the Bar Councils Act, 1926, an advocate of the Punjab High Court was entitled to count the period of his practice in the Lahore High Court for determining his standing at the Bar. Accordingly as respondents 2, 4 and 5 continued to be advocates of the Punjab High Court when they were appointed as District judges and had a standing of more than seven years when so appointed, they fulfilled the requirements of Art. 233(2) of the Constitution.
 Held, further, that the effect of cl. (6) of the High Courts (Punjab) Order, 1947, and s. 8(2)(a) of the Bar Councils Act, 1926, was that from August 15, 1947, to September 28, 1948, advocates who had been enrolled as advocates of the Lahore High Court were recognised as advocates entitled to practice in the Punjab High Court, and after September 28, 1948, they automatically came on the roll of advocates of the Punjab High Court, but had to pay a fee of Rs. 10 to the Bar Council. Consequently, respondents 3 and 6 who did not cease to be advocates at any time or stage after August 15, 1947, continued to be advocates of the Punjab High Court till they were appointed as District judges and had the necessary standing of seven years to be eligible under Art.
 233(2) of the Constitution.
