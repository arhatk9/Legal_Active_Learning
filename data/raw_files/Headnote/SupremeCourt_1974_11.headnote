 The appellant filed an election petition challenging the election of the respondent to the State legislative Assembly alleging that there was a substising contract, entered into by the respondent in the course of his trade and business, with the State Government, for the execution of works undertaken by the Government, and that therefore he was disqualified under s. 9A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. The High Court dismissed the petition holding that the contracts were not undertaken by the respondent in his individual capacity in the course of his trade and business but were on behalf of the Gram Panchayat of which he was the Naib Sarpanch, and also that the contracts bad been. fully carried out by the respondent long before the date of his nomination and that therefore, the Explanation to s. 9A was applicable and took his case out of the section. While the appeal was pending in this Court the State Legislative Assembly was dissolved under Art.
 174(2)(6) of the Constitution, The respondent raised the preliminary objection at the hearing of the appeal that in view of the dissolution of the assembly it was academic to decide whether or not the respondent was disqualified under the section.
 
HELD : The law relating to abatement of election petitions is exhaustively dealt with in Chap. VI of Part IV of the Act and since there is nothing in the Act 'which provides for abatement of election petitions when the legislature is dissolved the dissolution does not result in the abatement of an election petition. But the question in the present case is not whether the appeal has abated on the dissolution of the State Assembly, but whether in view of the dissolution of the State Assembly, it has become academic to decide the appeal. In the instant case, even if it is found that the respondent was disqualified under s. 9A it would have no.' practical consequence, because invalidation of his election after the dissolution of the State Assembly, unlike the case of invalidation for corrupt practice, would have no effect whatsoever. Therefore, the State Legislative assembly having been dissolved during the Pendency of the appeal it is now wholly academic to consider whether the respondent was disqualified under s. 9A at the date of his nomination and since that is the only ground on which the election of the respondent is challanged it would be futile to hear the appeal on merits.
