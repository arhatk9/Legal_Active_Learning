 The first respondent was appointed as Chief Minister of U.P.
 on October 18, 1970. His appointment was challenged on the ground that he was not a member of either house of legislature at the time of appointment. In appeal to this Court against the High Court's judgment dismissing the petition under Art. 226, 
HELD : (i) Clause (4) of Art. 164 must be interpreted in the context of Arts. 163 and 164 of the Constitution. Article 163(1) provides that "there shall be a Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister at the head to aid and advise the Governor in the exercise of his functions except in so far as he is by or under this Constitution required to exercise his functions or any of them in his discretion." Under cl.(1) of Art. 164 the Chief Minister has to be appointed by him on the advice of the Chief, Minister. They all hold office during the pleasure of the Governor. Clause' (1) does not provide any qualification for the person to be selected by the Governor as Chief Minister or minister. But cl. (2) makes it essential that the council of Ministers shall be collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly of the State. This is the only condition that the Constitution prescribes in this behalf. There is thus no reason why the plain words' of cl.(4) of Art. 164 should be cut down in any manner and confined to a case where a Minister loses for some reason his seat in the Legislature of the State. That this is the correct meaning to be given to Art 164(4) is supported by the proceedings of the Constituent Assembly and the position as it obtains in England, Australia and South Africa. [12GH, 3E].
 (ii) -If the Governor of a State appoints a Chief Minister and Council of Ministers none of whom are members of the State Legislature, and the Legislative Assembly of the State to whom the Council of Ministers would be responsible endorses this unlikely Council of Ministers, there is noth- ing in the Constitution which would make this appointment illegal. [3AB].
 (iii) There can be no difficulty in Ministers who are not members of the Legislature being present at the time of the Governor's address because by virtue of Art. 177 they would be entitled to be present at the meeting of the Legislature addressed by the Governor. [3C-D].
