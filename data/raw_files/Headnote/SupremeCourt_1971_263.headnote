 The assessee was a partner in a registered firm. The firm filed its income-tax return for the period ending 30-6-1949 under the Mysore Income-tax Act 1923 and an assessment was made thereunder. On 15-3-1950 the assessee filed his return in respect of his individual income including his share of income from the aforesaid firm for the accounting year ending 30-6-1949. This return was also made under the Mysore Act. By an order dated 20-3-1950 the Income-tax Officer directed a refund of Rs. 641-3-0 to the assessee due to the difference in the rate of tax applicable to him and the maximum rate. In the course of proceedings for the assessment years 1951-52 and 1952-53 the Income-tax Officer was of the opinion that the assessee's income had escaped assessment in the accounting year ending 30-6-1949 and he therefore issued a notice to him under s. 34 of the Act.
 The assessee objected to the reopening of the assessment on the ground that he had already been assessed for the said period under the Mysore Act and that according to paragraph 5(1) of the Part B States (Taxation Concession) Order 1950 an assessment under the Indian Income-tax Act 1922 would be possible only if, before the appointed day namely on 1-4- 1950 the assessee had not been assessed under the Mysore Act. Since the refund order had been issued to him he claimed to have been assessed under the Mysore Act. The Income-tax Officer rejected this contention and made an assessment under s. 34 of the Indian Act on 6-3-1955. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner held that the assessment under s. 34 was not valid. The Appellate Tribunal was of the view that the refund granted by the Income-tax Officer under s. 18 of the Mysore Act was not an assessment as contemplated under s. 23 of the Indian Act, and that the words 'such income profits and gains' used in paragraph 5(1) of the Part B States (Taxation Concession) Oeder 1950 referred to identity of income or sources and that it is only in cases wherein income has been assessed under the Mysore Act that the Income-tax Officer is prohibited from taking any further action thereon. On this view the Tribunal restored the order of the Income-tax Officer. In reference the High Court held that the refund order which was made on assessee's return was an order of assessment.
 On appeal by the Revenue in this Court, 
HELD : (i) The refund order given by the Income-tax Officer on the return filed by the assessee was an assessment within the meaning of paragraph 5 of the Order. The assessment of both the firm as well as the individual had been made under the Mysore Act for the year ending 30th June 1949 in respect of income of that year. As such it clearly fell 9 09 within the provisions of sub-paragraph, (1) of paragraph 5 of the Order which makes the Act applicable to such assessments. [913 A-B; 914 B] Esthuri Aswathiah v. Income Tax Officer, Mysore State, [1960] INSC 258; 41 I.T.R. 539. relied on.
 It is also provided in subparagraph (2) of paragraph 5 that where income profits and gains have not been assessed under the State law they shall be assessed under the Indian Act for the year ending 31-3-1951 which is the assessment year 1950-51 in respect of which the tax payable has been specified therein. There can be no doubt that for the assessment year 1950-51 for which the accounting year is the previous year 1st April 1949 to 31st March 1950, the Act applies and assessments would be made thereunder. This would be a hardship because under the concerned tax law of a Part B State an assessee in that State may have been taxed already. It is in &der to remove this hardship that the Order was issued under Section 60A of the Act. [914 C-D] Further, any omission to give information, or failure to file a return or failure to disclose truly and fully all material facts which are a condition of the re-opening of assessments under s. 34 of the Act do hot appertain to the Income-tax Officer under the Act but to the Income-tax Officer under the Mysore Act. Even on this reading it would appear that Section 34 of the Act would have no application., [914 E] (ii)The finding of the Tribunal that an assessment under s.
 34 could be made in the present case because the assessee's income from property and other sources had not been assessed under the Mysore Act was wrong. This reasoning would lead to the startling conclusion and would imply that there would be two assessments in respect of , the income of an assessee during one assessment year, i.e., while assessment made under the Mysore Act in respect of income reported by the assessee cannot be reopened, the income not disclosed by him would be liable to be assessed under, the Act. Moreover if that reasoning is correct it would not be a case of reassessment under s. 34 but assessment under s. 23 of the Act. This was not the stand taken by the Revenue at any stage.
 The appeals must accordingly be dismissed. [914 G-915 A]
