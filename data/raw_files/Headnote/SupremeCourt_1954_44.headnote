 Held, that the provisions of rules 84 and 85 of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure requiring the deposit of 25 per cent of the purchase money immediately on the person being declared as a purchaser and the payment of the balance within 16 days of the sale are mandatory and if these provisions are not complied with there is no sale at all.
 Non-payment of the price on the part of the defaulting pur- chaser renders the sale proceedings as a complete nullity.
 The inherent powers of the Court cannot be allowed to cir- cumvent the mandatory provisions of the Code and relieve the purchasers of their obligation to make the deposit.
 109 Under Order XXI, rule 72, of the Code of Civil Procedure a decree-holder cannot purchase property at the Court-auction in execution of his own decree without the express permission of the. Court and that when he does so with such permission, he is entitled to a set-off, but if he does so without such permission, then the court has a discretion to set aside the sale upon the application by the judgment- debtor, or any other person whose interests are affected by the sale. As a matter of pure construction this -provision is directory and not mandatory.
