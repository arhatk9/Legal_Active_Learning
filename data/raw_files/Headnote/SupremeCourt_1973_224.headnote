 There were two bus routes-the shorter and the longer routes- both being overlapping. On the shorter route, the strength of the stage carriage permit was fixed at 17 in 1950. In July 1958 the Regional Transport Authority decided to extend the shorter route by about six miles (which is called the longer route). In March, 1959 the strength of the shorter route was increased from 17 to 25. The State Transport Appellate Tribunal approved the extension of the shorter route. The R.T A. advertised for eight vacancies in the shorter route and a number of application had been received.
 Certain objections were raised to the increase in the strength and to the wrong description of the route. In August 1961 the RTA decided that the only route that survived was the longer route. The existing permits for the shorter route were in the meantime converted into permits for the longer route When appellants in the third group had applied for permits on the shorter route, objections were raised that the shorter route had ceased to exist.
 Overruling the objections, the RTA granted eight permits to the appellants, which decision was upheld' by the State Transport Appellate Tribunal in August, 1967.
 The High Court held (i) that without fixing the strength first on the longer route permits could not be granted for it(ii) that the RTA should have first decided whether there were two routes or one and then fixed the strength of the route or routes and that not having been done in accordance with law there was no proper disposal of the applications for permits; (iii) that the reduction of the strength of 25 to 9 on the shorter route as done by the RTA was illegal.
 Dismissing the appeals of the appellants in the first and second groups and allowing the appeal of the third group.
 
HELD : As the RTA had not fixed the number of permits for the longer route the grant of permits for the longer route was invalid. [560-G] in March, 1959 the RTA had fixed the number of permits for the shorter route at 25. As 17 permits had already been granted, the RTA invited applications for eight vacancies in June, 1959. So the strength was fixed long before the invitation of applications for permits. At one stage the RTA had taken the view that the shorter route had merged in the longer route but later it rectified the mistake and held that the shorter route and the longer route existed separately. The latter view of the RTA was correct in the then prevailing circumstances. [560-H] A decision to extend the shorter route to a longer distance under the U.P. Motor Vehicles Taxation Act will not automatically merge the shorter route in the longer route.
 For that purpose it was necessary for the RTA to take an independent decision under the Motor Vehicles Act. But no such decision was taken. The RTA realised the mistake and rectified it in its meeting of May, 1965. The decision of the RTA dated May, 1965 that the shorter route still existed with a strength of 25 stage carriages and that the shorter route and the longer route were separate routes was correct.
 [561-C-D] The RTA could not reduce the strength of the shorter route from 25 to 9. There were, therefore, eight vacancies on the shorter route and the RTA could validly grant eight permits to the appellants in the third group. The High Court was wrong in quashing the grant of permits to the appellants in the third group. [561-E-F] R. Obilaswami Naidu v.
