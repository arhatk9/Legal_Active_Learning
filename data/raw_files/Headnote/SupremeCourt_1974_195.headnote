 The appellants filed a suit for the recovery of a money debt against the respondents. The suit was compromised and by the compromise decree three items of the respondent's property were sought to be charged. The compromise decree was presented in the Registrar's office and was noted in Book No. 1, but, due to the negligence of that office only the charge on one item of property was specifically recorded in the registers mentioned in s. 51 and the Indices mentioned in s. 55 of the Registration Act. The appellants, after realising some money by the sale of the item of property with respect to which the charge was specifically recorded in the Registrar's office, filed on execution application for the recovery of balance of money by the sale of one of the items of property with respect to which the Registrar's office had not recorded the charge. That property, in the meanwhile, was mortgaged under two simple mortgages. The mortgagee, claiming to be ignorant of the prior charge, objected to its sale in the execution pro- ceedings initiated by the appellants; but his objection was overruled and the property was sold in execution.
 The mortgagee under the two simple mortgages field a suit for recovery of the amount due to him. The suit was dismissed by the trial court on the ground that though he had no actual or constructive notice of the charge in favour of the appellants, yet, the charge had priority over the subsequent mortgages and could be enforced against the mortgagee in as much as a simple mortgage without possession, did not give the mortgagee the protection given by the amended proviso to s. 100 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, which provides that a charge shall not be enforced against any property in the hands of a person to whom such property has been transferred for consideration and without notice of the charge.
 On appeals against the order arising out of the execution application of the appellants and against the judgment dismissing the mortgagee's suit, the High Court held against the appellants on the ground that the mortgage in favour of the respondent was protected under the proviso to s. 100 and was free from the charge in favour of the appellants.
 In appeals to this Court, on the question of competing priorities between a charge created by the decree and the subsequent simple mortgage, 
HELD (Per Curiam) : The appeals should be dismissed. [243 D- F-;258 C] (Per Jaganmohan Reddy and Alagiriswami, JJ:) (1) The charge created by the terms of the decree is covered by s. 100 of the Act. A compromise decree, not being the result of a decision by the court, but an acceptance by the court of something to which the parties had agreed, if it creates a charge on immovable property and is duly registered, it amounts to the creation of security by act of parties within the meaning of s. 100 of the Act.
 [232 B-C] (2) The finding of the courts below that the mortgagee had no notice actual or constructive of the prior charge created by the decree is correct. [231 E-C] (a) It was an admitted position that even on a careful inquiry the mortgagee would not have known that the property was charged in favour of the appellants, in as much as, neither the property cards nor the municipal records nor the indices contained a reference to the charge on the suit property. If the property 225 which a person wants to purchase or which is being offered to him as mortgage or security for payment of any money is shown in Index It then he would have notice of such charge or mortgage and may wish to further probe by inspecting Index I and Book 1. Merely inspecting Book or Index I will not benefit him because all he can know is that there is a decree that has been registered which would not be helpful to him. [230 H-231B, C-D] (b) The proviso to Explanation 1 to s. 3 of the Transfer of Property Act, provides that in order to amount to constructive notice it is necessary (i) that the instrument has been registered and its registration completed in the manner required by the Registration Act; (ii) the instrument has been duly entered or filed in books kept under s. 51 of the Registration Act; and (iii) the particulars regarding the transaction to which the instrument relates have been correctly entered in the indices kept under s. 55 of Registration Act. In the instant case constructive notice cannot be imputed to the mortgagee since the third condition required for the purpose was not satisfied. [231 D-F] (3) The protection in the. proviso to s. 100 does not apply to mortgages. In order to make it applicable it has to be shown that, (a) the property against which the charge is to be enforced has been transferred for consideration; (b) the transferee had no notice of the, charge, and (c) the property which is the subject-matter of the charge, is in the hands of the person to whom such property has been transferred. [236H-237B] (i) The words "transferred for consideration and without notice of the charge" have never been used for describing a mortgage whether it be a simple mortgage or mortgage with possession. This expression has always been understood to describe a sale and in antithesis to a transfer by way of gift. Throughout the Transfer of Property Act whenever a transfer of property is referred to without any qualification it is to the transfer of all the interests in the property. Thus the 'transfer of property' referred to in s. 100 is the transfer of the whole property and not a mere interest in or over the property like mortgage, lease etc.[234 F-H; 236 B-E] Under English aw, the expression 'purchaser for Value includes a mortgagee. Before the Transfer of Property Act came into force whenever any expression came up for consideration, in the absence of any specific definition under the Indian statutes, the meaning assigned in English law seem- to have sometimes been applied in a general way.
 The usage of any term conveying a particular meaning in English Law and which subsequently has been incorporated in the definition of statutes in England cannot, on that hypothesis, be imported as if that word has the same meaning under the Indian Law when our statute-, adopts different connotations. After the Act has come into force, if the Act intended to convey that a has an absolute title it has used the word 'buyer'. Through in the marginal note in s. 56 the word 'Purchaser' has been used, an analysis of the section shows that the legislature has used different terminology for connoting different concepts aid that it has used the word 'purchaser' as synonymous with 'buyer' and is not including the mortgagee or mortgagor or a lessee of- a lessor as in English Law. [237C. E-G; 238A-B-G] (iii)The expression 'in the hands of' in the proviso is a figurative expression and is intended to convey that a person has sufficient control over the subject matter , to enable him to do anything with it which the nature of that subject matter would permit. It is a multifaceted phrase connoting many meanings depending on the context. In the context of the saving clause in s. 100 the phrase was intended to convey and does convey that the buyer, as a transferee for consideration without notice of a charge, was in possession, including constructive possession through a tenant who has attuned to him and that the vendor had conveyed to him all his right. title and interest in the property including possession. If the intention of the Legislature was to make the proviso applicable even to a mortgage, there was no need for it to have used the words 'in the hands of a person to whom such property has been because, even if' the proviso is Teal without these words, the effect sought for would ensue.

 16-L251 Sup.CI/75 226 (4) The question of priority between a charge and a mortgage cannot be decided with reference to s. 48 of the Transfer of Property Act, because, that section deals with a case of transfers of interest in respect of the same immovable property created at different times while a charge is not a transfer of an interest in or over immovable property. In fact, the proviso to s. 100 was amended to get over the effect of certain decisions which have held that a charge was valid even against a subsequent purchaser without notice on the assumption that a charge creates an interest in property, because all provisions relating to a simple mortgage 'shall as for as may be apply to a charge'. [232 F- H, 239A; 234 A-B;240 D-E] (5)But the doctrine of notice apart from the statutory provisions such as s. 53A of the. Transfer of Property Act, s. 48 of the Registration Act and s. 27 (b) of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 corresponding to s. 19 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, is firmly embedded in the jurisprudence of this country as part of the equitable principles which courts administer in conformity with "justice, equity and good conscience". On this approach, the conclusion would be the same is if the proviso to s. 100 of the Act was applicable to mortgages also. [243 B-C] (6)However, it is no answer to say that merely because the ultimate result is the same we should read the language of s. 100 ignoring the purpose for which the amendment was made or give it an interpretation which is totally at variance with the tenor of the entire Act in order that it may conform with the ultimate result. [243 C-D] (7)Since the finding in the instant case is that the respondent did not have notice of the appellants' charge the mortgage will have a priority over the charge of the appellants. [243 D-E] (8) There is no question of the appellants being protected by the doctrine of Lis Pendents. [230 B-C] (Per Beg J :) : (1) The agreement between the parties which was embodied in the compromise decree satisfies the requirements of s. 100 of the Transfer of Property Act inasmuch as it is a charge created by the act of parties.
 If the rights of a simple mortgagee, who is not in possession of the mortgaged property, are not protected by the proviso to the section, the first part of the section will confer upon the charge-holder, the same rights as a prior simple mortgagee has against a subsequent simple mortgagee even though the charge does not amount to a mortgage. [246 D-E, G] (2) There is no reason to differ from the views taken by the trial court and the High Court which preclude the existence of 'gross negligence' on the part of the respondent who had made such attempts as could be expected of a reasonable and prudent individual to find out whether the property to be mortgaged was subject to a previous charge. The failure of the respondent to learn of the prior charge on the mortgaged property could be ascribed only to the negligence of the Registrar's office for which the respondent could not be made to suffer.[248 F-G] (3) The High Court was correct in adopting the view that the respondent, as a simple mortgagee, was not outside the protection conferred by the proviso to s. 100, because he was both a bona fide transferee for consideration with simple mortgagee rights 'in hand', as well as a person who had no notice, actual or constructive, of the prior charge of the appellants.,[250 G-H] (i) Section 58 of the Transfer of Property Act defines a mortgage is the 'transfer of an interest in specific immovable property' and 'property' is indicative of every possible interest a person can have. Therefore, a simple mortgage is a transfer of property within the meaning of s.
 5 of the Act, and the mortgagee's rights are 'property in the hands of a person to whom such property had been transferred for consideration'. If a simple mortgage amounts to a transfer of property for the purposes of s. 100 it is immaterial that a transfer of property implies a transfer of the whole bundle of rights in the property which the transferor has for the purpose of situations dealt with by other sections. For example, s. 8 of the Act laying down the effects, incidents and implications of a transfer. em- 227 bodies only a rule of interpretation and was meant to govern matters not expressly provided for in deeds of transfer. It was not at all intended to govern or Jay down the meaning of 'transfer, whenever used in the Act. That has been done expressly by ss. 5 and 6. In view of the other provisions of the Act, the transferee under the proviso to s. 100 may be of even an interest in property. The words 'such property' do not stand only for 'full ownership of property'. If the transfer of an interest in property to. a mortgagee, whether simple or Usufructuary, is a transfer of property, 'such property' could only mean, in the case of a mortgagee, the interest in property which has been transferred to the mortgagee because that is also property. [249F; 253 D-E; 254 A-C. F-G] (ii) Under English Law, for the purpose of determining the priority between the owner of a legal estate and an equitable owner, a 'purchaser for value' includes a mortgagee. English equitable principle under the provision of the Transfer of Property Act, so that, although the term 'purchaser is not used in s. 100 of the Act, the proviso seems to have been meant to incorporate the doctrine of a bona fide purchaser for value. It speaks of 'a person to whom Such property has been transferred for consideration without notice of the charge', and the language used was designedly wide so as to confer the benefit of the proviso also upon persons other than purchasers of ownership rights.
 [251G, 252G-253B] ((ii)) The expression 'in the hands of' could not be confined to tengible property which is actually in the physical possession of the transferee, because, property as defined in s. 6, includes both tangible and intangible property and extends to rights and interests in property.
 'Possession' is only one of the meanings of the expression 'in hand' and whenever the concept of possession was intended to be conveyed, the word 'possession' had been used as for example in Explanation 11 to s. 3. In the proviso to s. 100, the Legislature deliberately employed the concept of 'property in hand' in contradistinction to 'property in the possession of' a transferee, so as to include cases where a person has a right, which is intangible property, vested in him. The right of a simple mortgagee may be capable of being spoken of as 'possessed' by the mortgagee, but the right could more appropriately be spoken of as either 'vested in the transferee', or, as property 'in the hands of the transferee'. The object of employing this terminology in the proviso seems to be to include such rights as those of a simple mortgagee.[249, G-H; 250 C-G] Observation contra in Arumilli Surayya v. Pinisetti Venkataramanamma & Ors A.I.R. 1940 Mad. 701 overruled.
 (4)The appellants cannot contend that their prior rights would be protected by the principle underlying s. 48 of the Act because; (a) Apart from the qualifying words, 'so far as may be' in s. 100, one of the conditions for the applicability of s. 48 is that there must be an actual transfer of property, (b) Another condition is that the previous and the subsequently created rights cannot all exist or be exercised to their full extent together, which condition is not satisfied in tire present case. (c) The prior right of the charge bolder could only obtain priority provided other things are not unequal. (d) The conditions of priority as between the holder of a previous charge and a subsequent simple mortgage are completely covered by s. 100.
 [251 B-E] (5)If the same result on the question of a priority of a simple mortgage as against a charge, of which the mortgagee has no notice, can be reached by resorting to the principle of 'equity, justice and good conscience' s. 100 itself can be read as a direct statutory recognition of the very principles, because, it contains comprehensively the requirements of equity, justice and good conscience.[254H- 255B] (6)A wide and liberal interpretation must be given to the proviso to extend the benefit of the amended section to mortgagees also, as bona fide transferees for value-the word 'purchaser' having been deliberately eschewed. The amend- ment. made to negative the view in some cases that a charge could be enforced even against a bona fide purchaser for value without notice, should be interpreted to amplify the remedy and suppress the mischief aimed at. Decisions had also been given until now, since the amendment of s. 100 in 1928, or the assumption that a simple mortgagee is also covered by the protection conferred by the amended powers, There is no reason why a new path or its meaning should now be taken. [225 D-F; 256 F-H] 228 (7) There is no question of the mortgage being struck by the doctrine of Lis Pendens. [258 A-C]
