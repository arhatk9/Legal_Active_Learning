 The contemner, a journalist, was charged with committing contempt of court for publishing in his journals articles that certain judgments given by four Judges of the High Court proceeded from corrupt motives. At the end of the hearing of the contempt petition in this Court he was given a choice to submit apologies to this Court as well as to each of the four Judges of the High Court and if he chose to do so he should publish them on the front page of his papers. He submitted an apology to this Court; but within 10 days thereafter he published an article purporting to give a gist of the proceedings of this Court in the contempt petition stating that this Court told him that "if you tender apology we will consider. Under the circumstances I agreed for tendering apology". Later he came out with a front page article that his "conscience did not permit him to tender apologies to each of the four Judges and that he had decided to go to jail rather than tender apology to them".

 HELD: The conduct and writings of the contemner constitute serious interference with the administration of justice, since his sole object in giving publicity to the defamatory allegations against the Judges was to deter them from deciding cases against him or against those in whom he is apparently interested. The apology tendered by him was an eye wash, a make-belief, and cannot be accepted. In fact, there was no apology to accept because he had resiled from it. Indeed he was penitent for having apologised to the High Court Judges whose character he had assailed without the semblance of sincerity of purpose or purity of means. He was not penitent for his conduct. [17 E-G] The apology tendered by the contemner to this Court was a mere device to escape punishment for his culpable conduct.
 He had committed a breach of the undertaking given by him to this Court that he would not make similar charges against Judges and that he would publish his apology in the two journals. Far from carrying out that undertaking he had ventured into another bout of scurrilous writings against the High Court Judges. [16 D-E] 13 From the tenor of his articles and his conduct it was apparent that he was inspired by some others working from behind the curtain. But the fact that the contemner was writing at the behest of undisclosed principals is not an extenuating circumstance.
 Very often, contemners are so contemptible that it is useless to take serious notice of their conduct but it is necessary to take action in this case because nothing else would stop a systematic campaign of vilification against the defenceless Judges of the High Court. [18 B]
