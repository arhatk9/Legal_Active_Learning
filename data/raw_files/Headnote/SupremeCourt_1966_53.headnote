 The appellant company held an enquiry into the misconduct of two, of its permanent employees and dismissed one of them while discharging the other. They made applications to the Labour Court under s. 26 of the Bihar Shops and Establishments Act 8 of 1954. The said court issued a notice to the appellant asking it to show cause why the dis- missal/discharge should not be set aside. The appellant went to the High Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution and, inter alia challenged the validity of s. 26. The High Court having held that the section was valid the appellant came to this Court by special leave. It was contended that the proviso to s. 26(1) was ultra vires because it suffered from the vice of excessive delegation in as much as it gave unguided power to the State Government to prescribe what kinds of duct were punishable with discharge or- dismissal without notice under s. 26(1).
 
HELD; It is well known that in industrial law there are two kinds of misconduct, namely, (i) major misconducts which justify punishment of dismissal/discharge and (ii) minor misconducts which do not justify punishment of dismissal/discharge but may call for lesser punishments.
 Therefore when the legislature gave power to the State Government under cl. (c) of s. 40 to specify which kinds of misconduct could be punished without notice under s. 26(1) it clearly indicated to the State Government to include in its list of misconducts such of them a,; are generally understood as major misconducts which justify the dismissal/ discharge of an employee. This was sufficient guidance to the State Government and it is difficult to see what other guidance the legislature could have given to the rule-making authority in this behalf. [633 H634 C] Looking at the list of the several items of misconduct which were, prescribed by the State Government under r. 20(1) it was clear that the State Government properly understood the guidance.
 In the circumstances it could not be said that the proviso to s. 26(1) was ultra vires because of the vice of excessive delegation. [634 H]
