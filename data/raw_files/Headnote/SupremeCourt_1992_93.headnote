 On the abolition of the Food Department under the Central Government, the employees therein were transferred to the Food Corporation of India (FCI). In exercise of its power conferred by Section 45 of the food Corporation Act, 1964, FCI framed Regulations in regard to appointments and promotions. Later, pursuant to Regulation 10, FCI issued a Circular on 15.5.75 to the effect that both the employees transferred from the erstwhile Food Department (Food Transferees) and the direct recruits will be promoted on ad- hoc basis. It also stated that with the final transfer of Food Transferees to FCI with effect from 1.3.69, their promotions had to be regularised. It also provided that the transferees as well as direct recruits would be deemed to have completed the period of probation satisfactorily if they have completed one year of service in that grade. This was in accordance with Regulations 7 and 15 which stipulated a period of one year probation for the regular appointees in FCI-both transferees and direct recruits.
 One of the Respondents who was given ad-hoc promotion as Assistant Manager was reverted on the ground that he was not approved for regular promotion. Being aggrieved by the reversion order, he approached the High Court by way of a Writ Petition. The High Court directed the FCI to consider his case in the light of the circular dated 15.5.1975.
 Some other Writ Petition were also filed before the High Court by the employees challenging the seniority list, and the High Court quashed 329 the seniority list and directed the FCI to consider the claims of the Writ Petitioners in the light of the circular dated 15.5.1975.
 The union of India preferred appeals, against the orders of the High Court. A Writ Petition has been filed directly before this Court in regard to fixation of seniority.
 On behalf of FCI, it was contended that there was no need to quash the entire seniority list, as has been done by the High Court in the subsequent cases.
 Disposing of the matters, this Court, 
 HELD : 1. It will be seen from the circular dated 15.5.75 that the procedure for regularisation of 'food transferees' on their absorption in the FCI was laid down and it was provided that the transferees as well as direct recruits described as 'ad-hoc promotees' may be deemed to have completed the probationary period satisfactorily if they have completed one year of service in that grade after following the procedure laid down in Regulation 15 and allied orders. [333C,D] 
 2. Paragraph 3 of the circular envisages passing of formal order of regular appointments (as required by Regulation 7) after following the procedure laid down in the circular. These orders of regular appointment will be on the post held by the 'food transferees' on the date of absorption and if one has since been promoted, This in brief is the import of the circular read in the light of Regulations 7, 10 and 15. The circular has taken care of both the categories, namely, direct recruits as well as 'food transferees'. It is, therefore, essential that the question of seniority of both the cadres be determined on the basis of the principles laid down in the said circular.
 There was no need to strike down the entire seniority list but it would suffice if the FCI is directed to review and determine the seniority of the 'food transferees', as well as direct recruits who were granted ad-hoc promotions.
 [336D-F] 
 3. Food Corporation of India is directed to have the inter se seniority of the direct recruits/food transferees determined in the light of the circular and grant appropriate placements to the incumbents on the basis of the seniority so determined in the existing seniority list.
 Such placements 330 may require a reshuffle of the seniority list which the FCI would be free to do. Having regard to passage of time it is directed that this may be done within a period of six months. [336G,H;337A,B]
