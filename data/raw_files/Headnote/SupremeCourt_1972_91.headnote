 The appellant and the three respondents were candidates for election to the Madhya Pradesh Assembly at the general election held in 1967. The appellant was successful at he election, Respondent no. 1 chatlenged his election in an election petition charging him with corrupt practices. It was alleged by the election petitioner that in speeches made to the voters on the basis of religion within the meaning of s. 123 (3) of the Representation of the People Act 1951, the voters were threatened divine displeasure within the meaning of s. 123 (2), ad also statements were made about the election petitioner within the meaning of s. 123 (4). The affidavit in support of the petition did not disclose the source of information whereby respondent no. learnt the speeches constituting corrupt practice. The High Court however believed the oral evidence produced on behalf of he respondent, disbel eved that produced on behalf of the appellant and allowed the election petition. Appeal to this Court was filed under s. 116-A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) The affidavit filed by the respondent along with the election petition did not disclose the source of information in respect of , speeches alleged to have been made by the appellant. Although the respondent claimed in his evidence that he came to know of the speeches through notes made by certain persons who heard them, neither the notes nor these persons were produced in Court. The non- production of the notes and the persons who made them must lead to an irresistible inference against the respondent that the same would not have supported respondent's case.
 [959 H; 962 A-B] Rule 7 of the Madhya Pradesh High Court Rules states that every affidavit should clearly express how much is a statement and declaration from knowledge and how much is a statement made on information or belief aid must also state the source or ground of information belief' with sufficient particularity. Form No. 25 of 'he Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 requires the deponent of an affidavit to set out which statements are true to the knowledge of the dependent and which statements are true to his information. In so far as form No. 25 requires the dependent to state which statements are true to knowledge there is no specific mention of the sources of information in the form. The form of the affidavit and the High Court rules are not inconsistent. The High Court Rules give effect to provisions of Order 19 of the Code of Civil Procedure. [960 C-F] 956 The non-disclosure of grounds or sources of information in an election petition which is to be filed within 45 days from the date of election of the returned candidate, will have to be scrutinised from two politics of view . The non- disclosure of the grounds will indicate that the election petitioner did not come forward with the sources of information at the first opportunity. The real importance of setting out the sources of information at the time of the presentation of the petition is to give the other side notice of the contemporaneous evidence on which the election petition is based. That will give an opportunity to 'the other side to test the genuineness and varacity of the sources- of information . The other point of view is that he election petitioner will not be able to make any departure, from the sources of grounds. If there is any embellishment of the case it will be discovered.

 (ii) The High Court was wrong in pronouncing observations on the First Information Report relating to an incident at one of election meetings in question when a criminal case based on that Report was pending. [1964 F-G] (iii) The overwhelming impression produced by the witnesses on behalf of the respondent is that they were all prepared on the same pattern of evidence. On the entire evidence it could not be held that the allegations constituting corrupt practice were proved.[1971 H-972 A]
