 Out of the total holding of his land the respondent transferred land to two persons under two unregistered sale deeds and gifted away some land to his son. In the return submitted by him the respondent did not include in his holding the area transferred under the unregistered sale deeds. The Land Reforms Tribunal, ignoring the two transfers, computed his holding at 1.7692 standard holding and called upon him to surrender land equivalent to 0.7692 standard holding.
 On appeal the Land Reforms Appellate Tribunal upheld the order of the Land Reforms Tribunal.
 In revision the High Court held that the land transferred under the two sale deeds could not be included in the holding of the respondent for ascertaining the ceiling area. In coming to this conclusion the High Court gave the benefit of section 53A of Property Act to the person in possession of the plots pursuant to the contract for sale and treated the land as a part of his holding. It was contended on behalf of the respondent that the definition of 'holding' contemplates ownership with possession and if so the transferee in possession will be taken to be the holder of the land transferred and not the respondent who was the transferor or who was not in possession.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD : The respondent satisfies the conditions contemplated by the definition of the term 'holding' and the land transferred by him under a defective title deed will form part of his holding. The High Court was in error in holding that the land in possession of the transferee cannot be taken to be a part of the holding of the respondent. [486 H; 487 A] The expression 'held' connotes both ownership as well as possession. In the context of the definition it is not possible to interpret term 'held' only in the sense of possession. The explanation to the definition of 'holding' clearly contemplates that the same land can be the holding of two different persons holding 483 the land in two different capacities. The respondent in the instant case is holding the land as owner although he was not in possession. [486 C-E] It is well settled that a person in possession, pursuant to a contract for sale, does not get title to the land unless there is a valid document of title in his favour. In the instant case the transferee came into possession in pursuance of an agreement for sale but no valid deed of title was executed in his favour. Therefore, the ownership remained with the transferor. But even in the absence of a valid deed of title the possession pursuant to an agreement of transfer cannot be said to be illegal and the transferee is entitled to remain in possession. If per chance he is dispossessed by the transferor he can recover possession. The transferor cannot file any suit for getting back possession but all the same he will continue to be the owner of the land agreed to be transferred. [486 F-H] There may conceivably be cases where the same land is included in holding of two persons in different capacities and serious prejudice might be caused to one or both of them if they were asked to surrender the excess area. To safeguard the interest of the owners in such a case the legislature has made a provision in section 12(4) and (5) of the Act. Even so there might be cases where some prejudice might be caused to some tenure holders. [489 C-E; G] But if the definition of the term 'holding' is couched in clear and unambiguous language the Court has to accept it as it stands. So construed the same land can be a part of the holding of various persons holding it in different capacities. When the terms of the definition are clear and unambiguous there is no question of taking extraneous aid for construing it. [489 H. 490 A]
