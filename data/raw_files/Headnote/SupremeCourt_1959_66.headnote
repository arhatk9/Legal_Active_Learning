 The petitioners challenged the constitutionality of the Sugar Export Promotion Act, 958, which was enacted for the purpose of exporting sugar with a view to earning foreign exchange. The impugned Act imposed the following restrictions on the owners of 40 factories producing sugar by the vacuum pan process: (i) it obliged them to deliver to the export agency specified by the Central Government the quota of sugar allocated to them;
 (ii) it made them suffer a loss on this delivery of sugar;
 and (iii) it exposed them to a penalty in case the delivery was short of the quota. By a notification issued under the Sugar (Control) Order, 1955, which was made under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, the Central Government increased the price of sugar for internal sales by 50 nP.
 per maund to enable the owners to recoup the loss suffered by them by the delivery of the sugar for export. The petitioners contended that it was not permissible to take the notification issued under another statute into consideration and that the impugned Act offended Arts. 14 and 19(1)(f) and (g) of the Constitution.
 Held, per Sinha, Imam, Kapur, Subba Rao and Hidayatullah, jj., Sarkar, J. dissenting) that the impugned Act was constitutionally valid.
 Per Sinha, Imam, Kapur and Hidayatullah, jj. The restrictions placed by the Act upon the fundamental rights of the petitioners under Arts. 19(1)(f) and (g) were not unreasonable as arrangements were made to save them from loss by increasing the price of sugar for internal sales, thus passing on the loss to the consumers in India. The reasonableness of the restriction and not of the law was to be determined, and if the restriction was under one law but countervailing advantages were created by another law passed as part of the same legislative plan, the Court must take that other law into account. The reasonableness of the restriction was to be judged at the time it was challenged and in the context Of the circumstances then existing. The notification of the Central Government increasing the price of sugar to enable the recoupment of the loss occasioned by the export could be taken into consideration in judging the reasonableness of the restrictions.

 The foreign export served the national interest by stabilising the sugar market and stabilised national economy by earning foreign exchange. The loss, if any, was spread over many factories and was so small as not to amount to an unreasonable restriction.
 The Act did not offend Art. 14 Of the Constitution in selecting sugar produced by the vacuum pan process for export and in leaving out sugar produced by other methods and other commodities from the mischief of the Act. The Government was the best judge as to which commodities were most likely to earn 41 foreign exchange and the selection made was justifiable as a reasonable classification which was related to the object of the Act of earning foreign exchanger Per Subba Rao, J. In testing the reasonableness of the restrictions imposed by the impugned Act it was not permissible to take into consideration the notification under the Sugar (Control) Order, 1955, increasing the price of Sugar for internal sales by 50 nP. per maund. The test of reasonableness of one Act could be made to depend upon the impact of another Act on it only when the earlier Act was made part of later Act or when both Acts were parts of the same legislative scheme or plan. To go beyond this would be to destroy the stability of legislation and to introduce an uncertain element. To go further and to depend upon a notification of a transitory nature issued under an unconnected Act would be to place the statute in a fluid state. The impugned Act and the Essential Commodities Act were enacted for different purposes.

 The restrictions imposed by the impugned Act were not unreasonable as the Act served the national interest by earning foreign exchange for the State and building up foreign markets for the future prosperity of the sugar industry.
 Per Sarkar, J. The impugned Act which made the petitioners suffer a loss on the sale of a part of their produce imposed unreasonable restrictions on their fundamental right to carry on their business and was invalid. Though in deciding the reasonableness of the restrictions imposed by the impugned Act all the prevailing conditions and circumstances had to be considered, the notification increasing the home price of sugar could not be taken into consideration. The impugned Act neither made it obligatory on, nor empowered the Government to take any steps to recoup the loss caused to the petitioners. The increase in the price depended solely on the arbitrary discretion or generosity or sense of fair play of the Government. It would be intolerable in any legal system that a statute should be legal when the Government chose to do a thing and illegal when it undid it and so on from time to time at the choice of the Government.
 Besides, there was nothing in the Essential Commodities Act or the Sugar (Control) Order which authorised the Government to increase the price for the sake of recouping to the manufacturers the loss caused to them by the impugned Act, and the validity of the notification increasing the home price of sugar was doubtful.

 The impugned Act caused loss to the petitioners which was not negligible and thus imposed unreasonable restrictions on 6 42 their right to carry on their business. The restrictions could not be justified on the ground that they resulted in stablising the sugar industry as the industry (lid not require any stabilisation. The export was not to be made out of the excess of production over internal consumption and in fact production in India had always been less than internal consumption.
