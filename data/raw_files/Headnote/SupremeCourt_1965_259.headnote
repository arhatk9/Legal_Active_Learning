 In the profit and loss account of the appellant company for the accounting year ending 31st March 1957, a certain sum of money was shown as the amount of dividend proposed to be distributed for that year; and its balance-sheet as on that date showed the value of its fixed assets and another sum as a provision for tax liability under the Incometax Act. 1922. In computing the net wealth for the purposes of Wealth Tax Act, 1957, the Wealth Tax Officer accepted the said valuation of the fixed assets under s. 7(2) of the Act, rejecting the appellant's plea that :,each item should be valued at the market rate under s. 7(1). He also disallowed the claim of the appellant in respect of the proposd dividend and estimated tax liability on the ground that the said items were not debts within the meaning of s. 2(m) of Act, on the- valuation date 31st March 1957. The order was confirmed by the Appellate Tribunal and by the High Court on a reference to it.
 In appeal to this Court, 
 HELD : (i) The Wealth Tax Officer was justified in taking the value ,of the assets of the assessee as shown in its balance-sheet on the relevant valuation date [693 F] Under s. 7, in the, case of an assessee, carrying on business, the Wealth Tax Officer may determine the net value of the assets of the business as a whole, having regard to the balance-sheet of the business as on the valuation date, and, when the assessee himself had shown the net value of the assets at a figure, the Officer rightly accepted it. It was open to the assessee to convince the authorities that the; figure was inflated for acceptable, reasons but no such attempt was made,. [693 B, F, G] (ii) As on the valuation date nothing further happened than a recommendation by the directors as to the amount that might be, distributed as dividend, it could not be held that there was any debt owed by the assessee to the share-holders on the valuation date. Therefore, the amount set apart as proposed dividend by the directors was not a debt owed by the company on the valuation date and therefore was not deductible in computing the assessee's net wealth under s..
 2(m); [694 E] (iii)(Per Subba Rao and Sikri JJ). The liability to pay the tax is a debt within the meaning of s. 2(m) and it arose on the valuation date during the accounting year and therefore, was deductible in computing the net wealth of the: assessee. [708 H] Under s. 3 of the Wealth Tax Act, the net wealth of the assessee is assessable as on the valuation date, at the rate or rates specified in the Schedule to the Act. "Net wealth" is the amount by which the aggregate value of the assets if the assessee as on the said date is in excess 689 of the aggregate value of the debts owed by it. A debt owed with in the meaning of s. 2(m) can be defined as a liability to pay in praesenti or in futuro an ascertainable sum of money. A debt is a present obligation to pay an ascertainable sum of money, whether the amount is payable in praesenti or in futuro, debitum in praesenti, solvendum in futuro. But a sum payable upon a contingency does not become a debt until the said, contingency has happened. A liability to pay income-tax is a present liability though it becomes payable after it is quantified in accordance with ascertainable data. Under ss. 3 and 67B of the Income-tax Act, the assessee is liable to pay incometax and supper-tax on its income: ascertained during the accounting year ending with 31st March, at the. rates prescribed under the Finance Bill or the previous Finance Act, whichever is less. The tax is to be charged in accordance with, and subject to, the provisions of the Income-tax Act; but the charge win be in accordance with the rates prescribed, under the Finance Act., The primary object of the Finance Act is only to prescribe the rates so that the tax can. be charged under the Income-tax Act. Section 67B also shows that the charging section is only s. 3 of the Income-tax Act and that s. 2 of the Finance Act only gives the rates for quantifying the tax; for, s. 67B gives an alternative for quantification in the contingency of the Finance Act not being, passed on 1st April of the year. The conclusion will then flow that the tax liability at the latest will arise. on the last day of the accounting year. There is thus a prefected debt at any rate on the last day of the accounting year and not a contingent liability. The rate is always easily ascertainable. If the Finance Act is passed, it is the rate fixed by the Act; if the Finance Act has not yet been passed, it is the rate proposed in the Finance Bill pending before Parliament or the rate in force in the preceding year, whichever is more favourable to the assessee. All the ingredients of a debt are present. It is a present liability of an ascertainable amount; [697 E; 703 E, F; 704 C, E, H; 705 A-B, 708 A-C] Wallace Brothers and Co. Ltd. v.

 Looking at the problem from the standpoint of a businessman or looking at the question from a commonsense view, one; will reasonably hold that the net wealth of an assessee, during the accounting year is the income earned by him minus the tax payable by him in respect of that income.
 [697 A] Per Shah J. (dissenting); The liability to pay the tax is not a debt arising on the valuation date and therefore is not deductible in computing the net wealth of the assessee under s. 2(m).
 A debt involves a present obligation incurred by the debtor and a liability to pay a sum of money in present or in future. The liability must however be to pay a sum of money, that is, to pay an amount which is determined or determinable in the light of factors existing it the date, when the nature of the liability has to be ascertained, but the expression does not include liability to pay unliquidated damages nor obligations which are inchoate. or contingent. [711 A, C] Under s. 3 of the Income Tax Act, liability to be taxed becomes effective not later than the last day of the year of account. But the liability to may tax arises, not from the estimate made, but only when 690 the Finance Act becomes operative on the first day of April of ',he assessment year either by enactment of an Act or by virtue of s. 67B of the Income-tax Act. Section 67B, however, operates only on the first day of the assessment year, that is, after the valuation date and not before.
 Therefore, the existence on the Statute Book of s. 67B does not convert what is an inchoate liability on the valuation date into a completed or ,effective liability to pay tax.
 Hence, the liability to pay tax, in the present case, at the earliest, arose on the first day of April 1957, but that, under the Wealth Tax Act, is not the valuation date. The liability to pay wealth tax becomes crystallised on the valuation date though the tax is levied for the assessment year, and on the valuation date there is normally no completed or effective charge for income-tax payable for the assessment year, because, the liability to tax did not give rise to any obligation to pay a sum of money either determined or determinable in the light of factors existing on that date. [712 D-E; 716 C-F; 717 A] To a commercial man the distinction between liability which arises 'immediately and a liability to arise in future may be blurred : but that in law is a real distinction and a liability which arises in the year of assessment may not be projected into the account of the previous year. [716 G] There is no warrant for the argument that substantially s. 7(2) is a definition section, which extends for the purposes of the Act their definition of the "net wealth" of assessees carrying on business. Neither cl. (a) nor cl. (b) of the; section is directed towards the determination of the net wealth, and it would be impossible to hold that the Legislature intended that the net wealth for the purpose of the charge to tax under s. 3 should be the net value of the assets as determined under s. 7(2). [719 B-D] The power conferred upon the Wealth Tax Officer by s.
 7(2) is to :arrive at a valuation of the assets and not to arrive at the net wealth of the assessee. The section merely provides machinery in certain special cases for the valuation of assets, and it is from the aggregate valuation of assets that the net wealth chargeable to tax may be ascertained. It does not contemplate determination of the net wealth, because, net wealth can only be determined from the net value of the assets by making appropriate deductions for debts owed by the asseessee. Section 7(2)(b) only contemplates cases where a company not resident in India is carrying on business and it is not possible to make a computation in accordance with cl. (a) because of the absence of a separate- balance sheet of the company. [718 B, D-F] Chatturam Holliram Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Bihar and Orissa, 27 I.T.R. 709 (S.C.) referred to.
