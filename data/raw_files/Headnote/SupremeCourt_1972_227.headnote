 What is contemplated by clause (1) of section 271, income Tax Act, 1961, is that the Income Tax Officer or the Appellate Assistant Commissioner should have been satisfied in the course of proceedings under the Act regarding matters mentioned in the clauses of that sub-section. It is not however essential that notice to the person proceeded against should have also been issued during the course of the assessment proceedings. Satisfaction, in the very nature of things, precedes the issue of notice and it would not be correct to equate the satisfaction of the Income Tax Officer or Appellate Assistant Commissioner with the actual issue of notice. The issue of notice, indeed, is a consequence of the satisfaction of the Income Tax Officer or the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and it would he sufficient compliance with the provisions of the statute if the Income Tax Officer or the Appellate Assistant Commissioner is satisfied about the matters referred to in clauses (a) to (c) of sub-section (1) of section 271 during the course of proceedings under the Act, even though notice to the person proceeded against in pursuance of that satisfaction is issued subsequent to the making of the assessment orders would not show that there was no satisfaction of the Income Tax Officer during the assessment proceedings, that the assessee had concealed the particulars of his income or had furnished incorrect particulars of such income. [393E] Commissioner of Income Tax, Madras and. Anr. v. S. V.
 Angidi Chettiar, [1962] 44 I.T.R. 739, referred to.
 The fact that the Income Tax Officer has to refer the case to the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner if the minimum imposable penalty exceeds the sum of rupees one thousand in a case falling under clause (c) of sub-section (1) of section 271 would not show that the proceedings in such a case cannot be initiated by the Income Tax Officer. [394F] It is not necessary that the Income Tax officer, before feeling satisfied regarding the necessity of initiating proceedings for imposition of penalty and before issuing consequential notice should have issued another notice to the assessee and held a preliminary enquiry regarding the necessity of initiating proceedings. Such a course would result in mere duplication of the procedure without any advantage to the parties. The final conclusion on the point as to whether the requirements of clauses (a), (b) and (c) of s. 271 have been satisfied would be reached only after the assessee has been heard or has been given a reasonable opportunity of being heard.
