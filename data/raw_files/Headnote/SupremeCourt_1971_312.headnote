 Six accused were charged with the offenses under ss. 148 and 302 and 307 read with s. 149 I.P.C., for having formed themselves into an unlawful assembly with the common object of demolishing a thatch belonging to the complainant and for causing death and injuries when resisted. The trial court convicted them. On appeal, two of the accused were ac- quitted and the appellants were convicted for offenses under ss. 148 and 304 and 307 read with s. 149., On the question of the validity of the conviction, 
HELD : (1) Before s. 149, which prescribes constructive criminal liability for members of an unlawful assembly, can be called in aid, the court must find with certainty that there were at least five persons sharing a common object.
 It is possible in some cases that though five were un- questionably present the identity of one or more is in doubt in which case a conviction of the rest with the aid of s.
 149 would be good. Therefore, it is not necessary that in every Case five persons must always be convicted before s.
 149 can be applied. But in such a, case, the court must find with unerring certainty, that at least five persons were present. [426 H; 427 A-C] In the present case, the charge definitely named the four appellants who have been convicted, and the two who have been acquitted, a,% being the only members of the unlawful assembly. Since two of the named accused were acquitted the conviction of the other four under s. 148 and Es. 304 and 307 read with s. 149 cannot be sustained on the charge as framed. [427 F-H] (2) The appellants, however, were guilty of offenses under ss. 304 Pan 1 and 307 read with s. 34. The totality of the circumstances indicated that there was a preconcerted plan and a common intention to remove the thatch and to attack any person who resisted. [432 E-H] The common intention under s. 34, should be anterior in time to the commission of the crime showing a prearranged plan and prior concert., Generally, it has to be inferred from the acts or conduct of some or all the accused and the totality of relevant circumstances in the case, such as, the manner in which the accused arrived on the scene and mounted the attack, the determination and concert with which injuries were caused by one or some of them the acts done by others to assist those causing the injuries, and the concerted conduct subsequent to the commission of the offence as for instance that all of them left the scene of the incident together.
