 The Mysore Health Cess Act 1962 provided in s. 3 for the levy and collection of a health cess at the rate of nine naye paise in the rupee, inter alia, on the items of the State revenue mentioned in Schedule A. Item 1 of Schedule A mentioned duties of excise leviable by the State under any law for the time being in force in any area of the State on alcoholic liquors for human consumption (and opium etc.) manufactured or produced in the State and for countervailing duties levied on similar goods manufactured or produced elsewhere. The Mysore Excise Act, 1901 empowered the State Government to grant exclusive or other privilege of selling by retail any country liquor or intoxicating drugs to any person or persons on such conditions and for such period as it thought fit. According to s. 18 of the Act the privilege of sale in a specified shop was to be disposed of periodically by public auction held by the excise authorities. As a result of such public auctions held subject to the terms and conditions notified by the State Government the appellants were granted the exclusive privilege of selling country liquor in certain arrack shops, beer taverns and toddy shops in consideration of their agreeing to pay specified 'shop rent' thereon at the rate of nine naye paise in the rupee. The appellants challenged the levy of the health cess on the shop rent in writ petition before the High Court and thereafter appealed to this Court with the following contentions :
 (1) That the Mysore Legislature was not competent to enact the impugned Act because no entry in List It or List III authorities a tax on tax or a health-tax and that if the intention was to levy a surcharge on existing items of revenue the State legislature could have easily used the words 'surcharge' or 'additional revenue'.
 (2) Even if the impugned tax was valid the Act did not empower the levy of health cess on shop rent because shop 'rent was not an excise duty falling within Schedule A -of the impugned Act or Entry 51 of List II.
 
HELD:Per Subba Rao, C. J., Sikri and Dayal, JJ. (i) By the impugned Act the State Legislature was levying a health cess on a number of items of State revenue or tax and it adopted the form of calling it a cess and prescribed the rate of nine naye paise in the rupee on the State revenue or tax.
 Section 4 of the impugned Act makes it quite clear that the cess is leviable and recoverable in the same manner as items of land revenue, State revenue or tax. In the context, the word on' in s. 3 does not indicate that the subject matter of taxation is land 549 revenue or State Revenue but that 9% of the land -revenue or State revenue is to be levied and collected, the subject matter remaining the same as in the law imposing land revenue or any duty or tax. If we read ss. 3 and 4 together the fact that the words 'surcharge' or 'additional duty' halve not been mentioned does not detract from the real substance of the legislation. Accordingly the Mysore Legislature Was competent to enact the law under the various entries of List II which enable it to levy land revenue or the duties of excise or the other taxes mentioned in s.
 3(iii) of the impugned Act. [560 A-C] (ii) For a duty to be a duty of excise it must be shown that the duty has been levied on goods which have been produced or manufactured, the taxable event being production or manufacture of goods. However,, it is not easy to decide in a particular case whether the particular levy is a levy in respect of manufacture or production of goods. This question has to be decided on the facts of each case but in deciding it certain principles must be borne in mind.
 First, one of the essential characteristics of an excise duty is uniformity of incidence. Secondly, the duty must be closely related to production or manufacture of goods. It does not matter if the levy is made not at the moment of production or manufacture but at a later stage. If a duty has been levied on an excisable article but this duty is collected from a retailer it does not necessarily cease to be an excise duty. Thirdly, if a levy is made for the privilege of selling an excisable article and the excisable article has already borne the duty and the duty has been paid, there must be clear terms in the charging section to indicate that what is being levied for the purpose of the privilege of sale is in fact a duty of excise. [562 E-F; 563 H] There is no presumption that if no other taxable event has intervened, the levy must be treated to be connected with production or manufacture.
 The levy in the present case was a payment for the exclusive privilege of selling today from certain shops. The licencee paid what he considered to be equivalent to the value of the right. Secondly, it had no close relation to the production or manufacture of toddy. Thirdly, the only relation it had to the production or manufacture of toddy, was that it enabled the licencee to sell it. But he might sell little, less or more than he anticipated, depending on various factors. Fourthly, toddy had already paid one excise duty in the form of tree tax., but he need not tap himself.
 Fifthly, the duty was not uniform in incidence because the amount collected had no relation to the quantity or quality of the produce but had only relation to what the Petitioner thought be could recoup by the sale of the excisable articles. What be recouped would depend upon the amount of sales and the conditions prevailing during the licensing year. Sixthly, there were no express words showing that what was being realised by the appellants was an excise duty. Seventhly the privilege of selling was auctioned well before the goods came into existence. [564 B-E] For the above reasons the duty was not an excise duty within the meaning of item (1) of Schedule A of the Health Cess Act or Entry 51 of List 11 of the Constitution. The State of Mysore had therefore no authority to levy and collect health cess on shop rent. [567 G-H] Per Bachawat J (concurring) : A charge for licence to sell an excisable article may be a fee or a tax. If it is a tax, it can satisfy the test of a duty of excise when it is so connected with the manufacture or production of an article as to be in effect a tax on the manufacture or production.
 Otherwise such a tax does not fall within the classification of a duty of excise. In the present case the shop rent was not connect- 550 ed with the production or manufacture of arrack, beer or toddy and was therefore not a duty of excise. The State Legislature was not competent to make a law levying a surcharge on the shop rent under Entry 5 1, List H. [584 C- F] Per Hidayatullah, J. (dissenting) : The persons who bid at these auctions were themselves the producers or manufacturers. They bid for the exclusive privilege or selling which in so far as Government was concerned was a means of collecting the anticipated excise duty at one go from a producer or manufacturer before the goods became a part of the general stock of goods in the country. In other words the person who was charged was the producer or manufacturer and the duty was levied from him before he could sell or obtain liquor which had not borne excise duty so far. The duty was therefore clearly a duty of excise whether the matter was considered in the light of economic theory, legislative practice or judicial authority. [572 D- E] Case law considered.
