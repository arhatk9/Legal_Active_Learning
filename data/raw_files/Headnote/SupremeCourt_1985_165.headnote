 The appellant, a Municipal Councillor, was prosecuted u/s 161, IPC and s.5 (1)(d) read with Sec. 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The trial Court convicted him of the aforesaid charges. On appeal, the High Court, confirmed his conviction and sentence.
 In appeal to this Court, the appellant contended that as a Municipal Councillor was not a 'public servant' within the meaning of Section 21 of the Indian Penal Code, he could not be prosecuted under the Act even if sanction for his prosecution was obtained.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD : 1. The appellant, not being a public servant, could not be prosecuted under the provisions of the Act - whether or not sanction to prosecute him is obtained which is wholly irrelevant to the issue. [348 B-C] 
 2. The concept of a 'public servant' is quite different from that of a Municipal Councillor. A 'public servant' is an authority who must be appointed by Government or a semi- governmental body and should be in the pay or salary of the same. Secondly, a 'public servant' is to discharge his duties in accordance with the rules and regulations made by the Government. On the other hand, a Municipal Councillor does not owe his appointment to any governmental authority.
 Such a person is elected by the people and functions undeterred by the commands or 346 edicts of a governmental authority. Therefore, a Municipal Councillor is not a 'public servant' within the meaning of Sec. 21 IPC. [347 G-H, 348 A] K.S. Nayak v. A.R.Antulay, AIR 1984 S.C.684, followed.
