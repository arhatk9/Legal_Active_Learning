 Section 15 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, subjects every sales tax law of a State to the restriction that the tax on the sale or purchase of ,declared goods shall not exceed the rate prescribed in the section. On April 1, 1958, textiles became declared goods and thereafter the Mysore State Legislature enacted the Mysore Sales-tax (Amendment) Act, 1963 (Mys. Act IX of 1964) by which a new sub-s. 5(A) was introduced in the Mysore Sales-tax Act, 1957, imposing on sales of textiles during the assessment period October 1, 1957 to March 31, 1958, when textiles were not declared goods, tax at the rate specified in the Second Schedule to the 1957-Act, that is, at a rate in excess of that specified in the Central Sales 'lax Act. The Substituted sub-section of the amending Act was to be deemed always to have been there. In the appeal to this Court it was contended that if the Mysore Legislature had no power on February 27, 1964, the date on which Act IX of 1964 came into force, to impose tax on sales of declared goods at a rate in excess of that specified in s. 15 of ,the Central Sales Tax Act, it was not competent to the legislature to give retrospective effect to s. 5A covering the period of assessment even if during that period it had the power to do so. Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : . (i) It was because textiles became declared goods from April 1, 1958, that the Mysore Legislature lost its power to tax the sales of textiles At a rate higher than that specified in s. 15 of the Central Sales Tax Act as it stood at the relevant time. Though the goods on ',he sale ,of which tax was imposed remained the same in substance their legal quality became different. As textiles were not declared goods before April 1, 1958, there was no inhibition on the part of the legislature in ,subjecting the turnover of sales of textiles, before that period, to tax at a rate higher than, that specified in s. 15 of the Central Sales Tax Act. [351 E] A. Hajee Abdul Shakoor & Co. V. State of Madras, [1964] INSC 155; [1964] 8 S.C.R. 217, 231, explained and held inapplicable.
 (ii) Looked at from a different angle, the only limit on the pover of a legislature to create a fiction is that it should not transcend its power by the creation of the fiction. The limitation on the power of the legislature of Mysore when it enacted Act IX of 1964 was that on the sale of declared goods it could not have imposed sales tax at the rate higher than that specified in s. 15 of the Central Sales Tax Act as it stood then. There was no limitation on its power to impose tax on the turnover of sales of textiles before April 1, 1958, when they were not declared goods. [351 H] [The question whether, after April 1, 1958, when textiles became declared goods, the rate of tax as provided in the Second Schedule to the Mysore General Sales Tax Act, 1957, as amended would stand modified 345 in view of the s. 15 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, did not arise for consideration and, therefore, no opinion was expressed on that aspect.] [352 B]
