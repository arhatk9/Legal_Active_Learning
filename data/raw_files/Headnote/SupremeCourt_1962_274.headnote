 The appellant was the Resident Engineer for Light Houses and the complainant had a contract for reconstructing one of the light houses. For this construction the contractor used water from a temple well and used a temple room for storing cement. On the completion of the work the appellant asked the-contractor to carry out certain repairs to the temple but he declined to do so. At the time of the payment of the final bill the contractor paid a sum of Rs. 1,000,/- to the appellant and the amount was recovered from him upon a search. The explanation offered by the appellant was that the contractor had given this sum of money for payment to the temple authorities for repairs to the temple as he had himself been unable to do so. He was convicted under s. 161 Indian Penal Code by raised the presumption under s. 4 of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The appellant contended that the explanation given by him was both reasonable and probable and that accordingly the presumption was rebutted.
 Held, that the presumption under s. 4(1) had properly been raised as the appellant had admittedly accepted gratifica- tion other than legal remuneration. The appellant had failed to rebut this presumption and was rightly convicted.
 The burden of rebutting such a presumption resting upon the accused was not as light as in the case of a presumption raised under s. 114 Evidence Act. The burden was not discharged by merely giving a reasonable and probable explanation. The accused had to show that the explanation was a true one. Unless the explanation is supported by proof, the presumption cannot be said to be rebutted.
