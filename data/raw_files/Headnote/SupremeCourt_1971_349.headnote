 During the pendency of an industrial dispute between the appellant and its workmen, arising out of the demand of the workmen for higher scales of pay, the appropriate government fixed under section 3 of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, the minimum rates of wages for the employees employed in scheduled employments including the appellant's industry.
 The tribunal found that the appellant concern was not finan- cially stable. It fixed the minimum wages at rates higher than the rate fixed by the government. In its award the tribunal referred to the minimum rates of wages fixed in the several awards passed by it from 1962 onwards and also considered the rist in the cost of living. It also took into account the consumer price index for the month of December, 1966, and that for the month of January, 1967, for coming to the conclusion that rates higher than those specified in the notification published by government should be fixed as minimum wages. On the questions whether the tribunal was right in fixing wages at rates higher than the rates fixed by the government under s. 3 of the Act and whether what was fixed by the tribunal were minimum wages, 
HELD : (i) Sub-section (2A) of section 3 makes it clear that even after the fixation of minimum rates of wages by the appropriate government under s. 3 of the Act, it is open to an Industrial Tribunal adjudicating an industrial dispute relating to wages payable to the employees in a scheduled employment to fix minimum wages at higher or lower rates, if the dispute was pending at the time of fixation of minimum ages under s. 3. [924 G] (ii ) Minimum wages can provide not only for the sustenance of life, but also for the preservation of the efficiency of the worker. The rates of wages fixed by the tribunal were neither fair wages nor wages bordering on fair wages. They were minimum wages as explained by this Court. As such the capacity of the industry to pay was not a relevant consideration. [925 F] U. Unichovi v. State of Kerala. [1962] 1 S.C.R. at p. 957, applied.
 The tribunal was not wrong in taking into account the rates of minimum wages fixed in the several awards for the workmen employed in the city of Bombay as affording criteria for fixing minimum rates of wages with suitable modification for the workmen employed under the appellant. [926 E]
