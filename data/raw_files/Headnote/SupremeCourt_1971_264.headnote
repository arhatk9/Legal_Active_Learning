 The appellant was an Assistant Grade Clerk in the Police Department in the State of Punjab prior to reorganisation and the 4th respondent was occupying a similar post in PEPSU. The 4th respondent was senior to the appellant. At the time of the States reorganisation a provisional list of persons in service in the State of Punjab was prepared in 1957 and the 4th respondent was placed in a rank lower than that of his juniors including the appellant. The appellant was subsequently promoted and on March 1, 1962, he was confirmed as Deputy Superintendent (Office). The 4th respondent's seniority was however rectified in the final list and he was promoted as Deputy Superintendent (Office) in March 1960. On April 18, 1965, the Central Government issued an order under s. 117 of the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, directing the Government of Punjab to determine the seniority, pay and other matters concerning the officers included in the final gradation list in accordance with the principles set out therein. The 4th respondent was promoted on 26th July, 1966 as officiating Superintendent and was given March 1, 1962, as the deemed date of confirmation as Deputy Superintendent in accordance with the directive of the Central Government. He had thus 'become senior by virtue of his seniority in the grade of Assistants in accordance with r. 8 of Punjab Rules of 1933.
 The appellant filed a writ petition contending that since the promotion of 4th respondent was overlooked at the beginning and since the appellant was promoted earlier than the 4th respondent the confirmations and deemed date must be from the date of actual promotion according to rule 10 of the Punjab Police Clerical Service (State Service Class 111) Rules, 1960. By the time the writ petition came up for hearing the 4th respondent was given April 6, 196l as the deemed date of promotion as Superintendent after comparing his record as Deputy Superintendent with that of another officer who was senior to the appellant and who was also promoted as officiating Superintendent. On 26th February 1969, the 4th respondent was confirmed as Superintendent with effect from January 29, 1963. The High Court dismissed the appellant's writ petition.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD,: (1) The Punjab Clerical Service Rules of 1960 do not apply to persons governed by s. 115 of the States Reorganisation Act. They are governed only by the rules which immediately prior to the reorganisation governed them.
 In the present case, the Punjab Rules of 1933 governed the appellant and the PEPSU Rules of 1933 governed the 4th res- pondent. Those rules were identical, so that, under r. 8(d) the seniority of the members of the service holding the same posts shall be determined by the dates of their substantive appointment to such posts, provided that, if two or more members are subsequently appointed on the same date, in 897, the case of the members who are both or all recruited by promotion seniority shall be determined according to seniority in the appointments, from which the members are promoted. [904 E-H] (2) The 1960 rules cannot also apply because they were not issued with the previous approval of the Central Government under s. 115. Therefore, only those directions which the Central Government could give under s. 117 read with s. 127 of the 'States Reorganisation Act would govern the inter se seniority of the appellant and the 4th respondent. It cannot also be contended that when the 1960 rules were made by the Punjab Government they must be deemed to have received the previous, approval of the Central Government.
 The proviso to, s. 115(7) is clear' and categorical and therefore, previous approval must not be presumed but must be either categorically given or the approval must be unmistakably apparent from the correspondence between the State and Central Governments.

 (3) In the present case, the Government of India had given directions. Under s. 127 of the States Reorganisation Act, an overriding effect is given to such directions and they would prevail against all other service rules. The directions show that whatever promotions were made on the basis of the provisional gradation list prior to 27th February, 1961, should not be disturbed but the claims of officers for future promotion on the basis of seniority determined in accordance with the principles stated therein was not to be prejudiced, namely, the promotions made after 27-2-1961 on the basis of the provisional gradation list would be reviewed to the extent necessary to give effect to the claims of the officers who are senior in the final gradation list to the officers who have been promoted; and wherever applicable, the directions should be treated as being without prejudice to the principles of promotion on merit. Pursuant to those directions the Government of Punjab granted to the 4th respondent the deemed date of confirmation as Deputy Superintendent with effect from March 1, 1962. [900 F; 907 B-F] (4) The 4th respondent was never superseded on merit and the appellant was not promoted on merit. The 4th respondent's promotion was made late due to an error in the provisional list which was later rectified' by the Government. He was not only found to be fit, but subsequently, on a comparison of records, he was found to be superior to another officer who was senior to him and senior to the appellant. In any case among the promotees to the Superintendent's post the 4th respondent was definitely senior to the appellant. [903 B-G; 904 B-.D] (5) The appellant's specific prayer in his writ petition that he should' be deemed to have been confirmed as Superintendent from 17-10-1966 having been granted subsequently, he was not justified in making the unfair and unjust claim that the deemed date of the 4th respondent should be quashed. No injustice had been caused to the appellant because, he is now occupying the post which he would have occupied otherwise, and future promotion would not be determined by inter se seniority but on, a selection basis, depending on merit.
