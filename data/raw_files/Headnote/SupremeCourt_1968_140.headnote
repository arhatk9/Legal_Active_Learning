 The Inspector of Drugs, Agra Region, filed a complaint in July 1963 be, fore a Magistrate at Mathura alleging a preparation called anti-phlogistic plaster was manufactured and sold by a firm of which the first two -appellants were partners and the third appellant was the Manager; the label on the plaster showed the constituents to be three drugs which are to be found in pharmacopoeias prescribed under the Drugs Act, 1940 but did not bear a manufacturing licence number and other particulars required to be given under r.
 96 of the Drug Rules, 1945. As the drug fell within the mischief of s. 17(e) of the Act, it must be deemed to be 'misbranded'. Moreover the label of the plaster showed that it was -a Unani preparation which was apparently a false and misleading claim. Accordingly,- it was alleged that offences had been committed under s. 18(a)(ii) read with ss.
 27(a) and (b) of the Act for selling a misbranded drug as per s. 17(f) and s. 17(e) respectively of the Act and under s. 18(b) lead with s. 27(b) of the Act for selling the same drug which had been manufactured without a licence required for the purpose under the Act.
 The appellants filed a petition under s. 561A of the Criminal Procedure Code in the High Court in March 1964 and claimed inter alia that the plaster was not a drug as defined in the Act and praying that the entire proceedings pursuant to the complaint be quashed. It was contended that in the definition. of a drug in s. 3 (b) (i) of the Act in the expression "other than medicines and substances exclusively used or prepared for use in accordance with the Ayurvedic or Unarni Systems of medicine' the adverb "exclusively" governed the word "use' only and did not govern the words "prepared for use". The High Court was of the view that the intention of the legislature appeared to be to exclude from the definition of drug such medicines and substances which were used exclusively in accordance with the Ayurvedic or Unani system of medicine or which were prepared for use exclusively in accordance with the aforesaid system; but it declined to go into the disputed questions of fact as to whether the plasters in question fell within the exception as this was required to be determined on expert evidence On appeal to this Court by certificate, HELD: dismissing the appeal :
 The expression "substances" in the definition of drug contained in s. 3(b) means something other than "medicines". The word "and" used in the definition of drug in s. 3(b)(i) between "medicines" and "substances" is to be read disjunctively. [225 F--G] The scheme of cl. (i) of s. 3(b) is to take in all medicines substances with the exception of such medicines or substances which are 220 exclusively used or prepared for use in accordance with the Ayurvedic or Unani system of medicines. The exception made in the case of the latter class of medicines or substances was essentially meant to cover only such medicines or substances which were used in the Ayurvedic or Unani system or were prepared for use in accordance with those systems.
 [226 A-B] Medicines or substances have to be taken as a whole and in the present cases it would have to be decided by the trial court whether the plasters in question are medicines which are exclusively used or which have been prepared for use exclusively in accordance with the Ayurvedic or Unani system of medicine. The High Court was right in its view that the adverb "exclusively" must be taken to govern the words "used" as well as "prepared for use"; but each individual ingredient or component of the preparation in question will not be the decisive or determining factor and what the court will have to decide after recording such evidence as may be Produced will be whether the plasters satisfy the above test. If they fulfill that test they would be excluded from the definition of drug as contained in s. 3 (b) (i). [226 E- G] Chimanlal Jagjivandas Sheth v.
