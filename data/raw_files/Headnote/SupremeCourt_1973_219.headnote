 The first respondent was declared elected to the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly getting the highest number of votes.
 His election was challenged by 4 electors on various grounds of corrupt practices under s. 100 read with sub-sections 1, 2, 3, 3A, 4, 5, and 6 of s. 123 and for contravention of the provisions of s. 127-A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.
 It was alleged in the petition that the first respondent did not keep separate and correct account of all expenditure incurred and authorised in connection with his election, nor were his accounts kept in accordance with s. 77 of the Act read with Rule 86 of the Conduct of Election Rules. He did not obtain vouchers for every item of expenditure incurred etc., as prescribed by s. 77 of the Rules framed thereunder.
 He suppressed many items of expenditure which were in excess of the authorised amount of Rs. 12,000/-. Secondly, it was alleged by the petitioners that in an election meeting held on February 18, 1972, the agent who was an active supporter of the first respondent, made a false statement of fact in relation to the personal character and conduct of respondent no. 2, as well as petitioner No. 1. It was alleged that he made a statement in his speech in that meeting that respondent no. 2 secured the withdrawal of the petitioner no. 1 by giving him a bribe of Rs. 60,000.
 According to the petitioners, the first respondent got the said statement published in a weekly dated 23rd February 1972, and the statement was published with the consent of the first respondent as his election agent. Further, it was alleged that he printed election pamphlets and posters in which he appealed to the voters on the grounds of caste and community. The petitioners gave instances to show how the propaganda was carried on the by issuing pamphlets containing false statement of facts and which the first respondent or its maker either believed to be false or did not believe to be true.
 The first respondent denied that he made any statement in relation to the personal character or conduct of the second respondent, nor did his election agent or workers with his consent, make any such statements nor could it be said that any of the statements were reasonably calculated to prejudice the prospect of his opponent. It was also averred that the expenditure shown by him in the return of his expenses was correct and the return was in accordance with law and the rules framed thereunder ; that there was no contravention of s. 77 of the Act read with rule 86 of the Rules and denied that he incurred expenditure much more than Rs. 12,000/as alleged.
 Although the third respondent filed his written statement, practically admitting all the allegations in the petitions against the 1st respondent, subsequently he filed an application for permission to withdraw the power of his counsel one Mr. Desh mukh through whom he filed the written statement. Deshmukh was permitted to withdraw hid written statement. Thereafter, the third respondent did not take any apart proceedings. Respondent No. 4 neither appeared nor filed his written statement. Later, the trial proceeded ex-parte against. both response Nos. 3 and 4.
 Respondent No. 2 though represented, did not file his written statement. On these pleadings, as many as 31 issues were framed by the High Court of which issue no. 1 related to a preliminary objection that the petition was liable to be rejected for non-joinder of all the persons who had filed their nomination papers for the election. The High Court decided the 1st issue against the first respondent, but all other issues were held not proved by the petitioners and therefore, the petition was dismissed with costs. Before this Court, the appellants restricted their case to the three heads if corrupt practices viz.(1) under s.
 A602Sup.CI/74 430 123(4) of the Act, for Publication of false statement of facts in relation to personal character or conduct of the candidate or in relation to the candidature or its with- drawal; (2) under S. 123(6) for incurring or authorising expenditure in contravention of S. 77 of the Act and (3) under S. 123(3) for making an appeal on the ground of caste or community by printing, publishing and distributing pamphlets Ex. 42 and 43.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) Taking the last head under issues 19 and 21 which relate to two pamphlets, Ex. 42 and 43 in which a communal appeal had been made to the electors to vote for the 1st respondent there is no doubt that Ex. 42 and 43 made a communal appeal to Kunbi and Teli voters to vote for respondent no. 1. If these pamphlets are proved to have been printed, published and distributed by the 1st respondent, then he will be guilty of corrupt Practice within the meaning of sub.S. (3) of S. 123 of the Act. The High Court- found that they were neither printed, published or distributed by or on behalf of the first respondent nor by his election agent or by his workers with his consent or the consent of his election agent. On a perusal of the evidence as a whole and having considered the contentions advanced by both the parties, it cannot be said that the fin of the learned trial judge that Exts. 42 and 43 were not Printed. or published or distributed before the date of polling, is vitiated and on evidence, this finding is clearly sustainable.
 (ii) As regards the second head which relates to corrupt practice under Sub-s. (6) of Sec. 123 of the Act for incurring or authorising expenditure in contravention of S.
 77, the learned trial judge was of the view that it had not been shown how there was non-compliance of S. 77 read with S. 86 and also no arguments were advanced on this point.
 Every item of expenditure that has been shown in the return has been supported by the original voucher which was not challenged. Nor anything had been brought to the notice of the Court to show that there had been any averment in the pleading that the accounts filed were not a true copy of the accounts maintained. Therefore, the requirements of ss.. 77 
 (iii) As regards addition of Rs. 2992-95 to the amount of Rs. 7,499-11 found by the High Court, it can be pointed out that there is no justification in adding this amount to the total because Exts. 86 ad 87 were given on behalf of Jan Singh and Congress parties, whose names also had been written on those chits by the persons signing them at the petrol pump. Further, in respect of the expenditure incurred in illuminating the truck and hiring the tractor, the evidence so adduced by the witnesses were rightly disbelieved by the trial court. The evidence in connection with hiring of cycles was also not reliable. Similarly the trial Court had rightly rejected the evidence in connection with Kirti Hotel expenses of Rs 1,959/-. As regards the amounts paid to Laxmi Litho works for printing etc. the High Court was right when it said that Ex. 62 was a consolidated receipt of Rs. 765/- and this amount had been included in the return of election expenses. Similarly, the High Court had rightly rejected the allegation of certain petrol expenses incurred by the 1st respondent. A sum of Rs.
 1,938-50 however, is not accounted for and in absence of satisfactory explanation, this amount has to be taken as election expenses and must, therefore, be added.
 (iv) Even if the contention of the petitioner is accepted that Rs. 1,939/- incurred by Bhan dalal for which no account was given, Rs. 100/- paid towards the salary of Hari, the driver, Rs. 695/- in respect of Sakhare Rs. 192-40 or say Rs. 192/in respect of petrol, Rs. 600/- regarding hire charges of a taxi, hired by the father-in-law of the 1st respondent and Rs. 129/- incurred for Shende, respondent no.
 1, the several items will amount to Rs. 3,655/-. If these amounts are added to the election expenses already shown, it would come to Rs. 11,154. Even on this seeking, the election expenses are well within the limit of Rs. 12.000/- and consequently the appellant's charge against the 1st respondent for committing corrupt practice under Sub-s. (6) of s. 123 of the Act is not established.
 (v) As regards the statement made by a protagonist of a separate Vidarbha with the consent of the 1st respondent that the second respondent paid a bribe of Rs. 60,000/- to the first respondent to withdraw from the contest and the allegation that the said false statement appeared in a paper with the consent of the 1st respondent, the 1st respondent denied that the above statement was ever made or that 431 it was made in his presence or with his consent, nor did he have any knowledge that it was published paper with this consent or that the paper was acting as his agent. Further, the trial court held that the witnesses who gave evidence in support of the allegations were not present at the meeting.
 it was not proved that the first respondent ever consented at the second respondent to make the alleged false statement. The trial court, therefore, rightly rejected the allegations.
 (vi) In examining the question whether the allegations about the commission of corrupt practices by a returned candidate, the Court has to keep in view that the allegations about the commission of corrupt practices are of a quasi-criminal nature, the proof whereof has a double consequence of not only setting aside the election of the returned candidate, but also imposing subsequent disqualification debarring him from becoming a candidate at any election for a period of 6 years. Inasmuch as the charge is a serious one and is of a quasi-criminal nature, the onus of Proving the essential ingredients prescribed by sub-s.(4) of s. 123 is on the person who allege them.
 (vii)In the present case, from the evidence, it is not proved that the offending statement was made by Dhote an agent of respondent no 1, in the meeting or that it was made with the consent of respondent no. 1, The appellants have not established the corrupt practice under this head also by any credible evidence.
 (viii) As regards the costs "incurred" in section 96 and 119 of the Act, it means what is actually spent,.
 Accordingly, in the present case, it was incumbent in the High Court to award costs to the first respondent which costs he was entitled to if he could show that he bad incurred them. Admittedly, there was no proof of payment of any fee to counsel by the first respondent. As such,he will not been titled to the amount of Rs.400/- per diem awarded by the High Court. The first respondent cannot be allowed to file any fee certificate before this Court since he had not done earlier.
