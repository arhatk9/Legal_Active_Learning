 The respondents, who were the employees of the Hydel Department of the Government of Punjab, were retrenched on the completion of the work assigned to them. Their claim for payment of gratuity under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 having been rejected by the appellants, they moved the Labour Court under s. 33-C(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The Labour Court allowed their claim. The High Court dismissed the appellant's appeal in limine.
 In appeal it was contended that (1) the view of the Labour Court that the project was an establishment within the meaning of the definition of "Industrial establishment" contained in s. 2(ii) (g) of the Payment of Wages Act was erroneous, and the Payment of Wages Act being a Central Act is not an enactment contemplated by s. 1(3)(b) of the Payment of Gratuity Act; (2) since retrenchment is not superannuation or retirement or resignation or death or disablement due to accident or disease as defined in s. 4(1) of the Act, the retrenched employees were not entitled to gratuity; and (3) the Payment of Gratuity Act being a self- contained code, it excludes recourse to any other statute for claiming relief under this Act and, therefore, the respondents application under s. 33-C(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act was misconceived.
 Allowing the appeal in part;

 HELD : 1(a). It is not correct to say that what is contemplated by s. 1(3)(b) of the Payment of Gratuity Act is a law enacted by the State Legislature and not a Central Act like the Payment of Wages Act. There can be no doubt that when s. 1(3)(b) speaks of "any law for the time being in force in relation to shops and establishments in a State" it includes the Payment of Wages Act, which is a law in force in the State. [956 B-C] (b) The Payment of Wages Act is a statute which, while it may not relate to shops. relates to a class of establishments, i.e. industrial establishments. There is no warrant for limiting the meaning of the expression "law" in s. 1(3)(b) to a law which relates to both shops and establishments such as the Punjab Shops and Commercial Establishments Act, 1958. The expression is comprehensive in its scope and can mean a law in relation to shops as well as, separately, a law in relation to establishments or a law in relation to shops 954 and commercial establishments and a law in relation to non- commercial establishments. Had the intention of Parliament been to refer to a law relating to commercial establishments it would not have left the expression "establishments" unqualified. There is no reason for giving a limited meaning to s. 1(3) (b). This section applies to every establishment within the meaning of any law for the time being in force in relation to establishments in a State. Such an establishment would include an industrial establishment within the meaning of s. 2(ii)(g) of the Payment of Wages Act. Therefore, the Payment of Gratuity Act applies to an establishment in which any work relating, among others, to the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity or any other form of power is being carried on as defined in s. 1(3)(b) of the Act. [956 D-H, 957 A] 
 2. The expression "retrenchment" which has been defined in s. 2(q) to mean "termination of the service of an employee otherwise than on superannuation" is framed in the widest terms. Except for superannuation, any termination of service would amount to "retirement" for the purposes of the Act. Retrenchment is termination of service. It is immaterial that the termination is occasioned by the need to discharge surplus labour. [957 E-F] Bersi Light Railway Company Labour v. K. M. Joglekar, AIR 1957 SC 121, referred to.
 3(a). Parliament intended that proceedings for payment of gratuity due under the Act must be taken under that Act and not under any other. There fore the respondents' application did not lie under s. 33-C(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act. and the Labor Court had no jurisdiction to entertain it. [959-E] (b). The Payment of Gratuity Act is a complete code containing derailed provisions covering all the essential features of the scheme for payment of gratuity. For the enforcement of its provisions, the Act provides for the appointment of a Controlling Authority for administering the Act. He has been invested with an amplitude of power for the full discharge of his responsibilities under the Act. Any error committed by him can be corrected in appeal by the appropriate Government or an appellate authority particularly constituted under the Act. [959 B-D]
