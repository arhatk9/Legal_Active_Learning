 The assessee, among other things, imports and distributes vanaspati as agent of certain companies.. For the year 1957- 58, he filed a return on a turn over of Rs. 1,66,387.3 P and paid tax of Rs. 1060.30. Before the assessing authority, he accepted the liability of Rs. 10,339.19p. On independent enquiries, the Sales Tax Officer came to the conclusion that the turn over was Rs. 58,06,132.30 and the tax liability was to the extent of Rs. 3,62,691.62P. The tax authority had to resort to best assessment, as the assessee failed to appear, although 30 adjournments were given. The assessee filed an appeal to the appellate authority without depositing the tax, as required by proviso to Sec. 9 of the Act. The appeal was dismissed for non-compliance of Sec. 9. At the instance of the assessee, the question of maintainability of appeal was referred to the High Court. During the pendency of the reference, the assessee 'filed writ petitions challenging the validity of the Notification issued under section 3A and the legality of the proceedings. The High Court held that the appeal was properly dismissed. Before this Court, the following questions were raised : (i) that the assessee-appellant being an 'importer cannot be considered as one of the successive dealers in the series of sales as contemplated by Section 3A and, therefore, the Notification under section 3(A) was ultra vires, and (ii) that the dismissal ,of appeal, for want of payment of the admitted tax under section 9(1) of the Act was illegal.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) An importer is one of the dealers. He is the first dealer in the State. Chain of successive dealers begins from the first dealer and it goes to the last dealer. In view of this, dealer in this chain can be considered as a "successive dealer". The series does not begin in the middle. The notification under section 3 is a Commissioner of Sales Tax (19 S.T.C. 241.) approved. [4266 C-D) (ii) The assessee had accepted the liability of Rs. 10,339/- before the tax authorities. Under Rules 41(2) read with 12 he was bound lo submit the quarterly return and also deposit the tax due in, accordance with the return. The expression "tax,' admitted" in proviso to Section 9(1) means tax admitted before the assessing authority and not before the appellate authority. As payment of the admitted tax is one ,,of the conditions for the maintainability of the appeal, Section 9(1) would be rendered wholly useless, if it is interpreted to mean tax ,admitted in the memorandum of appeal. Ordinarily, no interpretation should be placed on a provision which would have the effect of making The provision either otiose or a dead letter. [426G-H; 427A-D] 425 Chanshyam Dass Balmukand v.
