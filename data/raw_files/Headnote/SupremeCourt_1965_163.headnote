 The appellant's suit for recovery of possession of property and mesne profits filed in 1950 was substantially decreed by the trial court. The appellant however filed an appeal before the Kerala High Court against the decree in so far as it went against him. The appeal was heard in 1960 after the Kerala High Court Act 5 of 1959 had been passed and under its provisions the appeal was heard by a single judge. When the appellant had filed his suit, and later on his appeal, the Travancore-Cochin High Court Act of 1949 was in force and under that Act the appeal would have been heard by a Division Bench. On the judgment of the High Court going against him the appellant came to the Supreme Court by special leave. It was contended on his behalf on the basis of kadhakrishan's case that the Kerala High Court Act 5 of 1959 could not retrospectively take away his right to be heard by a Division Bench, which he had under the law as it stood when he filed his suit and appeal. Reliance was also placed on Grikapati Veeraya's case for the proposition that the institution of a suit carries with it the implication that all rights of appeal then in force are preserved to the parties thereto till the rest of the career of the suit.
 
HELD : No party has a vested right to be heard by a specified number of judges. The Travancore-Cochin High Court Act of 1949 did not confer any right of appeal on the appellant which has been taken away by the later Act. It only provided for procedural matters which are dealt with by several High Courts under the Letters Patent. The con- tentions based on Radhakrishan's case and Garikapati Veeraya's case must therefore be rejected. [578 B-G] Radhakrishan v. Shridhar, I.L.R. 1950 Nag. 532, disapproved.
 Mahendra v. Darsan, I.L.R. 31 Pat. 446 and Garikapati Veeraya v. N. Subbaiah Choudhury, [1957] INSC 8; [1957] S.C.R. 488, referred to.
 Ittavlra Mathai v. Varkey Varkey & Anr. [1963] INSC 2; [1964] 1 S.C.R. 495, followed.
 It could not also be said that by depriving the appellant of the right to have his appeal heard by a Division Bench his further right of appeal to this Court under Art. 133 had been affected. Once it is held that no party has a vested right to have his appeal heard by more than one Judge of the High Court, no right to prefer an appeal under Art. 133 can be said to vest in him, the said right being unavailable in a ease heard and disposed of by a single Judge of the High Court.
