 P held the ex-proprietary tenancy of certain lands and, on the 5th June, 1947, executed a sub-lease in favour of the appellants which laid down that the tenancy was to commence from 1st July, 1947 and which was registered on the 22nd June. On 15th January, 1951, P surrendered his tenancy rights to the landlord who in turn, executed a lease in respect of the land in favour of the responden's. The appellants however continued in possession. The U.P.
 Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 came into force on 1st July, 1952 and both the appellants as well as the respondents claimed to have become Sirdars of the land under the Act. The appellants instituted a suit for a declaration that they had become Sirdars of the land under s. 19(vii) by virtue of being sub-tenants within the meaning of s. 47(4) of the U.P. Tenancy Act, 1939. The Trial Court decreed the suit in the appellants' 'favour but a Division Bench of the High Court set aside the decree.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended, inter alia, on behalf of the appellants that although P had surrendered his rights as ex-proprietary tenant on 15th January, 1951, their own sub-tenancy continued by virtue of the provisions of s.
 295A of the Tenancy Act which was introduced into that Act by the amendment Act X of 1947 that came into force, on the 14th June, 1947: it was claimed that s. 295A became applicable to the appellants because a sub-lease in their favour was executed on 5th June. 1947. prior to the enforcement of Act X of 1947 so that on the date of commencement of this Act the appellants continued to be the subtenants under s. 295A; it was further contended that though the sub-lease in favour of the appellants was not for any fixed term mentioned in the sublease itself, it should be held from the surrounding facts and circumstances that the sub-lease was for a period of five years as, under the Tenancy Act, an ex-proprietary tenant could sublet his holding for a period not exceeding 5 years 
HELD : The appellants' possession subsequent to 30th June, 1951 could not be held to be in pursuance of a right conferred on a sub-tenant by s. 47(4) of the U.P. Tenancy Act, 1939 and consequently, the land was not held by the appellants in the capacity mentioned in s. 19(vii) of the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950.
 (i) The appellants were not Sub-tenants on 14th June, 1947 which was the date of commencement of the U.P. Act X of 1947 and, therefore, s. 295A of the Tenancy Act never became applicable to their case. The sub-lease clearly laid down that the sub-tenancy was to commence from 1st July, 1947 which was a date subsequent to 14th June, 1947. The 871 mere fact that the sub-lease was executed on 5th June, 1947 by P could not mean that the appellants' sub-lease was with effect from that date.
 Mere delivery of the lease and its Counter-part by one party to the other as envisaged under s. 55(1) of the Tenancy Act does not make the lessee under the lease a lessee from the date of delivery of the written documents nor is any such principle laid down in s 55(1). Furthermore it was in any case not shown, on the facts, such delivery had taken place prior to 14th June, 1947. [874 G-H] (ii) Nothing in the conduct of the parties had been brought on record to show that the sub-lease was intended to remain effective for a period of 5 years and on the facts of the case the sub-lease must be held to be from year to year and the appellants' rights determined accordingly.

 The appellants had obtained the. sub-lease with effect from 1st July, 1947, and were entitled to hold the land for one year which would expire on the 30th June, 1948 but, if they were allowed to continue by their landholder on, 1st July, 1948, they became entitled to hold the land for another year expiring on 30th June, 1949, and so on from year to year.
 Since the appellants were allowed by P to continue in possession after 1st July 1950, they were sub-tenants of P under the sub-lease and were entitled to continue in possession upto 30th June, 1951. But on 15th January, 1951.
 P lost his right as chief-tenant and the effect of s. 47(1) of the Tenancy Act was that, with effect from that date, the rights of the appellants as sub-tenants of P became extinguished. Their possession after that date could no longer be held to be in the capacity of sub-tenants of P but was under a legal right which accrued to them under s.
 47(4). This is a limited right to continue in possession for the remainder of the term of the sub-lease or for five years whichever period may be shorter. In the present case, the right granted by s. 47(4) to the appellants could be exercised by them only upto 30th June, 1951. [879 C-F] Utility Articles Manufacturing Co. v. Raja Bahadur Motilal Bombay Ltd., A.I.R. 1943 Bom. 306 and Queen's Club Gardens Estate Ltd. v. Bignell, [19241 1 K.B.D. 117; referred to.
 There was no force in the contention that when the appellants continued in possession of the disputed land after 30th June, 1951, they did so in exercise of the same right which they possessed on 30th June, 1951, as that right was not extinguished by eviction from the land. The Tight under s. 47(4) is granted by the, statute itself for a limited period, and, once that period expires, it cannot be held that the right continues thereafter. There is no requirement in law that, after the expiry of that period, there must be eviction 'from the land in order to extinguish the 'right granted by s. 47(4).
