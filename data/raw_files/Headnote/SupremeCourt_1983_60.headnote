 The appellant filed a suit to recover possession of properties belonging to her deceased brother Bua Singh claiming to be his nearest heir. The suit was contested by the sons of Bua Singh's paternal uncle. Most of the suit properties were ancestral, while only a few of them were non-ancestral. Proceeding on the basis that according to the custom, the sister was excluded by the collaterals in the case of ancestral property, the trial court held that the appellant was entitled to succeed only to the non-ancestral property of Bua Singh. While the first appeal was rejected on the ground that she did not present the appeal in person as required by 0.33, r. 3, the second appeal was rejected on the ground that a copy of the trial court judgment was filed after the expiry of the period of limitation.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD : 1. Property inherited from paternal ancestors is 'ancestral property' as regards the male issue of the propositus, but it is his absolute property and not ancestral property as regards other relations. [23 A] Mulla : Principles of Hindu law, 15th ed., pp. 289 and 291 relied on.
 In the instant case, no doubt, the properties which have been found by the lower courts to be 'ancestral properties' in the hands of Bua Singh are properties which originally belonged to Bua Singh's ancestors. But Bua Singh was the last male holder of the property and he had no male issue. There was no surviving member of a joint family, be it a descendent or otherwise, who could take the property by survivorship. The respondents were collaterals of Bua Singh and as regards them the property was not 'ancestral property' and hence the appellant was the preferential heir.
 The appellant was, therefore, entitled to a decree in respect of all the plaint properties.
 
 2. Rules of procedure are meant to advance the cause of justice and not to short-circuit decision or merits. The lower Courts were in error in dismissing 21 the appeals preferred by the appellant. When the District Judge had admitted the first appeal there was no point in dismissing it thereafter on the ground that the memorandum of appeal had not been presented by the party herself. The High Court should have condoned the delay in filing a copy of the trial court's judgment and the second appeal should have been disposed of on merits.
