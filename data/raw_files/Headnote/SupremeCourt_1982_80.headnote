 For a candidate to be deemed to be set up by a political party under paragraph 13 of the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order 1968, it is essential that a notice in writing to that effect signed by the duly authorised office-bearer of the political party is delivered to the returning officer of the constituency not later than 3 p.m. on the last day of withdrawal of candidatures. The allotment of any symbol to a candidate by the returning officer is final under sub-r. (5) of r. 10 of the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961 except where it is inconsistent with any directions issued by the Election Commission in that behalf.
 The appellant, the respondent and one Jagmohan Singh contested the election to the Punjab Legislative Assembly from the same constituency and the respondent was declared elected. The appellant challenged the election of the respondent under s. 100(1)(d)(iv) read with s. 123(7) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. Paragraphs 4 to 18 of the petition related to change of symbols allotted to the candidates. It was averred therein that the last day for withdrawal of nomination papers was May 5, 1980; that a notice in writing signed by the authorised office-bearer of the Indian National Congress (I) to the effect that Jagmohan Singh was contesting as the candidate of that party 703 had been delivered to the Returning Officer on that day;
 that the Returning Officer had on May 8, 1980, intimated by a letter that on receipt of instructions from the Election Commission a change had been effected in the symbols allotted to the candidates according to which the symbol 'hand' reserved for the Indian National Congress (I) had been allotted to the respondent; that in terms of paragraph 13 of the Symbols Order Jagmohan Singh ought to have been deemed to be the candidate set up by the Indian National Congress (I); that the Election Commission had no power to direct re-allotment of the symbol once allotted to a candidate under sub-r. (4) of r. 10 and therefore the action of the Returning Officer in recalling the allotment of the symbol 'hand' to Jagmohan Singh was in violation of the Act and the rules made thereunder. The respondent contested these averments in his written statement and referred to the circumstances in which the Election Commission had issued the instructions relating to change of symbols.
 The respondent raised a preliminary objection that the averments in paragraphs 4 to 18 of the petition did not disclose any cause of action and the High Court, accepting the objection, ordered deletion of those paragraphs from the petition. The High Court held that it was incumbent on the appellant to find out the circumstances in which the Election Commission had passed the order relating to change of symbols and that in the absence of those material circumstances non-compliance with r. 10(5) or Paragraph 13 of the Symbols Order could not be spelled out. The High Court further held that the Symbols Order was not an order made under the Act and therefore s. 100(1)(d)(iv) was not attracted.
 In appeal, counsel for appellant contended that paragraphs 4 to 18 of the petition contained all the material facts necessary to show that the change of symbols was in breach of r. 10(5) and paragraph 13 of the Symbols Order and the High Court was not justified in ordering their deletion.
 Counsel for respondent contended that paragraphs 4 to 18 of the petition did not disclose any cause of action as there was non-disclosure of facts necessary to show how the order of the Election Commission was illegal, that the High Court was justified in striking out those paragraphs under O. Vl, r. 16 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 as it had no power to direct further and better particulars under O.
 Vl, r. 5. Laying emphasis on the words "under the Act" occurring in s. 100(1)(d)(iv) he contended that the Symbols Order was not an Order made under the Act.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: Cl. (a) of sub-s.(1) of s. 83 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 enjoins that an election petition shall contain a concise statement of the material facts on which the election petitioner relies. This clause is based on the provisions of O. VI, r. 2(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 from which it is clear that the statement of material facts ought not to contain the evidence by which they are proved. Cl. (b) of sub-s. (1) of s. 83 states that an 704 election petitioner must set forth full particulars of any corrupt practice on which he challenges the election of the returned candidate. This clause is based on O VI, r. 4 of the Code and the High Court has ample power while trying an election petition to direct further and better particulars as to the nature of the claim or defence under O.VI, r.5.
 The word 'material' in cl. (a) means facts necessary for the purpose of formulating a complete cause of action; and if any one material fact is omitted, the statement or plaint is bad; it is liable to be struck out. The function of 'particulars' in cl. (b) is quite different; the use of particulars is intended to meet a further and quite separate requirement of pleading imposed in fairness and justice to the returned candidate. The function of 'particulars' is to fill in the picture of the election-petitioner's cause of action with information sufficiently detailed to put the returned candidate on his guard as to the case he has to meet and to enable him to prepare for trial in a case where his election is challenged on the ground of any corrupt practice. Under O.VI, r.5. 'particulars' will be ordered of the 'material facts' on which the party pleading relies for his claim or defence. If a party's pleading is defective he can also seek leave to alter and amend his own defective pleading under O.VI, r.17. There is no express rule providing for the consequence of a party failing to deliver 'particulars' required by order of the Court but the decisions are to the effect that either by the order calling for particulars or by a later order the court can direct the claim or defence to be struck out under O.VI, r.16. [724B;
 723 H; 724 C-F; 726 C-E; 724 G-H; 725 A] In the instant case the question whether the order passed by the High Court could be justified under O.VI, r.16 would depend upon whether or not the election petition was in conformity with the requirements of s.83. A preliminary objection that the election petition does not contain a concise statement of material facts on which the petitioner relies is but a plea in the nature of demurrer and in deciding the question the court had to assume for this purpose that the averments contained in the petition were true. Although the High Court observed that a question of this nature had to be decided on a consideration of the averments in the election petition alone, it later on made certain observations which tend to show that the allegations in the written statement of the respondent were very much in its mind. It is no part of the statement of an election- petitioner to anticipate the defence and to state what he would have to say in answer to it. The High Court cast on the appellant the burden of disclosing facts not within his knowledge. This approach was unwarranted. The High Court was not justified in directing that the averments in paragraphs, 4 to 18 of the petition be deleted on the ground that there was non-disclosure of material facts sufficient to give rise to a cause of action under s. 100(1)(d)(iv). It is not clear from the order whether the High Court proceeded to act under O.VII, r. 1 1 (a) or under O.VII, r. 16. It could not have acted under O. VII, r. 1 1 (a) as, under that rule, when it is found that the plaint discloses no cause of action, it is obligatory to reject the plaint as a whole and not any particular portion thereof. The High Court's Order cannot also be sustained under O.VI, r.16 because there was no finding that the averments in paragraphs 4 to 18 were either unnecessary, frivolous or vexatious, or were such as may tend to prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the election, or were such as to constitute an abuse of the process of the court.

 603, referred to.
 (b) The contention that the High Court had no power to direct further and better particulars under O.VI, r.5 cannot be accepted. Sub-s. (1) of s.87 enacts that the trial of an election petition shall be, as nearly as may be, in accordance with the procedure applicable under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 to the trial of suits, subject to the provisions of the Act and of any rules made thereunder.
 There are no express provisions in the Act or in the rules made thereunder to deal with a situation like the one presented in the instant case. The provisions of the Code accordingly must apply in such a case as provided by sub- s.(1) of s 87. That being so, the provisions of O.VI which are integral part of the Code come into play except to the extent modified by sub-s. (5) of s. 86. [727 A-B; 726 E-G] Hari Vishnu Kamath v.

 2. The High Court was in error in holding that the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968 was not an order made under the Representation of the People Act, 1951. The Act is a law made by Parliament under Art.
 327 of the Constitution to provide for conduct of elections and the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961 are rules framed by the Central Government under s. 169 in consultation with the Election Commission for regulating the mode of holding elections. Rule 5 requires the Election Commission to specify the symbols that may be chosen by candidates and the restrictions to which their choice shall be subjected. Rule 10 provides for allotment of symbols to contesting candidates by the returning officer subject to any general or special directions issued in that behalf by the Election Commission. By virtue of Art. 324 of the Constitution the authority to conduct all elections to Parliament and State Legislatures is vested in the Election Commission. The Symbols Order has been issued by the Election Commission in exercise of its powers under Art. 324 read with s. 5 and 10.
 The primary object of the Symbol Order is to provide for specification, reservation, choice and allotment of symbols at elections in parliamentary and assembly constituencies.
 It is a matter of common knowledge that elections in our country are fought on the basis of symbols. It must but logically follow as a necessary corollary that the Symbols Order is an order made under the Act. Any other view would be destructive of the very fabric of our system of holding parliamentary and assembly constituency elections in the country on the basis of adult suffrage.
