 The co-sharers with the appellant, in the proprietary interest of certain lands, sold their share to the respondents. The appellant filed a suit for preemption, and in pursuance of the decree in his favour deposited the consideration of the sale deed in court. But, before that date, that is, from July 1, 1970, the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act. 1950. had come into force in the district where the property was situate. On the question whether the decree was executable.
 ^ 
 HELD: The decree was inexecutable in view of ss. 4 and 6 of the Act.
 (a) Having deposited the money, the appellant got himself substituted for the vendees in respect of the share in the property. But, since the vendees were still in possession after their purchase, the appellant had to obtain possession of the land and for that purpose had to take execution proceedings. The appellants' right to possession was. thus, based upon the decree which was itself based on the fact that he was a co-sharer of the proprietary right in the land. Since, however, on and from July 1, 1970, under ss. 4 and 6 of the Act, all rights. title and interest in that land ceased to exist and vested in the State, and nothing survived in favour of the erstwhile proprietors-the appellant or the vendors-the decree became devoid of substance and incapable of execution. It could not be contended that the decree was still executable in the absence of an express provision voiding the decree or taking away the right under the decree by operation of law. [196B- G] (b) The decision of this Court in Rana Sheo Ambar Singh v. Allahabad Bank Ltd., [1961] INSC 195; [1962] 2 S.C.R. 441 is a complete answer to the submission of the appellant. In that case. it was held that on the application of the Act to the mortgagor's estate, but for s. 6(h) of the Act, the mortgage would have nothing to proceed against under his mortgage- decree, and that under that provision, a special remedy was provided in favour of a mortgagee for proceeding only against the compensation money under s. 73. Transfer of Property Act.[198 A-C] Shivshankar Prasad Shah and Ors. v. Baikunth Nath Singh
