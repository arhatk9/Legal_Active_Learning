 In exercise of its power under Section 4 of the Madras Electricity Supply Undertakings (Acquisition) Act, 1954, the Government of Madras acquired the appellants' undertaking and its properties were taken over on the date of vesting viz. October 15, 1956. As per the option exercised by the _appellant under S. 6, the, appellant was paid a compensation of Rs. 18,42,312/ applying Basis 'A' method.
 In the course of the appellant's assessment for the assess- ment year 1957-58, corresponding to the accounting year commencing on April 1, 1955 and ending on October 14, 1956, the Income Tax Officer considered the question whether the compensation received by the appellant for the acquisition of its undertaking was in the nature of a capital gain within the meaning of S. 12 B of the Income Tax Act, 1922.
 Deducting a sum of Rs. 6.45,710/- representing the value of fixed assets from the compensation paid by the State Government to the appellant, the Income Tax Officer treated the sum of Rs. 11,95,602/- as capital gains which was liable to be brought to tax. The appellant's contention before the appellate Assistant Commissioner that the compulsory acquisition of its undertaking was riot a 'transfer' within the meaning of S. 12 B (1) of the Act and therefore, it was not liable to capital gain tax failed. The Tribunal in further appeal and the High Court on a reference confirmed the said view. The High Court on an application under Section 256(2) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, decided against the appellant on the question whether part of the compensation was paid towards good-will and therefore exempt from tax.
 Dismissing the appeals by certificate the Court, 
HELD : 1. The word 'transfer' is comprehensive and is regarded generally as comprehending within its scope transfers both of the voluntary and involuntary kinds.
 Without more, therefore there is no reason for limiting the operations of the word 'transfer' to voluntary acts of transfer so as to exclude compulsory acquisitions of property. [917 G-H] 
2. (a) The word 'transfer cannot be construed ajusdem generis with the words sale'.'exchange' or relinquishment'.
 [918 A] (b) There is no room for the application of ejusdem generis doctrine unless one finds a category and where the words are clearly wide in their meaning, they ought not to be qualified on the ground of their association with other words. [918 C-D] In the instant case, in the absence of a distinct genus or category, no presumption can arise that the word 'transfer' must be construed' in the sense of a voluntary act of transfer since 'sale', exchange' or 'relinquishment' are in the normal acceptation of those terms voluntary acts. The words (a) sale, (b) exchange, (c) relinquishment and (d) transfer must accordingly be given their plain and natural meaning and there is no justification for restricting the wide comprehension of the last of the four words to voluntary transfers by the application of the ejusdem generis rule.

 (c)The proviso to S. 12B of the Income Tax Act, 1922. as it stood prior to its amendment by the Finance Act (No. 3) 1956 shows that the word 'transfer' which occurred in sub- section (1) was intended to include transfer of capital assets by reason of the compulsory acquisition thereof under an law for the time being in force relating to the compulsory acquisition of property for public purposes. The object of the proviso, clearly, was to take away transfers by way of compulsory acquisition from the scope of sub- section (1). It is impossible on any other hyprothesis to give intelligible meaning to the exception carved out by the proviso. After the amendment of S. 12B by the Act of 1956, the exception carved out by the proviso in favour of 'transfer of capital assets by reason of the compulsory acquisition thereof was deleted. The deletion of the particular clause of the proviso contains an indelible reflection of the true legislative intent which is, that the transfer of capital assets by reason of compulsory acquisition are comprehended within the meaning of the word 'transfer'. If an existing title is extinguished and a new one is created, there is within the, meaning of section 12B (1) of the Act of 1922, transfer of a capital asset. The fact that the divestiture of title takes place under a law relating to compulsory acquisition of property would make no difference to that position. The word 'transfer' which occurs in section 12B (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1922, is an expression of wide comprehension and includes within its sweep both voluntary and involuntary transfers.[918 F, 919 B-H] Commissioner of Income Tax, Madhya Pradesh v.

 3.(a) The High Court has correctly negatived the appellants' contention that goodwill should be valued separately and a part of the compensation attributable to it should be deducted from the compensation. [920 G] (b)Since the question as to whether a part of the compensation is attributable to the goodwill of the appellant's business is a mixed question of law and fact and since not only was the question not raised by the appellant before the Income-tax Officer or the Appellate Assistant Commissioner but, having raised it before the Tribunal, the appellant placed no material before it on the basis of which good-will could be evaluated and a part of the compensation properly apportioned to the goodwill of the business, the appellant cannot be allowed to raise. the contention involved in two questions raised before the High Court under S. 256(2) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
