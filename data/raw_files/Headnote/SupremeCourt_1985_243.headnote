 The Respondent company manufactures sugar from sugar cane. On November 18, 1978, the Central Government issued a notice under sub-para (1) of para 3 of the Sugar Undertakings (Taking over of Management) Ordinance, 1978 stating that as on November 15, 1978, the respondent-company was in arrears of cane dues in relation to the cane purchased before that date for the purpose of its sugar undertaking to the extent of more than ten per cent of the total price of the cane purchased by it during the immediately proceeding "sugar year", the total arrears being Rs. 475.99 lacs, and called upon the respondent to explain in writing the circumstances in which the sugar undertaking had failed to clear the arrears of cane dues and why the undertaking should not be taken over by the Central Government under that Ordinance. On November 25, 1978 the respondent replied to the notice denying that it was in arrears. However, the Central Government issued an order dated December 1, 1978 reciting that it was satisfied after considering the report sent by the respondent that the arrears of cane dues had not been cleared by the respondent, and directing that the management of the sugar undertaking would vest in the Central Government for a period of three years commencing on and from December 2, 1978.
 The respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court which was allowed. It was held that while the Central Government could take action in respect of the arrears due in respect of sugar cane purchased during the current "sugar year" it could not do so in respect of the arrears pertaining to a preceding "sugar year", and therefore, the impugned orders were invalid. The High Court quashed the order and directed handing over of the possession of the sugar undertaking.
 759 Allowing the appeal of the Union of India to this Court, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The language of clause (b) of sub-section (a) of section 3 is clear. It speaks of arrears of cane dues in relation to the cane purchased "before that date". The language is wide enough to include all the arrears of cane dues accumulated upto "that date" including the arrears pertaining to sugar cane purchased in earlier years. The judgment and order of the High Court is set aside and the writ petition is dismissed. [765 D-E] 
 2. The Sugar Undertakings (Taking over of Management) Ordinance, 1978 was replaced by the Sugar Undertakings (Taking over of Management) Act, 1978. An analysis of the provisions of the Ordinance, and of the Act which replaced it, indicates that the principal purpose of the legislation is to put mismanaged sugar undertakings into proper functioning order by empowering the Central Government to assume the temporary management of the undertakings. [761 E;
 763 H - 764 A] 
 3. The legislation indicates two kind of cases evidencing mismanagement. One is the failure of the undertaking to commence the manufacture of sugar on or before the appointed day in the sugar year, or where the sugar undertaking, having started the manufacture of sugar on or before that date, has ceased to manufacture sugar before the expiry of the average period of manufacture of sugar. (Clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 3). The other is the case where the sugar undertaking has accumulated arrears of cane dues upto a date in a sugar year to the extent of more than ten per cent of the total price of the cane purchased during the immediately preceding sugar year. (Clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 3). The two cases merely provide evidence from which a presumption can be drawn that the sugar undertaking is in distress. [764 B- C] 
 4. The action intended under the legislation is intended to serve more than the object of recovering arrears of cane dues. If the object of recovering arrears of cane dues alone was the purpose to be achieved, there was already sufficient provision in existing statutes such as the U.P.
 Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and Purchase) Act, 1953, which by section 17 thereof provides for the recovery of arrears of cane dues. The impugned Ordinance and Act cannot be considered at par with the statutes providing merely for the recovery of arrears of cane dues. The object of the legislation covers a wider range of purpose. [764 G 765 A] 
 5. The permissible limit of arrears of cane dues provided for in cl.(b) of sub-section (a) of section 3 merely constitutes a standard for determining whether the arrears of cane dues fall 760 within the permissible limit or have exceeded it. It does nothing more than that. It cannot be extended as a criterion or determining whether the arrears of cane dues should be confined to the sugar purchased during the instant sugar year or can include also the arrears in relation to sugar purchased during an earlier sugar year.
