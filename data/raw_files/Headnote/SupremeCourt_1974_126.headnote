 Section 11 of the Mysore Land Acquisition Act (17 of 1961) provides for an award by the Deputy Commissioner allowing compensation for the land acquired. The proviso to the section states that no such award shall be made by the Deputy Commissioner without the previous approval of the State Government. In a petition under article 226 of the Constitution the appellant whose lands were acquired by the Government questioned the validity of the proviso to s. 11 and section 15A of the Act. The High Court held the proviso to be valid on the ground that the Deputy Commissioner was an agent of the State Government and the compensation fixed under the award was an offer made on behalf of the Government.
 On appeal to this Court it was contended (1) that the proviso to section 11 offended article 31(2) of the Constitution and (2) that there were no guide lines for the approval of the State Government under the proviso to section 11 of the Act.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) The award made under section 11 of the 1961 Act is an offer of compensation. The Deputy Commissioner who makes an offer is an agent of the State Government. The Government is the ultimate authority to approve the award.
 Therefore the proviso enjoins that no award shall be made without the previous approval of the State Government. it is wrong to suggest that any opinion of the Deputy Commissioner is being over reached by the State Government. The Deputy Commissioner is not acting in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity in making the award under section 11 of the Act.
 The area of authority of the Deputy Commissioner is subject to approval by the State Government. Finality of the award under section 11 of the Act rests with the State Government.
 [559F-H] (2) The Government, in approving the award has to take into consideration the provisions of the Act. Any grievance with regard to the quantum of compensation or any other grievance on account of compensation is capable of being remedied under the provisions of the Act. [560A-B] The provisions contained in sections 15, 23, 24, and 26 indicate that the award under section 11 of the Act is not final as far as the appellant was concerned. The matters to be considered in determining the compensation as embodied in section .23 of the Act are to be kept in mind, not only by the Collector under section 15 of the Act but also by the court under section 23 of the Act.
