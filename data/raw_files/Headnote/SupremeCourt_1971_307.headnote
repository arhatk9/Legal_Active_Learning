 The Indian National Congress, a recognised national party under the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968 had as its symbol "Two Bullocks with Yoke on" for the purpose of elections. The Congress is a voluntary association with its own Constitution. In 1969, following differences over the choice of the congress nominee for the office of the President of India, the Congress split itself into two groups congress 'O' and congress 'J'. On January 15, 1970 a communication was addressed by the Election Commission to the Secretary of congress 'J' as well as that of congress 'O' stating that "a dispute appears to have arisen as to which of the two groups is the recognised political party known as the Indian National Congress" for the purpose of the Election Symbols Order and that the commission was required to take a decision in the matter in terms of para 15 read with para 18 of the Order. Both the groups presented their claim before the Commission.. The Commission framed and settled the following four points for consideration :
 (1) Has the Election Commission jurisdiction within the meaning of paragraph 15 of the Election Symbol (Reservation & Allotment) Order 1968, to decide whether any one or none of the rival section or groups of the Indian National Congress,."national party", is the said Indian National Congress ? (2) Has the Election Commission, for the purpose of undertaking the inquiry to come to a decision as aforesaid, been satisfied on information in its possession that there are two rival section or groups of the said Indian National Congress each claiming to be that Congress ? (3) What is the nature of an election symbol under the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968 and whether an election symbol, whether reserved or free, is property ? (4) Whether on the facts and circumstances available to the Election Commission, any of the alleged rival sections of the said Indian National Congress is that Congress for the purpose of the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order 1968; if so: which is that rival section, or, whether on the facts and circumstances referred to above, none of the rival sections of the _said Indian National Congress is that Congress? The contention that the Working Committee or the President of Congress 'O', who was the President of the Indian National Congress at the time of the split, were the only authorities to give a binding decision was repelled by the Commission. The Commission held that the very existence of a conflict was enough to create jurisdiction to find out and decide, on- 319 the facts and circumstances established, whether the conflict was genuine and whether the claim and allegations of the applicants were valid. on point 2 the Commission observed that it was satisfied on the information available in its possession that there were two rival sections of the Indian National Congress, each claiming to be that congress.
 Regarding point 3 the finding of the Commission was that the Election Symbol was not property. As regards point No. 4, the Commission observed that the majority test was a valuable and relevant test in a democratic Organisation.
 The test based upon the provisions of the Constitution of the Congress, canvassed on behalf of the Congress 'O', was held to be hardly of any assistance in view of the removals from membership and expulsions from the committees of the Congress of the members belonging to one group by those belonging to the opposite group. The Commission then consi- dered another test, namely, that based upon the aims and objects as incorporated in the, Constitution of the Congress. It was observed that none of the two groups had challenged in any manner or openly repudiated those aims and objects. The test based upon the aims and objects was consequently held to be ineffective and neutral. Applying the test of majority, the Commission observed that Congress 'J' had the majority out of the total number of members returned on congress tickets to the Houses of Parliament as well as the majority out of the sum total of the members of all the Legislatures returned on congress tickets although in some States, like Gujarat and Mysore, Congress 'O' had majority in the Legislature. As regards the organisational wing of the congress, the Commission came to the conclusion that Congress 'J' enjoyed majority in the All-India Congress Committee as well as amongst the delegates of the undivided congress. As regards the delegates who were entitled to vote at the earlier Faridabad Session of Congress, the Commission found that out of the total number of 4690 delegates, 2870 pledged their support to Congress 'J'.
 Regarding the members of the All India Congress Committee (A.I.C.C.), the Commission held that the total number of A.
 
1. C. C. members who attended the Bombay meeting of the Congress J. was 423 out of 707 elected members and 56 out of 95 nominated and coopted members. The Bombay session, it was further held, assumed importance in view of the fact that all the resolutions passed at the requisitioned meeting of Congress 'J' at Delhi were ratified unanimously at the Bombay session. For determining as to who were members of A.I.C.C. and delegates the Commission accepted those persons as members of A.I.C.C. and delegates who held that position in the earlier session of the Congress at Faridabad before the split.
 Decision was accordingly given that for the purpose of paragraph 15 of the Symbol order Congress 'J' was the congress for which the symbol "Two Bullocks with Yoke on" had been reserved.. Appeal was filed against this order of the Election Commission. An appeal was also filed against the judgment ofthe Madras High Court on a certificate granted by that Court, repellingthe contention that paragraph 15 was ultra vires and invalid in so far as it conferred power on the Commission to decide the dispute between twogroups of a political party. On (i) the question whether the test of majority or numerical strength which was taken into account by the Commission was in the circumstances of-the case a relevant and germane test; (ii) the binding nature of the decision given by the Commission under paragraph 15; and (iii) the question whether paragraph 15 was ultra vires and invalid 
HELD : Dismissing the appeals (1) The occasion for making an order under paragraph 15 arises when the Commission is satisfied, on the information in its possession that there are rival sections or groups of a recognised political party each of whom 320 claims to be that party. In the circumstances of the present case the commission had to decide the matter under paragraph 15 and there was nothing objectionable in the communication dated January 15, 1970, sent to the two rival parties on its behalf. [333 E] As Congress is a democratic Organisation the test of majority and numerical strength was a very valuable and relevant test. The figures found by the Commission of the members of the two houses of Parliament and of the state legislatures as well as those of A.I.C.C. members and delegates who supported Congress 'J', have not been shown to be incorrect. In view of these figures it can hardly be disputed that susbtantial majority of the members of the congress in both its legislative wing as well as the Organisation wing supported Congress 'J'. [336 A] In view of the removals and expulsions which followed in the wake of split in the congress, the Commission adopted proper approach for determining as to who should be taken to be members of A. I. C. C. or the delegates, more so, when in the opinion of the Commission, the validity of those removals and expulsions was open to question. Further, if according to paragraph 6 of the Symbols Order the number of seats secured by a political party or the number of votes cast in favour of the candidates of a political party can be a relevant consideration for the recognition. of a political party, one is at a loss to understand how the numbers of seats in the Parliament and state legislatures held by the supporters of a group of the political party can be considered irrelevant. Consequently, there is no error in the approach of the commission in applying the rule of majority and numerical strength for determining as to which of the two groups was the Congres party for the' purpose of para 15 of the Symbols Order.[336E, C; 338 B] Even though the mass of congress members are primary members there are practical difficulties in ascertaining the wishes of those members. It can be legitimately considered that the members of the A.I.C.C. and the delegates reflected, by, and large, the views of the primary members. The Commission, in any inquiry under paragraph 15, has to act with a certain measure of promptitude and it has to see that the inquiry does not get bogged down in a quagmire. [336 F].
 Paragraph 13 of the Symbols order has nothing to do with the question of resolving a dispute wherein two rival sections or groups of a recognised political party claim to be that party. For resolving of such a dispute only paragraph 15 is to be looked into. ;[338 G-H] General Assembly of Free Church of Scotland and Others v.
 Lord Overtoun and Others, :[1904] A.C. 515, distinguished.
 Samyukta Socialist Party v. Election Commission of India & Anr., [1966] INSC 191; [1967] 1 S.C.R. 643, held inapplicable.
 The symbol is not property to be divided between co-owners.
 The allotment of a symbol to the candidates set up by a political party is a legal right and in case of split the Commission has been authorised to determine which of the rival groups or section is the party which was entitled to the symbol. The Commission in resolving this dispute does not decide as to which group represents the party, but which group is that party. [339 H] (ii) The claim made is only for the purpose of symbols in connection with elections to the Parliament and state legislatures and the decision of 321 the Commission under paragraph 15 constitutes a direction to the Returning Officer for the purpose of rule 10 of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 The said direction shall be binding upon the Returning Officer in accordance with sub- rules (4) and (5) of rule 10. [339 D] [The Court did not express any opinion on the question whether the decision of the Commission can be called into question in appropriate proceedings in a court of law.] (iii) There is no substance in the contention that paragraph 15 of the Symbols order is ultra vires the powers of the Commission. The, Commission has been clothed with plenary powers by the Conduct of Election Rules in the matter of allotment of symbols. If the Commission is not to be disabled from exercising effectively the plenary powers vested in it in the matter of allotment of symbol and for issuing directions in connection therewith, it is plainly essential that the Commission should have the power to settle a dispute in case claim for the allotment of the symbol of a political party is made by two rival claimants.
 Para 15 is intended to effectuate and subserve the main purpose and objects of the symbols order. The Commission is an authority created by tile Constitution and according to Article 324, the superintendence, direction and control of the Electoral rolls for the conduct of elections to Parliament and the legislature of every state and of elections to the offices of President and Vice President is vested in the Commission. The fact that the power of resolving a dispute between two rival groups for allotment of symbol of a political party has been vested in such a high authority would raise a presumption, though rebuttable, and provide a guarantee, though not absolute but to a considerable extent, that the power would not be misused but would be exercised in a fair and reasonable manner.[342 A-G] There is also no substance in the contention that as power to make provisions in respect to elections has been given to the Parliament by Article 327, the power cannot be further delegated to the Commission. The law made by Parliament under article 327 is subject to the other provisions of the Constitution including article 324. It, therefore, cannot be said that when the Commission issues direction, it does so not on its own behalf but as delegate of some other authority. [342 H]
