 Certain trade marks were registered in the name of two firms and one of the partners gave notice of dissolution of the two firms. Thereafter, he filed two suits for accounts.
 While the suits were pending he died and his legal representatives (appellants) were impleaded. The parties agreed to refer the matter to arbitration and before the arbitrators a question was raised whether the legal representatives were entitled to continue the suits. The arbitrators stated a special case to the Court for its opinion under the first part of a. 13(b), Arbitration Act, 1940. Meanwhile, one of the firms filed a suit against the appellants in the names of the firms under which they (appellants) Were tracking for an injunction restraining them from using the trade-marks. An ex-parte injunction was granted restraining the appellants from manufacturing and selling certain implements under the trade marks. On objection by the appellants, the order was vacated. A review application by the respondents was Allowed,. The order of the Court granting review was a combined order granting review and disposing of the application for interim injunction on merits. Oil appeal, the High Court confirmed the order. Against the order of the High Court an appeal was filed to this Court and this Court passed an interim order that the appellants will be entitled to use the trade marks but that the parties should keep accounts of all goods manufactured and sold and submit them to the trial court during the pendency of the appeal. While the appeal was pending in this Court, one of the appellants died.
 The Court, to which reference was made under the first part of s. 13(b), Arbitration Act, gave its opinion that the appellants were not entitled to continue the suits, and an appeal was filed against the order under Art. 136.
 The respondents filed a criminal complaint before the Magistrate stating that the appellants were using the trade marks without authority, and that they were passing off their goods as goods manufactured by the original firm. The appellants applied to this Court for taking proceedings for contempt of court against the respondents 'for having disobeyed the interim order of this Court'.
 On the questions :
 (1) Whether the appeal against the order of injunction had abated because of the death of one of the appellants ? (2) Whether the appeal against the order of injunction on merits, was maintainable " (3) Whether the trial court 'was justified in passing the order of injunction ? (4) Whether an appeal against the opinion of the Court given under the first part of s.
 13(b) of the Arbitration Act was maintainable, and (5) Whether the respondents, in filing the.
 criminal complaint were guilty of contempt of this Court ? 454 
HELD : (1) Under 0.30, r. 4, C.P.C., two or more persons may sue or be sued in the name of a firm, and if any of the partners dies, whether before the institution or during the pendency of any suit, it shall not be necessary to join the legal representatives of the deceased as a party to the suit. Under s. 107. C.P.C., the provisions of 0.30, r. 4, apply to appeals also. Since. the appellants were sued in the names of their firms, the injunction was issued against them in the names of their firms, and they filed the appeal in the names of their firms, the death of one of the partners would not cause the appeal to abate. [456F-H] (2) The order of the trial court was not only an order granting the review but also an order passed on merits.
 Therefore, the appellants were entitled, not only to challenge the order on the grounds mentioned in 0.47, r. 7, but also on any other ground open to them, namely that on merits, the order of injunction should not have been passed.
 [457 B-D] (3) Prima facie the respondents are not entitled to the exclusive use of the trade marks which formed part of the assets of the partnership of the two firms. If that be so, the court was not justified in granting the injunction res- training the appellants from using the trade marks. [457 G- H] (4) The consultative 'jurisdiction of the court does not result in a decision which is equivalent to a judgment, decree, determination or order which is appealable to this Court under Art. 136, and hence, the appeal is incompetent.
 [458E; 459F-G] (a) There is no material difference in the language of the corresponding section of English Act and s. 13(b) of the Indian Arbitration Act. In spite of the opinion given by the Court the arbitrators are clothed with the final duty of determining the case and the opinion of the Court does not finally determine the case and is not binding on the arbitrators.

Under,,round Electric Railways Company of London, Ltd., [1912] A.C. 673, in re an Arbitration between Knight and the Tabernacle Permanent Building Society, [1892] 2 Q.B.D. 613, Union of India v. M/s. South India Corporation A.I.R. 1960 Andhra Pradesh 346, Union of India v. M/s Ram Sukh Das and Others, A.I.R. 1959 Punjab 61, Adamji Lukmanji and Louis Dreyfus & Co. In the matter of an Arbitration, A.I.R. 1925 Sind 83, and Clive Mills Ltd. v. Swalal Jain A.I.R. 1957 Calcutta 692, referred to.
 (b) It might be that the arbitrators may choose to act upon the opinion, but that is not because the opinion is a determination or decision binding on the arbitrator. It need even be incorporated in the award under s. 14(3).
 Section 14(3) is concerned only with the latter part of s.13(b) because, that part provides for stating the award wholly or in part in the form of a special case of such question for the opinion of the court, and under s. 14(3) such opinion should,be added to and form part of the award.
 But an opinion given under the first part of section 1 3 (b) need not be added to and does not form part of the award.
 There could be no appeal from the decision of the arbitrators on the ground they did not act upon the opinion although it might be a ground for impeaching their award on the ground of misconduct. [459F; 469F-H; 461AC] (c) Moreover, under s. 39(1)(ii) an appeal is provided only against an order on an award stated in the form of a special case, but there is no provision for an appeal against the opinion given by the court on a special case Started to the court under the first part of s. 13(b). The scheme of the.
 Act shows that the legislature wanted to provide for an appeal only when there is to be a decision by the court binding on the parties and not when it tenders an opinion which is not binding on the arbitrators and which is not to be incorporated in the award, [460G-H-. 461B] (5) There could be no dispute that the respondent was entitled to file the complaint and therefore, it cannot be held that the respondent had disobeyed the order of this Court and committed any contempt.
