 The respondent filed two nomination papers for election to the Legislative Assembly from a constituency in Himachal Pradesh in the 1967 general election. Both his nomination papers were rejected at the scrutiny. The first nomination paper was rejected on the ground that the proposer'& name was wrongly mentioned as being at serial No. 380 of Part 13 of the Electoral Roll of the constituency whereas it was actually at serial No. 380 of Part 23 of the Roll. The second nomination paper was rejected on the ground that the respondent was shown as the elector at Serial No. 504 of Part 2 of 9-Arki Assembly constituency but really his name was found at serial No. 504 of Part 12 of that constituency.
 At the election subsequently held the appellant was the winning candidate. The respondent filed an election petition challenging the appellant's election on the ground that his (the respondent's) nomination papers had been wrongly rejected. The High Court allowed the petition whereupon, by special leave, the appellant came to this Court. It was urged on behalf of the appellant, inter alia, that the respondent was only a dummy candidate who was not even present at the time of the scrutiny and had filed the petition only because the candidate representing his party had been defeated.
 
HELD : The respondent's nomination papers were wrongly rejected in a manner impermissible under s. 36 of the Representation of the People Act and the election must be set aside under s. 100 of the Act. [785 A] it may be that while scrutinising the first nomination paper the Returning Officer had no material before him to find out whether the proposer of the candidate was really an elector in the constituency or not but in the second nomination paper the proposer's name as well as place in the electoral roll was correctly mentioned. It was improper on the part of the Returning Officer to have rejected the second nomination paper merely on the ground that the part of the electoral roll in which the respondent'& name was recorded was wrongly mentioned because the correct number of the electoral roll was mentioned in the first nomination paper.
 All the required information 'was before the Returning Officer and the mistake was only clerical. Obviously he rejected the nomination paper for the reason that the respondent was a dummy candidate but that was not a matter for him to decide. (784 D-H]
