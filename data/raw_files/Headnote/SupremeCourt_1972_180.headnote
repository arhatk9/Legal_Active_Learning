 The appellants along with some other accused were tried for murder under s. 302 I.P.C. and connected offences. They were acquitted by the Sessions Judge. The High Court reversing the judgment of acquittal convicted the appellants. In appeal before this Court under article 136 of the Constitution it was contended that in apprising the evidence the High Court had not followed the principles laid down by this-Court in Sanwant Singh and other cases.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) The contention that because the judgment of the trial court prima facie seemed reasonable there was no scope for reassessment of the evidence by the High Court was unacceptable. The Court of appeal has full power under the statute to go into the entire evidence and all the relevant circumstances of the case for coming to its own conclusion about the guilt or innocence of the accused bearing in mind the initial presumption of the innocence of the accused person and the fact that he was acquitted by the trial court. The High Court in the present case did not commit any error in the appraisal of the evidence on the record and in arriving at its own conclusion as to the guilt of the appellants. The criticism about the insertion of s. 120B in the site plan might raise a slight suspicion but in view of the trustworthiness of the prosecution evidence led in the case that could not in any way justify any grave suspicion of the prosecution story. It could not be said that the High Court had not followed the principles laid down in Sanwant Singh's case nor were its conclusions so erroneous as to justify interference by this Court under Art. 136 of the Constitution.

 (ii) Section 157 Cr. P.C. requires an occurrence report to be sent forthwith by the police officer concerned to a magistrate empowered to take congnizance of the offence.
 This is really designed to keep the magistrate informed of the investigation of such cognizable offence so as to be able to control the investigation and if necessary to give appropriate direction under s. 159. But when it was found in the present case that the F.I.R. was actually recorded without delay and the investigation started on the basis of the F.I.R. and there- was no other infirmity brought 965 to the Court's notice, then, however, improper or objectionable the delayed receipt of the report by the magistrate concerned it could not by itself justify the conclusion that the investigation was tainted and the prosecution insupportable. It was not the appellants' case that they had been prejudicial by this delay. [970 C-E]
