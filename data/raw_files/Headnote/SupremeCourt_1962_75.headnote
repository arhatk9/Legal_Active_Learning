 By r. 8 (1) of the Central Excise Rules, 1944, framed by the Central Government in exercise of its Power under s. 37(2) cl. xvii of the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944, "the Central Government may from time to time, by notification .in the Official Gazette, exempt subject to such conditions as may be specified in the notification any excisable goods for the whole or any part of the duty leviable on such goods." By two notifications issued under the said rule the Central Government exempted cotton fabrics produced on power looms owned by co-operative societies from the duty leviable thereon subject to certain conditions.
 Under s 38 of the Act the said rule and notifications on publication in the Official Gazette had effect as if enacted in the Act. The petitioners, apprehending loss of business in competition with the fifth respondent, a co-operative society, challenged the-rule and the notifications on the grounds(1 ) that the power of 'exemption conferred on the Union Government violated Arts. 14, 19(1)(f) and (g) of the Constitution and (2) that assuming that it dic 482 not do so, the exemption granted by the notifications was in excess of the power granted by r. 8(1).
 Held, that the contentions were without substance and must fail.
 Rule 8 of the Rules was as much a part of the. Act as s.37(2) cl. (xvii) and it was always open to the State to tax certain classes of goods and not to tax others. It was the function of the State to determine what and of taxes should be levied and in what manner. Regard being bad to the directive principles contained in Art. 43 of the Constitution, there was no doubt that the State in differentiating between goods produced in big establishments and similar goods produced by small power-loom weavers in a cooperative society, had made a classification that was constitutionally valid. There could, therefore, be no excessive delegation of the power to grant exemption.
 It was fallacious to contend that exemption, if at all, had to be granted in respect of any particular specified variety of 'cotton fabrics', and not with reference to persons producing them. The tax was on the production of the goods but was payable by persons producing them. The exemption granted was , therefore, within the terms of the notifications.
