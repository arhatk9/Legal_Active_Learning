 The public prosecutor, in charge of a criminal case where charges had already been framed and pending before a Magistrate in the State of Bihar, was directed by the magistrate to withdraw the case at the instance of the State Criminal Intelligence Department on the ground that a second investigation made by the Police in the said matter was truer than the first which proved to be false. The Public Prosecutor acted on the direction and withdrew the case.
 Unable to get the relief from the High Court, the petitioners moved this Court for grant of special leave to appeal. Refusing the leave, the Court, 
HELD : (1) The sole consideration for the Public Prosecutor when. he decides to withdraw from the prosecution is the larger factor of the administration of justice-not political favours nor party pressures nor like concerns. The interests public justice being the paramount consideration they may transcend and overflow the legal justice of the particular litigation. [605AB] (2)Justice ordinarily demands that every case must reach its destination, not interrupted en route. If some policy consideration bearing on the administration of justice justifies withdrawal, the court may accord permission; not if no public policy bearing on the administration of justice is involved. The court has to be vigilant when a case has been pending before it and not succumb to executive suggestion made in the form of application for withdrawal with a bunch of papers tacked on. [606-B-C] (3)The statutory responsibility for deciding upon withdrawal squarely rests on thePublic Prosecutor' It is non-negotiable and cannot be bartered away in favourof those who may be above him on the administration side. The Criminal Procedure Code is the only master of the Public Prosecutor and he has to guide himself with reference to Criminal Procedure Code only. So guided, the consideration which must weigh with him is whether the broader cause of public justice will be advanced or retarded by the withdrawal or continuance of the prosecution. [605E-F] (4)It may be open to a District Magistrate to bring to the notice :'of the public prosecutor materials and suggest to him to consider whether the prosecution should be withdrawn or not. He cannot command where he can only commend. In the instant 'case (a) ordering the public prosecutor to move for withdrawal was not proper for a District Magistrate to do. It is not proper to have the Public Prosecutor ordered about; (b) The Public Prosecutor obeyed and not acted in the instant case and, therefore, the statutory responsibility vested in him was notproperly exercised; (c) the surrender of discretion by the Public Prosecutor and the Magistrate are unfortunate" and (d) the State should not stultify the court by first stating that there is a true case to be tried and then make a volts face to the effect that there is a second investigation the case has been discovered to be false.[605 G-H, 606 A,C,D]
