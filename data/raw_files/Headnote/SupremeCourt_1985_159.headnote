 Krishna Babaji Patil, respondent No.1 herein and his brother Bandu Babaji Patil were holding a half-share in the lands bearing survey numbers 221/1,222/2,226/8 and 226/12 in all measuring 22 Acres and 13 Gunthas situated at Monja Shirsi, Peta Shirola, District Sangli in Maharashtra, as permanent Mirasi tenants and were in actual possession of their share in the said Lands. The lands in question were Paragana Watan Inam lands and the Watandars belonged to the family of Kokrudkar Deshmukhs. On May 20, 1947 they executed a mortgage deed in favour of two persons by name Dnyanu Krihna Mhoprekar and Ananda Santu Mhoprekar mortgaging their share in the above lands with possession by way of security for a loan of Rs.1,000 which they borrowed under the mortgage deed. The mortgage deed was for five years. The mortgagees were entitled to appropriate the income from the mortgaged property towards interest.
 During the subsistence of the mortgage, the Bombay Paragana and Kulkarni Watans (Abolition) Act, 1950 Bombay Act No. 50 was passed under which all the Paragana and Kulkarni Watans were abolished and the State Government resumed the watan lands. Dnyanu Krishna Mhoprekar, one of the mortgagees died in or about the year 1955 leaving behind him Jayasingh Dnyanu Mhoprekar, the appellant 1 herein as his heir and the Karta of his joint family. Bandu Babaji Patil, one of the mortgagors also died in the year 1955 leaving behind him three sons, plaintiff No. 2 being the Karta of the family.
 309 After the coming into force of the Watans Abolition Act, the holders of the Watan i.e. the members of the Deshmukh family did not pay the occupancy price as provided in section 4(1) of the Act within the prescribed time and apply for the occupancy right of such lands. Thereupon in the proceedings initiated to grant the lands in favour of the permanent Mirasi tenants, who were in actual possession thereof, the respondents, who were permanent Mirasi tenants of the half-share in the lands covered by the survey numbers in question deposited in the Government Treasury on July 29, 1963 a sum of Rs.182.41 being the requisite occupancy price equivalent to 24 times the assessment requesting that the grant should be made in their favour. The appellants mortgagees and their heirs in possession of the half-share and another Pandu Krishna who by virtue of the sale deed, by the other branch of the respondent's family in his favour is in possession of the other half share in the lands also deposited the occupancy price claiming the whole land.
 The Prant Officer, by his order dated February 5,1964, instead of granting occupancy right in respect of the one- half share of the land which belonged to the respondents in their favour ordered that the entire extent of Land measuring 22 Acres and 13 Gunthas should be granted in favour of the appellants and one Pandu Krishna as they were in physical possession. The respondents questioned the said proceedings before higher authorities and pending a decision thereat, made an abortive attempt to redeem the mortgage in a proceeding under section 83 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 in Miscellaneous Application No.44 of 1963.
 Thereafter, the respondent instituted a suit for redemption in Regular Civil Suit No.67 of 1965 on the file of the Civil Judge, Junior Division, Islampur. In the written statement, it was pleaded inter alia that since after the abolition of the watans, the mortgaged lands had been given to the appellants by the Government after receiving the occupancy price amounting to Rs.364.81 on February 5, 1964 the right of the mortgagors and/or their legal representatives to redeem the mortgage had become absolute owners of the suit lands. After the trial, the suit was dismissed by the Civil Judge. Aggrieved by the decree of the Trial Court, the respondents preferred an appeal before the District Court, Sangli in Civil Appeal No. 278 of 1966. In that appeal the decree of the trial Court was reversed and a decree for redemption was passed. Under that decree the respondents were directed to pay, in addition to the amount of Rs.1,000 borrowed under the mortgage deed a sum of Rs.182.41 which was equivalent to one-half of the amount paid by appellant No. 1 and others in 310 order to obtain the grant from the Government. Accordingly an appropriate preliminary decree was drawn up under order XXXIV, Rule 7 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Aggrieved by the said decree the appellants filed a second appeal before the High Court of Bombay in SA No. 37 of 1969 which was dismissed on March 3, 1971 and thus the decree made by the first appellate court was affirmed. Hence the appeal by special leave.
 Dismissing the appeal, the Court ^ 
 HELD 1.1 It is well settled that the right of redemption under a mortgage deed can come to an end only in a manner known to law. Such extinguishment of the right can take place by a contract between the parties, by a merger or by a statutory provision which debars the mortgagor from redeeming the mortgage. A mortgagee who has entered into possession of the mortgaged property under a mortgage will have to give up possession of the property when a suit for redemption is filed unless he is able to show that the right of redemption has come to an end or that the suit is liable to be dismissed on some other valid ground. This flows from the legal principle which is applicable to all mortgages, namely "Once a mortgage, always a mortgage. [315 D-H, 316 A] 
 1.2 It is no doubt true that the father of the first appellant and the second appellant have been granted occupancy right by the Prant Officer by his order dated February 5, 1964 along with Pandu, the uncle of appellant No. 1. But the appellants would not have been able to secure the said grant in their favour but for the fact that they were in actual possession of the lands. They were able to be in possession of the one-half share of the respondents in the lands in question only by reason of the mortgage deed.
 If the mortgagors had been in posssession of the lands on the relevant date, the lands would have automatically been granted in their favour, since the right of the tenants in the watan lands were allowed to subsist even after the coming into force of the Act and the consequent abolition of the watans by virtue of section 8 of the Bombay Paragana and Kulkarni Watans (Abolition) Act,1950. The fact that they had mortgaged land with possession on the relevant date would not make their position any different.[316 A-D] 
 1.3 Section 90 of the Indian Trusts Act, 1882 clearly shows that if a mortgagee by availing himself of his position as a mortgagee gains an advantage which would be in derogation of the right of a mortgagor, he has to hold the advantage so derived 311 by him for the benefit of the mortgagor. Section 90, therefore, casts an obligation on a mortgagee to hold the rights required by him in the mortgaged property for the benefit of the mortgagor in such circumstances as the mortgagee is virtually in a fiduciary position in respect of the rights so acquired and he cannot be allowed to make a profit out of the transaction. [317 C-D, F-G] In this case the mortgagees i.e. Dnyanu, and Ananda could each get 1/4th share in the total extent of land measuring 22 Acres and 13 Gunthas only by availing themselves of their position as mortgagees. The grant made in their favour is an advantage traceable to the possession of the land which they obtained under the mortgage and that the said grant is certainly in derogation of the right of the mortgagors who were the permanent Mirasi tenants entitled to the grant under the Government orders. The appellants could not have asserted their right to the grant of the land when the plaintiffs had deposited the requisite occupancy price well in time. The mortgagees obtained the grant in their favour by making an incorrect representation to the Government that they were permanent Mirasi tenants although they were only mortgagees. As such the appellants are liable to surrender the advantage they have derived under the grant in favour of the respondents even if the order of grant has become final before the Revenue authorities, of course, subject to the payment of the expenses incurred by them in securing the grant.[317 D-F, G- H]
