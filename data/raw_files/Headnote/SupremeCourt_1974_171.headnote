 The petitioners are under-going sentences in the Central Jail at Vizagapatnam. The petitioners have filed the present writ petitions for the reliefs that the armed Police Guards posted around the Jail should be removed and that live wire electrical mechanism fixed on top of jail wall should be dismantled. It was contended by the petitioners that (1) under section 3(1) of the Prisons Act, 1894 prison includes all lands and buildings appurtenant thereto. The policemen occupied huts appurtenant to jail and, therefore, occupied a part of the prison, which is calculated to cause substantial interference with the fundamental rights of the petitioners. (2) Naxalite prisoners were segregated and inhuman treatment was meted out to them as if they were inmates of a fascist concentration camp. (3) The live wire mechanism fixed atop the jail walls is unconstitutional because a prisoner attempting to escape is by the use of the device virtually subjected to a death penalty. Under the Penal Code a prisoner who escapes or attempts to escape is liable to a maximum sentence of 2 years and a fine. The live wire gadget lacks the authority of law and is in flagrant violation of the personal liberty guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution.
 It was contended by the respondent that (1) the usual watch and ward staff of the Jail having been found to be inadequate, services of the Andhra Pradesh Special Police force had to be requisitioned to guard the jail from outside. (2) The prisoners were not subjected to inhuman treatment and were on the other hand afforded all the facilities necessary for a decent and reasonably comfortable existence. (3) The live wire installed atop the wall is 14 ft. from ground level, height of the wall itself being 13 ft. It rests on enameled non-conductors. The wire has no direct contact with the wall and there is no possibility of the electrical current leaking through the wall. The prison walls themselves are situated at a distance of about 20 ft.
 from the cells where the petitioners are lodged. An electrician inspects the system regularly. The mechanism is not a secret trap as all prisoners are warned of its existence.
 Dismissing the petition.
 
HELD : (i) Convicts are not by mere reason of the conviction, denuded of all the fundamental rights which they otherwise possess. A prisoner is deprived of fundamental rights like the right to move freely throughout the territory of India or the right to practice a profession.
 But other freedoms like the right to acquire, hold or dispose of property are available to the prisoner. He is also entitled to the right guaranteed by Art. 21 that he shall not be deprived of his life or the personal liberty except according to the procedure established bylaw Therefore. under our Constitution the right of personal liberty and some of the other fundamental freedoms are not to be totally denied to a convict during the period of incarceration. [26D-F; 27B] (II) The petitioners are not denied any of their fundamental rights by posting of Police Guards immediately outside the jail. As many as 156 Naxalite Prisoners were lodged in the Vizagapatnam jail, as a result of which the usual watch and ward arrangement proved inadequate. 11 Naxalite prisoners including 2 out of the 3 petitioners escaped from the prison in 1969. It was decided thereafter to take adequate measures for preventing the scope of prisoners from jail.
 The Policemen have no access to the jail which is enclosed by high walls. Their presence in the immediate vicinity of the jail can cause no interference with the personal liberty or the lawful preoccupations of the prisoners. [27B-D, G] 25 (iii) The court is not satisfied about the truth of the allegations of inhuman treatment though the court does not accept the rosy picture drawn by the Jail Authorities. There are subtle forms of punishment to whichconvicts and under trial prisoners are sometimes subjected but it must be realize that these barbarous relics of a bygone era offend against the letter andspirit of our Constitution. [28B & G] (iv)The live wire mechanism has no support of law. It is based on mere administrative instructions. Therefore. if it violates the fundamental rights it cannot be justified on the ground of its being reasonable. If action of the WI authorities violates the fundamental rights of the petitioner the justification of the measure must be sought in some law within the meaning of Article 13 (3) (a) of the Constitution. There is no possibility that the petitioners will come into contact with the electrical device in the normal pursuit of their daily chores. There is also no possibility that any other person in discharge of his lawful functions will come into contact with the same. The prisoners have no fundamental freedom to escape from lawful custody. Therefore, they cannot complain of the installation of the live wire with which they are likely to come into contact only if they try to escape from the prison. [29E; H; 30 AB]
