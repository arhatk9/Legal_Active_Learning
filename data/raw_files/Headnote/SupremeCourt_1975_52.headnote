 6 notices were issued to the respondent under s. 148 of the Income Tax Act for reopening the assessments for 3 assessment years. The notices recited that they. were issued after obtaining the necessary satisfaction of the Central Board of Direct. Taxes The respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging the said notices inter alia on, the ground that sanction of the Central Board of Direct Taxes was not taken before the notices were issued as required by sec. 151 of the Act. The High Court accepted the said contention and did not decide the other grounds raised in the petition. The High Court held that on a reading of the affidavit made by J. P. Singh, Chairman of Central Board of Direct Taxes it would appear that the work which had been done by the Chairman of the Central Board was transferred to the Member of the Board and the approval of the Secretary to the Government of India was obtained for this transfer or allocation of work. The High Court, however, found that the averments in the affidavit were not in line with the office notes in the relevant file. The High Court also held that as no formal order was passed changing the allocation with the previous approval of the Central Government, the sanction issued by Central Board of Direct Taxes was without jurisdiction and authority.
 On appeal by Special Leave it was contended before this Court that r. 4 of the Central Board, of Direct Taxes (Regulation of Transaction of Business) Rules, 1954 provides that the Chairman of the Central Board may with the previous approval of the Central Government distribute the business of the Board between himself and the other members and may specify the cases or class of cases which shall' be considered jointly by the Board. It was contended that J. P Singh in his affidavit clearly stated that on 30-3-1964 he suggested to Narayan Rao, a member of the Central Board of Direct Taxes that lie should take up the work of according sanction of the Board under s. 151 of the Act which was being done by the Chairman. It was further stated in that affidavit that on June 18, 1964 he personally discussed the proposal with the Secretary to the Government of India, in, the Ministry of Finance and that the Secretary approved the said proposal and that a note was made by him on 18th June, 1964 to the effect that the matter was discussed with the Secretary and that it is just a minor internal arrangement and no formal order was necessary.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD'. (1) The High Court erred in not taking note of the affidavit of P. G. Gandhi Under Secretary Central Board of Direct Taxes, in which it is stated that all assessment work of income tax was assigned to Narayan Rao with the approval of the Central Government. In view of the statements in the specific affidavit of J. P. Singh and P. G. Gandhi it cannot be said that the office notes were not in line with the averments in the affidavits. [739H; 740C] (2) It was not necessary to express the approval of the Central Government formally in the shape of an order. [741H] Fonseca Private Limited and Others v. L. C. Gupta & Others, [1973] 1 S.C.C. 418, distinguished.
 736 In that case what was challenged was the order passed by an officer who was not entitled to pass it under the rules of business and the decision has no relevance on the question whether on the circumstances of the present case, approval of the Central Government should have been recorded in a formal order. [741C] (3) The distribution of the business of the Board by the Chairman is not a sub-delegated legislation and need not be expressed in a formal document; that the allocation of the business and approval are matters of internal arrangement not affecting any one's rights at that stage. Since the appeals succeed on other grounds the Court did not go into the question whether the provisions of the Central Board of Direct Taxes (Validation of Proceedings) Act, 1971 afforded protection to the action taken.
