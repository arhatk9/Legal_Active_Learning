 The Gujarat Legislature enacted Gujarat Devasthan Inams Abolition Act, 1969. Section 5 of the Act provides for abolition of certain Devasthan Inams together with their incidents and makes Devasthan lands liable to payment of land revenue. Section 8 vests all public roads, lanes, tracks, bridges, ditches, dikes and fences etc., situated in Devasthan lands in Government and further provides that all rights held by an Inamdar in such property would be deemed to have been extinguished. Section 9 of the Act provides for compensation in the form of cash annuity. By Section 31 certain exemptions granted to the Devasthan lands by the Bombay Tenancy & Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 and Gujarat Agricultural Lands Ceiling Act 1960 have been deleted.
 It was contended by the appellants that the Act violated Article 26(c) of the Constitution since it deprived religious denominations of their ownership of property; that in addition to fulfilling the requirements of Article 31(2) the Act had to fulfil the requirements of Article 26(c) also; that the Act was not saved by the provisions of Article 3 1 A since the operation of Article 26(c) is not included in the former Article and that Section 31 of the Act is violative of Article 26(c) since the compensation available to religious denominations is grossly inadequate.
 Held:Article 26 guarantees the right to own and acquire movable and immovable property for managing religious affairs. This right cannot take away the right of the State to compulsorily acquire property in accordance with the provisions of Article 31(2). If the acquisition of property of a religious denomination by the State can be proved to be such as to destroy or completely negative its right to own or acquire movable and immovable property for even the survival of a religious institution the question may have to be examined in a different light.- However, such an allegation is not made in the present appeals. When the property is acquired by the State in accordance with the provisions of Article 31(2) and the acquisition cannot be assailed on any valid ground, the right to own that property vanishes as that right is transferred to the State. There is no conflict between Article 26 and Article 31. The court also negatived the contention of the appellants that the decision in Khaja Mian Wakf Estate [1970] INSC 237; [1971] 2 S.C.R. 790 has been over-ruled by the Bank Nationalisation case [1970] INSC 18; [1970] 3 S.C.R. 530. [327 C-E] The Act is passed in furtherance of agrarian reform and is fairly protected under the saving provision of Article 31A.
 The right Conferred under Article 26(c) is not absolute and unqualified right. No rights in an organised society can be absolute. Where in a free play of social forces it is not possible to bring about a voluntary harmony, the State has to step in to set right the imbalance between competing interests and there the Directive Principles-of State Policy, although not enforceable in courts, have a definite and Positive role introducing an obligation upon the State under Article 37 in making laws to regulate the conduct of men and their affairs. In doing so a distinction will have to be made between those laws which directly infringe the freedom of religion and others, although indirectly, affect- ing some secular activities or religious institutions or bodies. The core of religion is not interfered with in providing for amenities for sufferers of any kind. The 318 Act does not violate the rights guaranteed under Article 26(c). The Act does not make any inroad in such a way as to affect directly the substance of the right conferred by Article 26(c). One fundamental right of a person may have to co-exist in harmony with the exercise of another fundamental right by others and also with reasonable and valid exercise of power by the State in the light of the Directive Principles in the interest of social welfare as a whole. The Courts duty is to strike a balance between conflicting claims of different interests. [328 F-H; 329B] Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments,Madras v. Shri Lakhsmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt, [1954] S.C.R. 1005/1028-1029, referred to.
 Objection on the score of inadequacy of compensation cannot be agitated against a legislation which relates to agrarian reform and, therefore, protected by Article 31A. The objection on the score of violation of Article 14, 19 and 31 is not entertainable. [329.F-E] ARGUMENTS For the appellants:
 
1. The impugned Act (The Gujarat Devasthan Inams Abolition Act, 1939) violates Article 26(c) of the Constitution which confers on every religious denomination the fundamental right "to own and acquire movable and immovable property", ,subject only to "public order, morality and health". The impugned Act aims at agrarian reform but is not concerned with public order, morality and health. Since it deprives religious denominations of their ownership of property, it transgresses Article 26(c) and. is invalid.
 2.Article 31-A provides that legislation covered by that Article cannot be ,deemed to be void on the ground of inconsistency with Articles 14, 19 and 21. Since the impugned act is inconsistent with Articles 26(c) whose operation is not excluded by Article 31A, it is not saved by the provisions of the latter.
 3.The Court below was wrong in holding that the question whether the impugned Act contravenes Article 26(c) depends on whether the Act is in conformity with the Directive Principles embodied in Part-IV of the Constitution. It is well established by decisions of this Hon'ble Court that the Directive Principles cannot over-ride fundamental rights.
 Where a fundamental right has been expressly made subject to certain reasonable restrictions, then the relevant Directive Principle would be taken into consideration by the court in deciding whether in a particular case the restriction imposed is reasonable or not.
 But where a fundamental right is in absolute terms, it cannot be Subject to restrictions in the general public interest.
 Since fundamental right in Article 26(c) is subject only to public order, morality and health, only those Directive Principles which relate to public order, morality and health would be relevant in construing whether a particular legislation is violative of Article 26(c).
 
4. While the fundamental rights in the American Constitution have been stated in general terms, those in our Constitution have been concretely defined. The ,Court below was in error in relying on American decisions for its conclusion that the fundamental rights in our Constitution are subject to the Directive Principles in Part-IV thereof- American decisions are not useful in deciding the scope of our fundamental rights.
 
5. The impugned Act in so far as it is concerned with compulsory acquisition of Property, fulfils the requirements of Article 31(2). It has, however, to fulfil it, ,addition the requirements of Article 26(c) also. It was held in the Bank Nationalisation Case [1970] INSC 18; [1970] (3) SCR 530 that the work "law" in Article 31(2) means a valid law, i. e. law which does not violate any other fundamental right. The impugned Act must accordingly be consistent not only with Article 31(2) but also Article 26(c). Observations to the contrary effect in Khajimian Wakf Estate etc. v. State of Madras and Anr. [1971](2) SCR page 790(at page 797) are inconsistent with the ratio of the Bank Nationalisation case, which was decided by a larger Bench, and are, it is respectfully submitted, not good law.
 319 6.The court below was not right in holding that the substance of the right under Article 26(c) is not affected if the property of religious denominations is compulsorily acquired by providing for a reasonable pensation. This view, it is submitted, is not correct, because compulsory acquisition of property 'limits the right of ownership guaranteed by Article 26(c). The observations in The State of Bihar Versus Maharajadhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of Dar- bhanga and others [1952] INSC 17; [1952] SCR 839 relied upon the Court below are not relevant, as the Bihar Act in question was included in the IXth Schedule of the Constitution and was beyond the challenge based on any fundamental right. Section 31 of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act 1948 and the Gujarat Agricultural Land Ceiling Act 1960 applicable to the agricultural lands of religious denominations. It cannot be disputed that the compensation available to religious denominations for the lands covered by these Acts is grossly inadequate. Section 31 of the impugned Act is, therefore, violative of Article 26 (c) of the Constitution of India even supposing that the rest of the Act is valid.
 For the Respondents:
 1.The rights conferred on the religious denominations under Article 26(c) and (d)of the Constitution of India enables them to own and acquire properties and to administer them according to law. In the submission of the respondents, these rights under Article 26(c) and (d) do not however derogate the power of the State to acquire the properties under Article 31 of the Constitution. It was further submitted that Article 26(c) and (d) must be read together with the result the right of the State to acquire property would not be affected, merely because the property is owned by a religious denomination.
 2.It was submitted that the right under Article 26(c) is not unbounded or absolute. The same is subject to reasonable regulation.
 3.What is reasonable regulation must depend on the nature of the fundamental right sought to be regulated the purpose for which it is conferred and the general pattern of Constitutional rights and obligation. It must also depend on the Directive Principles enumerated in Part IV and the socioeconomic structure envisaged by the Constitution.
 4.That in the event of conflict between the individual right and the legislation implementing socioeconomic policies laid down in Part IV, greater weight should be given to the policy enumerated in the Directive Principles.
 5.That the socioeconomic policy sought to be implemented through the legislation made in pursuance of Directive Principles would be rejoiner as "public purpose" or as intended to promote "public interest" and as a reasonable restriction on the fundamental rights. The two being parts of one scheme and "complementary and supplementary to each other." 6.Any law under which property was compulsorily acquired for a public purpose, the law satisfied the requirements of Art. 31(2) and 31(2A), it should be presumed that such an acquisition would amount to reasonable regulation on the exercise of the fundamental right to hold the Property, empowered in the interest of general public.
