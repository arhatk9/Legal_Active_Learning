 Held , that the Act affords protection to all persons who hold agricultural lands as contractual tenants, and subject to the exceptions specified all persons lawfully cultivating lands belonging to others, and it would be unduly restricting the intention of the Legislature to limit the benefit of the Bombay Tanancy and Agricultural Land Act to persons who derive their authority from the owner, either under a contract of tenancy, or otherwise. All persons other than those mentioned, in cls. (a), (b) and (c) of s. 4 of the,, Act who lawfully cultivate land belonging to other 2 persons whether their authority is derived directly from the owner of the land or not must be deemed to be tenants of the land.
