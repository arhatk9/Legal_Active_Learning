 The appellant was junior to Respondents 2 and 3 in the Class 11 Punjab Agricultural Service. On August 2, 1965 the appellant and Respondent No. 3 were promoted on an ad hoc basis as Deputy Directors of Agriculture a post borne on the cadre of Class I service. The appellant took charge of the post on August 4, 1965 being at headquarters, while respondents No. 3 joined on 18-8-65. Respondent No. 2. who was senior to Respondent No. 3 and the appellant could not be promoted earlier as he was on deputation with the Punjab Agricultural University and he was promoted on 22-2-67 i.e.
 after his return to parent department. The appellant, Respondent No. 2 and Respondent No. 3 therefore completed their probation on 3-8-1967, 21-2-1969 and 1-3-1968 respectively. On 14-10-71, the Government of Punjab published a tentative seniority list in which the appellant was shown as junior to respondents 2 and 3. On that basis respondents 2 and 3 were promoted as Joint Directors of Agriculture w.e.f. 10-7-1973 and 16-7-73 respectively. As his representation for considering his claim for seniority and promotion by virtue of his long continuous service in Class 11 post and also his earlier completion of probation that the respondents failed. the appellant filed a writ petition in the High Court on 16-8- 1973 contending that the promotion of respondents 2 and 3 to the post of Joint Director was illegal being violative of Article 16 of the Constitution and demanding that in recognition of his superior claim arising by virtue of seniority, he should be promoted and confirmed in the post of Joint Director. The High Court dismissed the Writ Petition but granted a certificate of fitness to appeal to this Court.
 Dismissing the appeal, the Court 
HELD : 1. The High Court was right in taking the view that respondents 2 and 3 were entitled to be appointed as Joint Directors of Agriculture in preference to the appellant on the basis of their seniority. [720D] 
2. Since all of them were appointed to Class I on an ad hoc basis and since they had all completed their probation in Class I post, when permanent vacancies occurred in that cadre, their seniority in Class If has to prevail in their ranking in Class I. By that criterion, the appellant must take his place below Respondents 2 and 3. [719B-C] 
3. (a) What governs the appellant is not the Government Memorandum dated 13-4-1966, but the rules contained in the Punjab Agricultural Service Class 1, Rules, 1947. Rule 16 provides that seniority of members of the service shall be determined according to the date of confirmation in the service. If regard is had to Rules 10 to 16 of the Rules, the appellant must rank lower in seniority than Respondents 2 and 3. [720B-C] (b) The circumstance, that the appellant and respondents 2 and 3 took charge of their respective posts in Class I service on divergent dates is purely 717 fortuitous and cannot affect their seniority. The appellant was junior to respondents 2 and 3 in Class III as well as in Class 11 service of the PEPSU State. He was also junior to them in class 11 service of the Punjab Govt., after reorganisation of states. Having been appointed to the higher post on the same date as respondent 3 and on ad hoc basis, the appellant cannot be permitted to take advantage of a chancy circumstance that being geographically close to the headquarters, he was able to take charge of the post of promotion on the very day on which he was appointed, an opportunity which a quirk of posting denied to respondent No. 3. In fact in Class 1, there were only two vacancies in August 1965 and if respondent No. 2 were available for being posted as Deputy Director, it is he and respondent 3 who would have filled the two vacancies. The appellant being junior to them would not have been appointed as a Deputy Director even on an ad hoc basis. [718H, 719D-G]
