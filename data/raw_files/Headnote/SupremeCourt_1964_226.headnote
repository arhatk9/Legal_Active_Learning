 The first respondent sought to have the election of the appellant to the Assembly seat set aside on the following two grounds, among others :(i) that the appellant was guilty of a corrupt practice within the meaning of s. 123(3) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, by using a religious symbol, namely the Dhruva star, as his election symbol, and by the distribution of pamphlets in which the qualities of the star were set out, and (ii) that the second respondent's nomination paper was improperly accepted because he had not completed 25 years of age. The Tribunal rejected the first ground but set aside the election on the second. On appeal, the High court rejected the second ground, but set aside the election on the first. On appeal to the Supreme Court, 
HELD : (i) An election dispute is to a certain extent different from a private dispute between the parties to a lis because the constituency also comes into the picture and, therefore, it is the duty of the Election Tribunal to safeguard its interests and if corrupt practices are alleged against any candidate to enquire into them and ascertain whether the allegations have been substantiated. But where a party did not seek to challenge those findings there was no further duty upon the High Court to examine their correctness. [715 C-E] (ii)The use of the Dhruva star and its description in the pamphlet did not amount to a corrupt practice within the meaning of the section. To say that voters who saw or read the leaflets were likely to conjure up it their minds the picture of a highly religious person and, therefore, their religious sentiments would have been aroused was too far fetched a conclusion. [723 A] (iii)As soon as special leave is granted there is an appeal before the Supreme Court and while dealing with such an appeal it exercises its civil jurisdiction, when the matter arises out of civil proceedings. [724 A-B] (iv)While dealing with the appeal before it, this Court has the power to decide all the points arising from the judgment appealed against and even in the absence of an express provision like 0. XLI, r. 22 of the Code of Civil Procedure it can devise the appropriate procedure to be adopted at the hearing. There could be no better way of supplying the deficiency than by drawing upon the pro-visions of a general law like the Code of Civil Procedure and adopting such of those provisions as are suitable.
