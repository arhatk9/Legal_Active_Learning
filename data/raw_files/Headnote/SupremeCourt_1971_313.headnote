 The High Court in its order disposing of a habeas corpus petition stated that the detenu had been taken into custody on the 5th of May, 1968, that his arrest "had surreptitiously been" sworn to have taken place on the 10th of May, 1968, and that he was subjected to torture resulting in injuries. The appellants filed appeal in this Court to expunge these statements.
 Dismissing the appeal, HELD: In State of U.P. v. Mohammad Naim, [1964] 2 S.C.R.
 363, this court has observed that the matters which have to be kept in view in considering whether the remarks made in judgments against authorities whose conduct comes into consideration before the courts of law in cases to be decided by them are disparaging are : (a) whether the party whose conduct is in question is before the Court or has any opportunity of explaining or defending himself; (b) whether there is evidence on record bearing on that conduct justifying the remarks; and (c) whether it is necessary for the decision of the case, as an integral part thereof, to animadvert on that conduct. It has also been recognised that judicial pronouncements must be judicial in nature and should not normally depart from sobriety, moderation and reserve. [420 D] On the facts of the case and the evidence on record, none of the remarks to which exception has been taken could be described as unwarranted, unnecessary or irrelevant or can be characterised as generalisation or of a sweeping nature.
 The appellants had opportunity of filing their affidavits to give their own version, which, they have done in great detail, showing that they knew what the allegations against them were. If they wanted to produce any other person in support of their stand that the accused was only arrested on the 10th and not on the 5th or that the injuries found on the accused were old and were not fresh, they could have done so.
 In a habeas corpus petition where allegations are made that a citizen of this country is in illegal custody, it is the duty of the Court to safeguard the freedom of the citizen which has been guaranteed to him by the Constitution and to immediately take such action as would ensure that no person, however high or low, acts in contravention of the law or in a high handed arbitrary or illegal manner. While no doubt it is the duty of the Court to safeguard against any encroachment on the life and liberty of individuals, at the same time, it has to be recognised that the authorities who have the_ responsibility to discharge their functions vested in them under the law of the country should not be impeded or interfered with without justification. In furtherance of this duty the High Court passed the orders which in the circumstances of the case was fully justified. [419 F] 410
