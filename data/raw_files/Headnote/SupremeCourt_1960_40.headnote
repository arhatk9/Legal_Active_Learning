 As there was appreciable decline in the activities and busi- ness of the appellant it decided, by means of a resolution, to close down two local agencies at Koraput and Berhampur (Ganjam) by May 31, 957. About the same time the appellant also thought of retrenching its employees and decided to retrench ten of its employees with effect from December 1, 1956. An industrial dispute having arisen as a result of the said closure and 208 retrenchment it was referred to the industrial tribunal for adjudication. Before the industrial Tribunal it was conceded on behalf of the appellant that the retrenchment of ten employees was invalid as the statutory notice required by S. 25F(c) of the Industrial Disputes (Appellate Tribunal) Act had not been served. It was also stated afterwards that the statutory compensation had been paid to the retrenched workmen. As regards the question of closure the tribunal came to the conclusion that the closure was not bona fide, and it held that the legal consequence was that there was not a real closure. Accordingly it directed the appellant to reinstate the ten retrenched workmen and to pay all its workmen employed at the two centres as though the centres had not been closed and were actually working. On appeal by special leave :
 Held, that when the two agencies had in fact been closed the finding about malafides could not justify the conclusion that the said two agencies should be deemed to continue and the tribunal was not entitled to make an award on that basis.
