 In a suit for pre-emption by the sons of the vendors of certain land the vendees pleaded collusive nature of the suit and limitation. The trial ,court found that the vendors and the plaintiffs resided and messed together and the expenses of the litigation were paid by the vendors.
 From this it was concluded that the suit had been filled by the plaintiffs at the instance of and in collusion with the vendors and therefore the plaintiffs were held 'to he estopped from exercising their right of pre-emption. On the question of limitation the trial court held that the vendors, and not their tenants. were in possession of the land sold, that possession of the land was delivered to the vendees on the date of the sale and therefore the suit was barred by limitation. The first appellate Court reversed the finding of the trial court on both the pleas. In regard to the plea of limitation it held that a part of the land sold was in possession of tenants and, therefore, it did not admit of physical possession which meant immediate personal possession. In that view of the matter, under Section 10 of the Limitation Act, 1908 the terminus a quo was the date of registration of the ,ale deed and therefore within the one year limitation under Article 10. The High Court affirmed this decision. In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : dismissing the appeal, (i) On the facts of. the present case there was absolutely no material on which the plaintiffs could be held to have lost their right of preemption on the ground of collusion.
 Merely because the vendors. the fathers of the plaintiffs, were helping their sons to exercise the statutory right con- ferred on the sons could not without more, deprive them of the right to be substituted for the vendees in exercise of their right of pre-emption. '[788 F] (ii) On the finding of the District Judge and the High Court physical possession of the whole of the property sold was not taken by the vendees on the date of sale. Therefore the first part of Article 10 of the Limitation Act does not apply. The second part of Article 10 covers cases where the subject of the sale, which means the whole of the property Sold,does not admit of physical possession and that would be so where a part of the land in the possession of tenants.
 The argument that use of the expression "subject to the sale" suggests that this Article would apply only if the entire and not only a part of the land is in the possession of the tenants is not acceptable. [789 C] In the present case the properties in the hands of tenants have to he held to be incapable of "Physical possession" which means personal and immediate possession.
