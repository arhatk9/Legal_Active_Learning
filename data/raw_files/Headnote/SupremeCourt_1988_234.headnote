 The Bhumidhar bequeathed life estate to his wife and the remainder in favour of the daughters. On his death the wife entered in possession of the land and executed a will in favour of the appellants. In a proceeding under the U.P.
 Consolidation of Holdings Act the Consolidation Officer accepted the claim of the daughters (respondent Nos. 6 and 7) to Bhamidhari rights. That decision was reversed in appeal by the Settlement Officer, but restored on revision by the Assistant Director of Consolidation. The High Court dismissed the writ petition.
 In this appeal by special leave it was contended for the appellants that for determining the heirship of a Bhumidhar, the personal law applicable to him must be held to be excluded by the provisions of the U.P. Zamindari Abolition & Land Reforms Act, 1951 dealing with succession exhaustively, and that Bhumidhari right is not consistent with limited interest and whenever such a right vests in a person, he becomes the absolute owner.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
 HELD: The holder of a Hindu widow's estate is the owner of the property subject to certain restrictions on alienation. The whole estate is for the time vested in her and she represents it completely. Her right is of the nature of a right of property, her position is that of an owner and so long as she is alive no one has any vested interest in the succession {526H-527B] .

 PG NO 524 PG NO 525 In the instant case, however, the personal law applicable to the testator and his wife is not attracted at all. The wife did not get the limited interest of a Hindu widow as recognised under the Hindu Law. What was bequeathed by her husband was a life estate as understood under the English Law. She did not enter into possession as an heir.
 She got the land under a will. The right of a Bhumidhar with transferable rights to bequeath his holding or any part thereof by a will is expressly recognised by s. 169(1) of the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act. While bequeathing his Bhumidhar right in favour of his daughters he could subject it to a life estate in favour of his wife.
 The interest of the life estate holder thus continued to be a life estate and did not get enlarged defeating the bequest in favour of the daughters. They should, therefore, be recognised as Bhumidhars. [527C, 526G, 527B, 525G, 526B] Balbhadra v. Board of Revenue, [1981] Allahabad Law Journal 781, approved.
