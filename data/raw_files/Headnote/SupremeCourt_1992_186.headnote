 The Respondent was appointed in the appellant-Institute on contract basis initially for a period of three months.
 The appointment was purely ad hoc and was extended from time to time. At one stage she submitted her resignation and the same was accepted. Despite this, she made a further request that her services may be continued for some more time, and she was appointed on a contractual basis as a Training Executive on a consolidated compensation. This appointment was also purely on ad hoc basis, terminable without notice.
 However, a Committee of the appellant-institute, which went into the question of abolition of redundant posts, recommended the abolition of certain posts including the one held by the Respondent. The recommendation was accepted and the posts were abolished. The Respondent preferred a Writ Petition before the High Court challenging the action of the appellant-Institute.
 The High Court directed the appellant-Institute to put back the Respondent on duty on the post held by her and to regularise her services within three months.
 The appellant-Institute preferred the present appeal by special leave against the High Court's order, contending that the appointment of Respondent was purely on ad hoc basis and she had no right to continue in the post beyond six months for which period she was appointed; that the appellant had to abolish the post because of financial constraints as 713 it was finding it difficult to disburse salary even to its regular employees; and that the posts abolished were found to be redundant.
 Disposing of the appeal, this Court, 
 HELD : 1.1. It is clear that where the appointment is contractual and by efflux of time the appointment comes to an end, the respondent could have no right to continue in the post. [717-G] 1.2. In the instant case, the appointment was purely ad hoc and on a contractual basis for a limited period.
 Therefore, by expiry of the period of six months, the right to remain in the post comes to an end. [719-D] Jacob M. Puthuparambil and ors. etc. etc. v. Kerala Water Authority and ors. etc. etc.[1988] INSC 182; , [1990] 1 Suppl. SCR 562, distinguished.
 
 2. However, in the facts and circumstances of this case and taking into consideration that the Respondent is already 41 years of age, it is directed that the services of the Respondent may be continued till the end of this calendar year on the same terms as spelt out in the appointment order dated 1.9.90. Of course, it would be open to the appellant to consider the regularisation of her services, should it so desire. In that event, this judgment will not stand in the way of such regularisation.
