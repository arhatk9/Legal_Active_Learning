 In 1796 the suit village was granted to the person occupying the office of Nattuvar conferring on him the, mirasi of the village permanently, subject to his paying all just dues.
 At the time of making the permanent settlement in the District in which the village was situate, it was decided by the Government to abolish the office of Nattuwar but to maintain the shrotiems, that is, the grants made to Nattuvar, and realise the dues through the instrumentality of the Zamindar. The policy was implemented by including the shrotiem in the Tirumazhy zamindari and by transferring the Government's ultimate reversionary rights to the Zamindar. The result was that the shrotriem tenure in the hands of the Nature continued after the permanent settlement as it existed prior to it, except that the tenure under the Government became an under-tenure under the zamindar, as the zamindar intervened between the Government and the Nattuvar.
 In 1950, the appellant State notified the shrotriem village as a zamin estate under s. 3 of the Madras Estates (Abolition and conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1948. The respondent who was in possession and enjoyment of the village filed a suit for a declaration that the notification was illegal and void. The trial court dismissed the suit, but the High Court on appeal, held that the notification was illegal and void, because, the village was not a zamin village, but a whole inam village.
 In appeal to this Court, it was contended that as the village was included in the assets of the zamindari at the time of permanent settlement, it was part of zamindari.
 
HELD : As the village was held under a permanent under- tenure, it fell under the definition in s. 3 (2) (e) of the Madras Estates Land Act, 1908, and was, therefore, an estate thereunder and hence it was an undertenure estate under s.
 2(3) of the Abolition Act. As the "under tenure" estate is excluded from the definition of "zamin estate", the notification by the Government on the basis that it is a zamin estate was void. [928 A-B] Though a village is physically a part of a zamindari, if it is held on a permanent under-tenure. it is included in the definition of an estate under s. 3(2)(e) of the Madras Estates Land Act. To constitute an under-tenure it is not material whether the grant was a pre-settlement or post- settlement one, but what is important is : in whom the reversionary interest rests. The reversionary interest may rest in the proprietor of the zamindari either because at the time of permanent settlement the inam was included in the assets of the zamindari or because he himself was the grantor of a permanent under-tenure. 'Me showing of shrotriem village as village of zamindar is not decisive in the context of the Act. The distinction between zamin and under-tenure is relevant for the purpose of compensation.
