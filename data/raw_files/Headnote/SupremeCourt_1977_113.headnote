 The appellants were charged under section 420 read with section 120B of the Indian Penal Code on the ground that there was a conspiracy between them as a result of which hundreds of applications were filed for the issue of pass- ports. The applications were made by suppressing the real facts about the .nationality and addresses of the applicants and by making false representations in several other re- spects. The prosecution alleged that hundreds of passports were issued and delivered to persons who were not entitled to have them under the law. Special Leave was granted limited to the question whether the passports were property within the meaning of section 420 of the Indian Penal code.

 2. The word 'property' is defined as the right to the use or enjoyment or the beneficial right of disposal of anything that can be the subject of ownership, specially ownership of tangible things. Passport is a tangible thing and is capa- ble of ownership. It is the property of the State so long as it is with the passport issuing authority and has not been issued to the person concerned, and after issue it becomes the property of the person to whom it has been granted. Passport can be the subject of ownership or exclu- sive possession and is therefore property within the meaning of sections 415 and 420 I.P.C. [523 A-C, 524 G]
