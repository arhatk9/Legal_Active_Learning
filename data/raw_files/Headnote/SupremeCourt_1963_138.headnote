 The appellant, as well as respondents 1 and 2 and others, had applied for the grant of stage carriage permit. The Regional Transport Authority granted a permit to each of the two respondents. The appellant aggrieved by this order preferred an appeal before the State Transport Appellate Tribunal. The Appellate Tribunal held that the appellant should be preferred to the Respondent No. 1. Against this order the respondent No. 1 preferred a writ petition before the High Court. The High Court set aside the order of the Appellate Tribunal on the ground that the Appellate Tribunal did riot state the reason for preferring the appellant to the Respondent No. 1.
 Held that the High Court was justified in setting aside the order of the State Transport Appellate Tribunal. In fact the State Transport Appellate Tribunal did not determine the only question which required to be determined and that was why one operator should be preferred to another.
