 The petitioner in this habeas corpus petition has challenged the validity of detention order dated the 28th August. 1973, passed under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971 on the ground that the petitioner was acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community. The ground of detention furnished to the petitioner was that on 19-8-1973 when petitioner's godown was searched. property belonging to the Railways of the value of Rs. 1180/- 'was found. The case of the petitioner was that the goods were scrap matter and that such article were available in the open market. The petitioner produced some receipts alleged to have been issued by the persons from whom he purchased the scrap. A criminal case was filed against the petitioner under section 3(a) of the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966 but that case could not be proceeded with as according to the District Magistrate the witnesses did not dare to depose in open court against the petitioner for fear of their lives.
 
HELD : This is a typical case in which for no apparent reason a person who could easily be prosecuted under the punitive laws is being preventively detained. The Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966, confers extensive powers to bring to book persons who are found in unlawful possession of railway property. Statements recorded under that Act during the course of investigation do not attract the provisions of section 162 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The Sub Inspector of Police who made the Panchanama could certainly not be afraid of giving evidence against the petitioner. Besides, if the statement of the detenue was recorded during the course of investigation that itself could be relied upon by the prosecution in order to establish the charge that the petitioner was in unlawful possession of the railway property.
 
HELD FURTHER: On the material which was available to the detaining authority it was impossible to arrive at the conclusion that the possession of the petitioner was unlawful. The prosecution was in all probability dropped as the petitioner might have been able to establish that his possession of the goods was not unlawful. The rule was made absolute and the petitioner was directed to be set at liberty forthwith. [914 F-G]
