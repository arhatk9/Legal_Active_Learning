 Rule 5(2) of the Bombay Judicial Service Recruitment Rules, 1956 provided for two methods of appointment to the posts of District Judges (i) by promotion of members of the Junior Branch who had served as Assistant Judges and (ii) by direct recruitment from members of the Bar. The proviso to Rule 5(2) (i) (b) provided that when a member of the Bar was recruited as a District Judge, and he was less then the age prescribed, he should first be appointed to work as Assistant Judge for such period as might be decided by the Government before he was appointed as a District Judge.
 The appellants who were members of the Junior Branch of the Judicial Service of the State of Maharahtra were appointed as Assistant Judges in 1971. in 1974 respondents Nos. 2 to 5, who were members of the Bar, were appointed as Assistant Judges and their names were shown below the appellants in the existing list of Assistant Judges. In February 1977 respondents Nos. 2 to 5 were appointed to officiate as District Judges. The appellants filed petitions before the High Court claiming that they should be treated as having been promoted as District Judges along with respondents Nos. 2 to 5. The High Court dismissed the petitions. Hence these appeals.
 Dismissing the appeals.

 HELD: Under rule 5 (2)(i)(b) of the Bombay Judicial Service Recruitment Rules, 1956 even though a member of the Bar is recruited as a District Judge he may be asked to serve as an Assistant Judge for a specified period. When he so func- 720 tions he cannot be called as a member of the cadre of Assistant Judges subject to the rule of seniority applicable to the regular members of that cadre who were appointed by promotion from the Junior Branch. He would only be a person who is recruited as a District Judge but posted as an Assistant Judge to gain the requisite Judicial experience of that post before being entrusted with the duties of a District Judge. Inclusion of the name of such a person in the list of Assistant Judges does not confer any right on such regular Assistant Judges appointed by promotion from the Junior Branch who are placed above him in the list to claim seniority over him. [723 G-H, 724 A-B] In the instant case since as between the appellants on the one hand and respondents Nos. 2 to 5 on the other there being no comparison, it cannot be said that there is any violation of Article 14 or Article 16 of the Constitution.
 It appears that all this confusion has arisen on account of the practice of including the names of the direct recruits from the Bar to the cadre of District Judges while they are serving as Assistant Judges under the proviso to Rule 5(2)(i)(b) of the Rules in the same list alongwith Assistant Judges promoted from the Junior Branch. If a separate list of such persons was there, there would not have been any room for such confusion.[724 E-F]
