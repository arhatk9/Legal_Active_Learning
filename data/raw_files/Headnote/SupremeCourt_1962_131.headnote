 This was an appeal by special leave by the judges of the Calcutta High Court against the decision of the City Civil Court at Calcutta decreeing the respondent 1's suit. That respondent was a Munsif in the West Bangal Civil Service (judicial) and had issued an injunction in his own favour in a case where he was the plaintiff. That order of injunction was set aside in appeal by the appellate Court. When the cases of several Munsif came up for consideration before the High Court for inclusion of names in the panel officers to officiate as Subordinate judges, the respondent's name was excluded. He was told by the Registrar of the Court on a representation made by him that the Court had decided to consider his case after a year. As the result of such exclusion respondent 1, who was then the senior most in the list of Munsifs lost eight places in the cadre of Subordinate judges before he was 438 actually appointed to act as an Additional Subordinate fudge. His case in substance was that this exclusion by the High Court amounted in law to the penalty of "withholding of promotion" without giving him an opportunity to show cause and he prayed that a declaration might be made that he occupied the same position in respect of seniority in the cadre of Subordinate judges as he would have done if no supersession had taken place and claimed arrears of salary payable to a Subordinate judge. The trial Court decreed the suit. A preliminary objection was taken in this Court on behalf of the appellants that the controversy raised was not justiciable.
 Held, that there was no cause of action for the suit and the appeal must succeed.
 There could be no doubt that under Art. 235 of the Constitution the High Court was the sole authority to decide the fitness of a Munsif to be appointed as a Subordinate judge and the exercise of its power was not justiciable.
 Article 235, read with the service rules, clearly showed that a Munsif had no right to promotion that could be enforced through court. Rule 55A of the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules had no application to the State of West Bengal and r. 49 conferred no right to promotion but only a safeguard against imposition of any punishment by way of withholding of promotion without adequate opportunity to show cause and operated only when there was a disciplinary proceeding.
 It was not correct to say that the High Court should have consulted the State Public Service Commission since Art.
 320(3)(c) of the Constitution also contemplated disciplinary matters.
 Nor was it correct to say that the respondent I was reduced in rank as a result of the High Court's action within the meaning of Art. 311(2) of the Constitution. The word 'rank' in Art. 311(2) referred to classification and not to a particular place in the same cadre in the hierarchy of a service. All Subordinate judges were in the same cadre and held the same rank irrespective of seniority. Losing some places in the seniority list, therefore, did not amount to reduction in rank.
 Nor were Arts. 14 and 16(1) violated. Equal opportunity did not mean getting the particular post for which a number of persons was considered. So long as one was equally considered along with others there could be no denial of equal opportunity if ultimately he was not selected in preference to the others.
