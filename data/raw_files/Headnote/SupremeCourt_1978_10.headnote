Fulkanwar, his mother Smt. Bhagwanti and his nephew Rambakas, on the night of January 20, 1975 and also- stole of various articles which were recovered from the appellants' residence soon after.

 Dismissing the appeals by special leave the Court 
HELD : 1. The question whether a presumption should be drawn under illustration (a) of Section 114 of the Evidence Act is a matter which depends on the evidence and the circumstances of each case. Thus the nature of the stolen article, the manner of its acquisition by the owner, the nature of the evidence about its identification, the manner in which it was dealt with by the appellant, the place and the circumstances of its recovery, the length of the intervening period, the ability or otherwise of the appellant to explain his possession, are factors which have to be taken into consideration in arriving at a decision.
 [600 EG] 2.Recent and unexplained possession of stolen articles may well be taken to be presumptive evidence of the charge of murder. [600 B-C] The prosecution succeeded in proving beyond any doubt that the commission of the murders and the robbery formed part of one transaction and the recent and unexplained possession of the stolen property by the appellant justified the presumption that it was he and no one else, who had committed the murders and the robbery. The appellant was given an opportunity to explain his possession, as well as his conduct in decoying Smt. Lakhpatiya and the other per- sons who died at his hand, but he was unable to do so.
