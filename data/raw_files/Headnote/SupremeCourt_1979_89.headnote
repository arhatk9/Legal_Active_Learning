 The appellants were the managing director and director of a private limited company. On November 13, 1961 a resolution for voluntary liquidation of the private company was passed. In February and November, 1970 the Income Tax Officer issued notices to the appellants calling upon them to pay income tax which remained unpaid from the company to the tune of Rs. 1.34 lakhs.
 The contention of the appellants that the company had gone into liquidation before the Act came into force on 1st April, 1962 and, therefore, s. 179 had no application to this case was rejected by the Income-tax Officer. The appellants' revision petition was rejected by the Commissioner; the High Court dismissed their writ petition in limine.
 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD : The appellants could not escape from their liability to pay the tax dues. Section 179 was meant to cover cases of this nature also. [784A] There are three stages when a company goes into liquidation, namely : (1) the commencement of the winding up of the company; (2) continuation of the proceedings or the steps for winding up and (3) final winding up and dissolution of the company. Section 179 will be attracted if any one or more of the three stages occurred after the commencement of the Act even though the first or the first and second events had happened earlier. The directors were made liable to pay the tax dues because on its liquidation it becomes difficult for the department to realise the tax dues from the assets of the company.
 [783D-E] In the instant case, although the commencement of the winding up of the company had begun on a date prior to the date of commencement of the Act, at the time when the Income-tax officer issued notice, proceedings for its winding up were pending.
