 Maintaining the order of the High Court quashing the detention, the Court ^ 
 HELD : (1) The detention under section 3 of the COFEPOSA is only for the purpose of preventing smuggling and all the grounds, whether there are one or more, would be relatable only to various activities of smuggling and no other separate ground which could deal with matters other than smuggling could be conceived of because the Act of smuggling covers several activities each forming a separate ground of detention and the Act deals with no other act except smuggling. Indeed, if the interpretation, namely, that Section 5A contemplates that there should be only one ground which relates to the violation of section 3 of the Act and if that ground is irrelevant while the other grounds which relate to the same subject matter are clear and specific the detention order will not stand vitiated, is accepted, then section 5A will become otiose. [501 H, 502 A- C] (2) Whenever allegations of smuggling are made against a person who is sought to be detained for preventing further smuggling, there is bound to be one act or several acts with the common object of smuggling goods which is sought to be prevented by the Act. It would, therefore, not be correct to say that the object of the Act constitutes the ground for detention. If this is so, in no case there could be any other ground for detention, except the one which relates to smuggling. This is neither the object of the Act nor can such an object be spelt out from the language in which section 5A is couched. What section 5(A) of the Act provides is that where there are a number of grounds of detention covering various activities of the detenu spreading over a period or periods, each activity is a separate ground by itself and if one of the grounds is irrelevant, vague or unspecific, then that will not vitiate the order of detention on the other grounds.
