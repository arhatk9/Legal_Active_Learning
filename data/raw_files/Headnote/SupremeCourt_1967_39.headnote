 The appellants were charged for murder under s. 302/34 I.P.C.. and were:acquitted by the Sessions Judge. On appeal the High Court reversed the acquittal and convicted the appellants under s. 302/34 I.P.C. In appeal to this Court the appellants contended that (i) since an acquittal.
 "reinforces" the presumption of innocence, it was not a fit case for reversal of an acquittal, and (ii) the testimony of the eye witnesses in the case was found by the Sessions Judge to be unsatisfactory.
 HELD:The High Court rightly convicted the appellants.
 (i)The powers of the High Court in an appeal from an acquittal are m no way different from those in an appeal from a conviction. The High Court can consider the evidence and weigh the probabilities. It can accept evidence rejected by the Sessions Judge and reject evidence accepted by him, unless the Sessions Judge relied upon his observation of the demeanour of a particular witness. In departing from the conclusions of the Sessions Judge the High Court must pay due attention to the grounds on which the acquittal is based on repeal those grounds satisfaction torily, bearing in mind always that an accuse starts with a presumption of innonce in his favour and this presumption cannot certainly be less strong after the acquittal. If these matters are properly kept in view and the acquittal is reversed, there can no objection because the High Court. is empowered to reverse an acquittal. [729 E-G] Sanwat Singh v. State of Rajasthan [1960] INSC 283; [1961] 3 S.C.R. 120, referred to.
 (ii)The evidence of the eye witnesses was consistent, convincing and credible The Sessions Judge lost sight of the main issue, namely, whether what the eye witnesses said was credible, in an attempt to examine the inter-relation of the witnesses. This is an inquiry of value up to a point but is not conclusive because there is no crime proved in small village communities where some kind of relationship cannot be established between witnesses and the victim and some petty quarrel shown to have taken place in the past between some of the witnesses and the accused. To decide a case on the basis of such circumstances, unless they are of great or significant magnitude, is to place reliance on collateral circumstances at the expense of direct evidence of guilt which really matters. The first serves as a check upon the latter but no more. [731 B-D]
