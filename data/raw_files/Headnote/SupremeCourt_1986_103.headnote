 The appellant was granted extra-ordinary leave on the request of the Government of India for being sent on a teaching assignment to the University of Aden (South Yeman) on the express condition that his lien on the post of Head of the Department of Zoology in a college affiliated to the Kanpur University will be maintained and his seniority will be protected. After having fulfilled the aforesaid teaching assignment and on return to India, he sought to resume his post in the college. The first respondent who was acting as the Head of the Department of Zoology in the college refused to handover charge on the ground that he had attained seniority over the appellant. The Principal also rejected the appellant's claim to seniority. Thereafter, the appellant challenged the order of the Principal before the Vice-Chancellor of Kanpur University on the ground that he had not suffered a break in service and his seniority over the first respondent remained intact all through his period of service on deputation. The Vice-Chancellor upheld the appellant's claim and held that he was entitled to his rightful place of seniority. The Chancellor, in appeal by the first respondent, affirmed the order of the Vice- chancellor.
 The first respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court. A learned single Judge of the High Court held that in terms of either the old Statutes or the First Statutes of the Kanpur University, the appellant is not entitled to reckon the period of service at the University of Aden for computing length of service in the DAV College and as such the recognition of the seniority of the appellant over the first 968 respondent by the Vice-Chancellor and the Chancellor in their respective orders cannot be sustained.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: l. The High Court has not properly comprehended the Statutes. Because of the failure of the High Court to have applied the appropriate provision in the Statutes, the period of service of the appellant on deputation has been wrongly held to be non-includible in the total length of service of the appellant. The Principal, as the Head of the Institution, was undoubtedly competent to grant leave on loss to pay to the appellant in order to enable him to take up a foreign assignment on deputation basis. The period of leave granted to the appellant was utilised in holding another position involving similar work and therefore, the appellant is automatically entitled to the benefit of sub- clause (4) of old Statute 11.34. [976 D; 978 G] 2.(i) & b-clause (1) of statute 11.34 of the Old Statutes deals with the reckoning of seniority on the basis of the length of service in one and the same college and in the same cadre and grade; sub-clause (2) provides for the addition of service in another University or associated/affiliated college etc. provided the University is situate in Uttar Pradesh and the college is affiliated to or associated with one of the Universities in the State;
 sub-clause (3) excludes service in an officiating capacity and grants recognition of temporary service only if it has continuity with a subsequent permanent appointment; and lastly sub-clause (4) prescribes for tacking on of leave period with the total length of service provided ; (1) the period of leave has been spent in holding another position involving similar work or (2) it was medical leave.[976 D-F] 2.(ii) The case of the appellant would not fall under sub-clause(2) because his service in the University of Aden will not constitute such kinds of services as are envisaged in the sub-clause. However, sub-clause (4) would undoubtedly cover the case of the appellant because he had been granted leave of absence on loss of pay for a period of three years for rendering service in the University of Aden on deputation basis. The word "unless during such leave another position 969 involving similar work was held" would squarely apply to the A period of leave of the appellant. It is significant to note that the qualifying words "University or College situated in Uttar Pradesh and the Colleges affiliated to or associated with one of the Universities in the State" occurring in sub-clause (2) are conspicuously absent in sub- clause (4). [976 F-G; 977 A-B] B 2.(iii) As there is no conflict between sub-clause (4) of Statute 11.34 of the Old Statutes and any provision in the First Statutes, there is no room or scope for invoking the overriding provision contained in Statute 1.02(1) for denying the application of Old Statute 11.34(4) to the case of the appellant. On the other hand, the appellant will be entitled to claim the benefit of First Statute 18.16 which preserved "inter seniority of teachers employed in the University from before the commencement of the Statute."[977 C-D] 
 3. Sub-clause (2) and (4) of Old Statute 11.34 contemplate different situations and act in different fields. While sub-clause (4) contemplates service rendered elsewhere during the period of leave, sub-clause (2) does not contemplate any such service but contemplates the service rendered elsewhere without taking leave from any institution. proper exposition of the fields of operation of sub-clauses (2) and (4) of Old Statute 11.34 will at once bring to light the merit in the contentions of the appellant and the error that has been committed by the High Court.
 Moreover, the provision contained in sub-clause (4) of Old Statute 11.34 has not been disturbed in any manner by the First Statutes and hence the appellant will be entitled to the benefit of this provision, especially in terms of statute 18.16 of the First Statutes. [977 D-H; 978 A-B]
