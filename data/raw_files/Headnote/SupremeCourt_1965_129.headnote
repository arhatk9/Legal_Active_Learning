 The plaintiff-appellant instituted a suit in the civil court for the possession of suit properties on redemption of a mortgage and the taking of accounts on the allegation that defendant No. 1 was the usufructuary mortgagee under a mortgage deed. The defendants pleaded that the transaction in question was an advance lease and not a mortgage and that they were "protected" tenants within the meaning of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948. Under s.
 70(b) of the Act it was one of the duties of the Mamlatdar to decide whether a person was a 'protected' tenant. Under s. 85(1) of the Act the jurisdiction of the civil court %-as barred in respect of matters which fell to be decided by the mamlatdar. The trial court held that the document in question was a composite document comprising of a mortgage and a lease, that the mortgage debt having been paid the mortgage stood redeemed, and that the plaintiff was at liberty to seek his remedy of possession in the revenue court-. The first appellate court held that the civil court had no jurisdiction to determine whether defendant No. 1 was a mortgagee in possession or a tenant, but confirmed the trial courts finding that the mortgage debt stood redeemed.
 The High Court in plaintiffs second appeal held that the lower appellate court having correctly held that the civil court had no jurisdiction to interpret the document executed between the parties ought not to have taken the accounts treating the document as a mortgage. It asked the trial court to refer the issue as to the nature of the transaction to the mamlatdar. The plaintiff filed a Letters Patent Appeal and that also having failed, he appealed to the Supreme Court, by special It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the jurisdiction of a civil court depends on the allegations made in the plaint and the plea in the written statement that the defend-ants were 'protected' tenants did not oust jurisdiction of the civil court.
 
HELD : (i) The Mamlatdar has exclusive jurisdiction under the Act to entertain an application by a landlord for possession of agricultural lands against a tenant, and the civil court has no jurisdiction to entertain and try a suit by a landlord against a tenant for possession of agricultural lands. The Mamlatdar has no jurisdiction to try a suit by a landowner for recovering of possession of agricultural lands from a trespasser or from a mortgagee on -redemption of a mortgage, and the civil court has no jurisdiction to entertain such a suit; but if the defendant to the suit pleads that he is a tenant and an issue arises whether he is such a tenant, the Court must refer the issue to the Mamlatdar for determination and must stay the suit pending such determination, and after the Mamlatdar has decided the issue, the court may dispose of the suit in the light of the decision of the Mamlatdar.
