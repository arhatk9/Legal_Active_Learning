 On the allegations, that the 1st accused, who was the Acharya of a public trust withdrew monies from the trust fund to meet his tax liabilities, that the other accused as trustees connived at the contraventions of the law, and that the monies were reimbursed later, the accused were convicted under ss. 35(i) and 66 of the Bombay Public Trust Act, 1950.
 In appeal, the High Court acquitted, the accused, holding that the requisite mens rea was not proved against the 1st accused, and that the other accused were not trustees at the time of the alleged offence. Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : The broad principles accepted by Courts with regard to the question whether a crime can be said to have been committed without the necessary mens rea. are : Where an offence is created by statute, however, comprehensive and unqualified the language of the statute, it is usually understood as silently requiring that the element of mens rea should he imported into the definition of the crime, unless a contrary intention is expressed or implied. In other words, the plain words of statute are read subject to a presumption, which may be rebutted, that the general rule of law that no crime can be committed unless there is mens rea has not been ousted by the particular enactment. Mens rea means some blameworthy mental condition, whether constituted by knowledge or intention or otherwise. But this rules has several exceptions. [560 H] The principal classes of exceptions may be reduced to three.
 One is a class of acts which are not criminal in any real sense, but are acts which in the public interest prohibited under a penalty. Another class comprehends some, and perhaps all, public nuisances. Lastly, there may be cases in which although the proceeding is criminal in form, it is really only a summary mode of enforcing a civil right. But except in such cases as these, there must in general be guilty knowledge on the part of the defendant, or of some one whom he has put in his place to act for him, generally or in the particular matter in order to constitute and offence. The present case falls within the first category [561 G] Section 35(1) of the Bombay Public Trust Act creates a quasi-criminal offence. It is a regulatory provision. It is enacted with a view to safeguard the interest of the public regarding trust money. The offence in question is punishable only with fine. The conviction under that does not carry any stigma. The language of the provision appears to make its contravention an absolute liability.
 Consequently the requirement of mens rea cannot be read into it. [563 A]
