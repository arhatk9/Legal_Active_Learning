 The High Court up held the decision of the trial court.
 On appeal to this Court it was contended by the appellant that a synopsis of the evidence was adequate to acquaint the respondent to cross-examine the witnesses at the inquiry.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : It is unjust and unfair to deny the Government servant copier. of statements of witnesses examined during investigation and produced at the inquiry in support of the charges leveled against him. A synopsis does not satisfy the requirements of giving the Government servant a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken. [371 D-E]
