 Appellant, an employee of an erstwhile Life Insurance Company filed a suit against the L.I.C. in the Calcutta High Court inter alia, claiming that the purported termination of his service was void and for a declamation that he continued to be in service of the Corporation after the vesting of the business in the life Insurance Corporation. He further claimed the arrears of rent and other dues accrued before the vesting and salary for the subsequent period. The Calcutta High Court split the two set of reliefs and held that under Rule 12-A-the Life Insurance Tribunal had the exclusive jurisdiction to decide whether the Corporation was liable as a successor to the said companies for the earlier liabilities or not. The High Court 'further held that the question as to whether the employment of the appellant stood terminated by virtue of sec. 3(2) of the Ordinance was also within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Since the relief for declaration of the continuation of service and subsequent salary depended upon the question of termination of service under sec. 3(2) of the Ordinance, the High Court ordered that part of the claim may stand over and considered after the Tribunal's decision on the first set of issues. The court gave liberty to the Corporation to agitate (at such an adjourned hearing) that the Central Government has the exclusive jurisdiction under sec. 11(1) & 11(3) of Act to adjudicate the question of continuation of employment.
 On appeal the Court, 
HELD: (1) The expression "controlled business of the insurer" in, Rule 12A means the life insurance business carried on by an insurer before its management became vested in a custodian under the ordinance and then in the Corporation., The appellant was not right in contending that the past liabilities do not relate to "controlled business".
 Therefore the Tribunal was the proper authority to decide question of arrears of pay and other dues. [1003 E] (2) Rule 12-A confers on the Tribunal the jurisdiction to try "any question of any nature whatsoever in relation to .... liabilities pertaining to controlled business." 'Me question, whether the services of the appellant stood terminated by cl. 3(2) of the Ordinance is related to the liability' of the "controlled business" and is covered by the wide wording of Rule 12-A. The Tribunal alone had the jurisdiction to decide the said question. [1005 D] (3) The High Court was right in splitting the appellants' claim into two, one triable by the Tribunal and the other not, and retaining with it 999 that part of the suit which did not fall within the scope of R. 12-A with liberty to the parties to raise later on the question whether that part was triable by the court or by the Central Government under S. 11 (3) of the Act. [1O05 G] Appeal dismissed.
