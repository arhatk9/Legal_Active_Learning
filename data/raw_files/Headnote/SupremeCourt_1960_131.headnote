 The petitioner, a limited company carrying on the business of manufacturing and selling iron and steel goods, with its factory at Jamshedpur in Bihar and its head Sales Office in Calcutta in west Bengal, was served with a notice on August 12, 1959, by the Commercial Tax Officer of West Bengal directing it to submit a statement of sales from Jamshedpur for the period of assessment July 1, 1957, to March 31, 1958, " the documents relating to which were transferred in West Bengal or of any other sales that may have taken place in West Bengal under s. 3(b) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956." For the same period, i.e., July 1, 1957 to March 31, 1958, of assessment the petitioner had on December 15, 1958, filed with the Sales Tax Officer, Jamshedpur, a return of inter-State sales made from Jamshedpur, in which were included all sales in which movement of the goods had taken place from the State of Bihar to destinations outside the State, and had paid advance tax under the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956. The petitioner contended before the Taxing Officer of West Bengal, inter alia, that in so far as its inter-State sales from Jamshedpur were concerned the situs of such sales, as determined under s. 4(2) of the Act, would always be in the State of Bihar as the goods were in Bihar and that the State of West Bengal could not tax a sale where goods were under the contract of sale moved from Bihar to Bengal even though the documents of title to the goods sold were transferred in Bengal, such sales being taxable only by the State of Bihar. The Taxing Officer, however, taxed all the sales effected by the company under S. 3(b) on the view that the sales in which the documents of title were handed over in Calcutta were taxable in the State of West Bengal because (1) all the sales effected in favour of West Bengal parties satisfied the conditions prescribed by s. 3(b), and (2) the place where the documents were delivered by the company to the purchaser was the place where the sale was effected.
 Held, per Sinha, C. J., Imam and Shah, jj., Sarkar and Das Gupta, JJ., dissenting) : (1) that within cl. (b) of s. 3 of the 49 380 Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, are included sales in which property in the goods passes during the movement of the goods from one State to another by transfer of documents of title thereto clause (a) of S. 3 covers sales, other than those included in cl. (b), in which the movement of goods from one State to another is the result of a covenant or incident of the contract of sale, and property in the goods passes in either State.
 (2) that sub-s. (2) of s. 4 of the Act defines what sales or purchases shall be deemed to take place inside a State and, thereby, locates the place where a sale is effected.
 The terms of the sub-section being quite general provide also for cases where sales are effected in the course of inter-State trade or commerce under s. 3 of the Act.
 (3) that the Taxing authorities in West Bengal had to ascertain, before they could order payment of tax under the Central Sales Tax Act, whether on the materials they were satisfied (a) that the goods at the time of transfer of documents of title were in movement from the State of Bihar to the State of West Bengal, and (b) that the place where the sale was effected was, under S. 4, cl. (2), within the State of West Bengal.
 Per Sarkar and Das Gupta, JJ.--A sale contemplated by s.
 3(b) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, is one where the transfer of property in the goods sold takes place by the transfer of documents of title to them during their movement from one State to another and is effected within the State in which the documents of title are transferred ; that State is the " appropriate State " in respect of such sale. (2) The purpose of S. 4(2) of the Act is to formulate principles for determining when a sale takes place " outside a State ", and not to fix the place where a sale under S. 3(b) can be said to have taken effect. The place of that sale is fixed by cl. (ii) of the Explanation in S. 2(a).
