 On a complaint made by the Honorary Secretary of the Supreme Court Bar Association, the Registrar of the Supreme Court issued notices to the appellant and another under r. 24, 0.
 IVA of the Supreme Court Rules to show cause why their names should not be included in the list of touts to be published by him thereunder. A preliminary objection was raised that rr. 23 and 24 were ultra vires the powers of this Court conferred by Art. 145(I)(a) of the Constitution and that the Registrar had, therefore, no jurisdiction to initiate the proceedings. The Registrar overruled the objection and on the evidence adduced by the complainant found both the persons to be touts within the meaning of r. 23 of the said order and directed their names to be included in the list of touts to be hung up on the Court notice board. The appellant appealed to the Chamber judge and on his direction the matter was placed before the Constitution Bench:
 Held, that rr. 23 and 24 of 0. IVA of the Supreme Court Rules, 1950, as amended, are intra vires the rule-making powers of this Court and the order of the Registrar must be upheld.
 There can be no doubt that this Court has the inherent jurisdiction to regulate its proceedings relating to the conduct of persons appearing before it, in and out of Court, in so far as it relates to the profession and its ethics.
 Apart from such jurisdiction, Art. 145(1)(a) of the Constitution by using the expression " the practice and procedure of the 65 500 Court," which has to be construed in its widest sense, confers on this Court the power to regulate not merely the conduct of advocates appearing in Court but also of their assistants in relation to the business of this Court., Consequently, r. 23 which makes an advocate who accepts engagement in legal business through a tout guilty of misconduct and r. 24 which lays down the procedure for including a person in the list of touts are clearly within the rule-making powers of this Court.
 No question as to r. 24 infringing Art. 14 of the Constitution could arise since it does not discriminate within the class to which it applies, nor does it contravene Art.19 or 21 of the Constitution and it was futile to contend that the word 'life ' in Art. 21 included 'livelihood'. No tout can claim any rights in relation to the business of the Court. This rule which seeks to maintain the purity of the legal profession is no less in the interest of the general public and it is the duty of every Court to see that toutism is completely eliminated.
