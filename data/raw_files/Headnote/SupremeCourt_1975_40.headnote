 The Executive Committee of the District Council, United Khasi-Jaintia Hills directed that no new construction or re- construction of stalls Should be undertaken in Bara Bazar.
 The respondents, who were thus prohibited from constructing their shops filed the writ petitions in the High Court challenging the direction.
 Schedule VI of the Constitution shows that the United Khasi Jaintia Hills District is a tribal area within the State of Meghalaya. The territories comprised within this district include Bara Bazar area, In view of para 6 of the Schedule which enumerates the powers of the District Council. the District Council has power to manage the Bara Bazar market and issue the impugned orders. But para 20 of the Schedule states that if any part of the area comprised in the district were included in the municipality of Shillong, before the district came into being the powers conferred on the District Council by para 6 of the Schedule would not be available to the Council in respect of that area. The High Court found that the village of Mawkher which comprises Bara Bazar, was a part of the municipality of the Shillong on the basis of (1) a notification dated January 16, 1934, (2) an extract from the Demand and Bill Register of the Shillong Municipality for the year 1957-58 and (3) the Khasi Siemships (Application of Laws) Order, 1949, and held that the District Council had no jurisdiction, administrative or otherwise over Bara Bazar and quashed the Impugned orders.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) 'The 1934 notification shows that what was ceded by the Siem of Mylliem when he ceded Mawkher and other villages to the British Government was only the jurisdiction necessary for the municipal administration in accordance with the Assam Municipal Act, 1923, and the Governor General in Council issued an order extending the 1923 Municipal Act to those villages. The Order provided that the villages were to be deemed as a municipality designated the Shillong (Administered Areas) Municipality. Thus the villages were ceded for the specified purpose of municipal administration only and though the provisions of the Municipal Act were made applicable to the ceded villages they were never included within the territorial jurisdiction of the Shillong municipality, but were deemed to be a distinct municipality- the Shillong (Administered Areas) Municipality. This shows that the villages were not intended to be merged in the Shillong Municipality though the officer,.% of the municipality were to exercise similar powers and discharge like duties in the ceded areas. Chapter 11 of the Municipal Act which empowered the provincial government to include within a municipality any local area in its vicinity was not made applicable to the villages. There is also no evidence that these territories were subsequently merged in the, Municipality of Shillong. [605F606A] (2)The Demand and Bill Register of the, Shillong municipality refers to South East Mawkher as a ward of the Shillong Municipality. But it does not mean that Mawkher or South East Mawkher was included In the territorial jurisdiction of the Municipality. It only means that the District Council, instead of taking up the administration allowed existing arrangements to continue ill some places for some time. [606B-C] 470 Sup. CI/75 602 (3)The Khasi Siemships (Application of Jaws) Order, 1949 refers to "Shillong Administered Areas" by which is meant 'so much of the areas for the time being comprised within the municipality of Shillong' as forms part of the United Khasi Jaintia Hills District. and the first Schedule to the Order defines the "Shillong Administered Areas" as comprising the areas covered by the Shillong (Administered Areas) Municipality which includes Mawkher. But, in view of the notification dated January 16, 1934, and the absence of any provision effecting merger with the Shillong Municipality the expression 'comprised within the municipality of Shillong,' can only mean that part of the district in which the officers of the Shillong municipality continued to exercise powers and discharge duties as before.
