 JD and RS were two of the five candidates for election to the Lok Sabha. JD was the returned candidate and RS polled the next highest number of votes. After the counting of the votes, RS applied for a recount under r. 63 of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961. In the petition he alleged that the difference in votes obtained by JD and himself was marginal, that more than 7000 votes were declared invalid;
 that votes have not only been declared as invalid but also that "admitted disputed votes" were not properly counted, and that the number of votes declared invalid materially affected the result of the election. He also alleged certain irregularities. The Returning Officer directed that all the votes cast in favour of JD and RS as welt as the rejected votes should be recounted. There was a slight discrepancy in the number of votes obtained by each of the two candidates, and in the number of rejected votes, in the recount, but there was no effect on the result of the election.
 In a petition challenging the election of JD the following grounds were urged, (1) that the election should be set aside under s. 100(l) (iii) and (iv) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, because, the votes have not been properly counted as valid or invalid and there was a violation of rule 63; and (2) that JD was guility of corrupt practice under s. 123(4) of the Act in that statements were made and documents published, by person, with the consent of JD attacking the personal character of RS; that his election agent distributed a weekly containing an attack on the personal character of RS; and that JD himself made such statements and published such documents. The petition was dismissed by the High Court.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court (except in respect of costs), 
HELD (1) The plea in the election petition that valid votes have been counted as invalid and invalid votes as valid would not include the plea that any valid votes of RS and other candidates have been counted as valid for JD.
 Therefore, it was not necessary to recount the votes of candidates other than JD and RS. On the allegations contained in the application to the Returning Officer he could not have ordered a recount of all the votes and his order directing recount was not in contravention of rule 68.
 The discrepancies in the number of votes was satisfactorily explained and there was no acceptable evidence of the alleged irregularities. [826 C; 827 A-B] (2)(i) Section 116A of the Act provides for appeal to this Court from an order of the High Court dismissing an election petition and an appeal lies on issues of both of law and of facts. Section 116C applies the Code of Civil Procedure as nearly as possible in the determination of the appeal. The power of the appellate courts is very wide. it can reappraise the evidence and reverse the trial court's findings of fact, but the practice of the appellate court, however, has uniformly been to give the greatest assurance to the assessment of the evidence made by the judge who hears the witnesses and watches their demeanour and judges of their credibility in the first instance. The appellate court may interfere with a finding of fact if the trial court is shown to have overlooked any material feature in the evidence of a witness or if the balance of probabilities as to the credibility of the witness is inclined against the opinion 823 of the trial court. This limitation on the power of the appellate court in a first appeal from decrees will also apply to an election appeal under s. 116A. In an appeal burden is on the appellant to prove how the judgment under appeal is wrong. To establish this he must do something more than merely ask for reassessment of the evidence. He must show wherein the assessment had gone wrong. This is especially so when the alleged corrupt practice is of a quasi criminal nature; and this Court would be slow to disagree with the finding of the High Court that such a charge was not established.

 (ii) In the present case, the High Court was right in holding that there is, no acceptable evidence, (a) of any consent given by JD to any one for them making of the various statements or the publishing of documents containing statements against the personal character of RS and (b) of the distribution of the weekly, either by JD or his followers or agents. [834 B-C; 849 F; 850 F. H] (iii) As regards the statements attributed to JD himself the evidence consists of the oral evidence of some witnesses who claimed to have heard the statements being made at various meetings, and the oral evidence of two police witnesses who took down his speeches in shorthand and one speech in long hand. While assessing the probative value of the oral evidence of the police witnesses it is necessary to remember that the report of a shorthand writer is strictly speaking not substantive evidence as such, and it can only be used as a part of the oral evidence. Three conditions are, however, necessary for admitting such statements in evidence,, under s. 159 to 161 of the Evidence Act; (a) the notes must have been taken down by the witnesses as and when the speeches were being delivered or so soon afterwards that the speeches were fresh in their memory, (b) the witnesses must be sure that the speeches have been correctly recorded by them, and (c) the notes must be produced and shown to the adverse party if he requires them. In the present case the first condition may be taken to be satisfied. The third condition was also satisfied. It could not be said that merely because the notes of speeches were in shorthand they would not be admissible in evidence and that they should have been recorded in a language which could be understood by the adverse party. According to section 98 of the Evidence Act evidence may be given to show the meaning of illegible or not commonly intelligible characters or of abbreviations etc. Notes in shorthand may be said to in 'not commonly intelligible characters' and 'abbreviations. [841 A-842 D] However, the record of the speeches, made by one of these witnesses, is not admissible in the present case, because the second condition is not satisfied. The evidence shows that there are various infirmities and that the extracts were not a correct recording of the speeches made by JD.

 (iv) As regards the other police witness according to his notes JD is alleged to have made the following statements.
 (a) That RS was "Bhrasthachar," (b) This is a war between truth and power. We have to see whether truth wins or power wins. We have to see whether truth wins or power loses, whether falsehood wins or truth wins. We have to see whether corruption wins or purity, wins' and (c) 'You know his (RS) achievements and capacity. I do net wish to speak anything about him.' The word "Bhrashtachar" means a man of fallen conduct. The High Court, however, translated it to mean 'Corruption', but in the context it is susceptible of the interpretation of a person who has fallen from orthodox conduct. It is- 824 one of those flourishes or hyperboles which are the common stock-in-trade of election speakers of exploit the emotions of the audience and to augment their popular support.As regards the other statements they do not refer to statements of fact in relation to the personal character or conduct of RS. There fore, the speeches attributed to JD do not make out any corrupt practice. The evidence of the other witnesses was rightly rejected by the High Court.
 [846 F; 847 D-E] (v) The application for production of the summaries of the notes of the speeches said to have been sent by the police witnesses to the government for corroborating the two witnesses should not be allowed, because apart from the fact that an elaborate inquiry will have to be made by examining a number of police witnesses and admitting a large number of documents for finding out whether summaries or full reports were sent to the government, in view of the findings that the record by one of the writings is subject to infirmities and that the statements in the record of the other witness did not amount to corrupt practice, the production of such records will not advance the case of the appellants. [847 F- 848 C] (vi) The contention of the appellants that those records would establish other instances of corrupt practice against JD cannot be entertained, because, such other instances were not pleaded in the election petition and JD had no oppor- tunity to deny them or disprove them. [848 C-D] (3) While dismissing the petition the High Court ordered that JD would be entitled to his costs including costs at the scheduled rate of Rs. 400/- per day for 52 hearings, from the petitioners. The sum of Rs. 400/- per day is pres- cribed by the Bombay High Court Rules for fees of counsel.
 Under s. 119 of the Representation of the People Act which deals with costs, "Costs shall be in the discretion of the High Court provided that whether a petition is dismissed under clause (a) of section 98 the returned candidate shall be entitled to the costs incurred by him in contesting the petition and accordingly the High Court shall make an order for costs in favour of the returned candidate". The peti- tion in the present case was dismissed by the High Court under s. 98(a). But the word 'incurred' means actually spent. There is no proof of payment of any fee to counsel by JD. Therefore, he was not entitled to the amount of Rs.
 400/per diem awarded by the High Court. [851 F-G]
