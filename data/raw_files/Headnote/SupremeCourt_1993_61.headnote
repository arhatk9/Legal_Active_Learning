 The respondents riled writ petitions before the High Court challenging the application of the Wealth Tax Act, 1957 to the State of Jammu and Kashmir on the ground that- the Act was relatable only and exclusively to Entry 97 of list 1 of Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India and 569 570 since the said entry had no application to the State of Jammu & Kashmir, the application of the Act to the said State was incompetent The High Court allowed the writ petitions the revenue flied the appeals by special leave.
 The assessee-respondents contended that the question as to the Entry to which the Wealth Tax Act Is relatable was concluded by the decision of a seven Judge Bench of this Court* which laid down that the Act is covered by Entry 97.
 On merits it was contended that the expression 'capital value of the assets' in Entry 86 did not signify the same thing as net wealth as defined in the Wealth Tax Act, and that for calculating the 'capital value of assets' only the incumbrainces charged on the assets could be deducted from the market value of the assets and not the general liabilities of the Individual owning the assets, which were to be taken into account for the purpose of the Wealth Tax and that, as such, the Act was relatable to Entry 97 and not to Entry 86 of list 1.
 The revenue contended that the Act, so far as It applied to nonagricultural assets, was relatable to Entry 86 and not to Entry 97 of list 1 and, since the Act as applied to Jammu and Kashmir did not take in agricultural lands/assets, section 1(2) of the Act extending the application of the Ad to the State of Jammu & Kashmir could not be said to be ultra vires the powers of Parliament; that this Court in Dhillon's case* did not finally determine which Entry covered the Wealth Tax Act as originally enacted as the issue did not arise for decision in that case, and the controversy was confined to the validity of section 24 of the Finance Act, 1969, amending the provisions of the Wealth Tax Act, 1957.
 Allowing the appeals, this Court, 
HELD- 1.1 The Wealth Tax Act, 1957, was covered by Entry 86 of list 1 of the Constitution, and Its extension to the State of Jammu and Kashmir was perfectly constitutional.
 The High Court was not right in holding otherwise. [593D] Banarasi Dos v. Wealth Tax Officer, 56 I.T.R. 224; Sudhir Chandra Nawan v. Wealth Tax Officer, 69 I.T.L. 897 and Assistant Commissioner of Urban Land Tar, Madras v.

 13 In view of ss. 2(e), 2(m) and 3 to 7 of the Wealth Tax Act, Wealth- tax is an annual levy on the total value of all assets owned by an assessee excluding exempted properties.
 Such value is the price which the property would fetch if sold In the market; in other words its capital value. From the capital value, certain liabilities and debts are to be deducted to arrive at the net wealth. The basis of the tax is capital value 572 and net wealth assessable is capital value after deductions of debts and liabilities. [p.589AB] 1.4The expression 'capital value' of as-gets is not capable of any prescribed definition but the taxes on capital are the net worth tax, the real property tax, and the capital levy under the, Equalisation of Burdens law.

 1.5In construing the language of constitutional enactments conferring legislative power' he most liberal construction should be put upon the words so that the same have effect in their widest amplitude. The heads of legislation should not be construed in a narrow and pedantic sense but should be given a large and liberal interpretation. [p.588C-F] Navinchandra Mafatlal v. The Commissioner of Income Tax, Bombay city, [1955] 1 SCR 829, 836, 837; Sri Ram Rant Naarain Medhi v. The State of Bombay, [1959] Suppl. 1 SCR 489 and British Coal Corporation v.

 1.6None of the items in the Legislative lists of the Constitution is to be read in a narrow or restricted sense.
 Each general word should be held to extend to all ancillary or subsidiary matters which can fairly and reasonably be said to be comprehended in it. [p.577CD] 1.7The tax contemplated by Entry 86 is a tax upon the net wealth of an individual. It is a net wealth tax. Net wealth of an individual necessarily means "what all he owns minus what all he owes" and this is what the Act purports to tax. The language of Entry 86 clearly indicates that the tax is upon the individuals and not directly upon the assets or upon their value. It cannot be said that since the tax is contemplated to be levied upon the capital value of the assets of an individual, the exclusion of his debts and other liabilities changes the nature and character of the tax. [p.591D-G] 2.1The question whether the Wealth Tax Act, 1957 (without reference to 'the Finance Act, 1969) falls within Entry 86 did not arise for consideration in Dhillon's case* and the majority judgment cannot be understood to have recorded a concluded opinion on the issue, which was left open for future when such occasion arose.

2.3 The basic rules of interpreting Court judgments are the same as those of construing other documents.The only difference is that the Judges are presumed to know the tenancy of parties concerned to interpret the language in the judgments differently to suit their purposes and, consequently, It is Important that the words am chosen very carefully so as not to give room for controversy.The principle Is that if the in a judgment is plain and unambiguous and can be reasonably interpreted In only one way it has to be understood in that sense, and any Involved principle of artificial construction has to be avoided.
 Further, If there be any doubt about the decision, the entire Judgment has to be considered, and a stray or a casual remark cannot be treated as a decision. [p.584DE]
