 A company was ordered by the High Court of Calcutta to be wound up. The Official Liquidator submitted an application accompanied by a signed statement for an order that the appellant, an ex- director of the company, be examined concerning the affairs of the company under s. 477 Companies Act, 1956, and that he be ordered to produce certain records. The application was granted ex- parte. The appellant applied for an order vacating or modifying of the order and for supplying copies of or facility for inspection of all documents including the signed statement of the Liquidator.
 The Company Judge rejected the application holding that the ex-parte order was final and he had no power to review it and that the appellant was not entitled to a copy of or to inspect the signed statement of the liquidator. On appeal Court held that the application to modify or vacate the order was maintainable, but in the circumstances of the case the Court held that the order was "desirable and necessary" and that the appellant was not entitled to an inspection of the signed statement of the liquidator.
 ^ Held, that the ex-parte order was not final and it was open to the Company Judge to modify or vacate it on the ground that it had been obtained without placing all the requisite materials before the court or by mis-statement of 944 facts or on other adequate grounds. The primary test for making the order was whether it was just and beneficial to the business of the company ;
 the power conferred on the court was very wide and the court had to guard itself against being made an instrument of vexation or oppression. In the present case none of the circumstances justifying interference with the ex-parte order were made out. The order was not sought for any collateral purpose, a purpose other than the effective progress of the winding up in the interest of the company. The appellant was prima facie a person who was likely to give information useful about the affairs of the company in winding up.
 In re North Australian Territory Company, (1890) 45 Ch. D. In re. Metropolitan Bank, (1880) 15 Ch. D. 139, In re. Mavile House, Limited., (1939) 1 Ch. D. 32 and In re. Gold Company Ltd., (1879) 12 Ch. D. 77, referred to.
 Held, further, that the appellant had no right to inspect the signed statement made by the liquidator on which the order of the court proceeded. The statement of the Liquidator did not form part of the file of the proceedings of liquidation. It merely enabled the court to be satisfied that the appellant should be examined in the interest of the company. The rules permitted the making of such an order ex parte. The examination was confidential.
