 On March 4, 1953, the President of India assumed Powers of the Government of PEPSU (which included Patiala) under Article 356 of in Constitution. On February 27, 1954, in exercise of the powers vested in him by the Proclamation, the President issued the Bank of Patiala Regulation and Management Order 1954, to provide for the better regulation and management of the Bank. By virtue of the powers conferred upon it by Clause 4(1)(iii) of the Regulation Order, the Board of Directors of the Bank framed certain Staff Rules. Rule 27 of which provided for compulsory retirement of employees of the Bank.
 The appellant, who was an employee of the Patiala State Bank was compulsorily retired by an order of the Board under Rule 27 passed in June 1958. He challenged the order in a suit mainly on the ground that Rule 27 was illegal and void. The Trial Court granted a decree substantially allowing the appellant's claim but on appeal, this decree was set aside by the High Court.
 In the appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant, inter alia, (i) that though the Regulation Order [Clause 4(1) (iii) of Which delegated power to the Board of Directors of the Bank to frame staff rules] was made on February, 27, 1954, it was not published in the Gazette until March 14 1954, by which time, in view of the revocation of the proclamation on March 7, 1954, the powers of the President to make rules governing the ervice conditions of Government servants in the State had lapsed and he delegation by the President to the Board of the Power to frame rules had ipso facto come to an end. The Board therefore, had no authority to frame the Staff Rules on Marah 25, 1954 and to enforce them from April, 1, 1954; that in any event the Regulation Order was in effect and substance a legislative Act and, in view of the provisions of Article 357(2), its operation could not extend beyond the period of one year specified in that Article; (ii) that prior to the promulgation of the Regulation Order in 1954 the Patiala State Regulations and other rules or orders, except the pension rules. made by the Ruler of Patiala, were applicable to the,staff of the Patiala State Bank; the Staff Rules sought to supersede the provisions of the patiala State Regulations and rules made by the Board of Directors could not abrogate the Regulations promulgated by the Ruler who exercised the 487 powers of the Legislature; (iii) that Rule 27 was unconstitutional as it offended the guarantee under Article 311 of the Constitution and the Staff Rules were also violative of Article 14; (v) that the Board which promulgated the Staff Rules had not been properly constituted inasmuch as some of the Directors were not present at the meeting.
 
HELD : (i) Although the Regulation Order was made on February 27, 1954 and was not published in the Gazette until March 14, 1954, the order itself provided for its commencement on the date on which it was made and it therefore came in to operation on February 27, 1954, i.e., before the termination of the Prosident's Rule in PEPSU.
 On a consideration of the provisions of the Regulation Order, it is manifest that those provisions were made for the better regulation and management of the affairs of the Bank and' it would be an absurdity to hold that some of the pro-visions would cease to be in operation after the period of one year ipecified in Art. 357(2); all the clauses of the Regulation Order, including Clause 4(1) (iii), come within the purview of the saving clause in Aiticle 357(2) which preserves the validity of "things done or omitted to be done" before the expiration of the period of one year after the proclaimation has ceased to operate and the Regulation Order therefore continued to be in operation after the expiration of that year.

 (ii) The Patiala State Regulations were applied to the employees of the State Bank of Patiala as a result of an "extension" made by tho Maharaja pursuant to the executive powers vested in him. The act of extension being as executive act it could be changed by a similar executive act. What was changed or superseded was the extension and not the rules. [497 E] (iii) There was no force in the contention that Rule 27 offended Article 311 or that the Staff Rules were violative of Article 14. [498 F] Motiram Deka v. N. E.

 referred to.
 (iv) The High Court had rightly held that under the law governing corporations, a majority of the members i the Corporation is entitled to exercise the powers of the Corporation and that the rule regarding corporations is equally applicable to a company. "he Board was, therefore, properly constituted at the time when the Staff Rules were promulgated. [499 A]
