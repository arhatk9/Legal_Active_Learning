 204 The respondent filed a petition in this Court with a prayer that Special Leave granted to the appellant be revoked on the ground that the appellant had made inaccurate, untrue and misleading statements in the petition for Special Leave.
 This Court also found that the appellant had made certain wholly untrue statements in the petition for Special Leave.
 Held, that Special Leave granted to the appellant ought to be revoked and the appeal dismissed. It was observed that it was of utmost importance that in making material statements and setting forth grounds in applications for special leave, care must be taken not to make any statements which are inaccurate, untrue and misleading. In dealing with applications for special leave, this Court takes statements of fact and grounds of fact contained in the petitions at their face value and it would be unfair to betray the confidence of this Court by making statements which are untrue and misleading.
