 The petitioner appeared in person and sought permission to be represented by another person who is not an Advocate, falling within the meaning of S.2(a) of the Advocate, Act 1961 in the place of an Advocate Amicus Curiae appointed by this Court.
 Allowing the petition, the Court 
HELD 
1. A private person who is not an Advocate, has no right to barge into Court and claim to argue for a party. He must get the prior permission of the Court for which the motion must come from the party himself. It is open to the Court to grant or withhold permission in its discretion. In fact, the Court may even after grant of permission withdraw it half-way through if the representative proves himself reprehensible. The antecedents, the relationship, and reasons for requisitioning the services of the private person and a variety of other circumstances must be gathered before grant or refusal of permission. [49599 G-H, 496 A] 
2. The Advocates are entitled as of right to practice in this Court under S. 30(1) of the Advocates Act, 1961 subject to the reasonable restriction provided under s. 29 of that Act viz. that the only class of persons entitled to practice the profession of law shall be advocates. Even so, it is open to a party, who is unable for some reason or the other to present his case adequately, to seek the help of another person in his behalf. To negative such a plea may be denying justice altogether in certain cases, especially in a land of illiteracy and indigence and judicial processes of sophisticated nature. Ss.302, 303 and 304 of the Cr. P.C.
 are indicative of the policy of the Legislature to provide for such contingencies. This Court should not totally shut out representation by person other than the party himself in situations where an advocate is not appearing for the party.
 [494 D-G] 
3. A comprehensive programme of free legal services, is in a sense,a serious obligation of the State if the rule of law were to receive vitality in its observance. Until then, parties should appear through advocates, and where they are not represented by one such, through some chosen friend.
 Such other person cannot practice the profession of habitually representing parties in Court. If a non-advocate specialises in practicing in Court, professionally he will be violating the text of the interdict in the Advocates Act, which the Court cannot allow him to do so. Nevertheless it is open to a person who is a party to a proceeding to get himself represented by a non-advocate in a particular in- stance or case. Practicing a profession means something very different from representing some friend or relation on one occasion or in one case or on a few occasions ,or in a few cases.
