 The respondent represented a joint Hindu family consisting of himself, his brother, and two sons of his father's brother. The joint family owned agricultural land, cows and buffaloes. Under s. 10 of the Orissa Agricultural Income Tax Act, 1947, the income of joint Hindu family was normally assessable as the income of one individual; but certain concessions were given in cl. B. of the Schedule of the Act to a joint family consisting of brothers only. The Explanation to the Schedule stated that for -the purpose of the Schedule 'brother' included the son and the son of a son of a brother, and the widow of a brother. For the assessment years 1950-51, 1951-52 and 1952-53 the assessing authorities under the Act did not allow to the family the benefit given by cl. B of the Schedule and refused to treat the income from milk derived from cows and buffaloes maintained by the assessee family as agricultural income.
 The order of assessment was confirmed by the Assistant Collector but the Agricultural Income-tax Tribunal gave the benefit of the rates in the Schedule to the family and treated the income from milk as agricultural income. In a reference the High Court confirmed the views of the Tri- bunal. The State of Orissa appealed to this Court against the High Court's order by special leave.
 It was urged on behalf of the State that (1) a family consisting of the sons of two brothers both of whom were dead was not a family consisting of "brothers only" under cl. B to the Schedule, (2) the income the, milk in question was not agricultural income.
 
HELD : If by the Explanation clause the expression "brother" has been given an artificial meaning as inclusive, of the son and the son of a son of a brother, it would be difficult to regard the family as not consisting of brothers only.
 For the purpose of interpreting cl. B Explanation (i) must be incorporated in the expression "consisting of brothers only" and by so doing the conclusion is inevitable that an undivided family consisting of sons of deceased brothers, for the purpose of taxation under the Orissa Agricultural Income-tax Act, would be regarded as one consisting of "brothers only". [405 E-F] The question whether income from milk derived from much cows maintained by the respondent's family was agricultural income was held to be. concluded by the court's decision in Commissioner of Income-tax, West Bengal, Calcutta v. Raja Benoy Kumar Sahas Roy, [1957] INSC 55; [1958] S.C.R. 101. [404 C]
