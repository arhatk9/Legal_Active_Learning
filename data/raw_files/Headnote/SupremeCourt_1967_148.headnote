 Expenditure on introducing the Casabalanca conversion system in the spinning plant of the assessee was not allowed as "development rebate" by the Income-tax Officer and the Appellate Commissioner. The Appellate Tribunal after inspecting the factory and considering the literature and Government notifications, held that the expenditure, though not admissible as development rebate, was -admissible as an allowance for current repairs to the existing machinery under s. 10(i) XV of the Income-tax Act. The High Court, on reference, accepted the Tribunal's finding and held that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to permit the assessee to raise a new contention which was not raised before the departmental authorities. In appeal by the Commissioner, this Court, HELD : The appeal must be dismissed.
 Under sub-s. (4) of s. 33 of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, the Appellate Tribunal is competent to pass such orders on the appeal "as it thinks fit". There is nothing in the Income-tax Act which restricts the Tribunal to the determination of questions raised before the departmental authorities. All questions whether of law or of fact which relate to the assessment of the assessee may be raised before the Tribunal. If for reasons rccorded by the departmental authorities in rejecting a contention raised by the asscsseee grant of relief to him on another ground is justified, it would be open to the departmental authorities and the Tribunal, and indeed they would be under a duty to grant that relief. The right of the assessee to relief is not restricted to the plea raised by him. [1959 D-F]
