One of the candidates for -election showed only one symbol which was reserved for a political party, and left blank the rest of the space. The Returning Officer rejected the nomination paper holding that the defects was of a substantial character. Alleging that the rejection was improper two voters filed an election petition challenging the lection of the appellant who was successful at the ensuing election the tribunal dismissed the petition but, on appeal, the High set aside the election or the ground that the rejection was improper.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : Under s. 36(4) of the Act, the returning officer shall not reject the nomination paper when the defect is not of a substantial character. The mention of the reserved symbol,in the first space and leaving blank the rest of the space is covered bythe phrase, "failure to complete, or defect in completing, the declarationas to symbols," in the provisio to r. 4 of the Conduct of Election Rules,and was therefore not defect of a substantial character.
