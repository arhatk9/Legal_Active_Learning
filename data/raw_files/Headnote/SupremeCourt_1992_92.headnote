 Clause 26 of the University Grants Commission Scheme of 1986 framed by the Government, pursuant to the recommendations of the Malhotra Committee, provided that the age of superannuation for teachers should be 60 years. The Scheme also contemplated certain improvement in the revision of pay scales and provision of assistance in that behalf.
 While the Government of Kerala decided to adopt a major part of the Scheme, including the revision of scales of pay it did not accept the recommendation as to the age of superannuation. This was challenged by the affected teachers before the High Court, contending that once the State Government had accepted the Scheme, which also provided for higher age of 60 years for superannuation, all the clauses of the Scheme became applicable and they were entitled to superannuate at the age of 60 years. However, this plea was rejected by the High Court. Hence, the appeal, by special leave, before this Court. Some Writ Petitions were also filed before this Court, by the affected teachers.
 Disposing of the cases this Court, 
 HELD : 1.1 The High Court was right in holding that the UGC Scheme did not become applicable because of any statutory mandate 312 making it obligatory for the Government and the Universities to follow the same, and, therefore, the State Government had the discretion either to accept or not accept the Scheme, And in its discretion, it had decided to accept the Scheme, subject to the one condition, that, in so far as the age of superannuation was concerned, they would not accept the fixation of higher age provided in the Scheme; and that as long as the age of superannuation remained fixed at 55 years, and as long as the State Government had not accepted the UGC's recommendation to fix at 60 years, teachers could not claim as a matter of right that they were entitled to retire on attaining the age of 60 years. [313B, F-G, 314D] 1.2. It is clear from paragraph 4 of the circular dated 17th June, 1987 of the Government of India addressed to all States/UTs (Union Territories) that the adoption of the Scheme was voluntary, and the only result which might follow from the State Government not adopting the scheme might be that it may not get the benefit of the offer of reimbursement from the Government to the extent of 80 per cent of the additional expenditure involved in giving effect to the revision of pay scales as recommended by the Scheme.
