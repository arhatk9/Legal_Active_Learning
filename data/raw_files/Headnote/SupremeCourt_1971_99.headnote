 The appellant was charged with the offenses under s. 5(2) read with s. 5(1) (d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 and s. 161, I.P.C. The investigation was conducted by the Dy. Superintendent of Police but some of the statements, reports and memoranda were written, not by the Dy. Superintendent of Police, but by the Sub-Inspector.
 The appellant did not raise any objection before or during the trial that an illegality or irregularity was committed during investigation. At the stage of argument, it was conte nded that there was a violation of s. 5(A). The appellant was convicted and the conviction was confirmed by the High Court. In appeal to this Court, on the questions:
 (1) whether there was violation of s. 5(A) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, and (2) whether such violation rendered the trial and conviction of the appellant illegal, 
HELD:(1) The Dy. Superintendent of Police gave evidence that the entire investigation was done by him and that the statements and reports which were in the hand- writing of the Sub-Inspector were written by the latter on his dictation and under his supervision. The evidence in the case also established that the Dy. Superintendent of Police was in complete charge of the investigation giving necessary directions and, never withdrew from the case at any stage. Though s. 5A is mandatory that the investigation should be conducted by the officer of the appropriate rank it is not necessary that every one of the steps in the investigation should be done by him in person or that he could not take the assistance of his deputies or that he was bound to go through each one of the steps himself.
 Therefore, there was no irregularity or illegality in the conduct of the investigation. [280 F-G; 282A-B, F-H; 283B] (2)Where no objection was raised before trial commenced regarding any illegality or irregularity committed during investigation and where the cognizance of case in fact had been taken and the case had proceeded to termination the invalidity of the preceding investigation would not vitiate the result unless miscarriage of justice has been caused thereby and the accused has been prejudiced.
