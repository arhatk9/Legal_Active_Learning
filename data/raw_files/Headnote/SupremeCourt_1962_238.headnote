 In a suit instituted by the appellant for the specific performance of an agreement of sale executed by the respon- dent, the latter disputed the genuineness and validity of the agreement and its consideration. The trial court decreed the suit but on appeal the High Court reversed the findings of the trial court and dismissed the suit. In the appeal filed by the appellant, the Supreme Court went into the evidence in the case elaborately and came to the conclusion that the decision of the trial court that the suit agreement was genuine and valid and was supported by consideration, was right and that the High Court erred in reversing that decision. In the judgement delivered by it, the High Court had passed severe strictures against the trial court suggesting that the decision of the trial court was based on extraneous considerations.

 723 Similarly, the High Court made some observations criticizing some of the witnesses examined in the case suggesting that they had consipired to give false evidence. The Supreme Court after carefully considering the matter fully was satisfied that the amputations made by the High Court against the impartiality and the objectivity of the approach adopted by the trial Judge were wholly unjustified.
 Held, that the High Court erred in using extravagant language in criticizing the trial court; that the use of strong language and imputation of corrupt motives should not be made light-heartedly because the judge against whom the imputations are made has no remedy in law to vindicate his position.
 Held, further, that the High Court was, similarly, in error in its criticism of some the witnesses examined in the case as showing a tendency to regard every witness whose evidence the High Court did not feel inclined to accept, as a perjuror and a conspirator.
