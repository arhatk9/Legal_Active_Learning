 The respondents filed Writ Petitions in the High Court of Gujarat challenging the validity of section 437A of the Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporation (Gujarat Amendment) Act, 1963. Section 437A(1) of the Act speaks of the order of eviction. In short, it states that if the Commissioner is satisfied that the person authorised to occupy any premises belonging to the Corporation as a tenant or otherwise has not paid any rent lawfully due from him in respect of such premises for a period of more than 2 months or has sublet without the permission of the Corporation the whole or any part of the premises or has otherwise acted in contravention of any of the terms express or implied under which he is authorised to occupy such premises or that any person is in unauthorised occupation of any municipal premises the Commissioner may notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force by notice order that such a person shall vacate them within one month of the date of service of the notice. Section 437A(2) speaks of the service of notice before the order is passed.
 Section 437D speaks of appeals to the State Government.
 Section 437 of the Act states that the provisions contained in section 437 are in addition to those contained in sections 60 and 438 of the Act.
 The Deputy Municipal Commissioner upon whom the Municipal Commissioner delegated powers under section 437A served notices upon the respondents to show cause why they should not be evicted. The respondents appeared at the enquiry.Thereafter an order was passed directing the respondents to vacate within one month of the date of the notice. The respondents challenged the said notices in the High Court of Gujarat by filing Petitions under Article 226 of Constitution. The High Court held that there is a, valid basis of differentia between occupiers of municipal premises -and those of other premises and that there is a rational nexus between the basis of the classification and the object of the legislation.
 The High Court held that sections 437A, 437B and 437F of the Act in so far as they relate to an order made under section 437A of' the Act are ultra vires Article 19(1)(f) of the Constitution and section 437A(1) and (2) is ultra vires Article 14 of the Constitution. The High Court, however, held that section 437A in so far as it empowers the Municipal Commissioner to make an order of eviction in cases of persons who are in unauthorised occupation of any municipal premises is violative of Article 14 on the ground that it is left to the arbitrary and unguided discretion of the Municipal Commissioner to adopt the drastic and summary remedy provided under section 437A(1) or to adopt the ordinary remedy of suit. The High Court upheld the contention of the respondents that the machinery provided for eviction in section 437A(1) is unreasonable on the ground that the Municipal Commissioner who is constituted the authority to determine whether the condition of liability as set out in clauses (a) and (b) of section 437A(1) exists, is the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation which is the owner of the premises. The Municipal Commissioner will be both a party and a Judge.
 The High Court further held that many questions of law would have to be decided and the Municipal Commissioner who is the Executive Officer would he hardly equipped to decide such questions of law.
 Allowing the appeal, 936 
HELD : In view of the decision of this Court in Maganlal Chhagganlal Private Limited the judgment in Northern India Caterers case does not hold the field. On the ruling of this Court in Maganlal Chhaganlal case the conclusion of the High Court that section 437A offends Article 14 on the ground that there is no clear guidance on the Municipal Commissioner to take proceedings is set aside. The conclusion of the High Court that provision of section 437A(1) is unreasonable because the Municipal Commissioner is in substance a party to the dispute is unacceptable. He is the highest officer of the Corporation. There is no personal interest of the Municipal Corporation n evicting the respondents. The Corporation represents public interest. The Municipal Commissioner acts in public duty in aid of public interest. If the Municipal Commissioner wrongly exercises his power the action will be corrected in appeal. The contention that the provision of section 437A imposes unreasonable restrictions on the right of the respondents under Article 19(1) since the Municipal Commissioner has no power to-summon witnesses and the State Government has to hear the appeal and not the ordinary courts was negatived. As long as the persons to be evicted is given the opportunity to produce evidence there is no element of unreasonableness. There are many statutes which provide appeals to the State and not to a court of law, like, Sea Customs Act, Mining Act etc. The State Government will employ persons who are equipped to deal with such matters and appeal to the State Government will not indicate unreasonableness. If there is any abuse of justice or miscarriage of justice or violation of the principles of natural justice the courts are always open to redress such grievances. [940 F; G; 941 B-E]
