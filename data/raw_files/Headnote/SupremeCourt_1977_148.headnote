 In 1962, the respondent Birbal Dass took a shop on rent of Rs. 175/- per month, plus the taxes, from the appellant.
 Five years later, he applied u/s. 4 of the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act, 1949, for the fixation of fair rent of the building. The Rent Controller found the evidence adduced by Birbal Dass insufficient for fixing the basic rent u/s. 4(2) of the Act, and therefore, upheld the contractual rate plus Rs. 10.15 paise per month towards taxes. The District Judge allowed his appeal and fixed Rs.
 4.50 paise per month as the fair rent payable by him. The High Court dismissed the appellant's revision application.
 In this appeal by special leave, the Court examined the language of s. 4(2)(a), for determining, firstly, the prerequisite conditions for its application, and secondly whether the phrase "in similar circumstances" governs both expressions namely, "the same" and "similar accommodation".
 Dismissing the appeal, the Court, 
HELD : (1) The phrase "in similar circumstances" occurring in s. 4(2)(a), qualifies and governs both the expressions, namely, "the same" and "similar accommodation". The prevailing rate payable for the same building before the 1st January, 1939can form the basis of the fixation of the basic rent only when the same buildingwas in existence in similar circumstances during that period. Identical will be the position with reference to the prevailing rate of rent for similar accommodation. [190 B-C] (2)The development of the locality would be a change in the circumstances so will be if there has been an appreciable and substantial development of the premises or the building by alterations or new constructions after the 1st January, 1939. A general increase in the size and prosperity of the town will not be sufficient to take the case out of the ambit of s. 4(2) (a). [190 E-F] Channan Singh v. Seva Ram, 68, Punjab Law Reporter 335, approved.
 The Court observed :
 A general prosperity and increase in the population of almost each and every town in our country has led to substantial increase in the rate of rent due to the increased demands over-stepping the corresponding availability of the buildings. In order to prevent the charging of exorbitant rent in such a situation, the legislature has provided for a restriction in the demand for increased rent. [190 F-H]
