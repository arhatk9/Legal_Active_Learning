 A suit for rent and possession of a house by eviction of the defendants was dismissed by the trial Court. The suit was filed against 6 defendants but the claim against the 6th defendant was not pursued. The 4th defendant was the mother of defendants 1 to 3 and the 5th defendant was her brother.
 Defendants 2 and 3 were minors. The suit was on the basis of a rent note purported to have been executed by the 5th defendant on behalf of the defendants 1 to 4 as tenants; and alternatively, the plaintiff relied on the status of defendants 1 to 4 as tenants derived from the position of the father of defendants 1 to 3 as a tenant under plaintiff's father. The trial Court held that defendants 1 to 4 were in adverse possession of the house. The plaintiff filed an appeal, but against defendants 2 and 3 it was filed out of time. The first appellate Court observed that the trial Court "profed into unnecessary matters". It passed a decree against the 5th defendant "on his own account" to vacate the house, but, as admittedly, he was never in occupation of the house, that decree was infructuous. The appellate Court also held that the plaintiff's suit against the defendants 1 to 4 and 6 must fail and that the appeal against defendants 2 and 3 should fail on the ground of limitation as well. The plaintiff then filed another suit against the same defendants in the same trial Court for a declaration of his title to the house and for possession.
 This suit was decreed by the trial Court and the first appellate Court. Second appeals to the High Court, in both matters, were heard together and disposed of by a common judgment and both appeals were dismissed. The High Court observed in its judgment that as regards the question of adverse possession of defendants 1 to 4 in the first suit, "the lower appellate Court held that it did not arise and, therefore, no finding was given on that point". The question whether the second suit was barred by res judicata because of the decision in the first suit was not raised at the hearing before the High Court. The plaintiff did not file a further appeal to this Court in the first suit, but defendants 1 to 4 filed an appeal to this Court in the second suit and raised the plea of res judicata. The plaintiff contended in reply that the 2nd suit was not barred by res judicata because, (1) there was no final decision regarding the adverse possession of defendants 1 to 4 in the first suit; and (2) there was no finding in the earlier suit on plaintiff's title, as the question was not raised in the first suit, and so the scope and subject matter of the two suits was not the same.
 ^ HELD: (Per Majority-K. K. Mathew and P. K.
 Goswami,JJ.):
 The appeal of defendants 2 and 3 must be allowed, because, the second suit was barred by res judicata as against them, but not against defendants I and 4. [834A-B] (1)(a) Ordinarily, when there is an appeal against a judgment, the appellate order alone will be operative. But, in the present case, on the dismissal of the plaintiff's appeal by the first appellate Court in the first suit, as time barred, against defendants 2 and 3, the trial Court's judgment became final between them and the plaintiff. The High Court, in second appeal, did not do anything to the contrary with regard to the appeal against these two defendants. The plaintiff took a specific ground in the High Court that "the lower appellate Court erred in law in dismissing the appeal against defendants 2 and 3 on the ground of limitation". but the High Court did not record any decision on this point, and did not disturb the finality of the decision regarding the adverse possession of defendants 2 and 3. Its observation that no finding was given 828 by the first appellate Court on the question of adverse possession shows that the finding of adverse possession given by the trial Court was displaced by the first appellate Court in the first suit, but only in relation to the adverse possession of defendants 1 and 4 and not of defendants 2 and 3. When there is no appeal in law by the plaintiff against defendants 2 and 3 to the first appellate Court, his appeal to the first appellate Court against the other defendants cannot destroy the finality of the trial Court's decision as far as defendants 2 and 3 are concerned.
 Hence, defendants 2 and 3 can claim in this Court that so far as they are concerned, with regard to their title to the house by adverse possession, there is a finding in their favour by the trial Court which was never disturbed by any Court in appeal, that it is binding on the plaintiff, and that it operates as res judicata in the second suit. [832 B- G 833-H] (b) There is no possibility of inconsistent decrees, one against defendants 2 and 3 and another against defendants 1 and 4, being passed. A decree for partial possession on the basis of the adverse possession of defendants 2 and 3 can be passed, because, the minors' (defendants 2 and 3) interest, even though represented by one of the other parties, is separate and distinguishable from the interest of that party and that of the others. In fact, there was a decree in the first suit against the 5th defendant alone "on his account", and the claim against 6th defendant for eviction from a portion of the house was abandoned even in the second suit. [836 E-F] (c) Defendants 2 and 3 could not have raised the plea of res judicata before the High Court. When second appeals arising out of two suits filed by the plaintiff, are treated as connected appeals and disposed of by the High Court by a common judgment, there is, ordinarily, no question of invoking the plea of res judicata before the High Court as the findings in the earlier suit are not till then final for the purpose of the second suit. The plaintiff not having appealed against the decision of the High Court in the first suit, defendants 2 and 3 could raise the plea of res judicata for the first time only in this Court after the issue of adverse possession of defendants 2 and 3 has been finally decided by the High Court in the first suit. [835C- E] (2) If a matter directly and substantially in issue in an earlier suit had been finally adjudicated upon by a court of competent jurisdiction, the matter becomes rest judicata between the same parties with regard to the identical subject-matter in a subsequent suit. In the present case, in both the suits, the parties, and the property for possession of which the suits were filed, are identical. The fact that in the second suit title to the property was brought in issue which was not an adjudicated issue in the first suit, is, however, not material, since the matter relating to the status of the defendants as tenants was directly and substantially in issue between the parties in both the suits. In the first suit, the relief was claimed on two alternative pleas that the defendants were tenants and the Trial Court rejected both the pleas, and held that the defendants had matured their title by adverse possession. In the second suit, although it was one for declaration of title and for possession, it was on the basis of the alternative plea set up in the earlier suit. The plaintiff sought to rely upon constructive possession through the defendants as tenants under his father and later under him.
 But, this very matter about the tenancy of the father of defendants 1 to 3 under plaintiff's father had been gone into in the earlier suit and it was found in favour of the defendants by the trial Court-which was not disturbed by the first appellate Court or the High Court-that their father was not a tenant under the father of the plaintiff and that therefore, the defendants were also not tenants under the plaintiff. This decision by the trial Court in the first suit against the plaintiff was not a mere collateral or incidental decision, because, it was necessary for holding that the defendants had acquired title by adverse possession.

[844-D-E] (1)(a) The finding of the trial Court that the defendants were in adverse possession of the house, in the first suit, was obliterated by the High Court and there was no final decision on the question in the first suit. In the judgment of the first appellate Court in that suit, when observations were made that the trial Court unnecessarily tried the issue of adverse possession, the observation was made in respect of all the defendants including defendants 2 and 3. That issue though decided by the trial Court, was thought unnecessary by the first appellate Court. The words "as well' in the judgment of the first appellate Court show that the ground of limitation against defendants 2 and 3 was only an additional one. The High Court, in second appeal, rested its judgment only on the basis of the finding that there was no relationship of landlord and tenants between the parties. Although the High Court did not record any finding expressly on the special ground taken-that the dismissal of the appeal against defendants 2 and 3 on the ground of limitation was erroneous-it must be deemed to have done so when it maintained the dismissal of the suit against all the defendants on the ground of non-establishment of the fact of their being tenants in the house. [844C, 843E-G] (b) The first appellate Court, in the first suit, did not intend to pass any inconsistent decrees and did not make any distinction between the case of defendants 2 and 3 who were minors and that of defendants 1 and 4, their brother and mother, on the question or their acquiring title by adverse possession. [843E-F] (c) The contention of res judicata, if it had any substance, was available to defendants 2 and 3 even in the High Court. It could have been argued that there was a finality of the decision on the question of adverse possession in the judgment of the trial Court in the first suit, as far as defendants 2 and 3 were concerned. [844A] (2) The issue regarding plaintiff's title was not decided in the first suit even by the trial Court. The decree of possession in the second suit, on the ground of title, on which there was no final decision in the earlier litigation, and on the ground of the plaintiff's right to possession is, therefore, not vitiated on the ground of res judicata.
