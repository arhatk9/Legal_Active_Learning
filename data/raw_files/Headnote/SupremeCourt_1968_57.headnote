 The respondent's 'father made a deposit of Rs. 5,000 with the appellant's father in 1926 which was repayable with interest. A demand wag made for repayment in 1944 and a suit for recovery decreed in 1946 for Rs. 11,459. The High Court confirmed the decree- in appeal in September 1951 and thereafter the appellants father deposited Rs. 11,098 to obtain a stay of execution of the decree.
 Although the judgment-debtors had made no attempt in the trial court or before the appeal court to take any advantage of the provisions of the Madras Agriculturists Relief Act IV of 1938 on execution proceedings being commenced they filed an application under the Act for scaling down the decree under s. 19(2). The Subordinate Judge who heard the application rejected certain objections raised by the decree holder and modified the decree. The High Court in appeal, reversed the order of the Sub-Judge holding that the money entrusted to the plaintiffs' father being a deposit with a banker was not payable until there was a demand for it: the money became payable only on 2nd October, 1944 i.e. after the coming into force of Act IV of 1938 and consequently the provisions of s. 19(2) of the Act were not applicable and the decree was not liable to be scaled down.
 In the appeal to this Court it was also contended on behalf of the respondent that the, word "debt" implied a pre- existing loan and as such it could not apply to a deposit;
 and furthermore that the decree had already been satisfied and as such s. 16(3) of Madras Act XXIII of 1948 was applicable.
 
HELD : The appeal must be allowed and the order of the subordinate Judge scaling down the decree upheld.
 (i) The definition of "debt" in s. 3(iii) of the Act is of a very wide import and would include any liability of an agriculturist with the exceptions specified Section 4 specifies and takes out of the ambit of the definition various liabilities and impositions on the agriculturist.
 If therefore there is a liability of an agriculturist not in terms excepted by sec. 3(iii) or sec. 4 of the Act, it would be a 'debt' within the meaning of the definition given in s.
 3(iii). There can be no doubt that on a deposit being made, the deposited incurred a liability although the time for repayment would come only when a demand was made and the cause of action for the suit would arise on such a demand..

 368 (ii) The definition in s. 3(iii) clearly negatives the respondent's contention that the word "debt" implied a pre- existing loan and could not apply to a deposit. If loans alone were meant to be covered by the use of the word 'debt'. there was no reason to exclude rent from the purview of the expression. In that case there would have been no need to mention expressly revenue, tax or cess or liability arising out of a breach of trust or in respect of "Maintenance under a decree of court or otherwise" in s. 4.
 [371 E-F] (iii) The fact of a judgment-debtor's depositing a sum in court to purchase peace by way of stay of execution of the decree on terms that the decree-holder can draw it out on furnishing security, does not pass title to the money to the decree-holder. He can if he likes take the money out in terms of the & her; but so long as he does not do so, there is nothing to prevent the judgment debtor from taking if out by furnishing other security, say, of immovable property, if the court allows it and on his losing the appeal putting the decretal amount in court in terms of Order 21 rule 1 C.P.C.
 in satisfaction of the decree. [373 A, B] The real effect of the deposit of money in court as was done in this case was to put the money beyond the reach of the parties pending the disposal of the appeal. The decree- ,holder could only take it out on furnishing security which means that the payment wag not in satisfaction of the decree and such security could be proceeded against by the judgment debtor in case of his success in the appeal. Pending the determination of the same, it was beyond the reach of the judgment debtor. [373 C-D] Chowthmull Maganmull v.

 Held also : There was no force in the content on that the decree-holder cannot claim any amount by way of interest after the deposit of the money in court. Ther is no substance in this point because the deposit in this case was not unconditional and the decree-holder was not free to withdraw it whenever he liked even before the disposal of the appeal. In case he wanted to do so. he had to give security in terms of the order. The deposit was not in terms of Order 21 rule 1 C.P.C. and' as such, there is no question of the stoppage of interest after the deposit. [373 F]
