 Under a deed of trust 160 shares of a company were settled equally upon the appellant and his younger brother.
 According to the deed the trustees were to hold the shares of each beneficiary till he attained the age of twenty-five years. Before that the income from the shares was to be applied for the benefit and advancement of the beneficiaries. If either of them died before attaining the age of twenty-five years his shares were to devolve on persons named in cls. 6 and 7 of the deed but the accumulated income was to devolve on his heirs. Clause 5 of the deed laid down that the beneficiaries could not before attaining the age of twenty-five years mortgage or encumber the shares or sell the same. The appellant's younger brother died in 1954 while he was still a minor and unmarried. The Assistant Controller of Estate Duty held that the, deceased's interest passed to the appellant under s. 5 of the Estate Duty Act, 1952 and levied tax accordingly. The Central Board of Revenue and the High Court upheld the finding. The: appellant contended before this Court that before attaining age of twenty-five years neither beneficiary had any interest in the property being entitled under the deed only to maintenance. Reliance was also placed on s. 23 of the Act.
 
HELD : Though the shares were not to be delivered to the deceased until he attained the age of twenty-five years, the shares belonged to him since the execution of the deed of trust, and he was also beneficially entitled to the income of the shares. His interest in the shares and the income was not an estate in remainder or reversion, nor was his interest a future interest. He was presently entitled to the whole income of his one-half share in the said 160 shares, and -after provision of maintenance, if any surplus remained, he was the beneficial owner of the accumulation of such surplus income But for cl. 5 he could disposed it of as he willed, and if he died it was heritable by his heirs.
 [996 G-H] In the circumstances, the interest of the deceased in the shares and in the accumulated income was 'property' within the meaning of s. 2(15) of the Act. On his death the property passed to the appellant who was liable to estate duty. [995 D-E] Since the interest of the deceased did not fail or determine before it became an interest in possession s. 23 of the Act had no application to the case. [995 H]
