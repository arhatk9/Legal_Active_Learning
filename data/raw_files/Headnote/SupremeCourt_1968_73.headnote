 The appellant-State abolished by an executive order cash grants payable by it. This order was quashed by this Court.
 Thereupon the State passed the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Cash Grants Act, 1963 to abolish the cash grants, but provided for the payment of certain compensation to the grantees-respondents. the respondents challenged the vires of the Act before the High Court. The High Court held the Act to be ultra vires of Art. 19(1) (f) of the Constitution and not saved by sub-Art. (5) thereof. In appeals by certificate, this Court, 
HELD: The Act is either violative of 31(2) or, in the alternative, Art. 19(1) (f) of the Constitution. [490 F] Choses in action and money could not be acquired under Art.
 31(2). If it is held that State by the exercise of its power of eminent domain can acquire choses in action and money belonging to its citizens, by paying a fraction of the money taken as compensation, the fundamental right guaranteed under Art. 19(1)(f) would be deprived of all its contents and that Article will cease to have any meaningful purpose. Article 31(2) must be construed harmoniously with Art. 19(1) (f). If so construed, it is obvious that the public purpose contemplated by the Article does not include enrichment of the coffers of the State. Further the compensation referred to in Art. 31(2) is the just equivalent of the value of the property taken. [495 E-H] A law which authorises the State to deprive a person of his property must be a valid law. it must not violate Art. 19(1) (f) which means that it must satisfy the requirements of Art. 19(5). The word "law" used in-Art. 31(1) indicates its limitations and refers back to Art. 19 and any law made under Art. 31(1) can be sustained only if the restrictions it impose& are reasonable and in the interest of general public. The Act which empowers the State to appropriate some one else'& property for itself solely with a view to augment the resources of the State cannot be considered as a reasonable restriction-in the interest of the general public.., If Art. 19(5) is interpreted to mean that the State can take by authority of law anyone's property for the purpose of increasing its assets or revenues, the guarantee given by Art. 19(1)(f) would become illusory (496 -497 E] Madhorao Phalke v.
