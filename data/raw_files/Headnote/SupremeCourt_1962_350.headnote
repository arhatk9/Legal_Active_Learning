 The appellant contended that though the wage scales were fixed in 1949, as in 1957, the question of revision of wage scales had been brought before another Tribunal which refused revision except in the case of Mazdoors 1 and 2, revision ought not to have been allowed and that the Tribunal had compared the wage scales of the appellant with those-with which they were not comparable and further that the Tribunal 737 had itself made some obvious mistakes which were later cor- rected, and that therefore the wage scales fixed by the Tribunal required review. As to classification it was contended that the Tribunal should have itself classified the workmen and not left this question to the appellant as it would lead to further disputes.
 Held, that on the facts of the case there was need for revision of wage scales and that substantially the comparison made was with engineering concerns, on which the appellant itself bad relied. Though in some cases higher scales had been given to the workmen, the wage scales fixed by the Tribunal were justified.
 Held, further, that though there were some slips in matters of detail in the award of the tribunal which had been rectified by it except for correcting one obvious slip which it had failed to correct the Award of the Tribunal could not be said to be vitiated.
 Held, also, that classification is of two kinds (1) classification of jobs and (2) fitting of existing staff into the various classified jobs. The first classification is a matter for the Tribunal whereas the second kind generally speaking may appropriately be left to the employer to be done in consultation with the Union, and it is only a disputed case which may be referred, it necessary, to the Tribunal.
 Novex Dry Cleaners v. Its Workmen, [1962] 1 L.L.J. 271 and French Motor Car Co. Ltd. v. Workmen, [1963] Supp. 2 S.C.R.
 16, referred to.
 As the Tribunal had directed only the second type of classification to be done by the appellant in consultation with the Union, the direction Was not erroneous.
