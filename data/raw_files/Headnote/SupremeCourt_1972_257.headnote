 The respondent filed a complaint against the appellant alleging that he had committed offences under s. 420 I.P.C., and s. 13 of the Maharashtra Ownership of Flats (Regulation of the Promotion of Construction, Sale, Management and Transfer) Act, 1963, in that he had contravened ss. 3(2)(a) and 4 of the Act. After some evidence was recorded the Magistrate passed an order that since the accused had undertaken to do certain things within a certain period the complainant did not wish to proceed with the trial, that therefore the case was compounded, and that the accused was acquitted. As the appellant went back on the undertaking the respondent moved the Magistrate for taking action for contempt of Court. The Magistrate directed that the papers may be sent to the High Court 'for appropriate action. The High Court in revision, after notice to the appellant held that it, was not a fit case for taking action for contempt but set aside the order of acquittal of the appellant and directed that the Magistrate should proceed with the trial.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) The offence under s. 13 of the Maharashtra Act was not compoundable with or without the permission of the Court. Where an acquittal is based on compounding and the compounding is invalid in law, the acquittal would be liable to be set aside. In the present case, as the acquittal of the appellant by the trial Court was based upon the compounding of an offence which was not compoundable the High Court rightly set aside the acquittal of the appellant.

 (2) Even though the High Court acted suo motu in setting aside the acquittal of the appellant there was no irregularity in the procedure adopted by the High Court.
 All that is necessary to bring the High Court's powers of revision into operation is, such information as makes the High Court think that an order made by a Subordinate Court is fit for the exercise of its powers of revision.

 (3) There is no substance in the contention that High, Court should not have interfered with the acquittal in so far as it related to the offence under s. 420, I.P.C. [696H] (a) The offence under s. 420 I.P.C. can be compounded only with the permission of the Court and no order granting such permission has been produced before this Court.-[697A] 692 (b)Assuming that such permission had been granted it is necessary to know the precise language, because, it is difficult to predicate whether the Magistrate would have granted the permission to compound the offence under s. 420, I.P.C., if he was aware that the offence under s. 13 of the Maharashtra Act was not compoundable. [697A-B] (c)moreover, the permission was one indivisible permission for both the offences, and in such an event, it is not permissible to sever the permission into two parts and to uphold it for the offence under s. 420, I.P.C., and hold it invalid in respect of the other offence, [697C-D]
