 The respondent-insured, claimed from the appellant- insurer a certain sum on the basis that he had suffered loss due to fire. The appellant repudiated the claim under cl. 13 of the policy. The respondent thereupon wrote to the appellant suggesting arbitration on the dispute as per cl.
 18 of the policy. The appellant however wrote back saying that since it had repudiated the claim of the respondent the arbitration clause was inoperative. The respondent then filed an application under s 20 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, for the filing of the arbitration agreement in the Court and for appointment of arbitrators. The trial court dismissed the petition as barred under cl. 19 of the policy.
 on appeal, the High Court set aside the order of the trial court and remanded the matter to ii for appointment of arbitration.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, ^ 
 HELD: (1) The difference which arose between the parties on the appellant's repudiation of the claim made by the respondent was not one to which the arbitration clause applies and hence the arbitration agreement could not be filed and no arbitrator could be appointed under s 20 of the Act. The only remedy open to the respondent was to commence a suit within three months of the date of the repudiation to establish the insurer's liability. [72 B-C].
 (a) Clause 18 provides that if any difference arises as to the amount of any loss or damage such difference shall be referred to arbitration. In the rejection of the claim made by the insured be on the ground that he had suffered no loss as a result of the fire or the amount of loss was not to the extent claimed by him then, and then only a difference-could have arisen as to the amount of any loss or damage within the meaning of the clause. The dispute raised in the present case appertained to the liability of the insurer to pay any amount whatsoever. Such repudiation of the claim could not amount to the raising of a dispute as to the amount of any loss or damage suffered by the insured. [66 G-H].
 (b) As per cl. 13, on rejection of the claim by the insurer, an action or suit has to be commenced within three months from the date of such rejection. Otherwise, all benefits under the policy stand forfeited. That is, as soon as there is a rejection of the claim, and not the raising of a dispute as to the amount of any loss or damage, the only remedy open to the claimant is to file a suit for establishing the insurer's liability. It may be that after the liability of the insurer is so established, reference to arbitration under cl. 18 will have to be resorted to for determination of the quantum of loss or damage. [67 A-C] (2) The last part of cl. 18 provides that an award is a condition precedent to any right of action or suit. But it cannot on that account be contended that even when there is a repudiation of liability the matter has to go to arbitration first. If the arbitration clause is couched in a comprehensive language taking within its ambit any kind of dispute arising under the policy then the obtaining of an award by arbitration is a condition precedent to the starting of any other legal proceeding. But, reading cls. 13 and 18 together, in the present case. it must be held that on the rejection or repudiation of the claim by the insurer me insured is under an obligation to start a legal proceeding within three months of such rejection and hence the obtaining of an award 63 in such cases cannot be a condition precedent. If the dispute is such that can go to arbitration then no action or suit can be commenced without obtaining an award. But the condition of obtaining an award prior to any action or suit can never be attracted if the dispute raised cannot be referred to arbitration and has got to be determined in a legal proceeding.

 (3) Clause 19 of the policy provides that in no case whatever shall the insurer be liable for any loss or damage after the expiry of 12 months from the happening of the loss or damage unless the claim is the subject of pending action or arbitration. the High Court is not right in its view that the claim of the insured was not barred under this clause because of s. 37 (3) of the Arbitration Act. It is, however, not necessary to decide whether the appellant's application under s. 20 was barred by clause 19 or could be defeated on the ground of the extinction of the insurance liability under clause 19. If the dispute was one to which the arbitration clause applied then the application under S. 20 could not be dismissed on the ground that the claim would not ultimately succeed either on facts or in law, because, the matter will have to be left for the decision of the arbitrator.
