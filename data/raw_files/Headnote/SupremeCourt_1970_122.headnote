 The appellant was a non-resident individual. He was a partner of a registered resident firm which carried on money-lending business in India and Malaya. The entire income of the firm for the assessment year 195657 accrued outside India. Since before the Finance Act, 1956, under s.
 23 (5) (a) of the Income-tax Act, 1922, the firm did not itself pay the tax on its income, but each partner's share in the firm's profits was added to his other income and the tax was payable by each partner on the basis of his total income, the assessee's share of the foreign income of the firm was included in his total income. 'The assessee claimed that it could not be so included under s. 4(1) (c).
 
HELD:Under s. 4(1) (c) when a person was not resident in the taxable territory income derived by him outside the taxable territories was not to be included in his taxable income.
 But under s. 4(1) (c) a nonresident partner of a resident firm was not entitled to exclude from his total income such proportionate share of the profits of the said firm which accrued or arose to it outside the taxable territories, and which was in eluded in the total income of the partner under s. 23(5) for the purpose of assessing the firm, since s. 4 is "subject to the provisions of this Act" that is, subject to s. 23(5) (a).
