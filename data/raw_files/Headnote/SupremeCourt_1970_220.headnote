 Departmental enquiry was started against the appellant a police constable on the charges that he remained absent from duty without leave or permission as he stayed beyond the sanctioned leave and that he did go on fast contrary to, the discipline of the police force. In reply to questions by the Enquiring Officer, the appellant admitted all the relevant facts.
 
HELD : The admission of the facts by the appellant amounted to a plea of guilty on the facts on which the appellant was charged. The police constable here was not on his trial for a criminal offence. It was a departmental enquiry, on facts, of which due notice was given to him. He admitted the facts. There was no distinction between admission of facts and admission of guilt. When he admitted the facts, he was guilty. The facts speak for themselves. It was a clear case of indiscipline and nothing less. If a police officer remains absent without leave and also resorts to fast as a demonstration against the action of the superior officer the indiscipline is fully established.
