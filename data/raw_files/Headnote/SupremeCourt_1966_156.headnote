 There was a partition suit between two brothers T and K. The matter was referred to arbitration. Under the award the properties were divided into four blocks A, B, C and D.
 Blocks A and C went to T, and B and D to K. Further according to the award, the parties had agreed that 'any party in case of disposing or transferring any portion of his share, shall offer preference to the other party, that is each party shall have the right of preemption between each other'. Thereafter T sold Block A to one G after obtaining K's refusal to preempt the same. Next year K sold blocks B and D to certain parties who in turn sold them to the plaintiffs. Some, years later G sold block A to defendant No. 1. The plaintiffs thereupon filed a suit against defendant No. 1 for preempting his aforesaid purchase. While the suit was pending in the trial court, defendant No. I sold block A to defendant No. 2 who was -also impleaded to the suit. The trial Judge held that the covenant of preemption was binding upon the defendants who had notice of that clause and the plaintiffs were entitled to the right of preemption. He further held that the covenant of preemption was not hit by the rule 'against perpetuities and was enforceable -against the assignees of the original parties to the contract. The defendants took the matter in appeal to the High Court which dismissed the appeal. The defendants came to this Court by way of special leave to appeal.
 
HELD : (i) It is true that the preemption clause does not expressly state that it is binding upon the assignees or successors-in-interest, but, having regard to the context and the circumstances in which the award was made it was manifest that the preemption clause must be construed as binding upon the assignees, or successors-in-interest of the original contracting parties. [295 G] Section 23, 27(b) and 37 of the Specific Relief Act lay down that subject to certain exceptions a contract in the absence of a contrary intention express or implied will be enforceable by and against the parties and their legal heirs and legal representative including assignees and transferees. In the present case there was nothing in the language of the preemption clause or the other clauses of the award to suggest that the parties bad any contrary intention. On the other hand a reference to the other clauses of the award showed that the parties intended that the obligations and benefit of the contract should go to the assignees and successors-ininterest. [296-H] The pre-emption clause was based on the ground of vicinage and this circumstance also suggested that the intention of the parties was that the pre-emption clause should be binding upon the heirs and successors-in- interest and the assignees of the original parties to the contract. [298 A] (ii) The rule against perpetuities does not apply to personal contracts which do not create interest in property. [298 F] 294 Reading s. 14 along with s. 54 of the Transfer of Property Act it is mainfest that a mere contract for sale of immovable property does not create any interest in the immovable property and it therefore follows that the rule of perpetuity cannot be applied to a covenant of pre-emption even though there is no time limit with-in which the option has to be exercised. [301 H] Accordingly the covenant for pre-emption in the present case did not offend the rule against perpetuities and could not be considered to be void in law. (302 D] Case-law referred to.
