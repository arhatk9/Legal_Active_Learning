 Respondent No. 1 was selected for Superior Forest Service of the Government of Saurashtra in the year 1951. On 9-4-1958, he was appointed as Assistant Conservator of Forests, Class 111. Sometime in August 1959, Respondent No. 1 was appointed as Deputy Conservator of Forests, consequent upon the merger of Saurashtra with Greater Bombay. On 1st May, 1956, he was allotted to the newly created State of Gujarat and appointed as Deputy Conservator of Forests. A new service called the Indian Forests Service was established in 1966 and Indian Forests Service Rules were made in 1966.
 Respondent No. I was one of the candidates to be considered for initial recruitment to the Indian Forests Service from the State cadre. The Selection Board did not recommend the selection of Respondent No. 1 and other respondents were selected. Respondent No. 1, filed a writ petition in the High Court of Gujarat. The High Court held that Regulation 5(2) (b) of the Indian Forests Service (Initial Recruitment) Regulations, 1966 is mandatory and as the Selection Board did not give reasons as enjoined by this provision, the selection made by the Board was illegal. The selection as well as the Notification dated January 7, 1972 were quashed accordingly.
 Dismissing the appeals, by special leave the Court 
HELD : 1. The provisions of Regulation 5(2)(b) of the Indian Forests Service (Initial Recruitment) Regulations 1966. are mandatory in character and whenever the Board sends the records to the Commission it must give its reasons as required by S. 5(2)(b) of the Regulation. [65G-H] 
 2. (a) Regulation 5 manifestly shows that the provision required three essential conditions to be complied with - (i) that the Board shall prepare in order of preference a list of officers of the State Forest Service in accordance with Regulation 4;
 (ii) that the Board must adjudge persons whom it thinks suitable for the appointment to the posts;
 (iii) that the Board shall send the records of eligible officers of the State who are not adjudged as suitable together with reasons recorded by the Board. [655 A-C] (b) The words "shall than be referred to the Commission for advice by the Central Government along with" are of a mandatory character and govern not only clause (a) but all the other clauses viz. (b) and (c). The requirement mentioned in clauses (a), (b) and (c). must be complied with before the recommendation is sent to the Commission. [655C- D] (c) Clause (b) of Regulation 5(2) is in public interest and has been made with a view to avoid arbitrary or capricious exercise of discretion by the Board and also to prevent any hostile discrimination. Clause (b) clearly states that where eligible officers of the State Forest Service are not found suitable, reasons must be given by the Board for their non-inclusion in the select list. [655D] 653 K. G. Vasudevan v. State of Kerala (Unreported case No.
 O.P. 2910/72 dated 1-10-1975) of the Kerala High Court);
 over-ruled.
 (d) The word "adjudge" is a very strong term and indicates that the Board must be satisfied that a person is not suitable and the requirement for giving reasons has been enjoined for the purpose of proving that the Board was not ,only satisfied but has given grounds of its satisfaction so as to exclude possibility of any oblique or extraneous considerations. The Commission would also, be in a position to know the views of the Selection Board and the reasons given by it for excluding a particular candidate so that it may verify the correctness ,of the reasons given by the Board with the record forwarded by the Board. Perusal by the Board of the confidential rolls of officers and forwarding the ,record to the commission is not substantial compliance with the provisions of Regulation 5(2)(b).
 Regulation 5(2)(b) is not an idle formality. [655 C-F] 
3. In the instant case, the deponent in the affidavit, not being a member of the Selection Board, was not at all competent to certify as to what was the reason given by the Board, as required by Regulation 5(2) (b), nor could the affidavit supply an omission made by the selection Board is not complying with the mandate contained in Regulation 5(2)(b).
