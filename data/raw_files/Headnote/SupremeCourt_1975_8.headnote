 The appellants are retail vendors of country liquor holding licences for the sale of liquor in specified vends. Those licences were granted to them on acceptance of their bids-, in the auctions held by the Excise Department, Government of Punjab. The appellants in Civil Appeals Nos. 485 and 2205 of 1969 held licences for the retail sale of foreign liquor for consumption on the premises of their respective establishments.
 Facts in Civil Appeal No. 365 of 1971 are as follows :
 Consequent on the judgment dated March 12, 1968 of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana in Civil Writ No. 1376 of 1967 (Jage Ram and Ors. v. State of Haryana & Ors.), holding that the auctions for granting the right to sell country liquor for the year 1968-69 had become ineffective, the first respondent held on March 23, 1968 an auction for granting the right to sell country liquor at the 'Town Hall Vend' and 'Kailash Cinema Chowk Vend', Ludhiana. The appellants gave bids in the sum of Rs. 34,01,000 and Rs. 12,02,000 respectively for two vends, and those bids were duly accepted by the first respondent. The appellants were then granted licences in Form IS. 14-A of the Punjab Liquor Licence Rules, 1956. 'The appellants deposited Rs. 1,41,708 for the Town Hall Vend and Rs. 50,091 for the Kailash Cinema Chowk Vend being 1/24th of the licence fee required to be deposited by way of security. They were, however, unable to meet their obligations under the conditions of auction and fell in arrears. The State Government demanded the payment, threatened to cancel the licences granted to the appellants and declared its intention to resell the vends at the risk of the appellants. On August 22, 1968, the appellants filed their writ petition in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana.
 They prayed for a direction quashing the auction held on March 23, 1968 and secondly, they asked that the respondents be restrained form enforcing the obligations arising under the terms and conditions of the auction.
 The High Court held that the State Legislature was competent to regulate the business of vending intoxicating liquors, that various provisions of the Act showed that the State Government had the exclusive right to manufacture or sell intoxicants, that the Financial Commissioner held the jurisdiction to determine the method of disposal of country liquor vends, that the rules under which the 255 impugned auctions were held are substantially different from those under which the auctions challenged in Jage Ram's case were held, that s. 34 of the Act is not an instance of delegated legislation and that the fixation of the maximum price of country liquor was a part of the power to regulate the trade in liquor. On the main contention that the levy in the shape of licence fee was unconstitutional, the High Court held that licences granted for regulating trade in intoxicating liquors stand in a class by themselves and that the consideration which governs licence fees charged in return for services rendered cannot apply to licences issued to the successful bidders at auctions of liquor vends. The High Court further held that Entry 66 in the State List is not confined to fees levied for services rendered but extends to all kinds of fees and therefore the imposition of the licence fee was within the ambit of that Entry.
 in these appeals founded on certificates of fitness granted by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana under Arts. 132(1) and 133(1) (a) and (c) of the Constitution, it was contended on behalf of the appellants that (1) the Financial Com- missioner has no power to frame rules so as to authorise the grant of liquor licences by holding auctions; (2) under s.
 34 of the Punjab Excise Act, 1914, the Financial Commissioner has no right to authorise the levy or collection of any amount which, strictly, is not a fee; an auction bid for fixing 'fees' is a contradiction in terms;
 (3) The licence fee bears no relationship with the services rendered to the licensees and is therefore not 'fee' in the true sense. Nor can the licence fee be justified as an 'excise duty' as it is not levied on the manufacture or pro- duction of liquor; (4)The real character of the levy imposed on licensees through the medium of auctions is that it is in the nature of a tax; and the Financial Commissioner who is an independent statutory authority having powers which are distinct and different from those of the Government, has no authority to impose the tax; nor indeed, has the State Government the power to impose such a tax; (5) The Government cannot under a contract impose a levy which it has no power to impose by law; (6) The new terms and conditions of auctions are, basically and in substance, similar to those which were struck down, by the Punjab High Court in Jage Ram's case which decision was affirmed in appeal by the Supreme Court-. and (7) The demand made by the Government for payment of large sums of money by hoteliers and bar-keepers who supply foreign liquor for consumption on their premises is arbitrary, without the authority of law and otherwise illegal. The respondents raised a preliminary objection to the maintainability of the writ petitions filed by the appellants and to- the grant of reliefs claimed by them on the ground that such of the appellants who offered their bids in the auctions did so with a full knowledge of the terms and conditions attaching to the auctions and they cannot by their writ petitions, be permitted to wriggle out of the contractual obligations arising out of the acceptance of their bids.
 Dismissing the appeals, 
HELD : (On the preliminary objection raised by the respondents). The bids given by the appellants constitute offers and upon their acceptance by the Government a binding agreement came into existence between the parties. The con- ditions of auction became the terms of the contract and it is on those terms that licences are granted to the successful bidders in Form L 14-A of the Rules. The licensees exploited the respective licences for a portion of the period of their currency, presumably in expectation of a profit. Commercial considerations may have revealed an error of judgment in the initial assessment of profitability of the adventure but that is a normal incident of all trading transactions. Those who contract with open eyes must accept the burdens of the contract along with its 'benefits. The powers of the Financial Commissioner to grant liquor licences by auction and to collect licence fees through the medium of auctions cannot by writ petitions be questioned by those who, had their venture succeeded, would have relied upon those very powers to found a legal claim.
 Reciprocal rights and obligations arising out of contract do not depend for their enforceability upon whether a contracting party finds if prudent to abide by the terms of the contract. By such a test no contract could ever have a.
 binding force. [265B; 263D-E] Lekhrai Sairamdas Lalvani v. Deputy Custodian-cum-Managing Officer & Ors., [1965] INSC 127; [1966] 1 S.C.R. 120, relied on.

 Just as country liquor contractors offered bids voluntarily on terms and conditions governing the auctions, the appellants in Civil Appeals Nos. 485 and 2205 of 1969 who hold licences in Form Nos. L-3, L-4 and L-5 for the retail vend of foreign liquor, voluntarily applied for and accepted the licences knowing fully well that the Financial Commissioner had the power to frame rules governing the licences. The licences, in a large measure, owe their existence and validity to the rule-making power of the Financial Commissioner. One of the reliefs which the appellants ask for is that Rules 27A, 30 and 31 be declared ultra vires and unconstitutional and consequently the respondents be directed to refund the assessed fees already recovered. By attempting to exploit the licences without the burden of assessed fees originally attaching to them under the rules framed by the Financial Commissioner, the appellants are seeking to work the licences on such terms as they find convenient. The writ jurisdiction of High Courts under Art. 226 of the Constitution is not intended to facilitate avoidance of obligations voluntarily incurred.

 There is no fundamental right to do trade or business in intoxicants. The State, under its regulatory powers, has the right to prohibit absolutely every form of activity in relation to intoxicants-its manufacture, storage, export, import, sale and possession. In all their manifestations, these rights are vested in the State and indeed without such vesting there can be no effective regulation of various forms of activities in relation to intoxicants.

 (ii)The distinction which the Constitution makes for legislative purposes between a 'tax' and a 'fee' and the characteristics of these two as also of 'excise duty' are well known. The amounts charged to the licensees in the instant case are, evidently, neither in the nature of a tax nor of excise duty. But then, the 'licence fee' which the State Government charged to the licensees through the medium of auctions or the 'fixed fee' which it charged to the vendors of foreign liquor holding licensees in Forms. L-3, 1-4 and L-5 need bear no quid pro quo to the services rendered to the licensees. The word 'fee' is not used in the Act or the Rules in the technical sense of the expression. By 'licence fee' or 'fixed fee' is meant the or consideration which the Government charges to the licensees for parting price privileges and granting them to the licensees. As the State can carry on a trade or business, such a charge is the normal incident of a trading or business transaction. [278 H, 279 B-C] Mathews v.

 (iii)The position obtaining under the Rules as amended on March 22, 1969 is in principle different as the still- head duty is now only 0.64 Paise as against 257 Is. 17-60 per liter which was in force under the old rules and excise duty as such s no longer payable on unlifted quota. The principles governing the decisions in Bhajan Lal's case C.A. Nos. 1642 and 1643 of 1968 decided on August 21, 1972) and Jage Ram's case cannot, therefore, apply any longer. [281 B-F] (iv)As the amount payable by the licensees on the basis of the bids offered by them in auction and on the basis of 'Fixed and Assessed Fees' is neither a fee in the technical sense nor a tax but is in the nature of the price of a privilege, there is no question of the Financial Commissioner lacking power to organize auctions so as to authorize the recovery of any amount which is not a fee properly so-called. The Financial Commissioner, under s. 34 of the Act read with rule 59(d), has the power to direct that licences may be granted on payment of such fees, that is, such consideration as he may by rules prescribe. It is open to him to frame a rule, as he has in fact framed Rule 35, directing that any class of licences may be granted on payment of fees fixed by auction. Once it is appreciated that auctions are only a mode or medium for ascertaining the best price obtainable for the grant of privilege to sell liquor, there would be no 'contradiction in terms' in directing, as r. 35 does, that a class of "licences may be granted on the fee fixed by auction. [281 F-H] (v)It is true that the amendments under which the appellants (holding licenses for sale of Foreign liquor) have been called upon to pay fixed fees were made after the licences were renewed. But the licences, though renewed in January 1968, were to be effective from April 1, 1968. The amendments having come into force before April 1, would govern the appellants' licences and they are, therefore, liable to pay the fixed fees under the amended rules.
