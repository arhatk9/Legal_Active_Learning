 In the 1962 general election the Praja Socialist Party had the 'Hut' as its election symbol. In 1964 the Praja Socialist Party and the Socialist Party combined to form the Samyukta Socialist Party, and the Election Commission allotted the 'Hut' symbol to the new party. The union was however short-lived and in early 1965 the Praja Socialist Party again severed itself from the Socialist Party which retained the new name even after the separation. The Election Commission on being moved by the Praja Socialist Party withdrew the 'Hut' as the symbol of the Samyukta Socialist Party and restored it to the Praja Socialist Party. This order of the Election Commission was challenged by the Samyukta Socialist Party in a writ petition before the High Court and the writ being refused an appeal by special leave was filed before this Court. A writ petition by one of the members of the Samyukta Socialist Party under Art. 32 of the Constitution was also filed before this Court. It was contended that unlike the earlier rule the new rule 5(1) of the Conduct of the Election Rules, 1961 only enables the Election Commission to place restrictions on the choice of the candidate or the party but the choice once made by the candidate or party is final, and that the power to amend the list of symbols which was conferred by the last eight words of the former rule was no longer there.
 
HELD : (i) It is incorrect to say that by changing rule 5(1) and dropping the last eight words from that rule the Election Commission has denied to itself the power to amend the list of symbols. The restrictions which the Election Commission has framed for the use of the symbols permit the issuance of fresh notifications if symbols are required to be changed. The restrictions when analysed are these.
 Before a candidate can choose a symbol it must be free.
 Before a reserved symbol can be chosen, the candidate must be accredited to the party whose symbol it is and it must be shown by the Election Commission in its notification as the symbol of the party. Obviously therefore, if the circumstances change the notification must follow suit.
 Parties may come into existence and parties may go out of existence; parties may unite or parties may separate. This will require amendment of the notification. Just as the Election Commission allotted the 'Hut' as a symbol by a change of notification to the Samyukta Socialist Party, it can allot it to another party if circumstances made that course obligatory and just. The Election Commission is required to give effect to conditions of its own making but that does not restrict its own powers so long as what it does is in consonance 644 with facts and the action is dictated by them. It must not of course favour one party so as to harm others. It must only change the symbol when the circumstances justify such a charge. [649 C-F] (ii) If the merger of Praja Socialist Party and the Socialist Party was unsuccessful and before any significant time had passed the Praja Socialist Party had decided to separate, and if all the leaders of the party and almost all its original members decided to quit the amalgamated party, the benefit of its symbol could not be left to the Socialist Party which, in the events that have happened is bearing the name of the unified party. It is no longer the unified party it was when the name was assumed. The 'Hut' was the symbol of the Praja Socialist Party and the amalgamated party chose the 'Hut' rather than -the 'tree' because of the greater success of the Praja Socialist Party at the polls.
 If disagreement led to a quick break up before the new party or its symbol could become properly grounded, the reversion to the original position was not only logical but also eminently just. It was clear therefore that the Election Commission proceeded along the right lines and reached the right conclusion both legally and in the light of the facts ascertained by it from impartial .sources.
