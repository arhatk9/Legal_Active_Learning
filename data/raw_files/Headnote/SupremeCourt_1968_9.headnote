 In 1938, the appellant executed a gift deed of four plots of land-two in village T and two in village L in favour of her husband. At that time the appellant was young and illiterate and her husband was in a position to dominate her will, and she believed that the document related only to the plots in village T which were originally the property of the husband. The properties in village L were inherited by the appellant from her father. They were very valuable and fertile and there was no reason whatever for her to gift them away to her husband. In 1941, the husband married a second wife but the appellant continued to live with him amicably till he died in 1949. Thereafter the conduct of the relatives of the second wife made her suspicious, and on enquiry, she found that the plots in village L were also included in the gift deed. She therefore filed a suit for setting aside the gift deed and for possession of all the four items of property, against the second wife and her children. The High Court, in appeal, dismissed the suit.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) The appellant's husband included the two plots of land in village L in the gift deed by fraud and without the appellant's knowledge. Since the fraudulent misrepresentation was with respect to the contents and not the character of the document the transaction was not void but only voidable. Therefore, the suit for setting aside the gift deed would be governed by Art. 95 of the Limitation Act, 1908. Since the Article prescribes a period of limitation of 3 years from the time when the fraud became known to the party wronged, and the suit in the present case was filed within a few days after the appellant came to know of the fraud, the suit with respect to the items in village L was within time and should be decreed. [800 G; 802 A-C, E] Clough v. L. & N. W. Railway, (1871) L.R. 7 Ex. 26; Foster v. Mackinon (1869) 4 C.P. 704, Sanni Bibi v. Siddik Hossain, A.I.R. 1919 Cal. 728 and Brindaban v. Dhurba Charan, A.I.R.
 1929 Cal. 606, referred to.
 (2) As regards the plots in village T, in view of s. 16(3) of the Indian Contract Act, and s. II 1 of the Evidence Act the gift deed must be presumed to have been obtained by the appellant's husband by undue influence. The suit with respect to these properties would therefore be governed by Art. 91. The period of limitation prescribed by the Article is three years and time begins to run from the date when the plaintiff discovered the facts entitling the plaintiff to have the instrument cancelled or set aside and not from the date when the plaintiff escaped from the undue influence.
 Since the appellant in the present case knew at the very time of the execution of the gift deed that her husband prevailed upon her to convey the plots in village T to him by undue. influence, her suit was barred by limitation so far as he plots in village T are concerned.
