 The appellant-assessee, one of whose business activities was quarrying lime-stone, was working a quarry as agent of the government with an understanding that the quarry would be leased out to the assessee if the ,government succeeded in the litigation in respect of it. When the assessee was in possession, a company instituted a suit against the government for specific performance of an agreement to lease the quarry. The assessee was made a party to the suit and a claim for damages was made against the government as well as the assessee. This Court granted a decree for damages and the assessee was also made liable to pay damages. On the ,question whether the litigation expenses incurred by the assessee constituted expenditure laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the assessee's business or whether it was incurred for the purpose of acquiring a new asset, 
HELD:(i) Where the expenditure laid out for the acquisition or improvement of a fixed capital asset is attributable to capital, it is capital Expenditure but if it is incurred to protect the trade or business of the assessee, it is a revenue expenditure. In deciding whether a particular ex penditure is capital or revenue in nature, what the courts have to see is whether the expenditure in question was incurred to create any new asset or was incurred for maintaining the business of the company. If it is the former it is capital expenditure; if it is the latter, it is revenue expenditure. [965A-966B] (ii)In the present case the expenditure was incurred for the purpose of protecting the assessee's business and, therefore, was revenue expenditure. The assessee was dragged into the litigation and a claim for damages was made against the assessee also. The litigation came to be instituted against the assessee because the assessee was working the quarry and it was working the same at the time of the litigation. Therefore, the only reasonable inference that could be drawn was that the assessee resisted the suit in order to protect its business and not with a view to safeguarding its prospects of getting a new lease.
