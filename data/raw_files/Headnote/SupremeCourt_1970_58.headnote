 A motion for contempt against the appellants was made and it was shown on the daily cause list on Monday, 1st of May 1967 before a Judge of the High Court. On that day the case did not reach and it was shown on the next day. The name of the counsel of the appellants was not correctly mentioned in the cause list of 1st of May, but the next day the entry was correctly made. When the case was called, the appellants were absent as also their counsel. The order was passed exparte imposing fines on the appellants - The clerk of the counsel filed an affidavit stating that he missed the case on the first day as his counsel's name was not correctly recorded, and as-contempt matters are usually shown on Monday, he overlooked it the following day also. It was also stated that his counsel was informed by another counsel that 'his case had been called out and when his counsel went to enquire, he found that the judgment had already been delivered. An application was thereafter made for rehearing the case after vacating the order. The Judge did not accept the explanation. In appeal, this Court, 
HELD :-The High Court contributed to the failure of the party to appear before it on the first day and in these circumstances, the High Court should have seen its way to hear the counsel when he put an application for re-hearing.
 The omission to mention the case correctly in the cause list was a mistake of the Court itself and some indulgence was, therefore, to be shown to the party who had been misled by this erroneous entry. It is no doubt true that on the next day, the entry was correctly made. When the counsel knew that his case was not in the Cause List the previous day he ought to have looked into the Cause List for the next day's work. There was some negligence on the part of the counsel or his clerk but it was not so grave as to disentitle the party to be heard, and in any event, the alleged contemnors could not be punished for a mistake on the part of their counsel or the counsel's clerk.
 Further, this was a case in which the counsel must have an opportunity of explaining his conduct and the conduct of his clients in reference to the order of stay for whose disobedience the charge of contempt was made. [972 B-G]
