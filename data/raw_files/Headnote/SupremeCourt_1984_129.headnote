 In an eviction application, filed by respondent- landlord against the appellant-a partnership firm under Clause 13(3) (vi) and (vii) of the Central Provinces and Berar Letting of Houses and Rent Control Order, 1949 (HRC Order for short) the appellant raised a preliminary objection that the application against the partnership firm was not maintainable without joining its partners as respondents. The High Court ultimately held that such an application for eviction was maintainable. Hence the appeal to this Court.
 Allowing the appeal and remitting the case back to the Rent Controller, ^ 
 HELD: (1) It is only by virtue of the provisions of Order 30 of the Code of Civil Procedure that a firm can sue and be sued in its own name without the partners being impleading co-nominee. But, since the Code of Civil Procedure does not apply to proceedings under the HRC Order, no application for eviction under HRC order can be maintained against a firm in the firm name. [270D-E] (2) The firm is merely a compendious name for the partners consti- 269 tuting it and an eviction application filed under HRC Order against a partnership firm without joining any partner constituting the firm as a respondent to the application would be merely a case of misdescription of the respondents to the application and this misdescription can be corrected at any stage of the proceedings. [270E-F] (3) In the instant case, the Court allowed the respondent to amend the title of the original application by adding the names of the partners of the appellant firm and remitted the case back to the case Rent Controller for early disposal on merits.
