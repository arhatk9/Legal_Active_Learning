 Rule 3(3)(b) of the Indian Administrative, Service (Regulation of Seniority) Rules 1954 laid down in its main part that the year of allotment of an officer who was appointed to the service by promotion 'shall be the year of allotment of the junior-most among the officers who entered the service by direct recruitment who officiated continuously in a senior post from a date earlier than the date of commencement of such officiation by the former. The second proviso to the rule laid down that a promotee shall be deemed to have officiated continuously in a senior post prior to the date of inclusion of his name in the Select List prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Indian Administrative Service (Appointment by Promotion) Regulations, if the period of such officiation prior to that date was approved by the Central Government in consultation with the Union Public Service Commission.. The appellants became members of the Indian Administrative Service in the years 1949 and 1950 by direct recruitment. The respondents were initially recruited to the executive branch of the Bihar State Civil Service and were subsequently in the years 1955 and 1956 promoted to the Indian Administrative Service.
 The Government of India on 3 September 1958 allotted to the respondents the year 1948 and placed them below the junior most amongst the direct recruits of the 1948 allotment in purported compliance with Rule 3(3)(b) aforesaid. The appellants thereupon made a representation to the Union Government as a result of which the Union Government by order dated 20 September 1967 revised the seniority of the promotees and allotted to some of the promotees the year 1950 and to others the year 1952. In making this order the Government of India agreed with the Ministry of Law in its view that rule 2(g) of the Seniority Rules did not permit retrospective declaration of a post as equivalent to a senior post within the meaning of Rule 3(3)(b) as had been done by the State Government in the case of the respondents.
 The respondents challenged the Union Government's order dated 20 September 1967 in the High Court. That Court quashed the said order and directed that the promotees would continue to hold the year of allotment assigned to them in the year 1958. In appeal to this Court by the direct recruits the questions that fell for consideration were (i) whether the period of officiation in a senior post by a promotees prior to the inclusion of his name in the Select List could be taken into consideration without the approval of the Central Government and the Union Public Service Commission as required by Rule 3 (3) (b); (ii) whether the State Government was authorized to retrospectively declare a post as equivalent to a 'senior post'; (iii) 549 whether in the circumstances of the, ease the order of the High Court restoring the year 1948 as the year of allotment for the respondents was right.
 
HELD : (i) The Select List for the promotion of the respondents was finally approved by the Union Public Service Commission on 26 December 1955. Rule 3 (3) (b) of the Regulation of Seniority Rules, 1954 speaks of approval by the Central Government in consultation with the Union Public Service Commission of the period of the officiation prior to the date of the inclusion of the, names of the promotees in the select list. This approval as contemplated in rule 3 (3) (b) is a specific approval and is directed to the particular matter mentioned therein as to whether there is approval of the period of officiation prior to the inclusion of the names in the select list. On the materials in the present appeals it could not be held that the Central Government gave any approval in- consultation with the Union Public Service Commission within the meaning of rule 3 (3 ) (b) so as to enable the promotees to have the, benefit of the period of officiation prior to the date of the inclusion of their names in the select list. [556H-557C] D.R. Nim, I.P.S. v. Union of India, [1967] INSC 5; [1967] 2 S.C.R. 325 and State of Orissa & Anr. v. B. K. Mohapatra, [1970] 1 S.C.R. 266,applied.
 (ii)The contention on behalf of the direct recruits that it is not open to the State to make a retrospective declaration with regard to posts being made equivalent to senior posts was, however, unacceptable. (Reasons discussed.) The State Government has power to make such a retrospective declaration. The order of the Union Government dated 20 September 1967 which directed the years of allotment on the basis that there could not be any retrospective declaration of equivalent post could not be sustained. [557C-559H] (iii)The High Court directed that the promotees must continue to hold 'ranks as assigned to them in the year 1958. This order of the High Court must be set aside for the reason that the year of allotment must now be determined by the approval of the Central Government in consultation with the Union Public Service Commission.
