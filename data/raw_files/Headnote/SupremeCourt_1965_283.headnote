 The respondent was convicted of offences under sections 3(1) and 4(1) of the Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women and Girls Act, 1956. For the offence under s. 3(1) he was sentenced by the trial court to pay a fine of Rs. 1,500 and for that under s. 4(1) to pay a fine of Rs. 500. On appeal by the respondent, the High Court affirmed his conviction.
 The State preferred an application before the High Court for enhancement of the sentences and with regard to the offence under s. 3(1) it was contended on behalf of the State that it was obligatory on the part of the Magistrate to pass the minimum sentence of imprisonment against the respondent.
 The High Court enhanced the fine in respect of this offence to a sum of Rs. 2,000/- but did not pass a sentence of imprisonment. In reaching this conclusion, the High Court took the view that the use of the word "punishable" in s.
 3(1) instead of the word "punished" necessarily postulates a certain discretion on the court to impose a sentence of imprisonment or a sentence of fine or both.
 On appeal to this Court- 
HELD : In the context in which the word "punishable" has been used in s. 3(1) it is impossible to construe it as giving any discretion to the court in the matter of determining the nature of sentences to be passed in 'respect of a contravention of the provision. The punishments for a first offence under s. 3(1) are rigorous imprisonment for a period not less than one year and not more than three years and also a fine which may extend to Rs. 2,000/-. [5 E-G] The expression "punishable" means "liable to punishment", which only means that a person who has contravened a penal provision will have to be punished. It does not mean anything different from "shall be punished". Punishment is obligatory in either cases but what the nature of punishment is to be, must be ascertained by a consideration of the whole of the penal provision. [4 H]
