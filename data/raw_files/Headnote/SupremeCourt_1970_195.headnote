 The Director of Agriculture in the respondent-State having retired the State Government wrote to the Public Service Commission requesting them to select one of the 14 officers shown in the list accompanying-the letter for being promoted as Director. The letter stated that the question of seniority among those officers was still under consideration and that the list was not arranged in accordance with seniority. The pay scale of some of the officers in the list was Rs. 900 to Rs. 1,400 and others Rs. 1,200 to Rs.
 1,700. The selection was to be on the basis of merit and suitability. After examining the records, the Commission recommended the name of the appellant. The third respondent filed a writ petition and the High Court held that the third respondent was senior to the appellant and had greater merit. The pay scale of both the appellant and the third respondent was Rs. 1,200 to Rs. 1,700.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD (1) The post of Director of Agriculture is a selection post and an ex-cadre post. Selection to it is made solely on the basis of merit and the question of seniority was not relevant. It is for the State Government to select the most suitable officer and for discharging that responsibility, it was open to the Government to seek the assistance of the Public Service Commission. The use of the word promoted in the letter was inappropriate but the nature of the post cannot be changed by the Government using that word.
 Therefore, the High Court was not justified in going into the question of seniority, especially when there was no complaint of mala fides either on the part of the Government or the Commission.[393 H; 394 B-C, E-F] (2) Rule 16 of the Rules regulating the Bihar and Orissa Agricultural Services Class I promulgated on April 11, 1935 is not superseded by the 1945 Rules which apply to Bihar Agricultural Service Class 1, Bihar Agricultural Service Class II, General Provincial Service and special posts outside these cadres. The 1935 Rules do not come in the way of the Government making its selection to the post of Director, and R. 12 of 1945-Rules is not applicable. [395 F, G; 396 B]
