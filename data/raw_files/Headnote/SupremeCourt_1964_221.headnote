 T died in 1938. According to his will certain legacies were to be paid out of his estate during a period of fifteen years after his death, the estate being managed by executors and trustees during that period; and the residue thereafter was to go to his five sons. Probate was granted to the five sons on August 24 1938, but by an Order dated May 10, 1948 the High Court appointed the Administrator-General of West Bengal as Administrator de bonis non of the property. In income-tax proceedings relating the assessment years 1950-51 and 1951-52 the Administrator-General-appellant herein- claimed that assessment should be made under s. 41 of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, because the income of the estate was receivable by him on behalf of the five sons of the testator, their shares in the said income being definite and determinate. His claim was rejected by the assessing and appellate authorities. The High Court held that the Administrator-General when appointed by the Court was expressly covered by s. 41 as one of the persons to whom that section applied, but the shares of the sons not being determinate as long as the administration lasted the proviso to s. 41(1) was attracted, and tax was recoverable at the maximum rate. Appeal was filed by the Administrator-General before the Supreme Court, with a certificate under s. 66A(2) of the Act.
 The appellant urged that the High Court had wrongly held that the shares of the five sons were not determinate. On behalf of the Revenue it was contended that s. 41 did not apply at all because the appellant received the income not on behalf of the five sons but as an executor.
 
HELD : The fact that the Administrator-General was mentioned in s.41 did not conclude the matter. There was another condition to be fulfilled before that section could apply, namely, that the income had to be received by him on behalf of a person or persons. In the instant case the Administrator-General did not receive the income on behalf of the five sons What the five sons were entitled to was the residue of the estate, and any savings that might be out of the income of the estate would be received by them finally not as their income but as a part of the residue. The position of an Administrator-General appointed de bonis non was in no way different from that of an executor vis-a-vis the income he received from the estate. [656 A-B; 659 B-C].
