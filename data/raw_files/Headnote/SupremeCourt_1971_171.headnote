 The respondent, by means of a trust-deed, transferred certain properties described in the deed unto himself as a trustee for making provision for the maintenance of himself and his wife, for the maintenance, education and marriage expenses of his unmarried daughters, and for the maintenance and education expenses of his minor sons. For the assessment years 1957 to 1961 the Department assessed the respondent to weaith-tax in respect of the trust properties as a trustee under s. 21 of the Wealth Tax Act 1957. The respondent contended that: (1) Since, as a trustee he was only holding the properties for the benefit of the beneficiaries and not on behalf of the, beneficiaries as laid down in the section he was not assessable to wealth- tax. and (2) as the share of each of the beneficiaries was not indeterminate, he should not be taxed at the maximum rate.
 The High Court in reference held that respondent was not assessable to wealth tax.
 
HELD:In appeal to this Court, S.21(1) of the Act specifically refers to trustees. The Legislature is competent, in the absence of any restrictions placed on it by the Constitution, to give its own meaning to the words used by it in a statute. In the Wealth Tax Act, Parliament, while enacting s. 21(1) & (2) of the Act, pro- ceeded on the basis that for the purpose of that Act a trustee is holding the trust property an behalf of beneficiaries. The mere fact that this conception does not accord with the provisions of the Trust Act does not invalidate the section. If the construction contended for on behalf of the respondent is accepted then a part of the section would become otiose. While a taxing provision must be strictly construed by courts and the benefit of any ambiguity must to go the assessee, if the intention of the Legislature is clear and beyond doubt then the fact that the provision could have been more artistically drafted cannot be a ground for treating any part of a provision as otiose.

 (2)In the present case, on the relevant dates, the settlor as well as his wife were alive and had a right to be maintained out of the trust properties and they had also a right of residence in a part of the trust property, and two of the sons of the settLor had a right to be maintained and educated. Therefore the shares of the beneficiaries were indeterminate, and hence, the trustee had to be assessed under s. 21(4) of the Act as it then stood. [975H; 976A-B]
