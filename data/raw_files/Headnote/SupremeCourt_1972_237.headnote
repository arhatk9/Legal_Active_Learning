 The appellant has several projects and workshops in the country. At Baroda it has a central workshop which controls all the workshops in the western region. The workmen are liable to be transferred for exigencies of service from one workshop to another as also from one region to another. At Baroda, when the workshop was under construction and there was insufficient accommodation at the site of the workshop, the office/administrative staff used to work in a shed at a distance of about 2 k.m. from the workshop. At that time the working hours of the administrative staff were from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. with an interval of half an hour. These working hours lasted from December, 1964 to June, 1965, when on completion of the construction at the site of the work- shop the administrative staff shifted there. With the shifting of the office to the site of the factory the working hours of the administrative staff were fixed from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. with an interval of one hour. The- workmen claimed that working hours of the administrative staff should have continued to be 6 1/2 hours per day and complained that fixation of 8 hours per day with effect from June, 1965 was violative of s. 9A of the Industrial Disputes Act. It was further complained that the fixation of 8 hours per day was not justified from the point of view of convenience and was also at variance with the practice uniformly prevailing in other administrative offices of the workshops of the Oil and Natural Gas Commission.
 The tribunal came to the conclusion that there was nothing to show that it was a condition of service of the employees in the administrative office to work only for 61 hours per day and that there was no uniform practice of working either for 6 1/2 hour-, only or for 8 hours, for office staff, at all places. In the opinion of the Tribunal, therefore, there was no presumption of there being any condition of service either way. on this reasoning Section 9A of the Act was held inapplicable to the case of the workmen at Boroda.
 The tribunal also observed that it was not correct that the factory would suffer if the working hours of the clerical staff in the Baroda workshop were reduced from 8 hours to 6 1/2 hours a day. But the Tribunal accepted the submission of the workmen that Industrial law recognises the distinction between workers in factories and workers in office and hence though under the Factories Act the workmen may be asked to work for 48 hours or 8 hours a day, it does not necessarily follow that the clerical staff should also be made to work 8 hours a day when they had been working for only 6 1/2 hours a day from December 1964 to June 1965.
 'The Tribunal also directed payment of overtime compensation at 10% of pay to the office administrative staff for the extra work taken from thorn.
 483 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD: (i) On the facts and circumstances of the case it cannot be said that 6 1/2 working hours a day was a term of service, for the simple reason that it was only during a period of the first six months, when the factory was being constructed that the administrative office-staff was, as an interim arrangement, temporarily located at a place 2 k.m.
 away, that the staff in this office was not required to work for more than 6 1/2 hours per day. There is no evidence that 6 1/2 hours per day was a condition of service; neither is there any such term of service in their letters of appointment, nor is such a term of service otherwise discernible from other material on record. [487 H] (ii) The Tribunal has wrongly interfered with the appellant's decision in fixing the hours of work which was fully within its competence and was not open to any valid objection. The Tribunal has not only made some contradictory observations about the practice prevailing in the other projects of the Appellant but has also misread the statement on record. The conclusions of the Tribunal are, therefore, tainted with serious infirmity justifying reappraisal of the evidence by this Court for coming to its own independent conclusion on such appraisal.
 (a) The management must have full power and discretion in fixing the working hours of the administrative staff within the limits prescribed by the statute. When the change in the working hours is covered by s. 9A read with the First Schedule of the Act, compliance with the section would undoubtedly be necessary for its sustenance. In the present case s. 9A is not attracted. It was only when the factory was completed and the administrative staff attached to it shifted to its own building at the factory site, that the management, apparently on an overall assessment of its requirements, fixed 8 working hours per day. This was within the competence of the management. [491 H] (b) The view of the tribunal that reduction in the hours of work of the office staff from 8 to 6 1/2 hours would not adversely affect the working is not supported by evidence on the record. [493 F] (c) The Tribunal was also not right in saying that in other projects the working hours of administrative office are 6 1/2 hours. According to the material on record working hours- in these offices vary and there is no uniform practice. But the fact that in some of the other offices the working hours are 6 1/2 hours per day, cannot be the determining factor. The office at Baroda being the controlling office its requirements and exigencies of work are such that fixing of 8 hours of work a day is fully justified. The mere fact that the staff at Baroda is liable to transfer to other projects is of little importance.[493 F] (iii) Once it is found that 8 hours a day has been properly fixed for work in the administrative office there can be no question of payment of any compensation, for working for 8 hours a day in the past.
