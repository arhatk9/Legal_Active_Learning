 The appellant assessee is a private Ltd. Company carrying on the business of manufacture and sale of sugar. During the accounting period relating to the assessment year 1956- 57, sums of Rs. 75,000/- and Rs. 37,000/- were paid by the assessee to the Cane Development Council of the Sugarcane Department of U.P. (under U.P. Sugarcane Regulation and Sugar and Purchase Act, 1953) by way of contribution for road development between various sugar cane producing centers and the sugar factories of the assessee. The roads were originally the property of the Government and remained so after improvements had been made. The improved roads facilitated the transportation of cane to the factories of the assessee and the expenditure was incurred for commercial expediency and for benefit of the day to day business of the assessee. The Revenue Authorities, the Appellate Tribunal and the High Court found that these contributions constituted capital expenditure and could not be allowed as an admissible deduction in computing the total income of the Assessee. Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : In the facts and circumstances of the case the expenditure was incurred by the assessee for reasons of commercial expediency apart from statutory compulsion. The development of the roads was necessarily meant for facilitating the carrying on of the assessee's business with a view to produce profits. In the absence of any finding by the Tribunal that the roads were to be altogether newly made and that the assesses would get an enduring benefit, the expenditure was allowable as an admissible deduction.
