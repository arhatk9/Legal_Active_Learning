 R was arrested on August 20, 1970 under ss. 107/117 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and was remanded to judicial custody by the City Magistrate Lucknow. A petition for a writ of habeas corpus was filed in this Court and on August 22, 1970 this Court ordered him to be transferred to Tihar Central Jail Delhi for personal appearance before the Court.
 R's original remand as ordered by the City Magistrate was till August 28, 1970. On that date at 4 p.m. the Superintendent Central Jail. Delhi sought directions from the court in view of the fact that the remand was due to expire at midnight. The court ordered that in the situation that had arisen R should be remanded back to the custody to which he belonged, that he may be taken to U.P. if so desired to be produced before the court at the next hearing, and that if no fresh remand orders were received by midnight R was to be set at liberty at midnight. The same day a wireless message was received by the Superintendent Delhi Central Jail from the District Magistrate Lucknow, informing him that the City Magistrate Lucknow had extended R's remand up to September 1, 1970. The following day a telegraphic message was received from the City Magistrate Lucknow informing the Superintendent that R was ordered to be remanded to judicial custody till September 10, 1970.
 Simultaneously this Court was informed by the District Magistrate that the remand of R was extended up to September 10, 1970. R filed another petition before this Court challenging the legality of the fresh remand orders mainly on the ground that they were made behind his back.
 
HELD : Per Hidayatullah, C.J., Bhargava, Mitter, Ray and Dua, JJ.-Even if it he desirable for the Magistrates to have the prisoner produced before them when they remit him to further custody, a magistrate can act only as the circumstances permit. Indeed courts trying cases may find it necessary to order a remand in the absence of an accused e.g. when an accused is so seriously ill that the trial has to be adjourned and he cannot be brought to court and in such case an order made without production of accused in court will not be invalid. [151 H] Prisoners who are under trial, are brought before- this Court on 'rule nis and are kept in custody of this Court.
 This is a transferred custody on behalf of the Magistrate.
 The Magistrate cannot recall the prisoner from this Court's custody by his order and he is only required to intimate to the jail authorities the prisoner, and this Court that the original remand has been extended while adjourning the case.
 This is sufficient compliance with the requirements of the law in such special circumstances. To expect the Magistrate to do more under s. 344 of the Code in such 148 circumstances is to expect an impossibility from him and the law does not contemplate an impossibility. [152 F] In the present case the prisoner did not want bail or seek to appear by counsel. He relied only on the technical plea that he was not produced before the Magistrate. There was no reason for this Court to order his release when he was held on proper remand by a Magistrate ,and there were no circumstances justifying his release.

 Per Shelat and Vaidialingam, JJ. (dissenting) : It stands to reason that an order of remand will have to be passed in the presence of the .accused. Otherwise the position will be that a magistrate or court will be passing orders of remand mechanically without having heard the accused for a considerably long time. When the accused is before the Magistrate when the remand order is passed he can make representation that no remand order should be passed and also oppose any move for a further remand. The fact that the person concerned does not desire to be released on bail or that he can make representations to the Magistrate are beside the point. For instance in cases where a person is sought to be proceeded against under Ch. VIII of the Criminal Procedure Code, it would be open to him to represent that the circumstances had materially changed and a further remand had become unnecessary. [160 H-161 D] It was no answer that in the present case the petitioner was brought to New Delhi under the orders of this Court and hence the City Magistrate had to pass the remand order at Lucknow.. The U.P. authorities had made no representation on August 27, 1970 when the writ petition was adjourned. They also did not take the prisoner to Lucknow as permitted by this Court. In the result it must be held that the orders of remand dated 28th and 29th August, 1970 passed by the City Magistrate, Lucknow were illegal. [161 F-162 A] Case law referred to.
