 The respondent 1's husband and father of minor respondent 2 was on February 11, 1952, knocked down by a Government jeep car rashly and negligently driven by an employee of the State of Rajasthan, while being taken from the repair shop to the Collector's residence, and subsequently died in hospital. On a suit by the respondents for damages, the trial court decreed the same exparte as against the driver but dismissed it as against the State, holding that as the car was being maintained for the use of the Collector, in discharge of his official duties, even though it was not being used for any purposes of the State at the time of the occurrence, that was sufficient to absolve the State of any vicarious liability as the employer. The High Court on appeal, disagreeing with the trial court, decreed the suit as against the State as well.
 ^ Held, that the liability of the State for damages in respect of a tortious act committed by its servant within the scope of his employment and functioning as such was the same as that of any other employer.
 The relevant provisions for determining the extent of that liability were not those contained in Arts. 294 and 295 which were primarily concerned with the devolution of rights, assets and liabilities but those of Art. 300 (1) of the Constitution, which by using the expression "in like cases" in its second part defined the extent of that liability and referred back to the legal position obtaining before the promulgation of the Constitution.
 Article 300 (1), read in the light of s. 176 (1) of the Government of India Act of 1935, s. 32 of the Government of India Act, 1915, and s. 65 of the Government of India Act, 1858, left no manner of doubt that the extent of the liability of a State must be the same as that of the East India Company as decided by the Supreme Court of Calcutta, in the case of Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co. v. The Secretary of State for India.
 990 Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co.
 v. The Secretary of State for India, (1868-69) 5 Bom. H. C. R. 1, approved.
 Regard being had to the stages by which the State of Rajasthan was ultimately formed, it was not possible in order to judge the liability of that State under Art, 300 (1) to go beyond the last stage of integration leading to the formation of the Rajasthan Union on the eve of the Constitution and that Union would be the corresponding State as contemplated by the Article. In the absence therefore, of any law providing otherwise, the Union of Rajasthan, just as the Dominion of India or any of its constituent providences, would be vicariously liable for the acts of its servant.
 Viewed from the stand-point of the first principles, the conclusion could not be otherwise.
 Ever since the days of the Fast India Company, the Sovereign was held liable to be sued in tort or in contract and the English Common law immunity as it existed in England before the enactment of Crown Proceedings Act, 1947, never operated in India.
 With the advent of the Constitution and inauguration of the Republic with a view to establishing a Socialistic State with its varied industrial and other activities engaging large numbers of employees there could be no justification, in principle or public interest, that the State should not be held vicariously liable for the tortious acts of its servants.

 786, referred to As neither the Parliament nor any State Legislature had thought fit to enact any law on the matter, a right saved by by Art, 300 of the Constitution, the law must continue to be the same as it had been since the days of the East India Company.
