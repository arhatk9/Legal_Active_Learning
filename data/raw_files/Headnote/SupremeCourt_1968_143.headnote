 Certain tenants of land applied to the Collector, Sangrur and Bhatinda, alleging that they had been forcibly deprived of the lands in May/June, 1943 and sought an order for restoration of possession under s. 43 of the Pepsu Tenancy and Agricultural Act 8 of 1953. The Collector granted the applications and ordered possession to be restored to the tenants. His orders were confirmed by the Commissioner who was of the view that an order under s. 43 could be passed by the Collector on his subjective satisfaction that a person was in wrongful or unauthorised possession of land. The Financial Commissioner also confirmed the orders on the ground that substantial justice had been done by the subordinate revenue authorities.
 The first respondent challenged these orders by a writ petition but this was dismissed by a Single Bench holding that the Act 8 of 1953 was a code in itself and provided for a complete machinery for the decision of disputes like the resent one. But a Division Bench in appeal allowed the petition and held that Act 8 of 1953 which came into force on December 13, 1953, had no retrospective operation.
 On appeal to this Court 
HELD, dismissing the appeals (i) Apart from the allegation of the tenants that the first respondent was in wrongful or unauthorised possession of the lands previously occupied by them, it was further necessary to establish that under cl. (b) of s. 43(1) the person in wrongful or unauthorised possession was not entitled to the use and occupation of the lands under the provisions of the Act. There was no provision which disentitled the first respondent to the use and occupation of the lands. Section 43 (1) (b) therefore had no application in the present case.
 The condition precedent to the investment of jurisdiction in the Collector being absent, the revenue authorities had no power to pass the order in ejectment which they purported to pass.
 (ii) The proceedings of the Collector are judicial in character and although the trial is summary, the Collector is bound to exercise the jurisdiction vested in him not on a subjective satisfaction, as the Commissioner assumed, but on a judicial determination of facts which invest him with jurisdiction to pass an order in ejectment. When the condition precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction does not exist the Collector cannot clothe himself with authority to pass the impugned orders. Furthermore, the High Court had rightly held the terms of cl. (b), s. 43(1) had no retrospective operation.
 (iii) If the Collector had no jurisdiction except in the special condition prescribed by s. 43, his order could not be sustained merely because 284 another authority may, if the proceeding were before that authority, on the findings recorded, have granted relief to the tenants of restoration to possession of their respective lands. Authorities which are vested with powers-judicial or quasi-judicial--can exercise their power within the limits of their jurisdiction and their actions without jurisdiction cannot be sustained merely because another body or authority, which if lawfully approached, may have jurisdiction to pass the order complained of.
