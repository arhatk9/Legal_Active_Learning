 The petitioner was convicted under s. 61(a) of the Punjab Excise Act and sentenced to two months' rigorous imprisonment. Revision application to the Sessions Judge having failed, he moved the High Court under s. 482, Cr.
 P.C. 1973 (II of 1974) read with Art. 227 of the Constitution. Invoking its revisional jurisdiction suo Motu the High Court issued a rule for enhancement of the sentence and raised it to six months. In application for special leave, the petitioner contended that the High Court, in revision s. 401, Cr. P.C. had no jurisdiction or power to enhance the sentence in the absence of an appeal by the State under s. 337 Cr. P.C.
 Dismissing the petition, 
HELD : The High Court, as an effective instrument for administration of criminal justice, keeps a constant vigil and wherever it finds that justice has suffered, it takes upon itself as its bounded duty to suo motuu act where there is flagrant abuse of the law. The character of the offence and the nature of disposal of a particular case by the subordinate court prompt remedial action on the part of the High Court for the ultimate social good of the community, even though the State may be slow or silent in preferring an appeal provided for under the new Code. In a given case of public importance, the High Court reacts to public concern over the problem and may act suo Motu on perusal of newspaper reports disclosing imposition of grossly inadequate sentence upon such offenders. This salutary power which existed in the old Code has not been denied by Parliament under the new Code. [490C-F]
