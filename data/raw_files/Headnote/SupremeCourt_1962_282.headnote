 Section 3(1) of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, authorise the appropriate. Government to fix rates of minimum was payable to employees in the scheduled employments. Section 3(3) (iv) authorises the government, in fixing or revising mini- mum wages, to fix different minimum rates for differ localities. By Notification dated April 19, 1955, the Government of Bombay revised the minimum rates of wages for work employed in the bidi manufactories and fixed for localities Sangamner and Akola and places within seven miles of the respective Municipal limits, a minimum rate of Rs.
 2/2/- 525 making 1000 bidis. The appellant contended that s. 3 (3) (iv) violated Arts. 14 and 19(1) (i) of the Constitution as it conferred uncontrolled powers on the government enabling it to discriminate between employers of different localities which also affected their business, that the notification also violated Art. 14 and that the notification was not validly made as the Advisory Board had no representatives of the employers on it.
 Held, that s. 3 (3) (iv) of the Act was valid and that the Notification was issued after compliance with the statutory Provisions.
 Section 3(3)(iv) does not delegate any arbitrary or un- controlled power to the Government' Having regard to the diversity of Conditions prevailing and the number of industries covered by the Act, the Legislature could not fix uniform rates for all the, industries and for all the localities. Working out of the detailed, provisions relating to minimum rates had from the very nature of the legislation to be delegated to some authority By entrusting to the State Government power to fix minimum wages for any locality or localities the legislature has not striped itself of its essential legislative power but has merely entrusted ;in incidental function to it. The policy and the principles for guidance in the exercise of the power are inherent in the purpose and object of the Act, and in the machinery erected for assisting the Government in marking equitable adjustment of the conflicting claims of labour and employers. If a statute does not make a classification itself but leaves it to a responsible body to make it and sets out the policy or principles for its guidance, the statute cannot be struck down as infringing Art. 14.
 Kathi Raning Rawat v. State of Saurashtra, [1952] S.C.R.
 435, relied on.
 The notification was promulgated after making a full enquiry under the Act. The fixation of rates of wages and the revision thereof was done after considering the reports of the committees and sub-committees appointed in that behalf and of the Advisory Committees and Board, and after giving full consideration to the representations made by the employers likely to be affected thereby. The fact that there was no representative of the employers in the Advisory Board did not affect the validity of the Notification as there was no such statutory requirement. Besides the function of the Board is merely to co-ordinate the work of the Committees and subcommittees and to a vise Government generally in the matter 526 of fixing and revising the minimum rates ; its function is not to make any detailed investigation in' any particular industry.
