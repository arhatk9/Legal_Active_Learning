 The appellants B and G were charged with offences under ss.
 302 and 364 I.P.C. but were acquitted for an offence under s. 364 IPC. The deceased had made a dying declaration that he was taken forcibly into B's baithak and was shot at. At the trial B stated that he had fired at the deceased in self defence because the deceased entered his baithak in a drunken state with a deadly weapon in his hand and attempted to attack him. Rejecting the plea of self defence and believing one part of the dying declaration and disbelieving another, the trial Court convicted the appellants under s.
 302. The High Court affirmed the conclusions of the trial court.
 Dismissing the appeal of B and allowing that of G, this Court 
HELD : (1) The effect of the acquittal of the accused under s. 364 IPC in the instant case would only be that for the charge of murder, the prosecution cannot rely upon the evidence that the deceased was dragged inside. the baithak by the two accused. The prosecution would have to bring the charge of murder home to the accused independently of the allegation that the accused had forcibly taken the deceased inside the baithak. If, that is done there would no legal infirmity in the conviction of the accused. [911 B-D] (2) If a part of the dying declaration has not been proved to be correct it does not necessarily result in the rejection of the whole of the dying declaration. The rejection of a part of the dying declaration would put the court on the guard and induce it to apply a rule of caution.
 There may be cases wherein the part of the dying declaration which is not found to be correct is so indissolubly linked with the other part of the dying declaration that it is not possible to sever the two parts. In such an event the court would be justified in rejecting the whole of the dying declaration. There may, however, be other cases wherein the two parts of the dying declaration may be severable and the correctness of one part does not depend upon the correctness of the other. In the last mentioned cases the court would not normally act upon a part of the dying declaration, the other part of which has not been found to be true, unless the part relied upon is corroborated in material particulars by the other evidence on record. If such other evidence shows that part of the dying declaration relied upon is correct and trustworthy the court can act upon that part of the dying declaration despite the fact that another part of the dying declaration has not been proved to be correct.
 [911 E-H] In the instant case the part of the statement in the dying declaration that the appellant had shot him was corroborated by the statement of the appellant himself because he admitted having injured the deceased by firing at him. That part of the dying declaration is separable from the other part regarding the deceased having been forcibly taken inside the baithak and the truth of the former part does not depend upon the truth of the latter part. [911 H-912 B] The case against G is not free from reasonable doubt and he is entitled to the benefit thereto, [913 A] 907
