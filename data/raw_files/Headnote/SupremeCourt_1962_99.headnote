 In, pursuance of an order for their deportation the res- pondents were arrested on July 21, and sent to Amritsar.
 The next day a habeas corpus application was filed on their behalf before the High Court at Lucknow and they were ordered to be produced on July 25, but on the High Court being informed that the respondents were beyond its jurisdiction it directed the application to be consigned to the records. On spurious information being received at Amritsar that the respondents had to be produced before the High Court the respondents were sent back to Lucknow which they reached at 1 P.M. on July 25. They were produced before the Deputy Registrar at 3 P. M. and he directed them to be produced at 10. 15 A.M. on the next day. In the mean time a second habeas corpus application was filed on behalf of the respondents, inter alia, on the ground that the detention of the respondents was in violation of Art.22 of the Constitution as they had not been produced before any Magistrate. The respondents were produced before the High Court at 10.30 A.M. on July 26, when the High Court ad- journed the case till 2 P.M. on July 27. and directed the production of the respondents at the time of hearing. On July 27, the High Court ordered the release of the respondents on bail and adjourned the case till July 28. On July 28, the High Court allowed the application and directed the respondents to be released on the ground of a contravention of Art. 22(2). It did not consider the legality of the detention in the first stage, i.e. from July 21 to 1 p.m. on July 25, but held that the detention in the second stage was illegal as the respondents were not produced before a Magistrate within 24 hours of 1 P.M. of July 25.
 Held, (per Sinha, C.J., Ayyangar, Mudholkar and Aiyar, J.J., Subba Rao, J., dissenting), that the detention of the 916 respondents was legal and the High Court was wrong in order- ing their release. The respondents were produced before the High Court on July 26, within 24 hours of their arrival at Lucknow and the High Court by ordering their production the next day permitted the respondents to remain in police custody. They were again produced before the High Court within the next 24. hours on July 27, when they were ordered to be released on bail. Thus at no time during the second stage could the respondents be said to have been illegally detained for more than 24 hours without production before a judicial authority in violation of Art. 22(2).
 Per Subba Rao, J. The detention of the respondents was illegal. The detention could not be dissected into two stages; it was a continuous one. Arrest: and detention for purposes of deportation was subject to the provisions of Art.22(2) and the respondents not having been produced before a Magistrate within 24 hours of their arrest the detention wag illegal.
