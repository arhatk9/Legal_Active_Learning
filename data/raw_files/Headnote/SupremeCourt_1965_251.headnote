 The two respondents were appointed guardians of the two minor .sons after the death of their father and mother, by an order of the Civil Court. Prior to his death the income of the father's business was assessed as an individual. The guardians filed a return on behalf of the minors in the status of a joint Hindu family. The Income-Tax Officer assessed the guardians under s. 23(3) read with s. 41 of the Income-tax Act. Later the Court allowed the guardians toll separate accounts thereafter for each of the minors. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner, on appeal against the assessment, directed their separate individual assessments, which was set aside by the Tribunal. On reference, the High Court held against the Revenue. In this Court, the Revenue contended that under s. 40 of the Act the guardians were liable to pay tax as it would be leviable from minors if of full age, and if the minors had been of full age they would be assessed as Hindu undivided family.
 
 HELD : Section 40 of the Act applied to this case, and consequently the guardians ought to be assessed, treating the minors as constituting a Hindu undivided family. [616 H] On the death of the father, the minor sons constituted a joint Hindu family and the business was joint family property. Till some positive action was taken to a partition of the property, it would remain joint family property. The order appointing the two guardians could not be read as having effected partition of the property. Apart from the fact that the Court under the Guardianship Act has no jurisdiction to partition property belonging to a join" Hindu family, there are no words in the order of the Court appointing the guardians to warrant such a finding. [616 E] The court's order allowing the guardians to keep and submit separate accounts came into existence after the assessment year and after the Income-tax Officer had passed his order. Therefore it could not have any effect on the position prevailing in the relevant accounting year in dispute. [616 D] Srifudin Alimohammad v. Commissioner of Income-tax, 25 I.T.R. 237, referred to.
 Commissioner of Income-tax v. Balvantrai Jethalal Vaidya, 34 I.T.R. 187, approved.
