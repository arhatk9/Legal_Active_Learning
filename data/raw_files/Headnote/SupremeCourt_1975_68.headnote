 Once an order refusing special leave has been passed by this Court, a review thereof must be subject to the rules of the Supreme Court Rules, 1966, and cannot be lightly entertained. Review proceeding does not amount to a re- hearing. A review of a judgment is a serious step and reluctant resort to it is proper only where a glaring omission or patent mistake or like grave error has crept in earlier by judicial fallibility. Even if the order refusing special leave was capable of a different course, review of the earlier order is not permissible because such an order has the normal feature of finality. [933 F-G; 934 B] Observation : It is neither fairness to the Court which decided nor awareness of the precious public time lost what with a huge back-log of dockets waiting in the queue for disposal, for counsel 'to issue easy certificates for entertainment of review and fight over again the same battle which has been fought and lost. [933 H]
