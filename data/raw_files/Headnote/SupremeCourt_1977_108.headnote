 Section 3(1)(a) of the United Provinces (Temporary) Control of Rent and Eviction Act, 1947, permits ejectment on the ground of arrears of-rent when the tenant is in arrears of rent for more than three months and has failed to pay the same to the landlord within one month of the service upon him of a notice of demand. Section 7-C(1) enables deposits of rent to be made when a landlord refuses to accept any rent lawfully paid to him by a tenant and s. 7-C(6) enjoins that "in any case where a deposit has been made as afore- said, it shall be deemed that the rent has been duly paid by the tenant to the landlord." The appellant-tenant had extremely strained relations with his landlady leading to criminal cases. He deposited the rent payable by him in the court regularly. The trial court as well as the High Court, taking the view that such prompt deposits of rent in the court did not satisfy the provisions of s. 3(1)(a) of the United 'Provinces (Tempo- rary) Control of Rent and Eviction Act, 1947, since it is not equivalent to payment of rent to the landlord, granted the ejection application filed by the respondent-landlady.
 Allowing the appeal by special leave and remanding the case, the court, 
 HELD: (1 ) The construction pot by the courts below on s. 7-C is too narrow and a liberal construction of the expression "paid to him by a tenant" in s. 7-C (1) is neces- sary. [487 B-D] (2) A correct interpretation of s. 7 has to be condi- tioned by the circumstances prevailing between the parties.
 In a situation where not merely bitterness and friction but potentially violent terms mar the life of the parties, s.
 7-C of the Act has to be read realistically. It is not necessary for the tenant to create a situation of tension and violence by physically giving the rent into the hands of the landlord. It is an idle ritual to insist or a physical tender of payment of rent where the circumstances make it impracticable. But harassing the landlord by straightaway depositing the rent in court without fulfilment of the conditions required by s. 7-C(1) is also unwarranted. [486 G-H, 487 A, D] The expression "where the deposit has been made as aforesaid" in s. 7-C (6) means that the deposit is permissi- ble only when the condition in s. 7-C(1) is complied with.
 If the landlord refuses to accept rent paid to him a deposit is permissible but payment need not be by physical tender person to person. It can be by money order or through messenger or by sending a notice to the landlord asking him to nominate a bank into which the rents may be regularly paid to the credit of the landlord. If the landlord refuses under these circumstances then a court deposit will be the remedy. In the instant case the courts below have not considered whether the circumstances which drove the appel- lant into the depositing of rent in court were such as eliminated the other possibilities of direct payment. [487 E-F, A] Observation It would be a far more satisfactory solution of the situation between two neighbours who have fallen out, if the parties would come to terms at the gentle suggestion of the court below as to what it considers Just aided by the activ- ist endeavours of counsel, than a mere adjudication of the points of fact and law raised which will leave the parties as bitter neighbours. [The court directed the appellate court to take .the initiative in the matter with a caution to-be totally non-aligned in the process. [488 A-B] 486
