 The appellant and Respondents Nos. 6 and 9 filed a suit in the District Court. The suit was transferred to a Sub- Judge, who tried it along with another suit filed by other plaintiffs. By a common judgment he dismissed the transferred suit as also the other suit. The plaintiffs in the other suit applied for a certified copy of the judgment and after obtaining the same filed an appeal before the High Court. The plaintiffs in the transferred suit also applied for a certified copy of the judgment, but the application came to be dismissed for non-remittance of printing charges.
 However they obtained a copy of decree and filed an appeal before the High Court beyond the period of limitation. Copy of the judgment of the Sub-Judge with the seal of the Court was also filed. It was explained that they were under bona fide belief that the copy of the judgment obtained by the plaintiffs in the other suit could be made use of and that it was not necessary for them to obtain the copies of judgment separately. It was pleaded that the time taken in obtaining certified copies of judgment by the plaintiffs in the other suit should also be excluded in the case of the plaintiffs in the transferred suit. The High Court rejected the application and consequently did not accept the appeal.
 It was held that the plaintiffs/appellants could not take advantage of the certified copy of the 549 judgment obtained by another person. Being aggrieved against the said orders of the High Court, one of the plaintiffs/appellants preferred the present appeal by special leave.
 On behalf of the appellants, it was contended that since the plaintiffs in the other suit have already filed a certified copy of the judgment, the filing of the same by the plaintiffs in the transferred suit should have been dispensed with; that the proviso to Order XLI Rule 1 CPC clearly applied to the case; that a memorandum of appeal need not necessarily be accompanied by a certifed copy of the judgment obtained by the appellant himself; and that the copy of the common judgment obtained by the plaintiffs in the other suit could be used by the plaintiffs in the transferred suit and in this view of the matter, the appeal filed was within time.
 The Respondents contended that the opposite party has neither filed any separate application for condonation of delay nor urged any ground in support of their claim except stating that they bonafide believed they could make use of the copy of common judgment obtained by the plaintiffs in the other suit.
 Dismissing the appeal, this Court 
 HELD 1. The entire purpose of introducing the proviso to Order XLI Rule 1 CPC, was to avoid extra expenses where more cases than one were disposed of by common judgment and the Appellate Court was authorised to dispense with the necessity of filing more than one copy of the Judgment. It was no doubt made clear by adding the proviso to Order XLI Rule 1 CPC that the filing of the certified copies of the judgment could be dispensed with where two or more appeals are filed against the common Judgment by the same appellant or by different appellants. It only deals with the provision as to what documents should be accompanied along with the memorandum of appeal. The provision has no relevance nor can control the provisions of limitation which are contained separately under the Limitation Act, 1963 [554-E,F] 
 2. Admittedly the plaintiffs filed the memorandum of appeal in the High Court against the Judgment and decree passed by the Subordinate Judge. The memorandum of appeal was accompanied by a certified copy of the decree as well as a printed copy of the common judgment. The appellant cannot claim any benefit of the proviso to Order XLI Rule 1 CPC 550 and as a consequence thereof the benefit of the time spent in obtaining the certified copy of the judgment by the plaintiffs in the other suit. The proviso permits the Appellate Court to dispense with the filing of more than one copy of the Judgment in order to save the expenses, but in the present case the plaintiffs had already filed a printed copy of the judgment of the Subordinate Judge and as such there was no question of seeking any order from the Appellate Court for dispensing with the filing of more than one copy of the judgment. [554-G,H; 555-A,B] 
 3. The appellant and respondents Nos. 6 to 9 who were plaintiffs in the transferred suit had filed certified copy of the decree under challenge along with the memorandum of appeal and the time in obtaining the certified copy of the decree can be excluded in computing the limitation and there is no dispute that such time has been excluded but even after excluding such time the appeal was barred by limitation. So far as the printed copy of the judgment filed along with the memorandum of appeal, it did not contain the necessary particulars regarding the person who made the application, the date of application, the date of issue, the date notified for receiving the same as required in Rules 253 and 254 of the Civil Rules of practice in order to entitle the appellants to claim extension of time under Section 12(3) of the Limitation Act, 1963.
