 In his petition under section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure the appellant alleged that the sale of one of the lots of his property which was attached pursuant to a decree of a court was vitiated in that there were several irregularities and omissions in the proclamation of sale and the conduct of the sale. Accepting his contention that the material irregularities in the sale proclamation vitiated the sale, the executing court set aside the sale.
 Allowing the respondent's appeal, the High Court held that the application for setting aside the sale lay under rule 90 of Order XXI and not under section 47 of the Code.
 Dismissing the appeal ^ 
 HELD : The application for setting aside the sale on the grounds taken by the appellant is referable to rule 90 of Order XXI and, therefore, not to section 47. [603F] The settling of the sale proclamation is part of the integral process of publishing the sale and irregularities committed in the process of settling the sale proclamation are irregularities which fall within the amplitude of rule 90 of Order XXI. [603B] The errors complained of by the appellant amounted to mere irregularities committed in settling the sale proclamation and could not be described as errors which render the sale void. [602D] The requirements which were not complied with when settling the sale proclamation were intended for the benefit of the appellant who could waive them. They were not matters which went to the root of the court's jurisdiction and constituted the foundation or authority for the proceeding or where public interest was involved. They were mere irregularities which fell within the scope of rule 90 of Order XXI C.P.C. [602E-F] Dhirendra Nath Gorai and Subal Chandra Shaw and Others v. Sudhir Chandra Ghosh and Others [1964] INSC 55; [1964] 6 S.C.R. 1001 applied.
