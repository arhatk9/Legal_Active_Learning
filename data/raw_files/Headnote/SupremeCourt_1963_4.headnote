 The appellant is the owner of a vacant plot of land of which the respondents were the tenants. The former applied to the court for ejectment of the latter and for getting possession under S. 13 (1) (g) and (e) of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947 on the grounds that he reasonably required the land for occupation by himself and for erection of new buildings. The trial court found in favour of the appellant on the first ground but rejected his claim under the second ground. Though cross appeals were filed the appellate court substantially upheld the order of the court below' Thereafter the appellant took possession about four months later and started storing materials for sanitary works and buildings even though at the trial his case was that he wanted the land for storing of timber. The respondents applied under s. 17 (1) of the Act to the trial court to obtain possession of the premises on the ground that the appellant had failed to occupy the premises within one month of his recovery of possession. The trial court rejected their application but the appellate court allowed the appeal filed by them. The revision petition filed by the appellant was summarily rejected by the High Court. The present appeal is byway of special leave granted by this Court.
 The appellant's contention before this Court was that the period of limitation of one month prescribed under s. 17 (1) would be applicable to an order under s. 13 (1) (i) and not to one passed under s. 13 (1) (g).
 Held, that s. 17 (1) makes a distinction between occupation and possession. The period of limitation of one month 554 applies as much to the case of occupation as to the case of erection of the work, contemplated by cl. 13 (1) (g) and (i) respectively. Since the appellant did not occupy the premises within one month he has failed to comply with the first part of s. 17 (1) and hence the respondents are entitled to an order for the possession of the premises.
