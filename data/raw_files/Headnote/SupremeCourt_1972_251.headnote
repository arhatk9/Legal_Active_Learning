 For the assessment year 1957-58, the assessee (respondent) was assessed to sales tax, under the U.P. Sales Tax Act and Rules, on a turnover which included the turnover of a flour mill of the assessee. The assessment was made ex-Parte. On account of food shortage the Government had fixed a quota for the flour mill in 1958 on the basis of the average grinding done during the previous three years. In view of the turnover according to the account books of the assessee for the years 1955-56 and 1958-59, the sales-tax officer thought that the turnover for the year 1957-58 was underestimated and that 'some turnover had escaped assess- ment. He accordingly issued a notice in September 1961 and a memorandum on 13th March 1962 calling upon the assesses to produce the account books but no account books were produced. On 24th March,1962, a notice was issued under s.21 of the Act. It was served on the assessee on 26th March 1962. On March 19, 1963, the sales tax officer made an assessment order under s. 21 estimating the turnover at a higher figure. Section 21 provides that if-the assessing authority has reason to believe that the whole or part of the turnover of a dealer had escaped assessment, be may reassess the dealer to tax, that such reassessment shall not be made for any assessment year after the expiry of four years, and that where notice under the section bad been served within four years, the reassessment may be made within one year of the date of service of the notice even if the period of four years is thereby exceeded.
 The High Court, on reference under s. 1 1 of the Act, held that : (1) the first notice and memorandum were not notices under s.21 so as to attract the period of limitation of one year for making the reassessment, but (2) that the assessing officer could not in the circumstances of the case, be said to have reason to believe that some turnover of the assessee had escaped assessment.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) The High Court wag.-right in holding that the first notice and memorandum were of a preliminary nature and did not constitute notices under s.21. All that was stated- in them was to call upon the assessee to produce account books, and a threat, in case of non-compliance, that action may be taken under s.21 of the Act. It was only on March 24, 1962, that notice under that section was given to the respondent. The reassessment made on March 19, 1963, was Within one year of the dates of service if the notice and hence, the reassessment was not barred by limitation. [635C- E] 626 (2) The High Court was in error in holding that the assessing authority did not act within, the ambit of his powers in 'initiating proceedings under s. 21. [634F] (a) The words 'reason to believe' convey that there must be some reasonable grounds for the assessing authority to form the belief that the turnover had escaped assessment.
 Reasonable grounds necessarily postulate that they must be germane to the formation of the belief regarding escaped assessment. The belief must be held in good faith and should pot be a pretense. At the stage of the issue of notice the only consideration which has to weigh with the assessing authority is whether there is some relevant material giving rise to the prima facie inference that some turnover has escaped assessment. If the grounds are of an extraneous character, they would not warrant initiation of proceedings under the section. But if they are relevant and have a nexus with the formation of the belief regarding escaped assessment, the assessing authority would be clothed with jurisdiction to take action under the section. Whether the grounds are adequate or not is not a matter which would be gone into by the High Court or this Court, for, the sufficiency of the grounds which induced the assessing authority to act is not a justifiable issue. What can be challenged is the existence of the belief, but not the sufficiency of reasons for the belief. [632D-H] S. Narayanappa v. Commissioner of Income Tax, [1967] 63 I.T.R. 219, applied.
 In the present case, the facts show that the assessing authority had valid grounds for forming the belief that pan of the turnover of the respondent had escaped assessment, and that the belief was formed in good faith. [634C-F] (b) There is nothing in s.21 to support the contention that proceedings for re-assessment cannot be initiated under the section in the case of ex-parte assessments. Such a construction would put a premium on contumacy and afford protection to dealers who avoid appearing before the assessing authority. [634G-H; 635A-B]
