 The Rayala Corporation (P) Ltd. manufactured Halda typewriters in India with materials imported from Sweden.
 Initially it made purchases through a firm known as A.B.
 Atvidabergs (later known as Facit A.B.). In 1963 the Rayala Corporation decided to import certain materials through another firm called the Associated Swedish Steels A.B., Sweden (ASSAB). Appellant No. 1 a Swedish national, was at the relevant time export manager of A.B. Atvidabergs; in 1966 he also became a director of Rayala Corporation. In November 1968 appellant no. 1 was travelling by aircraft from Singapore to Karachi. The aircraft became grounded at Delhi. The Director of Enforcement, New Delhi, acting under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947 took appellant no.
 1 into custody and detained him. He was served with a notice of adjudication tinder the Act; the notice purported to be in continuation of one already given to Rayala Corporation under s. 23C of the Act. Appellant No. 1 challenged his detention by a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution. In this Court a statement was made on behalf of the respondents that a complaint had already been filed against the appellants under s. 120-B of the Indian Penal Code read with certain sections of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act. In the said complaint it was alleged that in 1963 when appellant no. 2 had gone to Sweden he told Appellant no. 1 of the decision taken by the Rayala Corporation to buy certain materials from ASSAB. He further informed Appellant no. J that arrangements had been made with ASSAB to over invoice to the goods by 40%, and that the said excess over the true value would be kept in a bank in the personal account of appellant no. 2. Appellant no. 1 agreed to help Appellant no. 2 in opening-. the said account and keeping it secret; he also agreed to keep a watch over the account and to bring copies of it Whenever he visited India. This according to the complaint amounted to a conspiracy between Appellants nos. 1 and 2 within the meaning of s. 120-B of the Indian Penal Code for the purpose of illegal acquisition of foreign exchange by appellant no.
 2 and retaining the same abroad in contravention of ss.
 4(3). 5(1)(e) and 9 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act and Rule 132-A of the Defence of India (Amendment) Rules, 1964. It was alleged that appellant no. 1 actually sent to appellant no. 2 from time to time statements of the illegal account opened in Sweden in pursuance of the conspiracy. It was further alleged that in November 1965 appellant no. 1 came to India and again agreed to continue helping appellant no. 2 in operating the foreign account. The appellants filed petitions in the Madras High 761 Court asking it to quash the said complaint. These petitions having been dismissed the appellants appealed to this Court. it was contended on behalf of the appellants :
 (i) that s. 120-B of the I.P.C. did not apply to the case because s. 21 (1) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, covered the same grounds; (ii) that when the alleged agreement was made in 1963 the objects of it were not illegal because they became so only on the enactment of r.
 132A of the Defence of India Rules in 1964 and the amendment of s. 4 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act in 1965. It was urged that, whatever appellant no. 1 did or agreed to do after the passing of these laws did not constitute any offence and therefore he could not be said to have taken part in a criminal conspiracy.
 
HELD: Per Sikri, Ray and Reddy, JJ.-The appeals must be dismissed.
 (i) The combined effect of the several provisions of s. 21 does not support the view that sub-s. (1) covers a case of criminal conspiracy similar to s. 120-B. Section 21 does not in terms deal with an agreement to commit an offence or it legal act in an illegal way but merely provides that an agreement or contract by itself ought not to evade or avoid the provisions of the Act. The agreement entered into between. ASSAB and appellant no. 2 would, if proved, come within the mischief of s. 21(1) but the agreement such is the one alleged to have been entered into between appellant no. 1 and appellant no. 2 does not itself evade or avoid any of the provisions of the Act, rules, or directions. The words directly or indirectly do not take in any agreement to be illegal acts in future. [769 H-770 B] (ii) For the offence of conspiracy as defined in s. 120-A of the Indian Penal Code there must be a meeting of minds in the doing of an illegal act or the doing of a legal act by illegal means. If in the furtherance of the conspiracy certain persons are induced to do an unlawful act without the knowledge of the conspiracy or the plot the cannot be held to be conspirators, though they may be guilty of an offence to the specific unlawful act. The offence of conspiracy is complete when two or more conspirators have agreed to do or cause to be do in act which it itself an offence, in which case no overt act need be established. An agreement to do an illegal act which amounts to a conspiracy will continue as long as the members of the conspiracy remain in agreement and as long as they are acting in accord and in furtherance of the object for which they entered into the agreement. [770 D-F] The contention that the acts of appellant no. 1 in watching the bank account in Sweden on behalf of appellant no. 2 and keeping him informed about it did not constitute any offence and therefore he was not guilty of the offence of conspiracy, could not be accepted. The several acts which constitute a conspiracy cannot be split up into parts and the liability of appellant, no. 1 could not be judged by the part that he played. The entire agreement must be viewed as a whole and it bad to be ascertained as to what in fact the conspirators intended to do or the object they wanted to achieve-. [771 D-E] In this case on the allegations appellant no. 2 asked appellant no. 1 to help him in acquiring foreign exchange illegally and appellant no. 1 agreed to help him. This agreement though initially may not have been an offence was none the less an offence subsequently, but appellant no. 1 did not withdraw from it and was said to have continued to carry out the agreement. The help of appellant no. 1 was necessary to the design of appellant no. 2 because otherwise he would not know whether ASSAB was in fact, crediting his, account in the bank with the amount of over 762 invoice Appellant no. 1 kept appellant no. 2 supplied with necessary information from time to time and agreed while in Madras in 1965 to continue to help appellant no. 2. The several acts of appellant no. 1 were all acts- in consequence of the agreement which had its origin in Sweden.
 Appellant no. 2 also in pursuance of the conspiracy acquired foreign exchange in Sweden. Therefore on the allegations contained in the complaint appellant no. 1 and appellant no. 2 could be charged with an offence under s. 120-B. [771 H-772 E] M/s. Rayala Corporation (P) Ltd. & Anr. v. Director of Enforcement, New Delhi [1969] INSC 150; [1970] 1 S.C.R. 639 and Denis Dowling Mulchv v. Queen L.R. 3 H.L. 305, 317, referred to.
 Per Mitter and Hedge, ]J. (dissenting).-The appeals must be allowed.
 Per Mitter, J.-(i) An agreement by two persons whereby one agrees to help the other by 'facilitating transfer of foreign exchange from a foreign exporter into the banking account of that other is an agreement the object whereof is not only the acquisition of foreign exchange but the retention of it abroad. This is clearly an agreement to evade the operation of the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act relating to the ill-gal acquisition and retention of 'foreign exchange within the meaning of s.
 21 (1) of the Act. So far as the violation of the different provisions of the Act or rule or direction or order made thereunder are concerned the Act is a complete code including within its ambit by reason of s. 21(1) a criminal conspiracy to acquire foreign exchange abroad illicitly and retaining the same abroad. The offence alleged against the appellants in the present case therefore fell under s.
 23(1A) read with s. 21(1) of the Act and no complaint lay under s. 120-B of the Indian Penal Code. [781 E-F, 782 B, 783 H] (ii) In the Rayala Corporation's case this Court laid down that complaint under s. 23(1)(b) cannot be launched before the Director of Enforcement has taken up the adjudication proceedings and made some inquiry in these proceedings and formed the opinion that it was necessary to have resort to the more drastic provisions of conviction by a court as envisaged by s. 23(1)(b). In the present case no proceedings had been started either against appellant no. 1 or appellant no. 2 in pursuance of the notice of adjudication issued against them. Therefore in respect of the substantive offences for contravention of the different sections of the Act the Director of Enforcement could not make a Complaint before first having followed the Procedure laid down in s. 23D of the Act. It would be absurd to allow him to file a complaint for violation of s. 21(1) by making a charge under s. 120-B I.P.C. when the overt acts alleged were contravention of different provisions of the Act punishable only under s. 23(1)(b) 'by following the procedure indicated in s. 23D To allow the prosecution to be proceeded with at this stage would in effect be stultifying in s. 23(1)(b). Accordingly the complaint filed under s.
 120B of the I.P.C. against the appellants must be quashed.
 [782 C-F] Per Hegde, J.-(i) The appeals must be allowed following the rule laid, down by this Court in the Rayala Corporation's case. It is a fundamental principle of law that what cannot be done directly should not be permitted to be done indirectly. [784 A-B] (i) From the facts and circumstances of the case it was clear that the complaint was not a bona fide one. It had been filed with a collateral purpose viz. to justify the unlawful detention of appellant no. 1 in this country.
 [784 B-C] 763 (iii) Even if all the facts stated in the complaint were accepted as correct the same did not amount to an offence under s. 120B of the Indian Penal Code. These allegations merely made out that appellant no. 1 was in accessory after the fact and not that he was a conspirator. If a person agreed with a robber to receive the stolen property to arrange for its safe keeping he does not become a co- conspirator with the robber in the commission of the offence of robbery. On the facts alleged it was clear that appellant no. 1 had nothing to do either with the acquisition of foreign exchange by appellant no. 2 or in the matter of the latter's failure to repatriate the same to this country. The allegation against him was that he provided facility for its retention in Sweden. [786 A-B]
