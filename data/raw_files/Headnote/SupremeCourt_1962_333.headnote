 The appellants were the editor, printer and publisher of an Oriya Daily Newspaper called "Matrubhumi". In the issue of May 31, 1958, the views expressed by Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia concerning the Political situation created in Orissa by reason of the resignation of the Congress Ministry and its immediate non-acceptance by the Governor were published.
 During the Press Conference he remarked that the Governor had played as a toy in the hands of the Congress and that his one near relation, had secured employment with the help of the congress party. After it came to the notice of the Governor, he got it translated into English and sent to the Government for taking such action as may be necessary.
 Shortly thereafter, the Home Secretary to the Government passed an order pur. ported to be a sanction under s. 198B of the Code of Criminal 448 Procedure for the prosecution of the appellants for offences under ss. 500 and 501 of the Penal Code and in pursuance thereof the Public Prosecutor lodged a complaint on the basis of which the appellants were tried by the Sessions judge who held both of them guilty to the charge, convicted them of these offences and sentenced them to pay certain fines and their appeals to the High Court were also dismissed. It was urged by the respondent in this Court that it was enough for the Governor to say that he had no objection to the lodging of a complaint and his statement that he left it to the Government to decide what action should be taken and that the Government had consulted him before it decided to take action, therefore, meets the requirements of the provisions of cl. (a) of sub.s. (3) of s. 198B, Code of Criminal Procedure.
 Held, that s. 198-B(3) (a) requires that the Governor should authorise a Secretary to lodge a complaint. Held, also, that there are two restrictions upon the power of the Public Prosecutor to lodge a complaint (1) he must first obtain a sanction to lodge such complaint; (2) and the sanction should be accorded by a Secretary to the Government authorised by the Governor in this behalf. While the sanctioning authority has to apply its mind before according sanction and in performing the function the Secretary does not merely perform a ministerial Act, the initiative has to be taken by the Governor by indicating unequivocally that he desires action to be taken and that the authorisation by him is not an idle formality.
 Held, further, that sub.s. (3) of s. 198-B speaks of a complaint under sub-s. (1) and the complaint under sub-s.
 (1) is a specific complaint in writing made by the Public Prosecutor. Reading the two sub-sections together it would be clear that the authorisation by the Governor is of the sanction with respect to a specific complaint. A general sanction will not be of any avail.
 Gour Chandra Bout v. Public Prosecutor, A. 1. R. 1960 Orissa 116, held inapplicable.
