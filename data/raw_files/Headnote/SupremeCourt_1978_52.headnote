 Section 468 of Criminal Procedure Code (Act 2 of 1974), 1973 bars taking cognizance after lapse of the period of limitation. Under sub-s. (2) of S. 468 the period of limitation shall be (a) six months, if the offence is punishable with for only; (b) one year, if the offence is punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year and (c) three years, if the offence is punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding one year but not exceeding three years.
 The appellant, while working as General Secretary of the Central Bank of India Employees Union, Ludhiana, filed a criminal complaint on 15-3-1972 against respondents Ascharaj Lal Chopra, who was his predecessor in office and also against one Amreek Singh a treasurer for the commission of an offence under ss. 406/420 IPC using the words viz., "criminal intention" and "fraudulently and with a dishonest intention" etc. The trial Court convicted them on 11-2-1975 but the First Appellate Court by its order dated 1-4-1975 acquitted them' which was affirmed by the High Court by its judgment dated 15-5-1975. Respondent Ascharaj Lal, therefore filed a complaint under s. 500 I.P.C. against the appellant on 11-2-1976. The Magistrate examined the plaintiff and issued a summons to the appellant on 15-9- 1976. The appellant moved the High Court under s. 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code for quashing the Magistrate's order taking cognizance of the offence against him, and the High Court rejected it.
 Allowing the appeal by special leave, the Court 
HELD : 1. The statutes of limitation have legislative policy behind them. They shut out belated and dormant claims in order to save the accused from unnecessary harassment and from the risk of facing trial at a time when his evidence might have been lost because of the delay on the part of the prosecutor. [438 B-C] 
2. Section 468 of the Criminal Procedure Code not only raises bar of limitation but also prescribes the period thereof.. The question when the period of limitation could be said to commence lies within the purview of s. 469 Sub-s.
 (1) of s. 469 specifically provides that the period of limitation prescribed in s. 468, in relation to an offence, shall commence inter alia "on the date of the offence". [436 F-G] 
3. It is an essential requirement of sub-s. (1) of s. 470 Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 that the person who seeks its benefit should be able to establish that he was "prosecuting" another prosecution in one Court or the other referred to in the sub-section. [437 6] 
4. In the instant case, (a) the date of the offence was March 15, 1972 when defamatory complaint was filed in the Court of the Magistrate and that was the starting point for the purposes of calculating the three years' limitation provided by s. 468; (b) the complaint under s. 500 I.P.C.
 was filed on 11-2-1976 much after the expiry of three years limitation prescribed for that offence. It was, therefore, not possible for the Court of the Magistrate to take cognizance of the offence after the expiry of the period of limitation : (c) the question of 435 cause of action" contemplated in s. 469(1)(c) could not arise as the controversy related to "the commission of an offence" and (d) the provision of sub-s. (1) of s. 470 cannot avail the respondent as his case, was not so. He did not claim the benefit of s. 473 either. [436 II, 437 A-C, 438 A]
