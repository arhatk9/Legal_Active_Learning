 The appellant the Maharashtra State Electricity Board which took over the supply of electrical energy from the original lincensee, increased the tariff and fixed a uniform tariff for all its consumers. The respondents consumers filed petitions under Art. 226 of the Constitution, contending that (a) s. 49 of the Electricity (supply) Act 1948 did not permit the Board to frame uniform tariffs for consumers in compact areas as well as consumers in sparse areas, so as to require the former to pay a part of the cost involved in the supply of electricity to the latter; and (b) if s. 49 gave such power to the Board it; was ultra vires and void, as it offended the provisions of the Constitution. The High Court allowed the writ petitions. The Board filed appeals to this Court and during its pendency s. 49 was amended retrospectively by the Electricity (Supply) Amendment Act 1966 and by s. 24 of the Amendment Act the imposition and collection of charges under s. 49 was validated.
 HELD: The appeals must be allowed.
 (i) The appellate-Board had ample powers to frame uniform tariffs and the levy was valid.
 In the old s. 49 there was no such policy or direction indicated by the Legislature that the Board is to frame uniform tariffs. Under that section, the Board had the power to supply electricity on such terms and conditions as it may from time to time fix, having regard to the matters referred to in the said section. The only restriction upon the Board's power was that it shall not show undue preference to any person in fixing any such terms and conditions. In s. 49 as it now stands the Legislature has empowered the Board to frame uniform tariffs and it has also indicated the factors to be taken into account in fixing uniform tariffs. These two aspects are contained in 'sub- ss. (1) and (2). The Legislature has also made it clear in sub-s. (3) that the Board in the special circumstances mentioned therein, has got power to fix different tariffs for the supply of electricity. Sub-section (4) directs the Board not to show undue preference to any person for fixing the tariffs and the terms and conditions for the supply of electricity. Though prima facie it would appear that sub-s.
 (4) will govern sub-ss. (1) to (3) in s. 49 the proper way to interpret sub-s. (4) will be to read it along with sub-s.
 (7). When the entire tariff is uniform for every consumer, there is no question of any undue preference as every customer will pay the same amount for the same benefit received by him. [153 CE] South of Scotland Electricity Board & Ors. v. British Oxygen Co. Ltd. [1959] UKHL 4; [1959] 2 All E.R. 225 and Attorney-General for Victoria v. Mayor, Aldermen, Councillors and Citizens of Melbourne, [1907] A.C. 469, referred to.
 Sup.CI./68-10 138 (ii) In the counter-affidavit filed on behalf of the Board, it has been stated that ever since its constitution, it has been carrying on its operations at a loss and there has been no occassion when any part of its revenues has been passed to the consolidated fund of the State, as provided by the proviso to sub-cl. (b) of cl. 10 of s. 67. Even otherwise, before the proviso can come into operation, there are several other items in respect of which adjustments will have to be made, and there will be no occasion at all for the proviso to come into effect. There is no force in the contention of the respondents that with a view to give effect to the proviso the Board will so fix the tariffs as to enable them to have huge surplus, after meeting the various adjustments. In case such a thing happens in future. the proviso, which is clearly severable, may have to be struck down. Therefore, this ground of attack, that there is a colourable exercise of taxing power, cannot be accepted. [154 H-155 C] (iii) Section 49 is not, in any way, bad on the ground that it gives an unguided and arbitrary power to the Board to fix its tariffs as it likes. The provisions of the Act have the effect of properly guiding the activities of the Board, in its dealings with the consumers including the levy of tariffs. Section 49 itself is hedged in by various restrictions and directions which the Board will have lo comply in the matter of framing uniform tariffs or in the matter of fixing different tariffs, and that section also provides a proper guide-line for framing uniform tariffs and different tariffs. Therefore, in particular, it may be noted that the extension and cheapening of supplies of electricity to sparsely developed areas under cl. (d) of s.
 49(2) of the Act can only be complied With by keeping the uniform rate at a minimum, consistently with the requirement of s. 59, of not running at a loss. [156 B-D] (iv) The contention, that while restrictions have been placed on the licensees no such restriction has been placed on the Board in as much as that the licensee shall so adjust his charges for the sale of electricity, whether by enhancing or reducing them that his clear profit in any year of account shall not, as far as possible, exceed an amount of reasonable return, has no substance. The licensees are persons who must have invested considerable capital in the matter of their business. and obviously, the Legislature thought that some directions will have to be given so as to enable them to have a reasonable return. [156 E-G] (v) Section 24 of the Amendment Act, deals with all rates, as a matter of fact fixed under s. 49 of the Act. In this case, the Board has fixed tariffs under s. 49 of the Act.
 Therefore, s. 24 of the Amendment Act has full effect and force. [157 B]
