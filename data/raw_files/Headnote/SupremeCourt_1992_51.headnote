 The respondents were employed as Casual Labour in the Construction Division of the Northern Railways and their services were terminated by oral order. The respondents made a representation that they had been working continuously for more than 120 days and as such were entitled to the status of temporary Railway servants. Since there was no response to their representation, the respondents approached the Central Administrative Tribunal. They relied on letter dated 29.12.78 issued by the General Manager, Northern Railway. As per the letter and the earlier instructions, casual labourers whether employed on project or otherwise who had completed four months' continuous service were required to be considered by the Employment Screening Committee for absorption against Class IV posts.
 The Tribunal gave its finding that since the respondents had worked for more than 120 days, they would be deemed to have acquired temporary status, and that the termination of their services without notice was violative of Rule 2304 of the Indian Railways Establishment Manual. Thus, the Tribunal quashed the termination Orders and directed that the respondents should be reinstated and posted either in the same zone or anywhere else depending on the availability of work, and absorbed against regular class IV posts as per rules.
 The Union of India has preferred the present appeal by special leave, challenging the Tribunal's order.
 On behalf of the appellants it was contended that in case the respon- 824 dents were employed in the construction work on the open line then they would acquire a temporary status after continuous employment of 120 days, and since they were employed on a project work they could acquire temporary status only after completing 360 days of service.
 Disposing of the appeal, this court, 
 HELD: 1. Chapter XXIII of the Indian Railways Manual lays down that casual labourers who have worked for more than 120 days in open line and those who have worked for more than 360 days on projects acquire temporary status and would be entitled to the rights and privileges admissible to temporary Railway servants. Before the Tribunal, the respondent-workers took a clear stand that they were Class IV employees in the Northern Railways and were employed in the Construction Division. This was supported by the appointment letters issued to them. They had been working for over 120 days and as such were entitled to all rights and privileges admissible to temporary Railway servants.

 2. It is directed that all the 105 workers should be accorded the status of temporary employees. They would be entitled to the salary equal to temporary status employees of the Railway at the initial stage of the pay from 12.5.1991. The respondents have been uprooted from their original place and even now they are being given daily wages at the rate of Rs. 19.10 paise and not being given the wages equal to a temporary status employee of the Railway at the initial stage of pay. The Railway Authorities shall pay the back wages, to all the employees from 12.5.1991 equal to a temporary status employee allowed at the initial stage of pay within two months, after adjusting any amount already paid to them.
