 The assessee Bank, which was a co-operative society, did business is controlled commodities with the approval of the Registrar of Co-operative Societies and earned profits. it claimed that these profits were also exempt from taxation under F. D. (C. R.) Notification R. Dis. NO. 291-1. T./25 dated August 25, 1925, as subsequently amended, issued under s. 60 of the income-tax Act. This notification exempted "the profits of any co-operative society " from tax. It was urged for the Department that these words referred to profits made by a co-operative society in its business as a pure co-operative society, i.e., in business with its own members within the four corners of the Cooperative Societies Act, 1912, and the bye-laws made thereunder.
 Held, that the said profits were exempt from tax. The words of the Notification were wide enough to include profits of business of a co-operative society in transactions with non- members also. It was always open to the appropriate Govern- ment to allow a society to extend its business operations to trading with persons other than its members. Once there was such 108 extension, the profits of the society from such business fell within the general words of the Notification and it required more than a supposed underlying intention to negative the exemption.
