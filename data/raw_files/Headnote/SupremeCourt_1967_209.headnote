 Respondent no. 1 was the tenant of the appellants in respect of certain land. The rent was payable by the 20th of March every year. In respect of the years 1951-52, 1952-53, 1953- 54 and 1954-55 the rent was paid by the respondent and was accepted by the appellants though it was not paid on the due dates. The appellants filed an application under s. 29 of the Bombay Tenancy & Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 before the Mamlatdar for eviction and possession on the ground that as the rent had not been paid for the aforesaid years by the due date,, they were entitled to an order of ejectment under s. 25(2) of the Act as it stood before its amendment in 1956. The Mamlatdar dismissed the application. The District Deputy Collector and the Appellate Tribunal upheld the order of the Mamlatdar. The appellants then filed an application under Art, 227 of the Constitution before-the High Court challenging the Tribunal's order. The High Court dismissed the application observing that as it was an admitted position that the landlord had received all the rent due by the tenant and there were no arrears due by him at the date of the said application, there was no ground for interfering with the Tribunal's order. By special leave the appellants came to this Court.
 
HELD:The High Court's refusal to interfere with the Tribunal's order was justified.
 Under sub-s. (1) of s. 25 if the tenant has failed to pay rent and the tenancy is terminated on that ground, the Mamlatdar has the power to direct the tenant to pay up the arrears and on payment of such arrears by the tenant the Mamlatdar has to pass an order directing that the tenancy had not been terminated. Sub-section (1) thus pre-supposes that there are arrears at the date of the application which the Mamlatdar can direct the tenant to pay and that on such arrears being paid the Mamlatdar has to order notwithstanding the termination of the tenancy by the landlord that such tenancy had not been terminated and no order of eviction can be passed against such tenant. Sub- section (2) on the other hand deals with a case where there is persistent default by the tenant.for three years and provides that to such a case the provisions of sub-s(1) would not apply.The Mamlatdar in such a case has not the power to order payment of arrears as he would do under sub- s.(1) and on such payment to direct as he would do under subs.(1)the tenancy should be treated as not having been terminated.sub-section (2) therefore pre-supposes (i) that the tenant has made defaults or ore than two years and (ii) that the tenant was in arrears at the date Of the application which arrears in this case the Mamlatdar cannot order the tenant to Pay. Sub-section (2) is in contradistinction to sub-s. (1), that is to say, whereas in the case of less than three defaults the Mamlatdar can call upon the tenant to pay the arrears and can on payment of such arrears direct that the tenancy was not terminated he cannot do so under sub-s. (2), where 542 there are more than two defaults and direct that the tenancy had not been terminated. [544A-E] The 'legislature could never have intended that even where the tenant has paid up all the arrears and the landlord has accepted them he would still have the right to evict the tenant, through his reason for terminating the tenancy and his cause of action for an action for eviction have disappeared by his acceptance of the arrears due to him.
 The Act does not rule out the payment by the tenant and acceptance by the landlord of arrears of rent before a suit for eviction is instituted resulting in waiver by the landlord of the termination of tenancy by him. [544F-H] Raja Ram Mahadev Paranjipe & Ors. v. Aba Maruti Mali & Ors.
