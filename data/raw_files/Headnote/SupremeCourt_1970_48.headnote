 The petitioner was detained under the order of the District Magistrate, Jammu passed under s. 3 (2) read with s. 5 of the Jammu & Kashmir Preventive Detention Act, 1964 on March 30, 1969. He filed a petition under Art, 32 challenging Ws detention. Later he. withdrew the original petition and with the leave of the court filed another. In this petition it was urged that the grounds of detention supplied to him were in English which he as an illiterate person did not understand; they were also not explained to him in the language understood by him. It was further urged that the grounds were vague. On behalf of the State the file relating to the detention of the petitioner was produced in court and attention was drawn to the copy off the grounds served on the petitioner at the bottom of which there was a thumb-mark alleged to be that of the petitioner and an endorsement to the effect that the grounds were explained to the detenu in Urdu. The Additional Secretary to the Government filed an affidavit in reply to the first petition andthe Under Secretary in reply to the second petition.
 
HELD : (i) It is absolutely necessary that when dealing with a detenu who cannot read or understand English language or any language at all, that the grounds of detention should be explained to him as early as possible in the language he understands so that he can avail himself of the statutory right of making a representation. To hand over to him a document written in English and to obtain. his thumb- impression on it in token of his having received the same does not comply with the requirements of the law which gives a very valuable right to the detenu to make a represen- tation. [877 B] (ii) Ile endorsement on the copy of the grounds in the original file were in different inks and therefore the document could not be taken at its face value. In the copy of the grounds filed with the affidavit on behalf of the State in reply to the first petition there was no endorsement to the effect that the contents had been explained to the detenu in Urdu. 'Me affidavit filed by the Under-Secretary in reply to the second petition could not be relied on because it bore erasures and substitution of words at a significant place. [875 H-876 C] When there was contradiction between the affidavits filed by the petitioner and by the State the Court had to determine which one was acceptable, giving all the benefit of doubt to the detenu. In the present case the affidavit of the detenu had to be preferred and it must be held that the requirement of explaining the grounds to the detenu in his own language was not complied with [875 D; 876 H] (iii) The grounds charged the petitioner with having conspired with some leaders of Democratic conference, and having incited landless people 8 73 of Rspura Tehsil to forcibly occupy the land comprised in Nandpur Mechaof RSpura Tehsil to forcibly occupy the land comprised in Nandpur Mechato evict them. No details of the leaders of the conference or of the persons incited or the dates on which he conspired or incited the squatters or the time when such conference took place were mentioned. It would be impossible for anybody to make a representation against such grounds which, on the authorities of this Court, must be' held to be vague. [877 D-E] Accordingly the detention of the- petitioner must be declared illegal.
