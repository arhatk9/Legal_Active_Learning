 Following the major awards in the engineering industries in 1948, 1950 and 1958 the petitioner company and its workmen entered into an agreement in 1958. By this agreement a scheme was established. Under this scheme a certain proportion of the production was taken to correspond to the minimum basic wages and dearness allowance fixed by the awards and this was termed as quota'. The production above the quota was paid at piece rates. But there was a 'norm' also fixed which was much higher than quota. Every workman who failed to produce the 'norm' would be considered guilty of misconduct and would be liable to be dismissed.
 The petitioner's contention was that the entire payment for production above the quota was payment of production bonus and therefore could not be taken into account for the purposes of provident fund in view of the decision of this Court in Bridge and Roof Co. Ltd. v. Union of India. It was further contended that even if the payment for production between quota and norm was not production bonus which can be taken out of the definition of basic wages in the Act it should be treated as payment in the nature of 'other similar allowances' appearing in S.2(b) (II) of the Employees Provident Fund Act, 1952. The workmen contended that the scheme in force in the petitioner company was a peculiar one which did not correspond to any standard scheme of production bonus in as much as it had two bases. It was their contention that in the scheme in question production 996 bonus started after the norm and that the payment for production between the quota and the norm was nothing more than basic wages as defined in Employees Provident Fund Act, 1952.
 Held, that straight piece rate plan was the simplest of the incentive wage plans. In such a case all payment would be basic wage as defined in s.2(b) of the Employees Provident Fund Act, 1952.
 M/s. Titaghur Paper Mills Co. Ltd. v. Its Workmen (1959) Supp. 2 S.C.R. 1012 and Bridge and Roof Co. Ltd. v. Union of India (1962) 2 L.L.J. 490, referred to.
 In the scheme of the petitioner Company however the worker cannot stop at the quota he must produce upto the norm on pain of being charged with misconduct. Therefore the real base or standard which is the core of a 1 typical production bonus scheme is, in the case of the petitioner company the norm. Any payment above the norm would be real production bonus under the present scheme and any payment upto the norm whether made in one firm or the other, is basic wage for the purpose of the Act.
 Mr. Ziakh v. Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co. Ltd. (1954)1 L.L.J. 281, distinguished.
 The payment for production between the quota and the norm having nothing of the nature of an allowance and it being a straight payment for the daily work must be included in the words defining basic wage. The portion of the payment which is made by the petitioner for production above the norm' would be production bonus and would be covered by the judgment of this Court in Bridge & Roof Company.
