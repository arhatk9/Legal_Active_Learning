 The respondent-company in Civil Appeal No. 801 of 1976 is engaged in milling wheat into wheat products in its flour mill. It commenced the construction of another building in the compound of the existing factory for the expansion of the factory and engaged workmen for such construction on daily wage basis. The appellant-Corporation called upon the respondent-company to make contribution in respect of the workmen employed for the construction work of the factory building as required by the Employees State Insurance Act, 1948.
 The respondent-company disputed its liability and filed a petition under Art. 226. A Single Judge allowing the petition took the view that the persons employed in the construction of a new unit of the factory were not employees within the meaning of the definition of the term 'employee' under s. 2(9) of the Act.
 On appeal by the appellant-Corporation, a Division Bench relying upon an earlier decision of that Court in Employees State Insurance Corporation v. Ghanambikai Mills Ltd., [1974] 2 LLJ 530 dismissed the appeal and held that construction workers being causal employees do not come within the purview of the Act.
 The connected appeals and the special leave petitions are based on similar facts and involve a common question of law.

 3. The definition of the term "employee" under s. 2(9) of the Act is very wide. It includes within it any person employed on any work incidental or preliminary to or connected with the work of the factory or establishment. It is difficult to enumerate the different types of work which may be said to be incidental or preliminary to or connected with the work of the factory or establishment. [871 B-C] 
 4. In the instant cases, the additional buildings have been constructed for the expansion of the factories in question. It is because of these additional buildings that the existing factories will be expanded and consequently, there will be increase in the production that is to say increase in the work of the factories concerned. So the work of construction of additional buildings has a link with the work of the factories. It cannot, therefore be said that the construction work has no connection with the work or the purpose of the factories. [871 C-E] 865 
 5. The expression 'work of the factory' should also be understood in the sense of any work necessary for the expansion of the factory or establishment for augmenting or increasing the work of the factory or establishment. Such work is incidental or preliminary to or connected with the work of the factory or establishment. [873 A-B]
