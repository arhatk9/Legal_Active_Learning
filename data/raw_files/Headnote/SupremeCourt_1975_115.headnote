 On July 1, 1947 the petitioner was appointed Income-Tax Officer Class II. On August 12, 1949 the petitioner was appointed Income-Tax Officer Class I Grade 11 in post-1945 vacancy reserved for candidates with war service. On January 24, 1950 a seniority list of Income-Tax Officers Class I Grade II as on January 1, 1950 was issued on the basis of 1947 Seniority Rules. The petitioner was shown in that list senior to respondents 4 to 26. The same position was reflected in a seniority list issued in 1958. The petitioner was prompted as Income Tax Officer Class I Grade I with effect from January 1, 1951 and confirmed in that post from the said date. The Rules of 1974 were revised and in supersession of them 1952 Seniority Rules were issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Income-Tax department took some time to revise the seniority list of Income-tax Officers Class I in accordance with 1952 Seniority Rules and finally on November 26, 1956 revised seniority list of Income-tax Officers Class I Grade I as on October, 1 1956, was issued. In this list respondents 4 to 26 were shown senior to the petitioner and were entitled to be promoted to higher posts earlier than the petitioner. Another seniority list of Assistant Commissioners was issued as on January 1, 1958 in conformity with the earlier list of 1956 showing the petitioner to be junior to respondents 4 to 26. By this time the petitioner and respondents 4 to 26 had all been promoted Assistant Commissioners.
 This Court in Karnik's case 78 I.T.R. 243 held that the following principles emerge from 1952 Rules for determining the seniority. (i) Between Income-tax officers promoted at the same meeting, their seniority inter se will be reflected in the list of Assistant Commissioners of Income-tax; (ii) Between an officer promoted earlier and another officer senior to him but who was not considered in the meeting when the former was promoted, seniority in the list of Income-tax Officers will be reflected in the higher cadre; (iii) Where the senior officer was considered and not promoted, and the junior officer was promoted at that meeting, the order of promotion will govern seniority in the higher grade and (iv) Where senior officer is promoted and confirmed and at a later meeting a junior officer is promoted, the latter cannot claim to be placed above the senior officer in the higher cadre relying upon the circumstance that he could not be considered for promotion at the earlier meeting, because he had not to his credit the qualifying minimum service. In pursuance of the above judgment of this Court, seniority of Income-tax Assistant Commissioners promoted before April 1, 1964 was recast and new seniority list was issued on February 1, 1971. The petitioner filed this writ petition challenging the seniority list of Additional Commissioners of Income-tax as on February 1, 1971 circulated by the Government of India, Ministry ,of Finance.
 It was contended on behalf of the petitioner that, as he was promoted Assistant Commissioner on August 19, 1955 while respondents 4 to 26 were promoted to that post subsequent to that date, the petitioner should be shown senior to those respondents.
 410 Rejecting the contention and dismissing the writ petition.
 
HELD : (i) The fact that the petitioner was promoted as Assistant Commissioner prior to respondents 4 to 26 would not make him senior to respondents 4 to 26 because according to the seniority list issued on the basis of 1952 Seniority Rules the above mentioned respondents were senior to the petitioner. The seniority of the petitioner vis-a-vis respondents 4 to 26 has to be determined in the light of proposition No. 2 laid down by this Court in Karniks case, according to which between an officer promoted earlier and another officer senior to him, but who was not considered in the meeting when the former was promoted, seniority in the list of Income-tax Officers will be reflected in the higher cadre. As respondents 4 to 26 were admittedly shown senior to the petitioner in the list as on October 1, 1956 prepared ill accordance with 1952 Rules, their seniority qua the petitioner would be reflected in the higher cadre of Assistant Commissioner. [412 GH] (ii) It has not been shown that the names of respondents 4 to 26 were also considered in the meeting wherein a decision was taken to promote the petitioner as Assistant Commissioner. Assuming that a decision to promote respondents 4 to 26 to the posts of Assistant Commissioners was taken at the same meeting in which it was decided to promote the petitioner, in that event proposition No. 1 in Karnik's case would be attracted. Even in such a contingency the seniority of respondents 4 to 26 qua the petitioner would be reflected in the list of Assistant Commissioners. In the seniority list of Assistant Commissioners issued in 1958, the petitioner was shown junior to respondents 4 to 26 in conformity with the seniority list of 1956. In the matter of confirmation to the post of Assistant Commissioner, six out of respondents 4 to 26 confirmed earlier then the petitioner. while the rest of them were confirmed at the same time as the petitioner.
 The impugned list of seniority circulated in 1971 merely reflected the seniority of the petitioner qua respondents 4 to 26 as determined in 1956. [412 H, 413 A-C] S.K. Ghosh & Anr. v. union of India & Ors., [1968] INSC 87; [1968] 3 SCR 631 referred to.
 
HELD FURTHER-(iii) The seniority of the petitioner qua respondents 4 to 26 was determined as long ago as 1956 in accordance with 1952 Rules. The said seniority was reiterated in the seniority list issued in 1958. The present writ petition was filed in 1971. No satisfactory explanation has been furnished by the petitioner for the inordinate delay in approaching the court. It is no doubt true that he made a representation against the seniority list issued in 1956 and 1958 but the representation was rejected in 1961. No cogent ground has been shown as to why the petitioner became quiescent and took no diligent steps to obtain redress. The petitioner, therefore, cannot be allowed to challenge the seniority list after lapse of so many years. [413EFGH]
