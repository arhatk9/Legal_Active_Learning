 Purporting to act under the provisions of Income-tax Act, 1961, the Additional Personal Assistant to the Collector, who was functioning as the tax recovery officer issued notices to the appellants prohibiting them from transferring or otherwise dealing with the properties in their possession on the basis of 22 certificates issued to them under the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 and the Income- tax Act, 1961 because arrears of income tax were due from the deceased assessee. The appellants who claimed that the properties were gifted to them by the deceased assessee, questioned (i) the jurisdiction of the Tax Recovery officer, as also his competence to the issue of recovery proceedings under the 1961 Act, because the taxes became due under the Travancore Income tax Act and 1922 Act; (ii) and the issue of 22 certificates on the ground that neither the Travancore Act nor the 1961 Act warranted the issue of certificates against an assessees after his death. The appellants prayed for the issue of writs of mandamus, certiorari and prohibition.
 The High Court dismissed the petitions.
 Dismissing the appeals, ^ 
 HELD: (1)(a) The orders sought to be quashed were only notices of commencement of recovery proceedings by attachment of certain properties. Final orders could only be passed after the appellants have had their opportunities to object under r.11 of the Second Schedule to 1961 Act because the notices purported to be only preliminary notices under r. 48 of the Second Schedule to the 1961 Act. These proceedings could only be quashed if they were entirely without jurisdiction. Otherwise a prayer for quashing the proceedings would obviously be premature. [684 E-F] (b) No occasion for the issue of writ of mandamus could arise unless the appellants showed non-compliance with some mandatory provision and seek to get that provision enforced because some obligation towards them is not carried out by the authority alleged to be flouting the law. [684 F-G] (c) The appellants have asked for writs of prohibition.
 The existence of an alternative remedy is not generally a bar to the issuance of such a writ or order. But, in order to substantiate a right to obtain a writ of prohibition from a High Court or from this court, an application has to demonstrate total absence of jurisdiction to proceed on the part of the officer or authority complained against. It is not enough if a wrong section or provision of law is cited in a notice or order if the power to proceed is actually there under another provision. [684 H] (2) The appellants not having raised the question at any earlier stage that the Additional Personal Assistant to the Collector was not an officer authorised to issue notices, could not do so in appeal to this Court. Even if the Peshkar was the competent officer under the Travancore Income tax Act. his duties as tax recovery officer would by operation of the various provisions of law contained in s.8(1) of the General Clause Act. s.13(1) of the Finance Act 1950, s.2(44), and s.221 of the 1961 Act, automatically devolve upon the Collector or Additional Collector or upon such officer as may be empowered 13-L925 SupCI/75.
 682 by the State Government by a special or general notification in the official gazette to effect recovery of land revenue or other public demand under any law relating to land revenue or other public demand. [688 A; 687 H] (3) If any part of the property is illegally or unjustiably attached, it does not really affect the jurisdiction of the Tax Recovery Officer to proceed to deal with an objection under r.11 in Schedule 2 of the 1961 Act.
