 The respondents, carrying on mining operations, were using dumpers and shovels which were registered as `Motor Vehicles' under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939. They were paying tax thereon under the Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1965. subsequently, they stopped paying tax on the ground that they were paying tax thereon under a mistaken belief that they were motor vehicles. The orders and notices requiring the respondents to pay the taxes were challenged by them. The Judicial Commissioner, Goa, without drawing any distinction between dumpers and shovels, held that when dumpers and shovels were being solely on the premises of the owner, they have to be excluded from the purivew of the Taxation Act since public roads were not being used by those vehicles. Against the order of the Judicial Commissioner, Union of India filed appeals in this Court.
 Allowing the appeals and setting aside the orders of the Judicial Commissioiner, this Court, 
 HELD : 1. Dumpers are vehicles used for transport of goods and thus liable to pay a compensatory tax for the availability of roads for them to run upon. The mere fact that dumpers were used solely on the premises of the owner, or that they were in closed premises, or permission of the Authorities was needed to move them from one place to another, or that they are not intended to be used or are incapable of being used for general purposes, or that they have an unladen and laden capacity depending on their weight and size, is of no consequence. The impugned orders and notices issued by the appellants-officers to the respondents are valid and 993 enfoceable in accordance with law. [977 E-F, H] 
 2. Under section 4 of the Taxation Act, tax is to be paid for "keeping for use a motor vehicles", be one the owner thereof or not. It is the keeping of the motor vehicle for use which attracts taxation. Keeping the motor vehicle for use in the context is for use on public roads of the State.
 
 3. So far as the case of shovels is concerned, there is no definite material on the pleadings of teh parties to conclude that besides theri weight and size, what is their overhang and what is the nature of its wheels, by means of which it would transport goods or passengers so as to attract liability to taxation. When the view of the Judicial Commissioner in treating dumpers and shovels at par, has been upset insofar as dumpers are concerned, it is prudent that his view about shovels also is upset and the matter is remitted back for reconsideration by the High Court.
