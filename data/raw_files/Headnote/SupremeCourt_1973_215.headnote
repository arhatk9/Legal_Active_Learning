 Owing to the very low cotton crop there was unprecedented and phenomenal rise in cotton prices and there was a perceptible drop in yarn production. Early in 1973 the yarn prices showed an upward trend in the fine and super fine counts. The power-loom and hand-loom sectors which produced 
47.1 percent of the total cloth production in the country' depended for the supply of raw material yarn on textile mills. Two thirds of-the total yarn produced came from composite mills. The composite mills competed with handloom and power-loom sectors in the production of cloth. Even though the question of control and fixation of fair price of cotton textiles had received the attention of the Government in the past pursuant to the recommendations of the Tariff Commission and the Tariff Board, no control over the production and sale of yam was imposed until March, 1973 when the Government decided to bring yarn under control in all respects, viz., prices, production and distribution and- issued the two impugned notifications. The first notification was issued by the Textile Commissioner under clause 22 of the Cotton Textile (Control) Order, 1948. The notification determined the ex-factory price of count of yarn of 59s and below and count of yarn 60s and above. In the case of count of yarn of 59s and below the price was to be the highest ex-mill price or the highest contracted price for delivery effected in December, 1972. In the case of producers of yarn situated in States of Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry where the electricity cut exceeded 70% the relevant price as applicable was to be increased by 6 per cent. In the case of counts of yarn 60s and above the determined price was the regulated yarn price adopted for individual producers of yam from the 1st day of August 1972, increased by 6 per cent where there was no electricity power cut, and further increased according to the percentage of electricity cut. The term 'regulated price' under the notification meant the price calculated by taking the difference between the highest contract price as on June 1, 1972 or the nearest date in case no sale was effected on June 1, 1972 and the highest price for the relevant count and form of packing during January, 1972 and allowing one half of the difference to be reduced from June 1, 1972 price. By a notification dated March 31, 1973, the Textile Commissioner authorised the Deputy Commissioners and the District Collectors to specify the maximum price of yarn to be sold by dealers. The maximum price was to be fixed after taking into consideration (a) invoice prior of yarn(b) incidental charges (c) such reasonable marginal profit not exceeding 2 percent of the invoice price as the Deputy Commissioner or the District Collector may determine in each case, and (d) any other relevant factor. The notification was not applicable to yam sold to hosiery industry and to yarn on beams delivered under specified circumstances. The second impugned notification was made by the Textile Commis- sioner in exercise of powers conferred under cl. 30(1)(b) of the 1948 order.- 399 The notification directed that no producer of yarn for civil consumption shall sell or deliver any such yarn produced by him except to such person or persons and subject to such conditions as the Textile Commissioner might specify. The_ same notification contained another direction under powers conferred by cl. 30(1) (a) of the 1948 order that every producer of yarn for civil consumption shall sell or deliver such yarn only to five channels of distribution mentioned therein on the basis of the directions that might be issued from time to time by the Textile Commissioner. Those five channels were (a) the nominees of the State Government; (b) the Handloom Export Promotion Council Madras; (c) the Cotton Textile Export Promotion Council, Bombay; (d) the Federation of Hosiery Manufacturers Association of India, Bombay; and any other person as may be nominated by the Textile Commissioner in this behalf. The order of distribution through channels was made inapplicable by successive notifications to yarn counts of 40s and below. However control was imposed in such cases by another notification at the point of sale by a dealer of yarn to consumer by providing that every dealer shall sell or deliver yarn only to persons therein in such quantities as may be determined by the Deputy Commissioner or the District Collector.
 In a petition under article 32 of the Constitution of India the petitioners questioned the validity of the two notifications on the following grounds : (1) the 1948 Order in so far as it purported to make provisions ill respect of control and distribution of cotton yarn by fixation of prices, more particularly by clauses 22 and 30 thereof, was ultra vires the powers conferred on the Central Government by s. 3 of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946, inasmuch as cotton yarn was not covered by the item "Cotton and Woollen textiles" and could not be brought within any other item; (ii) in any event the provisions of the 1948 Order relating to cotton yarn could not be said to have been continued in force either under s. 16 of the Essential Commodities Ordinance, 1955, or under s. 16(2) of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, as cotton yarn is not covered the item "cotton and woollen textiles" under s.
 2(a)(iv.) of the 1955 Act and no notification had been issued declaring cotton yarn as an essential commodity in exercise of the powers conferred under S. 2(a) (xi) of the 1955 Act; (iii) on a true construction of S. 3 of the Essen- tial Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946 the power to issue orders in respect of essential commodities having been conferred to ensure their availability at fair price such orders cannot validly confer arbitrary powers on the executive to fix prices of essential commodities unrelated to the cost of production and reasonable margin of, profit;
 in particular, yarn price control had not followed the pattern of price control for cloth by providing for periodic changes in the control price to allow for fluctuations in cost elements; sub sections (3), 3(A), (3B), and (3C) of section 3 of Essential Commodities Act, 1955 constituted a single scheme and that what is implicit in sub section (3) is made explicit in sub section (3C); (iv) if provisions of the Cotton Textiles Contra Order conferred arbitrary power on the Textile Commissioner to fix prices for yarn unrelated to the cost of production and reasonable profits to the producer then the provision becomes void by reason of infringement of fundamental rights guarenteed by Art.(1)(f)and (g) and 31 as well as Article 301 of the Constitution; (v) if the 1948 Order did not authorise fixation of price of cotton yarn arbitrarily and without reference to relevant factors such as cost of production and reasonable return, the impugned notifications which fixed a price for yarn, below the cost of production of the mills are ultra vires the Cotton Textiles Control Order 1948, inasmuch as the prices fixed under the notifications were not based on relevant considerations such is cost of production, reasonable return, but were wholly arbitrary and based on irrelevant considerations; and (vi) the provisions of the second impugned notification regarding channelisation. of, yarn distribution was arbitrary and also created monopoly in favour of specified persons violating articles 19(1)(f) and (g) and 301 of the Constitution.
 A preliminary objection was raised on behalf of the State that the petitions were not competent because of the Proclamation of Emergency. Dismissing the petitions, 400 
HELD The petitions are competent. If it can be shown that the executive action taken during the emergency has no authority as a valid law its constitutionality can be challenged. The Cotton Textiles (Control) Order 1948 was continued by Essential Commodities Act 1955. The impugned orders are made under pre-emergency Cotton Textile Control Order. The validity of the impugned orders is challenged under articles 19(1)(f) and (g) of the Constitution on the ground that it is a pre-emergency executive order which could have been challenged under Article 1 9 (1 ) (f ) and (g) before the proclamation of emergency. From the point of view the petitions are competent though the challenge is insupportable. [428E-F] Bennett Coleman & Co. case [1972] 2 S.C.R. 788, referred to.
 (i)Cotton yarn is included in cotton textiles. Yarn is the material or component with which cotton textile is manufactured or woven. The setting in which the words 'Cotton textile' are used has a legislative and executive understanding of the words consistently over a period of time. The legislative practice shows that cotton textile is a generic term which includes cotton fabric and yarn. One of the methods of construction of statutes is to ascertain the setting and circumstances; in which the words are used.

 (ii)The 1948 Order continued under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. Since cotton yarn is included in cotton textiles it was not necessary to issue any notification declaring cotton yarn as an essential commodity under s. 2(a) (xi) of the 1955 Act. The notification dated March 13, 1973, required an explanation to say that yarn for the purpose of notification shall mean all cotton yarn except sewing thread and industrial yam like tyre cord.
 This explanation was necessary to include all cotton Yarn because the decentralised sector was facing severe yarn shortage. [412C] The Lotus Industrials, Kallai, Malabar v.

 (iii)(iv) (v). Control over price and distribution of yam is in the interest of the general public. Handloom and powerloom industries require protection and, therefore, controlover the price and distribution of yarn is in the interest of the general public.[416D] Just as the industrycannot complain of rise and fall of prices due to economic factors in an openmarket, they cannot s imilarly complain of increase or reduction of prices as a result of notification under s. 3(1) of the Essential Supplies Act, 1955, because, that increase or reduction is also based on economic factors. If fair price is to be fixed leaving a reasonable margin of profit there is never any question of infringement of fundamental right to carry on business. The question of fair price to the consumer with reference to the dominant object and purpose of the legislation claiming equitable distribution and availability at fair price is completely lost sight of if profit and the producer's return are kept in the forefront.
 The maintenance or increase of supplies of the commodity or the equitable distribution and availability at fair prices are the fundamental purposes of the Act. , If the prices of yarn or cloth are fixed in such a way as to enable the manufacturer. or producer recover his cost of production and secure a reasonable margin of profit, no aspect of infringement of fundamental right can be said to arise. In determining the reasonableness of restrictions imposed by law in the field of industry, trade or commerce, the mere fact that some of those who are engaged in these are, alleging loss after the imposition of the law will not render the law unreasonable. By its very nature, industry or trade or commerce goes through periods of prosperity and adversity on account of economic and, sometimes, social and political factors. [419H; 42OA-C] 401 When controls have to be introduced to ensure availability of consumer goods at a fair price it is an impracticable proposition to require the government to go through the exercise like that of a commission to fix the prices A,.
 commission cannot always make a correct estimate of a price which is fair to all- because. there are intricacies in the trade of all profit making enterprises which a commission may not be able to probe. [420C] When available stocks go underground and the Government has to step into control distribution and availability in public interest, fixing of price can be only empirical.
 "Reasonable restriction connotes that the limitation imposed on a person in enjoyment of the right should not be arbitrary or of an excessive nature beyond what is required in the interest of the public. In the present case the legislative measures have left the question of resolving the economic problems of increasing supplies, equitable distribution and availability of essential commodities at fair prices to the judgment of the statutory authorities.
 [420E-F] The power to fix controlled price is in Section 3 (2) (c) read with s. 3 (1) and not in s. 3(3) of the 1955 Act. The controlled price fixed under s. 3(1) read with s. 3 (2) (c) is different from price under sub-section (3A) 1 (3B) and (3C). [421-G] The control of prices may have effect either on maintaining or increasing supply of commodity or securing equitable distribution and availability at fair prices. The controlled price has to retain this equilibrium in the supply and demand of the commodity. The cost of production and a reasonable return to. the producer of the commodity are to be taken into account. The producer must have an incentive to produce. The fair price must be fair not only from the point of view of the consumer but also from the point of view of the producer. In fixing the prices, a price line has to be held in order to give preference or predominant consideration to the interest of the consumer or the general public over that of the producer in respect of essential commodities. The aspect of ensuring availability of the essential commodities to the consumer equitably and at fair price is the most important consideration. The produce should not be driven out of his producing business.
 He may have to bear loss in the same way as he does when he suffers losses on account of economic forces operating on the business. There is no justification that the producer should be given the benefit of price increase attributable to boarding or cornering or artificial short supply. In such a case, if an "escalation" in price is. contemplated at intervals the object of controlled price may be stultified.
 Any restriction in excess of what would be necessary in the interest of general public or to remedy the evil has to be very carefully considered that the producer does. not perish and the consumer is not crippled. [422F-H; 423A-B] In the present case the controlled price fixed reflects costs of production and,, reasonable return. The mere suggestion that no provision is made for adjustment on account of changes in the cost of production does not amount to infringement of fundamental right to carry on business and to hold and dispose of property. There is no material to show that increase in yam prices was on account of cost of production. The fixing of controlled price is much more than a fair price to the producer on the date it is fixed.
 The prices of new cotton crop, that is for September. 1973 to August, 1974 are not known at the time of the fixation of price. Even when they are known the petitioners will have to show with reference to the different types of mixes used in producing yarn, the impact of cotton prices on the cost of production of that category of yam. Further, even if there is increase in the cotton prices, the petitioners can absorb it because the controlled price fixed is more fair to the producer. If he-, sustains alleged losses for some time, it will be a reasonable restriction, because the object of the price control is to hold the price line or revert the prices to normal levels and make available cotton yarn to the handloom and powerloom weavers at a fair price which will enable them to withstand competition from mill made cloth. It is not shown that the controlled price is so grossly inadequate that it not only results in huge losses but also in a threat to the supply position of yarn. The controlled price is in the interest of the country as a whole for just distribution of basic necessities. The controlled price is, therefore, neither arbitrary nor an unreasonable restriction.

 (vi ) By the channelisation of yarn distribution what is sought to be achieved is price control as well as distribution control to meet the problems of avail.ability of goods at reasonable prices. The contention that the distribution channels are monopolies in favour of specified persons is unsound. The channels of distribution are agencies of the State and associations of users of cotton yarn. The requirement not to sell yarn at a price above the maximum price operates on all distributing channels. The distribution control is intended to ensure availability of yarn at reasonable or fair price. It is not that all dealers in yarn have been denied the right to carry on trade. It is denied only to those whose carrying on trade in yarn would not, in the opinion of the Textile Commissioner, ensure availability of yarn to actual consumers at the fair price. Elimination of persons who have hoarded or cornered or are unscrupulous in distribution is intended in public interest. This is a reasonable restriction in the interest of general public and is contemplated in Article 19(6) of the Constitution. [426C-G] Rashbihari Panda v. State of Orissa.
