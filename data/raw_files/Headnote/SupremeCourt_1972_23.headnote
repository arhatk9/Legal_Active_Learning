 The petitioner was arrested on May 11, 1971, under s. 3 of the West Bengal (Prevention of Violent Activities) Act, 1970. His case was placed before the Advisory Board and the Board submitted its report to the State Government on July 12, 1971 that there was sufficient cause for the peti- tioner's detention. The State Government confirmed the order of detention on August 17, 1971.
 In a petition under Art. 32, 
HELD : The detention was illegal, since the State Government confirmed the detention order beyond three months from the date of detention.
 Article 22(4) has specified three months as the maximum period of initial detention and detention for a longer period can only be made on the basis of the report of the Advisory Board. Under ss. 12 and 13 of the Act, the State Government has power to detain a person beyond a period of 3 months but limited to a period of one year, on the basis of the opinion of the Board that there is sufficient cause for detention. When the State Government receives the opinion, it has the option either to confirm or not the detention order. It would not be necessary to confirm the detention if the Government wants to continue the detention only for the period of three months. When s. 12(1) speak of 'and continue the detention of the person concerned for such period as it thinks fit', it can only mean continuance of the detention from the point of time at which the detention would become illegal if the order of detention is not confirmed, namely, the expiry of three months from the date of detention. If that he so, the order of detention must be confirmed before the expiry of the three months. [168G;
