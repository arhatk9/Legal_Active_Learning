 Six persons were tried in the Court of Addl. Sessions Judge in connection with the death of the victim. The trial Court acquitted 3 but convicted 2 under Sec. 304 Part II read with s. 34 I.P.C. and the other one was convicted under 323 I.P.C. and they were sentenced accordingly.
 Two cross appeals were, thereafter, filed-one by the convicts challenging their conviction and the other by the State praying that the convictions of the 3 accused be under s. 302 read with s. 34, I.P.C. The High Court acquitted one of them but convicted the other two under s. 302 read with S. 34 I.P.C. and sentenced them to undergo imprisonment for life and hence the appeal before this Court.
 The prosecution, in support of its case, examined two sets of eye witnesses. The evidence of one set consisted of the testimony of three eye witnesses. The trial court, did not place any reliance upon their testimony nor upon the dying declaration. The other eye witness upon whose testimony the prosecution and the trial court placed reliance was P.W. 14, who professed to be working with the deceased at the time of occurrence.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : The function of the Court in a Criminal Trial is to find whether the person arraigned before it is guilty of the offence with which he is charged. For this purpose, the Court scans the material on record to find whether there is any reliable and trust 'worthy evidence upon the basis of which it is possible to convict the accused and to hold that he is guilty of the offence with which he is charged. If in a case, the prosecution leads two sets of evidence, each one of which contradict and strikes at the other and shows it to be unreliable. the conviction cannot be sustained.
