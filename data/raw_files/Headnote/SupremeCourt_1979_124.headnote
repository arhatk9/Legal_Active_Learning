 The petitioner was convicted and sentenced under Sections 366 and 368 Penal code to three years' rigorous imprisonment on each count for the offences of abduction, seduction and sale of girls to others. In appeal, the High Court confirmed the said order of conviction under Section 366 I.P.C. but set aside the conviction under Section 368 ibid.
 Dismissing the special leave petition, the Court ^ 
 HELD: It is an insulting stultification of the amelioratory legislation viz. Probation of Offenders Act to extend its considerate provisions to such anti-social specialist criminals, as in this case, where the petitioner an abominable culprit with sufficient expertise in the art of abduction seduction and sale of girls, descended in a taxi cab, kidnapped the young woman and when she cried out administered the potion which rendered her unconscious and by a well-laid out plan took her from the small town in Bihar to Dhanbad and from there, via Delhi to Haryana and lodged her in a house for obvious immoral purposes.[82C-E]
