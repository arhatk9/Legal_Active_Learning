 In respect of the goods supplied by the assessee the Government of India paid the price by cheques. The cheques drawn on the- Reserve Bank of India, at Bombay, were received by the assessee at Jaipur, outside the taxable territories. On the question whether the amounts repre- sented by the cheques, cashed at Bombay, were taxable in the hands of the assessee under the Income-tax Act, 1922, the High Court, on reference, held that the mere fact that the cheques were realised at Bombay was of no consquence and that in the particular circumstances of the case since the cheques were 'received by the assessee outside the taxable territory the amounts covered by the cheques were received by the assessee at that place. In dealing with the contention of the revenure that the assessee must be considered to have received the cheques at Delhi where they were posted, the High Court accepted the finding recorded by the Appellate Tribunal in its supplementary statement that the revenue failed to establish the fact of posting of cheques at Delhi. The High Court also recorded a finding that the revenue failed to place any material before the Tribunal to prove that the cheques were being sent by the Government of India through post.
 The revenue filed applications before the High Court for grant of certificate for appeal to this Court. The learned Judges who dealt with these applications were different from those who dealt with the main reference. Two alternate grounds were urged viz., (1) the payments by cheques were not made at Jaipur where the cheques were received, but at Bombay where they were cashed and (ii) the cheques were posted at Delhi and as the post office acted as the agent of the assessee the payment was made at Delhi. On the first ground the High Court held that in view of the decisions of this Court no substantial question of law remained to be decided; but, granted certificate to appeal on the second ground. It held that the question of law which really arose was whether a presumption could be drawn under the circumstances of the case that the cheques were sent by the Government by post or whether the fact of sending the cheques by post had to be positively proved by the Revenue.
 The court also observed that the general question whether a Presumption under s. 114 illustration (f) of the Evidence Act could be raised in circumstances such as those presented by the case was likely to arise in many future cases not restricted to income-tax.
 In this Court a preliminary objection was raised as to the maintainability of the appeals on the ground that the certificates granted by the High Court were not proper. It was urged that the High Court erred in ignoring the specific findings recorded by the Tribunal, and accepted by the learned Judges. answering the reference, that the Revenue placed no evidence before it to show that the cheques were posted at Delhi, and, therefore, there was no question of any presumption arising under s. 114 91 7 illustration (f) of the Evidence Act. Setting aside the order of the High Court granting the certificate, 
HELD : (i) In circumstances like the present case the jurisdiction of the court at the stage of dealing with application for grant of certificate is limited only to considering whether any substantial question of law arises having due regard to the material on record and the discussion on facts and law contained in the judgment of the High Court which dealt with the appeal or reference or any other proceeding as the case may be., [924 E] (ii)On the findings recorded by the Appellate Tribunal and by the High Court no question of applying any presumption under s. 114 of the Evidence Act arises for consideration.
 The learned Judges, dealing with the application for grant of certificates, had no jurisdiction to go behind the finding recorded in the original judgment disposing of the reference. [925 F] (iii)This Court should not be invited to decide any question of law much less substantial question of law, purely in the abstract. The question of law must reasonably arise on the basis of the material on record. [924 H] (iv)Regarding the question that the assessee may be considered to have received the payments at Bombay the learned Judges rightly declined to grant a certificate.
