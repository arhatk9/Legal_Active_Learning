 The respondent was sentenced to death by the Additional Sessions Judge for double murder. He did not file any appeal. The trial Judge made a reference to the High Court, for confirmation of death sentence. Two advocates were appointed Amicus Cuiae to defend the respondent. After interview with the respondent the advocates reported to the High Court that the respondent appeared to be insane. He was examined by a Medical Board consisting of 3 Psychiatrists. According to the Medical Board he was not capable of rational thinking or behaviour. The High Court came to, the conclusion that the respondent was clearly of unsound mind. The High Court, therefore, postponed the proceedings in the confirmation case. On appeal to this Court by State, it was contended;
 (1)The provision regarding postponing the proceedings if an accused is found to be of unsound mind as contained in section 465 of the Criminal Procedure Code is confined to the trial stage and does not apply to the proceedings before the High Court on reference as the same are post-trial proceedings.
 (2)In proceedings on reference under section 334 the accused has no right of audience before the High Court.
 (3) The High Court was wrong in delegating its powers to determine whetherthe responder, was of unsound mind to the Medical Board.
 
HELD : (i) As far as an accused person sentenced to death is concerned, his trial does not conclude with termination of the proceedings in the Court of Session, since the death sentence passed by the Court of Session is subject to confirmation by the High Court, the trial cannot be deemed to have concluded till an executable sentence is passed by a competent court. The confirmation proceedings are in substance a continuation of the trial. Expression ,.at his trial". occurring in section 465 hoes to be liberally construed in a manner which is not repugnant to the fundamental principles of natural justice. [579D-E; 58OD-B ] (2) In confirmation proceedings the High Court cannot arbitrarily refuse to hearthe accused either in person or through counsel. It is wrong to state that theHigh Court accepted the ipse dixit of the medical experts.These experts.gave detailed and cogent reasons in support of their opinion.The High Court meticulously considered their evidence and thereafter recorded its own findings on the crucial issues.
