 The Dholpur State was one of the States which merged to form the United States of Rajasthan. Article XII of the Covenant entered into among the Rulers of the several States provided that the Ruler of each covenanting State shall be entitled to the full ownership, use and enjoyment of all private properties belonging to him, and Art. XIV provided. that succession according to law and custom, to the gaddi of such covenanting State, and to the personal rights, privileges, dignities and titles of the Ruler were guaranteed.
 On the death of the last Ruler of Dholpur in 1954 without any male issue, a controversy, as to who was entitled to the rulership, arose between the petitioner, who was a senior member of a collateral branch, and the son adopted by the widow of the last ruler. The Government of India con- stituted a Committee consisting of the Chief Justice of the Rajasthan High Court and the Rulers of two other merging States to examine the rival contentions. The petitioner took part in the proceedings before the Committee, relied on Art. XIV of the Covenant, and disputed the jurisdiction of the Committee to go into the question. The Committee submitted its report and the President of India recognised the adopted son as the Ruler of Dholpur, under Art. 366(22) of the Constitution.
 On the question of the validity of such recognition, 
HELD : (1) Under Art. 366 the power of the President to re- cognise a Ruler is inherent in the Article. The words 'for the time being is recognised by the President' in the Article, are used not only in relation to a Ruler but also in relation to a successor of such Ruler. [636 C-E] (2) Such an act of recognition is an exercise of political power by the President. It is a matter of personal status, and not of inheritance or of descent by devolution, nor is it based only on covenants and treaties. The covenants ceased to be effective after the enactment of the Constitution in so far as they were inconsistent with the Constitution. [637 B-C] (3) The power to recognise a Ruler which is conferred on the President by the Constitution cannot be challenged on the ground that the power is unguided. It was in fact exercised by appointing a committee to examine the rival claims. Whatever rights the petitioner asserted in regard to succession were the subject matter of enquiry by the Committee. If the petitioner sought to rely on Art. XIV of the Covenant, he had to establish such a right based on custom or law before the appropriate authority. Under Art, 363 a dispute arising out of such recognition by virtue of a Covenant is not justiciable in a court of law. [636 E-H; 637 A-B] (4) The right to private property is not embraced within Art. 366(22), and the President's notification recognising the Ruler did not state that the Ruler thereby became entitled to private properties of the late Ruler, 632 nor did it affect 'any private property in the possession of the petitioner. It only recognised the right to succeed to the gaddi of the Ruler. Such recognition entitles the Ruler to the enjoyment of the privy purse and the personal rights, privileges and diginities of the Ruler of an Indian State.
 But the payment of any sum as privy purse is from the consolidated fund of India and, the privy purse is not an item of private property to which the Ruler succeeds.
 Therefore, there is no infringment of the petitioner's rights under Art. 19(1)(f) or Art. 31 by any executive flat.
 [635 E-H; 636 A-B; 637 D] (5) Nor did such recognition instantaneously invest the Ruler with property on the basis that rulership and property were blended together. If the petitioner bad any competing rights with the Ruler in relation to any private property of the last Ruler, of which the Ruler came into possession after his recognition by the President, such a claim is not a fundamental right, nor was it established in any court of law. [637 F-H, 638 A-B]
