 The Special Judge, after a very thorough and careful assessment of the whole evidence in the case, had come to the conclusion that the prosecution case against the appellant was established beyond reasonable doubt and convicted him under sections 120B as well as 161 read with s. 34 I.P.C. and also under sections 5(1)(d) and 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. The High Court dismissed the appellant's appeal summarily without giving any reasons.
 Dismissing the appeal to this' Court, 
HELD : (1) It is necessary for the High Courts, even when they dismiss criminal appeals summarily on facts found, to record the reasons briefly. It is often difficult in a criminal case to say whether any material error was committed by the trial court in arriving at its findings of fact without atleast some examination and consideration of the main features of the evidence which only a reasoned order would disclose. [851 E-G] (2)An examination of the evidence by this Court, because of such summary dismissal, however, shows that the findings of the trial court must be up-held. it must be deemed that the High Court had affirmed the findings of the trial Court when it dismissed the appeal summarily, and therefore, there is no reason to depart from the general rule that this Court will not interfere with concurrent findings of fact except under very exceptional circumstances.
