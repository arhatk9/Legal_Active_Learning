 Allowing the petitions, the Court ^ 
 HELD: (1) Undoubtedly, the error or omission was on the part of the Regional Transport Authority in the instant case, in not supplying full information to the Special Secretary about all the valid permits in force at the relevant time and which were either to be curtailed or cancelled consequent upon the approval of the scheme. This error or omission on the part of the Regional Transport Authority has resulted in gross discrimination between the transport operators in the same class in that some have their permits remaining intact with right to ply their vehicles on the notified route and some others whose permits are curtailed. When discrimination is glaring the State cannot take recourse to inadvertence in its action resulting in discrimination. [237 D-E & 238 B-C] (2) Conceding that this was discrimination unconsciously indulged into by inadvertence or oversight on the part of a governmental agency, the error should be rectified. To reject the whole scheme would be destructive of a wholesome effort towards nationalisation of bus transport which is generally undertaken in public interest.
 In this case denial of equal protection, complained off flows from State action and has a direct impact on the fundamental rights of the petitioners. A constructive approach by removing the discrimination by putting the present petitioners in the same class as those who have enjoyed favourable treatment by inadvertence on the part of the Regional Transport Authority will meet the ends of justice. The benefit of this order would be available, if and only if, the petitioners have valid permits for operating stage carriage and if such permits are there, they would be without restriction for operating on that part of the route of each of the petitioners which overlaps with the notified route but it would be open to the Regional Transport Authority to impose corridor restrictions; so, however, that such restriction does not suffer from the defect of discrimination which is found to be constitutional.
