 The appellants were convicted of an offence under s. 379 of the Indian penal Code by a full bench of the Gram Cutcherry constituted under the provisions of the Bihar Panchayat Raj Act, 1947. It was contended for the appellants that the conviction was bad on the grounds, inter alia, that s. 62 of the Act which provided for the criminal jurisdiction of Gram Cutcherries gave concurrent jurisdiction to the ordinary criminal Courts and left it open to a party to go either to the ordinary criminal Courts or to a bench of the Gram Cutcherry, and as the procedure followed in the ordinary criminal Courts was substantially different from that followed by a Gram Cutcherry, the Act was discriminatory in nature and as such infringed Art. 14 of the Constitution.
 Held, that the impugned provisions of the Act are not discriminatory in nature.
 The scheme of the Act is that a case or suit cognizable under the Act by a Gram Cutcherry should be tried only by it unless the Sub-Divisional Magistrate or the Munsif concerned chooses to take action under s. 70 or S. 73 of the Act. The 996 reference to concurrent jurisdiction in s. 62 is explainable by reason of the provisions in ss. 69, 7o and 73, so that on the transfer or withdrawal of a case from the Gram Cutcherry or the cancellation of the jurisdiction of the bench, it may not be said that the ordinary criminal Courts also have no jurisdiction to try it.
