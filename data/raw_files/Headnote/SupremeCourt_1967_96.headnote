 Sales-tax under s. 8 of the Central Sales-tax Act at the rate of 7% was imposed on assessee's sales, for which declaration forms 'C' was filed after the prescribed date but before the order of assessment was made. The assessee filed a writ petition against the assessment, which the High Court allowed. In appeal, this Court, Held: The third proviso to Rule 6(1) of the Central Sales Tax (Kerala) Rules, is ultra vires of s. 9(4) read with s.
 13(3) and (4) of the Central Sales Tax Act. The phrase "in the prescribed manner" occurring in s. 8(4) of the Act only confers power on the rule making authority to prescribe a rule stating what particulars are to be mentioned in the prescribed form, the nature and value of the goods sold, the parties to whom they are sold, and to which authority the form is to be furnished. But the phrase "in the prescribed manner" in s. 8(4) does not take in the time-element. In other words, the section does not authorise the rule-making authority to prescribe a time-limit within which the de- claration is to be filed by the 'registered dealer. This view is supported by the language of s. 13(4) (g) of the Act which states that the State Government may make rules for "the time within which, the manner in which and the authorities to whom any change in the ownership of any business or in the name, place or nature of any business carried on by any dealer shall be furnished." This makes it clear that the Legislature was conscious of the fact that the expression "in the manner" would de note only the mode in which an act was to be done, and if any time limit was to be prescribed for the doing of the act, specific words such as "the time within which" were also Therefore the assesses was not bound 'O before the prescribed time in the any such time-limit it was the duty option in Form 'C' within a reasonable time and in the present case it is the admitted position that the assessee did furnish the declarations before the order of assessment was made.
