 Complaints were received against the petitioner, a probationer in the Haryana Civil Service (Judicial Branch), and the High Court held an inquiry to determine his suitability to continue in service. Show cause notices were issued and the petitioner was given reasonable opportunity to be heard, but it was found that his explanations were belied by documentary evidence on record, On the recommendation of the High Court, the State Government terminated his services by an innocuously worded order, after considering his further explanations. Three questions arose, before this Court. firstly, whether the inquiry held by the High Court amounted to "punishment" within the meaning of Article 311, secondly whether probationers and confirmed Government servants stand at par in such cases and thirdly, whether on mere technical pleas, this Court should interfere under Article 136 of the Constitution.
 Dismissing the special leave petition, the Court, 
HELD : 1. This Court would not interere under Article 136 of the Constitution on a merely technical plea. It is only if patent facts disclose a serious enough infringement of law as well as indubitably damaging and undeserved consequences upon a petitioner that the court's conscience could be so moved as to induce it to interfere. [519 D-E] 2.If the enquiry conducted and notices given are intended only to determine whether a probationer, who has no fixed or fully formed right to continue in service (treated in the eye of law as a case of "no right" to continue in service), should be continued and more serious action is not contemplated it means that no stigma is intended to be cast, even if the reputation of the probationer is to some degree affected, if those facts can not reasonably be disputed by him. In the eye of law, it is not a case of punishment, but of termination of service simpliciter, unless the individual concerned has suffered a substantial loss of reputation which may affect his future prospects.

 3.There should be some difference, as to the nature of, or the depth of the inquiry to be held, as between a probationer whose services can be terminated by a notice and a confirmed Government servant who has a right to continue in service until he reaches a certain age. A confirmed Government servant's dismissal or removal is a more serious matter. This difference must necessarily be reflected in the nature of inquiries for the two different purposes.
 Neither can be '.punished", without a formal charge and inquiry. but a less formal 514 inquiry may be sufficient to determine whether a probationer should be continued in service. He has no "right" to continue to serve without justifying he continuance. [519 G- H, 520 A]
