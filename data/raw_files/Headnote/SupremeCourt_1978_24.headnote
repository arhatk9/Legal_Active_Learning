 Properties 1A to 1H were either purchased or endowed in the name of the deity Shri Vithal Rakhumai Dev by one Ambabai.
 One Pandurang Babaji Pawar was appointed as the manager (Vahivatdar) and one Bala Appa Yadav was appointed as a servant of the deity. On 1-6-1905, Ambabai executed a sale deed in respect of all the suit properties except property I E in favour of Pandurang and Bala. On 23-6-1907, Ambabai executed a second will reiterating that Pandurang and Bala as the Vahivatdar and the servant respectively. After the death of Ambabai on 12-3-1910, the properties were partitioned. Pandurang got property at IC and Bala the rest. Pandurang died on 13-2-1911 and thereafter there were several transfers of the properties. The property at 1 E came in possession of plaintiff/appellant No. 1 who claimed to be the Vahivatdar and hereditary trustee of the deity.
 Plaintiff No. 1 treated the property at 1 E as his own and sold it on 17-9-1947 to original defendant Nos. 2 and 3. The plaintiffs instituted a suit in 1961 under section 50 and 51 of the Bombay Public Trusts Act, 1950, attacking the sales made in the years 1905 and 1947 as being void and not binding on the deity. The trial Court treating the suit as one filed by the deity held that the properties were endowed to the deity; the sale deeds were obtained by undue influence, without legal necessity and were not for the benefit of the Devasthan and hence not binding on the devasthan; the, purchasers' possession over the land sold was therefore void and adverse. The suit was however dismissed on the ground that it was barred by limitation.
 In appeal, the finding of the trial Court in respect of property at 1 E alone was assailed without success.
 Dismissing the appeal by special leave, the Court 
HELD : (1) The law of limitation fixing a period of limitation for the initiation of any suit or proceeding is a procedural law and not a substantive one. If the claim was not barred and the right to the property was not extin- guished when Section 52A came into force, then a suit instituted, thereafter could not be defeated under any of the Articles of the Limitation Act, 1908 or even of the new Limitation Act of 1963. In express terms, Section 52A over- rides the provisions of the Limitation Act including the provisions in Section 28 of the Limitation Act, 1908. The overriding effect of Sec. 52A will have its play and operation, only if, by the time it came into force Section 28 had not extinguished the right to the property in question. Section 52A cannot have the effect of reviving an extinguished and lost claim and giving life to a dead horse.

 815 (2) The effect of Section 28 of the Limitation Act, 1908 is not only to bar the remedy but also to extinguish the right.
 [817 B] (3) In the instant case, the effect of Section 28 of the Limitation Act was that the right to the property was extinguished resulting in conferment of a title by adverse possession on the persons in possession of the concerned properties. By such adverse possession those who had come in possession of these properties had acquired an indefeasible title under the Indian Limitation Act, 1908 and the claim had become barred long before the year 1955. The lost right to this property long before 1947 could not be saved and revived in the year 1955 or 1961 by Section 52A of the Bombay Public Trust Act. [817 A, B]
