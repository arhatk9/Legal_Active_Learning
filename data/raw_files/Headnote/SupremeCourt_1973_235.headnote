 In 1945, a donation of Rs. 30,000 was made for building a 6- bed hospital for women on an approved chosen spot, according to the approved plan, to be constructed by the donor with a matching contribution from the government and with any other voluntary donation. The donor died in 1947 and all that was done by that time was to lay a foundation stone. In 1952, the sons of the donor filed a suit for return of the Rs.
 30,000 on the ground that the conditions subject to which it' had been given had been violated and that the contemplated charity never materialised.
 The trial court and the High Court in appeal decreed the suit.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) A hospital for women is a charitable object and since the beneficiaries are a section of the public, it constitutes a public trust.
 (2) The doctrine of cypres is applicable to both testamentary and non-testamentary gifts for public charitable purposes. [686G] Nori Venkata Rama Dikshitulu v. Ravi Venkatappayya, A.I.R.
 1960 A.P. 35 and Potti Swami v. Rao Saheb D. Govindarajulu, A.I.R. 1960 A.P. 605, referred to.
 (3) The conditions for the application of the doctrine are- (a) The settlor has shown a general charitable intention- that is, the charitable object is of a general and not of a specific nature, and the original trust has failed ab initio; (b) there must be impossibility, not in the strict physical sense but in the liberal diluted sense, of impracticability of carrying out' the settlors intention;
 and (c) there must be a completed gift. [689B-E] In re Hilsom [1913] 1 Ch 314, In re Ulversion and District New Hospital Building Trust, [1956] 1 Ch. 622, Commissioner, Lucknow Division v. Deputy Commissioner of Pertapgarh, A.I.R. 1937 P. C. 240 and In re Rymer, [1895] 1 Ch. 19, 31, referred to.
 (4) The present is a borderline case is to whether there was a general intention to benefit the community, but Courts should lean in favour of the charity taking effect by imputing, without straining the languages an intention to help the people of the area with a maternity hospital. The rule of law must rise to this rule of life by a facilitating the- fulfillment of benevolent objects but vigilantly guarding against perversion, diversion. subversion, inaction and unjust enrichment, where public donations have been raised. [691B] (5) But the transaction in the instant case was not a gift simpliciter but was subject to a matching grant from the Government the building being required to be constructed by the donor with such augmented money etc. Assuming substantial compliance as sufficient in law, one of the conditions has been carried out by the State. [693F] 680 Harish Chandra v. Hindu Sharma Sewak Mandal, A.I.R. 1936 All. 19 lit re University of London Medical Sciences institute Fund, [1909] 2 Ch. 1;8-9, In re White's Trust, [1886] Ch. Div 449, Tudor on Charities and Halsbury's Laws of England 3rd Edn., referred to.
 (6) :The conditions having failed, the charity proved abortive, and the legal consequence is a resulting trust in favour of the door. Though s. 83 of the Trusts Act, 1882 does not apply proprio vigore, it embodies a universal rule of equity and good conscience and may be held to be applicable to public charitable trusts also. [688A-B; 693F- G] Government litigation involves expenditure of public money and should not be permitted to become an occasion for abusing the legal process regardless of the morality of the please and indifferent to any offer of settlement of the claim on fair terms.
