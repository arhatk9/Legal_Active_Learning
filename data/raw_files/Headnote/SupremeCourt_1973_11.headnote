 The six respondents (accused) were convicted by the trial Court for offences under s. 302/149, I.P.C. Four of them were sentenced to death and two to imprisonment for life on the grounds that one was a 'budding lawyer' and the other was 15 years old. The son and daughter of the deceased were examined as eye witnesses to the occurrence. Four persons, who were cited as eye-witnesses by the prosecution, were given up, because, the counsel for prosecution represented that he had reason to believe that they would not speak the truth. They were neither examined by the trial court under s. 540, Cr.P.C., nor as defence witnesses.
 The trial court scrutinised carefully and properly evaluated the evidence of the son and daughter, and as the son was 12 or 13 years old, applied the correct principles governing the appreciation of the evidence of a child witness and accepted their evidence as true. The High Court on appeal, examined the 4 witnesses given up by the prosecution, as court witnesses. It devoted a major part of its judgment to the consideration of the additional evidence recorded by it.
 Feeling wholly unimpressed by that evidence, the High Court endorsed the view of the prosecution that these witnesses were given up as they were not prepared to speak the truth and even issued notice under s. 479A, Cr. P. C. to one of.
 them to show cause why he should not be prosecuted for perjury. The High Court disagreed with the main arguments urged on behalf of the accused for discrediting the testimony of the son and daughter. But, the High Court acquitted the accused on the view that the son and daughter, being closely related to the deceased and being in a sense, chance witnesses, their evidence without corroboration did not prove the, guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.
 
HELD : (1) The judgment of the High Court reversing the judgment of the trial court and acquitting the accused caused grave miscarriage of justice. [325B-C] Once the two eye witnesses were held to be trustworthy witnesses there was no cogent reason for not acting upon their evidence. The fact that the other persons who were present at the spot and had witnessed the occurrence have, without any good reason and, perhaps with oblique motive, chosen not to state the truth in court and thereby obstructed the course of justice, is a sound reason for accepting the testimony of the son and daughter. To decline to act upon their testimony merely because of the absence of other witnesses to corroborate them in court, is to defeat the cause of justice in this case. it was wholly unreasonable for the High Court to dub them as chance wit- nesses, as there is no material on record to support such an observation. and the observation runs counter to the High Court's own line of 314 reasoning earlier. There is thus absolutely no justification for the view that their testimony leaves any scope for reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused.
 It could not be considered that because of their relationship to the deceased, they would spare the real assailants and falsely implicate the accused, and in the circumstances of the case, there is no scope for such a hypothesis. There is no general rule that the evidence of the relations of the deceased must be corroborated for securing the conviction of the offender. Each case is to be considered on its own facts. [325F-326C] In the present case, there is an instrinsic ring of truth in the evidence of the two eye witnesses. The straight forward nature of their deposition and the fact that they were undoubtedly in, a position to, identify the assailants coupled with the recovery of blood-stained earth from the place of occurrence leave no reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused. [326C-D] (2) No leniency should have been shown to the 'budding lawyer', because, he, as a result of his education and profession should have ,exercised a restraining influence on his associates rather than allowed himself to be misled by them into being a party to a gruesome murder. However, in view of the facts that (a) the murder was committed as far back as 1968; (b) on conviction by the trial court in September 1969, the accused were under the shadow of death;
 (c) the accused were acquitted by the High Court in May 1970; and (d) it is not possible to assign with certainty the fatal blows to any particular accused person, the ends of justice would be served by sentencing all the accused to imprisonment for life. [326G-H; 327A-C]
