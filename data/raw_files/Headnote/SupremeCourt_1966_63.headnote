 A was born in Kozhikode of parents who were both Indian citizens. In 1948 at the age of 12 he went to Pakistan. He came to India for some time in 1954 on a Pakistani passport in which he was described as a Pakistani national. He again came for some time in 1956. After that there was no record in Kozhikode of his movements but in 1964 he was again found there without any valid travel documents. On action under the Foreigners Act being taken against him a writ petition was filed in the High Court and it was urged that he was an Indian citizen. The High Court held that he had 'migrated' to Pakistan within the meaning of Art. 7 of the Constitution in 1948, and therefore was a foreigner. With certificate the appellant came to this Court.
 HELD: (per P.B. Gajendragadkar, C.J., K.N. Wanchoo, S.M.
 Sikri and V. Ramaswami, JJ) (i) The word "migrated" is capable of two meanings : In its narrower connotationit means going from one place to another with the intention of residingpermanently in the latter place; in its wider connotation it simply going from one place to another whether or not with the intention of permanent residence in the latter place. In Art. 7 the word is used in its wider sense, Shanno Devi's case in which the narrower meaning was attributed to the word was wrongly decided. [709 C; 714 Al Smt. Shanno Devi v. Mangal Sain, [1960] INSC 142; A.I.R. 1961 S.C. 58, held wrongly decided.
 (ii)The non-obstante clause with which Arts. 6 and 7 begin shows that the concept of domicile found in Art. 5 is not to be brought into these Articles. Moreover Arts. 6 and 7 speak of migration after March 1, 1947 when partition had not yet taken place. At that time the question of change of domicile did not raise, and even after partition people moved without forming any definite intention as to their permanent place of abode. [712 D; 713 B] (iii)However, even when used in the wider sense the word "migrated" cannot take in movement which was involuntary or for a specific purpose and for a short and limited period. [713 D-E] Per Hidayatullah J. (dissenting) :
 The decision in Shanno Devi's case was correct. The word "migrate" in the context of Arts. 6 and 7 cannot mean mere going from one place to another. Just as domicile is a question of fact and intention, migration is also a question of fact and intention. The immediate requirement of intention in migration as used in the Constitution is that the person ed to change his abode from one part of India to another. If the part to which he went came to be incorporated in the territory of Pakis- 707 tan he had to return the manner prescribed in the proviso to Art. 7 or he would not be deemed to be a citizen of India.
 [719 B-C; 718 F-H] Per Shah J.-The word "migrate?' is used in more senses than one and the context must decide its meaning. In ascertaining the meaning of that word in Arts. 6 and 7 the court would have regard to the scope and object of the constitutional provisions examined in the light of the events which were witnessed both before and after the birth of the dominions of India and Pakistan. Another matter that must be kept in mind is that Arts. 6 and 7 deal with the status at the commencement of the Constitution. And if intention to take up permanent residence in one or the other dominion, coupled with movement could alone justify a claim for citizenship of the country into which the migrant has moved, a large number of persons who migrated from the territory of Pakistan to India would find themselves without citizenship of India. Therefore "migrated from the territory of India" within the meaning of Art. 7 means moving from one place to another but not necessarily with the intention of permanently residing in the country into which the person has moved. [720 F; 721 C; 723 A-B] Case law considered.
