 In exercise of the powers conferred by notifications issued under s. 3 of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, the concerned officer directed, on August 20, 1957, various appellants in Tadepalligudem in Andhra Pradesh, to sell to the Government of India certain quantities and kinds of rice at price calculated by him. The officer took into account the rates published in Vijayawada, about 80 miles from Tadepalligudem, which was the nearest locality where published figures were available, and made such adjustments as were necessitated by considering transport charges and the quality of rice procured which was inferior to the rice for which the published price was available in Vijayawada.
 On September 14, 1957 the Central Government under s.
 3(2)(c), fixed the maximum price, and the officer made requisitions between September 14, and December 29, 1957 at that price.
 On December 30, 1957, after the new rice crop had come into the market, the Central Government refixed the maximum price at less than the maximum price fixed on September 14. 1957, and Government requisitioned rice thereafter at that price.
 from the appellants.
 The appellants filed writ petitions in the High Court, contending that, (1) for the period before September 14, 1957, the price had not been properly fixed according to the provisions of the Act; (2) the prices fixed by the Central Government on September 14, 1957, and December 30, were bit by Arts. 14. 19 and 31 of the Constitution; and (3) the lesser price fixed on December 30, 1957, should not have been applied to the rice purchased by the appellants before that date at the higher rate fixed on September 14, 1957, and requisitioned from them after December 30. The writ petitions were dismissed.
 Dismissing the appeals to this Court, 
HELD : (1)(a) Under s. 3(3A)(iii) there are 3 ways in which the price has to be fixed as indicated in sub-cls. (a), (b) and (c). Sub-clauses (a) and (b) apply only to those situations where a controlled price has been fixed by the Central Government. Since there was no controlled price before September 14, 1957 in the present case. sub-cl. (c) applied. Hence. the officer had to fix the price under s.
 3(3A)(iii)(C), and the contention that he should have first tried to come to an agreement with the appellants under sub- cl. (a) has no force. [426A-E] (b) Under s. 3(3A)(iii)(C) and cl. (iv), the price had to be calculated with reference to the average market rate prevailing in the locality, on the ,basis of published figures available in the locality or a neighbouring locality, during the period of 3 months immediately preceding the dates of notification of the price. [426F] 419 (c) The words 'published figures' mean that figures should be publicised in some way as in newspapers or on the radio or in any other manner which makes them known to the general public. 'the prices entered in the accounts books of the appellants, cannot. in any circumstances be called 'published figures' even if they were shown to the tax- authorities. [427D-F], (d) Admittedly the rice procured was inferior in quality to the rice for which the published price was available in Vijayawada. Hence, merely because in 1964, Central Government issued a notification, that the difference between the two qualities is slight, would not mean that the officer was wrong in treating, in 1957 the rice procured by him as inferior. [428F-H] Therefore, it cannot be said that the officer was wrong in taking the figures published in Vijayawada and making the necessary adjustments. [429B] (2) (a) The orders passed by the Central Government fixing the price relate only to certain districts of Andhra Pradesh. But these districts are surplus rice producing districts and form a class by themselves; and fixation of maximum price therein would subserve the purpose of s. 3(1) of the Act of stabilising the prices. Hence there is no violation of Art. 14. [423D-E] (b) Sections 3 and 4 of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946, were in terms similar to ss. 3 and 4 of the Act, and were upheld by this Court in (Harishankar Bagla's Case [1955] 1 S.C.R. 380). Therefore, for the reasons given in that case, which were accepted in (Bhanamal Guiarilal's case [1959] INSC 156; [1960] 2 S.C.R. 627), Ss. 3 and 4 of the Act are not hit by Art. 19(1) (f) and (g). [423D-C] (c) The Act does not fix the amount of compensation, but the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined are found in s. 3, which provides that the price should be fair, and that involves in it all factors which have to be taken into account in fixing a fair price. As the Act was dealing with a large number of commodities of different types in which different factors would enter in fixing fair prices, the legislature left it to the Central Government to determine the, fair price in a just and proper manner, after indicating in sub-ss. (3) and (3A) the manner in which it should be fixed. Therefore, there-is no violation of Art. 31(2). [423G-424B] (3) The contention that the rice procured between September 14 and December 29 by the appellants should have been requisitioned at the price fixed on September 14 and not the price fixed on December 30 must also fail.[1425A] (a) The reason for reduction of prices on December 30 was that new crop came into market from November 1957, and it is a well-known economic fact that prices fall whenever the new crop comes into market and traders. who had purchased at higher prices, would have to sell at the reduced rates.
 Therefore, what would have happened in a free market was all that happened when the prices were reduced. [424D-F] (b) The reduction of price was not unfair and it could not be said that the loss to the appellants would not have happened even in the normal course of business. [424F] (c) If the contention of the appellants is accepted (i) the Central Government can never reduce prices when once it had fixed them' and (ii) there would be two sets of maximum prices. But that would be against the very purpose of s.
 3(1) of fixing a fair price. [424F-G] (d) If the prices were raised by a subsequent notification, the appellant would not have contended that the old price should prevail in relation to the stocks purchased by them earlier. [424G-H] (4) Section 3(3A)(iv) provides that the rates determined shall be final and shall not be called in question in any court. These words do not take away the jurisdiction of the High Court under Art. 226 to give relief in a ,proper case;
 but they certainly indicate that the rates fixed shall not be lightly interfered with unless the High Court finds that there has been serious injustice in the fixation of rates.
