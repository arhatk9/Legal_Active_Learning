 The Allahabad High Court in Mongey v. Board of Revenue U.P. [A.I.R. 1957 All. 47] laid down the practice that a period of ninety days should be taken as the period for application for the issue of a Writ of Certiorari and that time could be extended only when special circumstances were shown to exist. The appellant who had taken all the preliminary steps to file a writ petition did not file it on the ninetieth day. That day was originally a working day;
 but from the afternoon onwards the court and its offices were closed, without previous intimation, for the Diwali holidays. The appellant filed the petition on the re- opening of the court. The High Court dismissed the petition on the ground that the rule of practice, prescribed a binding rule of limitation and there was no explanation for not f iling the petition on the ninetieth day. In appeal to this Court.
 
HELD: The High Court erred in exalting a rule of practice into a rule of limitation and rejecting the petition of the appellant without considering whether he was guilty of laches and undue delay. [289A-B] A rule of practice may only indicate how discretion will be exercised by the court in determining whether having regard to the circumstances of the case, the applicant has been guilty of laches or undue delay. [288 A] Normally this Court will not interfere with the exercise of this discretion by the High Court but the special circumstances of the present case justified a departure from the rule. [288H]
