 The appellant was tried and convicted along with certain others under s. 120-B read with ss. 409 and 5(2) read with s. 5(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The accused were alleged, in pursuance of a conspiracy, to have arranged the issue of a number of licences for the import of motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts, to a number of cornpanies which had no existence. Against the appellant the specific allegation was that he had received the delivery by post of two such licences and had signed the acknowledgment -receipt. The appellant along with others was convicted by the trial court, and his conviction having been upheld by the High Court, he came to this Court by special leave.
 The material questions that came up for consideration were :
 (1) whether the charge at the trial was not defective since it mentioned only one conspiracy for the issue of all the licences whereas eight licences had been issued and there were therefore eight conspiracies; (2) whether the High Court was right in taking into account reasons other than those given by the investigating officer as an explanation of his failure to send the specimen handwriting of the appellant to the handwriting expert for opinion.
 
HELD : (i) The charge of conspiracy was not that the conspiracy was entered into with each bogus individual firm for the benefit of that firm alone in connection with the issue of licences to that particular firm. The charge was that out of the profits made from acts done in furtherance of the conspiracy, all the persons in the conspiracy were to benefit.[598 B-C] The conspiracy was a general conspiracy to keep on issuing licence.-, in the names of fictitious firms and to -share the benefits arising out of those licences when no real independent person was the licensee. The various members of 'the conspiracy other than the two public, servants must have joined with the full knowledge of the modus operandi of the conspiracy and with the intention and object of sharing the profits arising out of the acts of the conspirators. It could not therefore be said that the mere fact that licences were issued in the names of eight different companies makes out the case against the appellant and the other conspirators to be a case of eight different conspiracies each with respect to the licences issued to one particular fictitious company. [598 D] R. v. Griffiths, [1965] 2 All E.R. 448, distinguished.
 (ii) The High Court could not be said to have been in error in considering other reasons besides those given by the investigating officer and 596 holding that no adverse inference could be drawn against the prosecution from the fact -that the opinion of the handwriting expert had not been obtained with respect to the acknowledgment receipt. [600 C] Further, an adverse inference against the prosecution can be drawn only if it withholds certain evidence and not merely on account of its failure to obtain certain evidence. When no such evidence has been obtained., it cannot be said what that evidence would have been and therefore no question of presuming that the evidence would have been against the prosecution under s. 114, illustration (g) of the Evidence Act can arise.
