 During the course of the investigation of a case of house- breaking and theft information was received that R had received the stolen article. The appellants, who were a Sub-Inspector of Police, a Head Constable and a Constable, respectively, took R into custody on January 6, 1957. Less than three days later R was found lying dead with a number of injuries on the body. The appellants were prosecuted for having caused injuries to R, acting in concert for the purpose of extorting from him information which might lead to the detection of an offence and restoration of stolen property, and also for having his body thrown at the place where it was ultimately found with the intention of screening themselves from punishment. The appellants pleaded inter alia (1) that the prosecution was barred by limitation by reason of the provisions of s. 53 of the Madras District Police Act, 1859, and (2) that the trial of the appellants was vitiated by the fact that the completion of the investigation of their case was done by an Inspector of Police and this contravened the Madras Police Standing Orders under which investigation in cases against the police for torture and causing death had to be conducted by a person of the rank of Assistant or Deputy Superintendent of Police or by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate.
 Hold that the prosecution of the appellants was not barred by limitation under s. 53 of the Madras District Police Act, 1859..
 No provision of law authorised police officers to beat a person with a view to induce him to make statement; and 743 though in the present case the act of beating was alleged to have been done when the appellants were engaged in investi- gation, there could be no reasonable connection between those acts and the process of investigation. The acts complained of could not be said to have been done or intended to be done under any provision of the Madras District Police Act or the Code of Criminal Procedure or any other law conferring powers on the police, and, consequently, s. 53 of the Madras District Police Act had no application to the present case.

 Held further, that the provisions of the Madras Police Standing Order No. 145 were nothing more than administrative instructions by the Government of Madras and did not have the force of law; that, in any case, the requirement of the Standing Order was merely directory and not mandatory, and non-compliance did not make the investigation of the case illegal; and that even assuming that the Standing Order had the force of law, the trial of the appellants would not be rendered invalid unless it was shown that miscarriage of justice had been caused on account of the illegal investigation.
