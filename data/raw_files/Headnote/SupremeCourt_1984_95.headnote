 The appellants in their appeals to this Court challenged the order of a Single Judge of the High Court admitting the writ petition of the first respondent company and staying of the notice seeking removal of certain Directors of the company.
 ^ 
 HELD: 1. There will be an order vacating the order of stay/injunction passed by the Single judge of the High Court, prohibiting any action being taken on the basis of the requisition put in by L.I.C. [644E] 
 2. All appropriate proceedings will be taken in accordance with law on the basis of the requisition.
 However, no effect should be given to any resolution the company may pass at the extra-ordinary general meeting to be held in consequence of the requisition without obtaining prior directing from this Court. [644F-G] 
 3. The pendency of these cases in this Court will not stand in the way of holding the annual general meeting of the company in the normal course. [644G]
