 The appellant was detained from November 1962 onwards under various detention orders. She was released on February 4, 1964 but as won as she came out of the prison gates, she was served with a fresh order of detention dated February 3, 1963 issued by the State Government under r. 30 of the Defence of India Rules, 1962. She was detained with a view to prevent her from acting in a manner prejudicial to the defence of India,- the public safety and maintenance of public order. A petition filed by the appellant under Art.
 226 of the Constitution against her detention under the said order was dismissed by the High Court. The appellant came to this Court by special leave.
 It was contended on behalf of the appellant : (1) The State Government having delegated its powers under r. 30 to District Magistrate by a notification dated 9th November 1962, it was not competent to pass an order of detention under r. 30. (2) The order of detention was bad because two ministers cannot legally jointly pass an order of detention.
 (3) The Order of detention was vitiated by malice in law.
 (4) The High Court should have insisted on an affidavit from the Ministers. (5) There was no material to show that there was an apprehension that maintenance of public order -would be prejudicially affected.
 
HELD : There was no infirmity in the order under which the petitioner was detained.
 (i) By delegating its power under r. 30 to District Magistrates the State Government was not itself denuded of the power to act under 30. [317 H] Huth v. Clarke, 25 Q.B.D. 391, relied on.

 (ii)There is no difficulty in two Ministers successively being satisfied that it is necessary to detain a person for different reasons and then their decision being carried out by one order of detention duly authenticated. [318 D] Godavari Samrao Parulekar v. State of Maharashtra, [1964] INSC 17; [1964] 6 S.C.R. 446, referred to.
 (iii)The mere fact that the detention order is passed during the pendency of habeas corpus proceedings cannot by itself lead to the conclusion that the order is vitiated by malice in law. If the Government considers an order of detention, which is the subject-matter of challenge, to be invalid, there is no reason why it should not pass a Valid order [319 B-D] 314 315 Naranjan Singh Nathawan v. State of Punjab, [1952] S.C.R.
 395, relied on.
 (iv)Whether an affidavit by the Ministers concerned was necessary or not was for the High Court to consider.
 (v)The Court could not go into to the question whether the material before the detaining authority was sufficient or not.
