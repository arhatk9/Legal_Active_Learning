 A Jagir of 41 villages was conferred on Dewan Krishna Kant Nandy, the predecessor-in-interest of the appellant by the Raja of Banaras. By a fresh Sanad issued on January 10, 1785 the Governor-General assigned the said villages as 'Altamga Jagir', for the purposes of defraying the expenses of worship etc. of the deity in a temple. Subsequently, in the year 1793, the grantee created a trust of the income of this Jagir in favour of the deity. In the revenue settlement of 1841 the grantee was entered as Jagirdar of these villages entitled to realise the land revenue and the zamindars were to pay the annual land revenue to the Jagirdar, and since then the grantee and his descendants have been realising the land revenue. In execution of the decrees in the suits which were filed against the defaulting zamindars, the appellant's ancestors purchased the zamindari rights.
 When the U.P. Zamindari and Land Reforms Act, 1950 came into force in 1952, the appellant claimed to have two distinct rights, namely, Jagirdari rights under the Sanad and additional Zamindari rights acquired by purchase in execution of the decrees. The appellant was, however, paid compensation in the form of annuity in respect of those villages over which he had acquired zamindari rights as the land was held in trust for meeting the expenses of a religious institution. The State's claim that the Jagirdari rights of the appellant became vested in the State under ss.
 4 and 6 of the Act, was disputed by the appellant contending that his Jagirdari rights fell outside the purview of the Act and had not vested in the State.
 The appellant filed a writ petition in the High Court alleging that he had not been paid compensation in respect of Jagirdari rights and sought direction to the Government to 116 recognize and enforce the Jagirdari rights over the said villages. The petition was dismissed and this order was confirmed by a Division Bench.
 Dismissing the Appeal to this Court, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The intention of the Legislature as clearly disclosed by the Scheme of the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 was to extinguish estates, all derivative rights in estates and interest of intermediaries between the State and the tiller of the soil.
 All grants and confirmation of title in respect of a right or privilege over land in an estate or its revenue, would stand automatically determined under the provisions of the Act. [118 G-H] State of Uttar Pradesh v. Kunwar Sri Trivikram Narain Singh, [1961] INSC 250; [1962] 3 S.C.R. 213 followed.
 
 2. In the instant case, the appellant was having Jagirdari rights over 41 villages under the Sanad issued in January 1785, and the interest of the appellant in the land constituted an estate under Cl. (8) s. 3 of the Act read with Cl. (26) of that section. As a result of the combined operation of ss. 4 and 6 of the Act, the Jagirdari rights on the date of the coming into force of the Act automatically ceased and became vested in the State free from encumbrances with effect from the specified date. [119 D-H, 120 A] 
 3. The Sanad expressly states that the grantee shall take and use the produce of the original lands and increase thereof without being liable to pay any Dewani contributions and government demands. [119 C] 
 4. The appellant and his predecessors were entitled to take possession and hold control over the lands. The application for grant of the Sanad clearly shows that the request was for confirmation of the grant of 41 mouzas of land and for the issue of a Sanad evidencing such confirmation. [119 D] (Per Sabyasachi Mukharji J. concurring) In the instant case, there is no provision for any compensation for vesting of the right of entrustment of certain duties of worship which belonged to the donee. The Act has not been challenged on the ground as being ultra vires and though it is not necessary to provide for compensation in all cases after 117 the amendment of the Constitution, this is a factor which normally should be taken into consideration because taking away of a right without some provision for compensation is normally not favoured unless one is compelled by the language of the provision. No provision has been made for this obligation of worship i.e. whether the worship, would no longer be continued or whether the State would carry on the worship. In the social background this is a factor which normally deters one from interpreting a document in a manner which has abolished worship of the deity. [121 E-G]
