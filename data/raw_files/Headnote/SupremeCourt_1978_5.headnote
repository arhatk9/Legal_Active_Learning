 As against the claim of twelve days casual leave (on a paid basis) made by the workmen of the appellant company and for modification of the Standing Orders under the Industrial Employment (Standing orders) Act 1946, and the rules framed thereunder, the certifying officer, taking into consideration (a) the financial position of the appellant's undertaking including it having paid 20% bonus to its workers (b) the prevalent practice in neighbouring industries in that industrial belt of giving paid casual leave, and (c) the current trend in that particular industrial area, granted the modification reducing the number of days to six, as being fair and reasonable. The appellate authority confirmed the said modification.
 Dismissing the appeal by special leave, the Court 
HELD : 1. Supreme Court's jurisdiction under Art. 136 cannot be exploited for canvassing pure questions of fact. [535 E] 
2. Casual leave is not an automatic, advantage to the total number of days' leave that a worker is entitled.
 Casual leave is not a matter of right and it is only in the event of sudden emergencies that casual leave is allowed.
 Unforeseen circumstances may unexpectedly prop up necessitating sudden absence of an employee, be he in Government service or any other office or in an industrial undertaking. The whole concept of casual leave is calculated to provide for such contingencies. [535 G-H; 536 A] 
3. A certain number of days' leave prescribed in S. 79(1) is the minimum and not the maximum. Current trend in a particular area or industry has not the force of law. It may have persuasive value but not more, in considering the claim for casual leave.
 In the instant case; (1) There is nothing grossly unfair or shockingly violative of fairness or justice warranting interference by this Court by exercise of its special jurisdiction. After all the excess is around three days in a year over the current trend of granting an overall maximum of thirty days, which circumstance the Tribunal has taken note of.
