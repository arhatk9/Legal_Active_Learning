 Two khalasis were convicted for the offence of conspiracy to secure railway passes on forged applications, and under s. 5(1)(d) and (2), Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. It was the duty of the office of the Works Manager of the Railway to issue passes to railway employees for railway travel. The two khalasis were not formally appointed to work in the Pass section, but their services were actually utilised in the office for issuing passes.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the khalasis, inter alia, that they are not public servants.
 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: (1) Section 21, Ninth. I.P.C., as it stood at the reievant time included in the definition of 'public servant' every officer in the service or pay of the Government. The tests for determining whether a person is an officer of the Government` are : (a) whether he is in the service or pay of the Government: and (b) Whether he is entrusted with the performance of any public duty whether of an exalted or humble character. [500G-50IB] In the present case. the two khalasis were actually allowed to deal with the preparation and issuance of railway passes. and as such. were in fact, performing public duties and dicharging public functions auxiliary to those of the Works Manager-who is an officer of the Government-and his office. They were. therefore. in actual possession of the situation of a public servant and in view of Explanation II to s. 21, I.P.C., would be 'public servants'. They were, therefore. rightly convicted under s. 5(1)(d) and (2), Prevention of Corruption Act. [50IE-G] G. A. Monterio v. State of Aimer [1956] INSC 49; [1956] S.C.R. 682.
