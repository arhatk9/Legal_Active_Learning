 In the petitions for special leave to appeal in criminal proceedings, the petitioner annexed only a copy of the judgment of the High Court but did not file any papers, such as, copies of the charge-sheets or the judgment of the Trial Court which could give full picture of the facts.
 Dismissing the petitions, ^ 
 HELD : 1. The Supreme Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 136 may not propose to proceed further in the matter in which the petitioner has not chosen to file any papers in the court apart from the judgment of the High Court. Therefore, in the instant case, the Court will not be justified in issuing a show cause notice to the respondent when no attempt has been made to place all the facts before it by filing the necessary documents.
