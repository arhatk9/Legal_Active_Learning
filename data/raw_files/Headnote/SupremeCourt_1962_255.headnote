 The petitioner No. 1 is a public limited company engaged in a manufacture of engineering goods. In additional to basic wages and dearness allowance payable by petitioner No. 1 it has introduced two Production bonus schemes. Certain difficulties and doubts having arisen on the question whether production bonus could be taken into consideration in calculating the contribution under s. 6 of the 979 Employees Provident Fund Act, 1952, the Central Government passed an order by which it was directed that the production bonus payable as part of a contract of employment either at a flat rate or at a rate linked to the quantum of work turned out satisfied the definition of "basic wages" under s. 2(b) of the Act. The petitioner No. 1 was further directed to effect the recovery of provident fund and contribution and to make deposit of arrears of contribution in accordance with the first direction contained in the order. Thereupon the present petition was filed under Art.
 32 of the Constitution.
 The main contention of petitioner No. 1 was that ,bonus' without any qualification had been excepted from the terms "basic wages" in the definition in s. 2(b) of the Act and therefore all kinds of bonus were excluded from "Basic wages". Since the section which provides for contribution only refers to basic wages, dearness allowance and retaining allowance no contribution need be paid on bonus. Consequ- ently the order of the Central Government directing that production bonus should be included in basic wages for the purpose of contribution under the section was invalid.
 Held, that when the word "bonus" was used without any qualification the legislature had in mind every kind of bonus that may be payable to an employee which was prevalent in the industrial field before 1952. It is not possible to accept the contention of the respondent that whatever is the price of labour and arises out of contract is necessarily included in the definition of "basic wages" and therefore production bonus which is a kind of incentive wage would also be included, in view of the exceptionof all kinds of bonus from the definition. Therefore the order of the Central Government, which was presumably under s. 19A of the Act, was incorrect.
