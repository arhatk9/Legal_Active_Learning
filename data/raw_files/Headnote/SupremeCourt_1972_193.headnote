 The assessee was a non-resident company for the purpose of Explanation 2 to s. 6 of the Wealth-tax Act, 1957 and was operating a tramway undertaking in Calcutta. The Government of W. Bengal proposed to acquire the undertaking and entered into an agreement in 1957 with the assessee. Under the agreement, the Government had an option to acquire the undertaking after the 'purchase date' namely, January 1, 1972. In compliance with the provisions of the agreement the assessee maintained a special reserve and a shareholders' account in its books. The assessee had also issued debentures which were secured by a floating charge on the general assets of the company. All the debenture- holders were however residents in the United Kingdom, the specialities were in the United Kingdom, and the debts were payable in that Country.
 For the assessment years 1957-58, 1958-59 and 1959-60 the assessee claimed that, (1) the amounts in special reserve account; (2) the amounts in shareholders reserve account;
 and (3) the debenture loans as debts, deductible in ascertaining its net wealth for the purpose of the Act. The High Court, in reference, held in favour of the revenue with respect to all the three items.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) Till the assessee-company was acquired by the Government the amounts shown in the special reserve, through shown in accordance with the agreement, were the assets of the company. Between the Government and the company there was only an agreement and the Government could not have acquired the assessee-company before the purchase date, January 1, 1972. [1040D-F] (2) The amount in the shareholders' account did not belong to the shareholders but was an item of the assets of the assessee-company. [1041D] A company is a different legal. entity from its.
 shareholders, and the shareholders have no rights in the assets of the company except when dividends are declared or when the assets of the company are distributed on liquidation. The fact that a separate shareholders reserve had to be maintained by the assessee-company because of the agreement with the Government did not change the character of the asset.

 (3) In view of the nature of a floating charge, and the circumstances in the present case that the debenture-holders were all residents of the United Kingdom, the specialities were in the United Kingdom and the 1034 debts were payable in the United Kingdom, the debenture loans could not also be taken into consideration in ascertaining the net wealth of the assessee under s. 6 of the Wealth-tax Act, [1041E; 1042F-G] Halsbury's Laws of England, 3rd Ed.
