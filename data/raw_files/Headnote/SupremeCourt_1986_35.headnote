 By an agreement dated July 28, 1961, the Respondent- State Electricity Board agreed to supply the appellants with bulk electrical energy for their power oriented industry at a concessional rate for a period of 20 years. Under cl. 18 of the agreement, it was provided that the rate of supply was reviewable by the Board every five years after January, 1971, and the revision of rate was to be effected if to rise in the cost of generation out of the total cost varied by 25% or more from the cost last fixed. It was further envisaged by cl.34(b) that the mutual rights and obligations of the parties would be subject to alteration by further legislation relating to supply and consumption of electricity enacted during the period of the agreement. The Board commenced supplying electrical energy to the appellants with effect from March 1, 1963. The Board issued various notifications from time to time bringing into effect the revised tariffs for the supply of electricity to its different classes of consumers at different rates. By Notification dated July 26, 1966, the Board imposed general surcharge on the appellants at the rate of 15% on the normal tariff.
 634 The appellants filed a petition under Article 226 challenging the power of the Board to levy the general sur- charge of 15%. The High Court allowed the petition and held that the levy of general surcharge of 15% on the appellants was ultra vires the Board insofar as the appellants were concerned because the parties having entered into a statutory agreement dated July 28, 1961, there was a fetter created on the power of the Board to unilaterally increase the tariff under s. 49 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 and there-fore the appellants could not be subjected to payment of the general surcharge of 15%. The Board preferred an appeal against the judgment of the Single Judge.
 From January 1, 1971, the Board intimated its intention to the appellants to revise the concessional rate of supply and charge them the uniform rate of tariff under Schedule HS/LP/HT-1 as applicable to all large industrial consumers and the general surcharge of 15% thereon in exercise of its powers under cl. 18 of the agreement. Accordingly, the Board by its letter dated February 1, 1971 forwarded a bill for the billing month January 1971, raising a demand on that basis.
 The appellants thereupon filed a writ petition under Article 226. A Single Judge of the High Court quashed the impugned bill and held: (i) that the Board was entitled under the first part of cl.18 to review the rate of supply 'every fifth year starting from the first date of supply', but in view of the restrictive clause contained in the second part of cl.18 it was impermisible for the Board to make any such upward revision in the rate of supply till January 1, 1971; (ii) that in the circumstances it can be inferred that the rise in the cost of generation was at least 25% and accordingly the Board was entitled to revise the rate of supply by 25% and (iii) that if the Board claimed a further rise, it would have to establish that the rise in the cost of generation was more than 25% and it had to for that purposes get the percentage in the cost of generation determined either by mutual dialogue or by reference to arbitration.
 During the pendency of the appeals preferred both by the appellants and the Board, on February 7, 1976 the Governor of Rajasthan promulgated the Electricity (supply) (Rajasthan Amendment) Ordinance, 1976, by which new sections 49-A and 635 49-B were introduced into the Act with retrospective effect to overcome the difficulty created by the judgment of the High Court in this case, and more particularly by the judgment of this court in Indian Aluminium Co. v. Kerala State Electricity Board, [1975] INSC 138; [1976] 1 S.C.R. 70. By the use of a non obstante clause in sub-s.(1) of s. 49A the Legislature made it lawful for the Board to revise, from time to time, the tariffs fixed for the supply of electricity to persons other than licensees and to frame uniform tariffs for the purpose of such supply. Sub-s.(2) thereof provided that in revising or framing tariffs under sub-s.(1), the Board shall be guided by the principles set out in s. 59 and as respects any period commencing on and from September 16, 1966 i.e.
 the date on which the new s. 49 of the Act was brought into force, by the provisions laid down in sub-ss. (2), (3) and (4) of s. 49-A notwithstanding anything contained in the Act or in any agreement, undertaking, commitment or concession made before the first day of April, 1964 i.e. the date when the uniform tariffs were first framed by the Board. Sub- s.(3) of s. 49A provided that all such agreements, undertakings, commitments or concessions as are referred to in sub-s.(1), shall, insofar as they are inconsistent with the provisions of sub-ss.(1) and (2) and to the extent of the tariffs fixed or provisions made therein for such fixation, be void and shall be deemed always to have been void. Section 49A (3) thus had the effect of nullifying the agreement entered into by the appellants with the Board under s.49 for supply of electricity at concessional rate.
 Similarly by use of a non obstante clause, s. 49B provided that any amount realised or demand made or created by the Board or the Government, etc. according to the uniform tariffs in force from time to time or against any person claiming any special tariffs under any such agreement, undertaking or concession made before February 7, 1976, the date of promulgation of the Ordinance, shall be deemed to have been validly realised, made or created under the Act as amended by the Ordinance.
 Immediately thereafter on March 12, 1976, the Board furnished the appellants with a bill for the billing month of February 1976 at uniform rate, under Schedule LP/HT-1 framed by the Board's tariff Notification dated May 28, 1974 together with the general surcharge of 15%.
 The appellants, therefore, filed petition under Art.
 226 636 challenging the constitutional validity of ss. 49A and 49B of the Act, as introduced by the Amending Ordinance as also the impugned bill sent by the Board for the billing month of February, 1976.
 On November 4, 1976 the Board issued another Notification under s.49(1) framing revised uniform tariffs to be applicable for the billing month of December, 1976.
 But unlike the earlier notifications, this notification did not contain any exclusionary clause granting exemption for specially negotiated loads. On November 3, 1977 the Board furnished another bill to the appellants claiming arrears amounting to Rs. 5.57 crores on account of the difference between the normal rate of tariff and the agreed rate for the supply of electrical energy for the period from January 1, 1971 to January 31, 1976.
 The appellants filed another petition under Article 226 questioning their liability to pay the said amount.
 The High Court upheld the constitutional validity of ss. 49A and 49B of the Act as introduced by the Electricity (Supply) (Rajasthan Amendment) Act, 1976 and also the right of the Board to revise the rate of supply as agreed upon for the period commencing from January 1, 1971 onwards and enforce a demand for payment of the difference between the uniform tariffs as fixed from time to time and the agreed rate.
 In the appeals to the Court, the questions for consideration were : (i) Interpretation of the terms of agreement between the parties dated July 28, 1961, particularly cl. 18 and 34(b) thereof; (ii) Interpretation of ss. 49A and 49B of the Act; and (iii) whether the demands raised by the Board for payment of the difference by the impugned bills dated February 1, 1971 and March 12, 1976 which involved the imposition of a liability on the appellants by the retrospective conferment of a prospective power under s.49A and the validation of such power under s.49B was wholly arbitrary and irrational, confiscatory in nature and amounted to deprivation of property without payment of compensation and was thus violative of Arts. 14, 19(1)(f) and (g) and 31(2) of the Constitution.
 637 On behalf of the appellants it was contended : (i) that cl.18 was an escalation clause and therefore the Board was not entitled to unilaterally frame uniform tariffs as due and payable by the appellants but the rate of increase must be in proportion to, or correlated with, the actual rise in the cost of generation; (ii) that the stipulation in cl.34(b) cannot be regarded as a contractual stipulation at all and that in no case cl.34(b) can possibly be made applicable to any purported alteration of contracting parties' right for a past period by means of retrospective legislation; all that the parties contemplated was that the mutual rights and obligations would be subject to future legislations on supply and consumption of electricity but such legislations necessarily had to be valid legislations and if cl.34(b) was to be treated as a contractual stipulation providing that the rights stipulated in the agreement were subject to any modification by any legislation, valid or invalid, cl.34(b) will have to be struck down as a totally uncertain clause which cannot find place in any contract; (iii) that while the concessions stipulated by the agreement under s.49(1) could have been altered in proportion to the rise in the cost of generation, such concession could not have been altogether eliminated as that would amount to a total disregard of the guiding principles contained in section 49(3) and thus contrary to the mandate of s.49(2) of the Act; (iv) that ss.49A and 49B were integrally connected and were intended and meant to achieve a joint purpose which was merely to validate such of the past actions of the Board as would have been valid if s.49A had already been in force at the relevant time and the demand to be validated had to be raised prior to February 7, 1976 and not on a date subsequent thereto; since the bill dated March 12, 1976 was subsequent to the date of promulgation of the Ordinance, the same was not validated under s.49B; it was not open to the Board to make a demand from the appellants for payment of charges for the period commencing from June 1, 1974 and ending with February 6, 1976 according to the uniform tariff of 1974; and (v) that the demand raised by the Board against the appellants for payment of the difference between the uniform tariffs and the agreed rate for the period subsequent to January 1, 1971 was violative of Arts. 14, 19(1)(f) and (g), and 31(2) of the Constitution.
 On behalf of the Respondent-Board it was contended: (i) that cl. 18 is not an escalation clause; (ii) that cl.34(b) 638 makes the contract subject to any legislation; that the rights which the parties derived under the agreement for supply of electricity at a concessional rate under s.49 of the Act was defeasible; and that being so, ss.49A and 49B had to be read into the contract and therefore became a contractual term; that the appellants derived a right to get electricity at a concessional rate only for a limited period till January 1, 1971 and thereafter the Board derived the power to revise the rate of supply under cl.18 and it was, therefore competent for the Legislature to enact a law providing for application of uniform tariffs notwithstanding any such commitment, undertaking or concession to the contrary made during any period prior to April 1, 1964.
 ^ 
 HELD : 1. By virtue of ss. 49A and 49B of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 as introduced by the Electricity (Supply) (Rajasthan Amendment) Act, 1976, it was lawful for the Respondent-Board to revise the special rate of tariff agreed upon and to raise a demand against the appellants by its letter dated February 1, 1971 for payment of the difference between the uniform tariff under Schedule HS/LP/HT-I applicable to all large industrial consumers under the Board's tariff notification dated April 26, 1969 and the concessional rate in terms of cl.18 of the agreement between the parties dated July 28, 1961 for the period from January 1, 1971 upto February 6, 1976, i.e. the date of promulgation of the Electricity (Supply) (Rajasthan Amendment) Ordinance, 1976, as also the general surcharge of 15% thereon levied by the Board by its tariff notification dated April 26, 1969 as from September 16, 1966 onwards.
 [689 C-E] 
 2. The Board's letter dated March 12, 1976 being subsequent to the date of promulgation of the ordinance the demand raised by the Board for payment of the revised uniform tariff under Schedule LP/HT-I applicable to all such large industrial consumers under the Board's tariff notification dated May 28, 1974 purporting to act under ss.
 49A and 49B of the Act read with cl.18 of the agreement, was not validated by s.49B and, therefore, the Board was only entitled to recover uniform tariff at the same rate i.e.
 under Schedule HS/LP/HT-1 of 1969 for the period from July 1, 1974 to February 6, 1976, that is, prior to the promulgation of the Ordinance. [689 E-G] 639 
 3. The Board was entitled by the terms of s.49A to raise a demand for payment of the revised uniform tariff under Schedule LP/HT-I of 1974 w.e.f. February 7, 1976 and thereafter as per the revised uniform tariffs framed from time to time as applicable to all large industrial consumers in terms of c1.18 of the agreement. [689 G-H; 690 A] 
 4. An "escalation clause" according to its accepted legal connotation means a clause which takes care of the rise and fall of prices in the market, whereas the right to review confers the power to revise the rate of supply. [666 D-E] 
 5. The word 'review' in c1.18 necessarily implies the power of the Board to have a second look and to so adjust from time to time its charges as to carry on its operations under the Act without sustaining a loss. The parties clearly contemplated by c1.18 for a fresh revision of the rate once in a block of five years. The only fetter on the power of the review is that contained in the proviso to c1.18, according to which power of review shall be exercisable if the component of cost of generation out of the total cost varies by 25% or more and that such power shall not be exercisable by the Board till January 1, 1971. Therefore, c1.18 cannot be regarded to be an escalation clause.

 Black's Law Dictionary, 4th Edn., p.639; American Jurisprudence, 2nd Edn., Vol.17, p.786 and Corpus Juris Secundum, Vol.17, p.806, referred to.
 
 6. The true object and purpose of the enactment should not be ignored and due effect should be given to the provisions of ss.49A and 49B of the Act with a retrospective effect which clothed the Board with power to make the uniform tariffs applicable to bulk consumers like the appellants who under agreements entered into with the Board on July 28, 1961, that is, before April 1, 1964, the cut-out date mentioned in sub-s.(1) of s.49A had been, to the great financial detriment of the Board, enjoying a concessional rate of supply which had no relation to the existing cost of generation, with the 640 result that the burden of this cost had to be passed over to other consumers. As is clear from the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Bill, the Legislature thought it expedient to amend the Act so as to cover the rising cost of generation from time to time, notwithstanding any special contract, undertaking or concession to the contrary. The legislative mandate contained in ss.49A and 49B of the Act as introduced by the Rajasthan Electricity (Supply) Amendment Act, 1976, subserves the public interest to ensure that the Board shall not, as far as practicable, after taking credit for any subvention from the State Government under s.63, carry on its operations under the Act at a loss.
 [672 A-E] 
 7.1 It is not uncommon for statutory contracts to contain a term like c1.34(b) which makes the contract subject to future legislation. Such a clause can usually be found in forest or excise contracts relating to the grant of a privilege which subjects the mutual rights and obligations flowing from such a contract to be liable to be altered or modified by subsequent legislations. [669 A-B] 
 7.2 In the instant case, the rights which the appellants derived under the agreement for supply of electricity at a concessional rate under s.49 was defeasible inasmuch as on a fair construction of the terms of c1.34(b) taken in conjunction with the conduct of the parties, it is clear that the parties had contemplated that the mutual rights and obligations under the contract would be subject to alteration by future legislation. That being so, ss.49A and 49B have to be read into the contract and these provisions by virtue of c1.34(b) became a contractual stipulation. [668 E-F; 670 H; 671 A-B] 
 8. The State Legislature under Entry 38 of the Concurrent List was competent to enact the Rajasthan Electricity (Supply) Amendment Act, 1976 and introduced the impugned ss.49A and 49B with retrospective effect to overcome the difficulty created by the decision of this Court in Indian Aluminium Company's case (Supra). There being a change in the law brought about by the introduction of ss.49A and 49B of the Amending Act, the Court is bound to give effect to these provisions notwithstanding anything contained in the Act or in any agreement, undertaking, commitment or concession to the contrary made by the Board before the first day of April, 641 1964, or the decision of this Court in Indian Aluminium Company's case (supra). [673 D-D] Indian Aluminium Company v. Kerala State Electricity Board, [1975] INSC 138; [1976] 1 S.C.R. 70 referred to.
 
 9. A combined reading of the provisions contained in ss.49A and 49B shows that the Board is relieved of the shackles of the contractual obligations flowing from the agreements relatable to s.49(3), and the Board is empowered in terms of s.49A to revise the tariffs or frame uniform tariffs with respect to consumers enjoying special benefits as from September 16, 1966. However, the Board could not on the strength of s.49A alone recover the difference between the uniform tariffs fixed from time to time and the agreed rate of supply from the appellants for the period from January 1, 1971 to February 6, 1976 without the aid of s.49B. [677 F-H; 678 A] 
 10. Section 49B on its terms has no application unless there was a demand raised or created prior to February 7, 1976, the date of promulgation of the ordinance. There is, therefore, insuperable barrier in applying the uniform tariff under Schedule LP/HT-I framed by the Board's tariff notification dated May 28, 1974 from the billing month of July 1974 i.e. from June 1, 1974 to February 6, 1976. The Board never intimated the appellants that they would have to pay charges for the supply of electricity to them at that rate. Therefore, the appellants would be liable for that period to pay charges at the uniform tariff as per Schedule HS/LP/HT-I framed by Board's tariff notification dated April 26, 1969. [678 A-D] 11. The word "surcharge" is not defined in the Act.
 Plainly, it means an additional or extra charge of payment.
 A surcharge is in substance an addition to the stipulated rates of tariff. The general surcharge of 15% as also that the uniform tariff were part of the general burden borne by all consumers alike. Whatever may have been the position under the old s.49, the new section as substituted by the Amendment Act 30 of 1976, makes it plain that the Board can fix uniform tariffs. The power to fix uniform tariffs must necessarily include power to make uniform increase in tariffs. Section 49A had the effect of removing the Board from the shackles of the agreement to supply electricity as a concessional rate entered 642 into under s.49. The effect of the non/obstante clause in sub-s.(1) of s.49A was to nullify the agreement. [678 E-F;

 12. Where a law does not, in reality, affect a transfer of ownership or possession, Art. 31(2) cannot be attracted.
 In order to constitute acquisition within the meaning of Art. 31(2), there must be transfer of ownership of property to the State or to a Corporation owned or controlled by the State. [683 F-G] 
 13. Unless the taking of property had taken place in either of the two way i.e. "acquisition or requisitioning", there was no obligation to pay compensation under the Constitution. The extinction of the right of the appellants under the contract with the Board to get electric supply at a concessional rate under cl.18 of the agreement for the period after January 1, 1971 when revision of tariff was due under cl. 18 thereof, had not amounted to acquisition of property under Art. 31(2). Further, there was no question of any transfer of money representing any debt owned by the Board from the appellants which stood extinguished by reason of ss.49A and 49B of the Act. All that the appellants had under their contracts with the Board was a defeasible right by reason of cl. 34(b) of the agreement. The appellants had contracted themselves by cl. 34(b) to be subject to any subsequent legislation, and s. 49A of the Act struck at the agreement. It is an enabling provision and empowers the Board to revise the tariffs for supply of electricity to a class of consumers enjoying special benefit under agreement entered into under s. 49(3). The Board was competent to review the tariff in terms of cl. 18 of the agreement as from January 1, 1971. Section 49A liberates the Board from the constraints of the agreed rate under the agreement entered into by the Board with the appellants under s.49 of the Act and empowers the 643 raising of demand according to the uniform tariffs. Here, there was no debt due or owing to the State or a Corporation owned or controlled by the State. Article 31(2) was thus not attracted. [683 G-H; 684 A-B; 683 C-F] 
 14. The concept of "property" in Art. 31 is not a narrow concept and is used in a comprehensive sense. Any legal right which can be enforced through a Court is a right in the nature of property within the meaning of Art. 31.

 15. The contention based on Art. 19(1)(f) and (g) cannot prevail. The present case concerns only with sale of goods i.e. electricity and price to be paid therefor, for "tariff" is nothing but the price. The contract itself provided for revision of the rate under c1.18 of the agreement after January 1, 1971. The Board was within its powers in applying the uniform tariffs to the appellants after the period stipulated for had expired. There was nothing unreasonable for the Board to have enforced the uniform tariffs as against the appellants as from January 1, 1971. Reasonableness of the increase in tariff is established by the fact that the Board was not bound to supply electricity to the appellants at a concessional rate by incurring operational losses beyond that date. [687 D-F] 
 16. The appellants have not shown nor produced any material to show that they have suffered any loss on account of the increase in tariff. There is nothing to show that the appellants had not the capacity to bear the burden of uniform tariffs. It cannot be said that the impugned demand made by the Board as against the appellants were confiscatory in nature. When all the large industrial undertakings including the public sector undertakings of the Government of India and the State Government were paying for the supply of electricity at uniform tariffs fixed from time to time, the appellants had no right to claim immunity. [687 F; 688 D-E] 644 
 17. It is evident that the cost of generation in the grid was far higher than the concessional rate at which the appellants were getting the supply. As a result the Board was incurring very heavy losses on account of this low rate for a large bulk consumption. It would have been unreasonable for the Board not to have applied the uniform tariffs to the appellants as from January 1, 1971 when the Board derived the power to revise the rate under c1.18 of the agreement. The component of cost of generation worked out by the Board shows that the appellants were getting their electricity free of all charge. Even the uniform tariff under HS/LP/HT-I was very much less than the price at which the Board was getting its supply. Therefore, there was no reason why the appellants should not be treated alike wit all other large industrial undertakings which were all subjected to payment of uniform tariffs fixed from time to time. The contention based on Art.14 must, therefore fail.
 [686 D-F; H; 687 A-C] 
 18. There was no question of any estoppel against the Board inasmuch as the appellants did not open their PVC plant on account of any assurance or promise by the Board.
 The appellants approached the Board for supply of high tension ower for their industrial complex and the Board complied with the request. Even otherwise, the appellants have not made out that but for the statutory contract for supply of electricity at a concessional rate under s.49 they would not have established their industry. There were number of incentives offered by the State Government to enterpreneurs to set up their industries in the State. The Board is not the Government and the appellants cannot rely on promissory estoppel for the incentive offered by the Government. [688 F-H; 689 A-B] 
 19. All the appeals, except CA. No. 2675/80 are dismissed. Civil Appeal No. 2675/80 arising out of the judgment and order of the Division Bench of the High Court dated September 12, 1980 dismissing S.B. Writ Petition No.
 8579/80 filed by the appellants challenging the validity of the bill dated March 12, 1976, for payment of Rs. 21,35, 506.70p. for the billing month of February 1976, is partly allowed to the extent that the said bill is quashed with the declaration that the Respondent Board is empowered in terms of s.49A of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 as introduced by the Electricity (Supply) (Rajasthan Amendment) Act, 1976 to 645 raise a fresh demand for payment under Schedule HS/LP/HT-1 of 1969 for the period from July 1, 1974 to February 6, 1976 and further that the Board is entitled to recover from the appellants charges under Schedule LP/HT/1 of 1974 as from February 6, 1976 and thereafter as per the revised uniform tariffs, framed from time to time as applicable to all large industrial consumers together with general surcharge of 15% thereon in terms of c1. 18 of the agreement.
