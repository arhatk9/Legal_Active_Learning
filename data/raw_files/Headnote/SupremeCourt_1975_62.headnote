 Under the Assam and Nagaland High Court Services (Appointment, Conditions of Service and Conduct) Rules, 1956, the initial pay of the Registrar of the High Court was Rs. 850/- per month. Under r. 3(1), when the post was filled up from the judicial service, it will carry a special pay. The Chief Justice had also power under the rule to fix, without the previous approval of the Governor, the initial pay up to Rs. 1200/- per month according to experience etc. Subsequently, the rule was altered authorising the Chief Justice to fix the initial pay, without the approval of the Governor, up to Rs. 1180/-.The State, Government revised the pay scale of the Registrar with effect from 1st April, 1964 and fixed the initial pay at Rs. 1200/-, A special pay was also sanctioned if fie was home on the judicial service. but no change in Y. 3(1), authorising the Chief Justice to fix the initial salary up to Rs. 1180/per month was made, On April 28, 1967, the respondent, who had retired from the judicial service and was holding the post of Presiding Officer. Industrial Tribunal, was appointed Registrar of the High Court and the Chief Justice fixed a special initial salary of Rs. 15001-. that is. at the maximum of the scale, and a special allowance of Rs. 250/-.
 On the question whether the fixation of the salary and special allowance was valid the High Court held in favour of the respondent on the grounds that, (a) because in the past the Chief Justice could appoint the Registrar with the special pay of Rs. 1200/- or Rs. 1180/- when the initial pay was Rs. 850/-, that is, he could give six increments of Rs.
 
50. the Chief Justice could now appoint the Registrar with the special pay of Rs. 1500/- when the initial pay was Rs.
 1200/- by giving five increments of Rs. 60; and (b) when the initial pay itself was Rs. 1200/- the power of the Chief Justice to fix a special pay of Rs. 1180/- became meaningless and _must be read is Rs. 1500/-.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) The reasoning of the High Court was wrong and no such power could be implied in the Chief Justice. If the Chief Justice wanted to appoint the Registrar with the special salary of Rs. 1500/- and special allowance, approval of the Governor should have been taken under Art. 229(2), because the rules do not permit such a salary and the higher salary involves greater financial burden on the Government.

 (2) Further, r. 3(1) conferred power on the Chief Justice to fix the special allowance only when the post is filled from the members of the judicial service. The post of Presiding Officer, Industrial Tribunal was included in the Assam Judicial Service only on August 17, 1967, and not when the respondent was appointed as a Registrar of the High Court. That apart, it is indisputable that the respondent had retired from the State Judicial Service and it could not be said that such a retired person was member of the Judicial Service or was borne on the service. [858D-F] (3) Rule II is a general rule and is not applicable to the appointment and fixation of pay and special allowances of the Registrar because there is specific 855 provision, namely, r. 3(1) for the post of Registrar which prevails over the general rule. Moreover. r. 11 must also be read subject to the proviso to Art. 229(2) which requires the approval of the Governor for fixing pay etc. Also, Fundamental Rule 19 does not permit any such fixation in the teeth of r. 3(1) on the strength of r. 11.
