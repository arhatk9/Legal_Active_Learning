 To protect the interests of its members against loss resulting from over production, the Jute Mills Association provided that the members shall work their looms for a fixed number of hours and gave to its members facility of transferring "loom-hours", that the number of hours for which the members were entitled to work their factories. A member of the Association was thereby permitted, in addition to the "loom hours" allotted to that member, to work its factory for such "loom hours" as were transferred to it by another member. The respondent-assessee had transferred its surplus "loom hours" which it could not utilize during the assessment years, and received certain sums of money as consideration, which the Income-tax Officer included in the respondent's total, income liable for payment of income-tax.
 That order was confirmed by the Appellate Asistant Commissioner and the Tribunal, but the High Court on a reference, held in favour of the assessee.
 In his appeal to this Court, the Commissioner contended that: The right to work for the allotted number of hours was an asset of the assessee capable of being transferred, and where it was a part of the normal activity of the assessee's business to earn profit by making use of its asset by either employing it in its own manufacturing concern or by letting it out to others, the consideration received for allowing the transferee to use that asset was income received from business and chargeable to income tax.
 
 HELD: The High Court was right in holding that the receipts from sale of "loom-hours" were in the nature of capital receipts and were not taxable. [770 E] Distinction between revenue and capital in the law of income-tax is fundamental. Tax is ordinarily not levied on capital profits: it is levied on income. Sale of stock-in- trade or circulating capital or rendering service in the course of trading results in a trading receipt; sale of assets which the assessee uses as fixed capital to enable him to carry on his business results in capital receipt.
 The "loom-hours" were the asset of the respondent, but their temporary user could not be granted. The transaction was therefore a sale of "loom-hours", and when a businessman disposes of his capital for whatever reason, unless it is a part of his circulating capital, the receipt is capital and not income which is taxable.
