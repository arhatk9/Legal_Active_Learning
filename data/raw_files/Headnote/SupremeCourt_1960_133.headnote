 A complaint was filed against the respondent by the Food Inspector for selling adulterated milk. Section 20(1) of the Food Adulteration Act, 1954, provided that no prosecution shall be instituted under the Act " except by, or with the written consent of, the State Government or local authority or a person authorised in this behalf by the State Government or a local authority ". On the application of the Food Inspector consent in writing was given by a person authorised by the local authority. But it was contended by the respondent that the written consent was of no avail as it did not in terms name the person in whose favour it was given.
 Held, that where a prosecution was launched on the basis of a written consent granted by the competent person or authority, it was not necessary to name the complainant in the consent. The Act did not in terms require that the complainant shall be named in the written consent nor could such a limitation or condition be gathered as a necessary intendment of the provision. The written consent was for the launching of a specified prosecution and need not necessarily be in favour of a complainant authorising him to file a complaint.
