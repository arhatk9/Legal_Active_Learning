 In execution of a decree obtained by the first respondent against 'the second respondent, a firm in Aurangabad in the erstwhile Hyderabad State, a house which was furnished as security for the amount of decree which might be passed against the second respondent, was sold and the sale proceeds were deposited in the executing Court.
 Subsequently, the Collector of Aurangabad made an order under s. 119 of the Hyderabad Land Revenue Act, 1317F, distraining a part of the amount on account of arrears of sales-tax due from the second respondent.
 On the question of the validity of the Collector's order, the High Court held that the order was not valid because :
 (1) s. 119 of tile Hyderabad Land Revenue Act applied only to property which was in the custody and possession of the judgment-debtor and not in the custody and possession of the court; (2) the debt, due to the Government in respect of arrears of sales-tax had no priority over the dues of tile first respondent; and (3) the first respondent as a decree- holder had a prior charge; and the debt due to the Government in respect of salestax on account of the quality of the debt due to the first respondent, had no priority.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) The construction put by the High Court on s. 119 was not correct. The section in general terms empowers the distraint and sale of the defaulter's movable property and there is nothing in its language or context which prohibits tile Collector from ,making an order of distraint with regard to the movable property in the custody and possession of a court. [859 C-F] (2)But, a reading of ss. 104 and 116 of the Hyderabad Land Revenue Act, shows, that in respect of taxes other than Land revenue, only the procedure for recovery under s. 116 applies and not the substantive law of priority under s. 104 of the Act; and therefore the Government had no priority in 'respect of arrears of sales-tax over the dues of the firs', respondent. 1860 H-861 B] (3)The Government could claim priority regarding payment of salestax according to the doctrine of "Priority of Crown debts'.', quite apart from the provisions of the Hyderabad Land Revenue Act, but there was no proof that the doctrine was given judicial recognition in the Hyderabad State prior to January 26, 1950, and therefore, the doctrine was not a "law in force" in that territory which was continued by virtue of Art. 372(1) of the Constitution.
