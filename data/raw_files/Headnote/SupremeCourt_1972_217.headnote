 The assessee is a registered firm of three partners who are brothers, each having 1/3rd share and is engaged in the manufacture and sale of aluminum utensils. In the assessment year 1963-64, the see claimed to have paid Rs.
 31,684/- to M/s. Eastern Sales Corporation as selling agency commission and claimed deduction of the same under section 37 of the Act as an item of expenditure laid out or expanded. The selling agency firm was principally a partnership firm of the wives and minor sons of the partners' assessee firm. The selling agency agreement was entered into on March 26, 1962, while the partnership of the selling agency firm came into existence on April 13, 1962.
 The business address of the selling agency firm was the same as that of the assesses firm. The selling agency firm had no godown of its own nor any transport vehicles. The Tribunal held that the selling agency firm had no genuine independent existence and that the selling agency firm was only a make-believe arrangement and a device to minimise the tax liability of the assessee firm. The Tribunal further held that the selling agency agreement was not a genuine business arrangement, and refused reference to High Court.
 The High Court declined to call upon the Tribunal to state a case as desired by the assessee firm.
 On appeal to this Court on the grounds (i) that the Tribunal misconstrued or misunderstood the selling agency agreement and the partnership deed and (ii) that the Tribunal ignored the oral evidence and the same had vitiated its conclusions and on the question whether any question of law arises from the order of the Tribunal which required the Tribunal to state the case for the opinion of the High Court, Dismissing the appeal, Held (i) The assessee by adopting a device has made to appear the income which belonged to it had been earned by some other person. [213C] Commissioner of Income Tax, Gujarat v. A. Raman & Co.
 67 J.T.R. 11, followed.
 (ii) The mere existence of an agreement between the assessee and its selling agents or payment of certain amounts as commission, does not bind the Income Tax Officer to hold that the payment was made exclusively and wholly for the purpose of the assessee's business. It is still open to the Income Tax Officer to consider the relevant factors and determine for himself whether the Commission said to have been paid to the selling agents is properly deductible under s. 37 of the Act. [214A] Swadeshi Cotton Mills Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax, U.P. 63 I.T.R., 57, 208 (iii)Held, further, that as the Tribunal had not relied upon any irrelevant evidence and the inferences were rationally arrived at. [212H] Dhirajlal Girdharilal v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Bombay, 26 I.T.R. 736, Commissioner of Income Tax, West Bengal-ll v. Rajasthan Mines Ltd., 78 I.T.R. 45 and Commissioner of Income Tax, Punjab v. Indian Woollen Textile Mills, 51 I.T.R. 291, held inapplicable.
 (v)The Tribunal was justified in not stating a case for the opinion of the High Court under section 256(1), and the High Court was justified in not calling for statement of case under s. 256(2). [214C] Commissioner of Income Tax, West Bengal II v. Durga Prasad More, 82 I.T.R. 540, referred to.
