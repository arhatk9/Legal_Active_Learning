 Rashidul Hasan was a dealer registered under the U.P.
 Sales Tax Act. During the lifetime of Rashidul Hasan, the Sales Tax Officer sent a notice to him asking him to appear and to produce all books of account, cash memos, bills, receipts, bank pass books, statement of income and expenditure which he may desire to produce. He died in December, 1968 leaving behind three adult sons. At the time of his death assessment proceedings relating to the assessment years 1960-61 and 1961-62 were pending before the Sales Tax Officer. After the death of Rashidul Hasan, the business was continued by his sons by forming a partnership.
 His legal representatives obtained a number of adjournments in order to make an effective representation. After granting 6 adjournments the 7th Application for adjournment was rejected by the Sales Tax Officer and an ex-parte order of assessment was made in April, 1969. The Sales Tax Officer thereafter initiated recovery proceedings in pursuance of the assessment orders and the demand was sought to be realised from the sons of the deceased by coercive measure.
 Section 7C(3) of the Act provides that where a person having furnished a return dies and the assessing authority may determine the turnover of such person and assess the tax payable by him on the basis of such determination and for this purpose may by notice require from the legal representative of the deceased person any accounts, documents or other evidence which he might under the provisions of this Act require from the deceased person.
 Section 8(1) provides that the tax assessed under the Act shall be paid within such time not being less than 15 days from the date of service of the notice of assessment. It further provides that in default of such payment the same may be recovered as arrears of land revenue. The appellant filed two Writ Petitions before the High Court of Allahabad challenging the orders and recovery certificates issued under section 8 of the Act. The High Court rejected the application.
 On appeal by certificate under Article 133(1)(a) of the Constitution, the appellant contended:
 (1) The assessment orders are invalid as they are made against a dead person, and that no notice as required by section 7C(3) was served on the legal representative to produce accounts, documents and other evidence.
 (2) A proper and valid notice which is a condition precedent for fixing liability under section 8 has not been served on the legal representatives and therefore the recovery proceedings were illegal.
 ^ 
 HELD : (1) The notice was already served on the deceased when he was alive. It was not necessary to serve the notice on legal representatives again under Sec. 7C(3).
 The legal representatives would have been entitled to a notice to produce documents and evidence if the deceased had not earlier been served with a similar notice during his life time. The orders of assessment cannot, therefore, he held to be invalid on account of non-service of notice for production of documents upon the legal representatives in this case. Besides the legal representatives were aware of the proceedings and took several adjournments and if they did not choose to produce any further evidence it was entirely their fault. [865 E, G, 866 A-B] 863 (2) It is clear that before a certificate proceeding can be instituted under section 8 a notice of demand is condition precedent. There can be no recovery without service of a demand notice. It is admitted that such notice has not been served on the legal representatives. That being the position, the recovery proceedings are not maintainable in law and are invalid and the same along with certificates are liable to be quashed. [867 C-D] Sahu Rajeshwar Nath v.
