 The appellant is a company which carries on the business of exhibiting cinema films in its theatre' The respondents Jai Jai Ram and Mohd. Mia, were its employees for the past many years. Charge-sheets were served on them and the charges were enquired into by the Enquiry Officers appointed by the appellant. At the enquiry, the appellant 462 led evidence, both oral and documentry. Eleven witnesses were examined on behalf of the appellant and an equal' number of witnesses was examined on behalf of the respon- dents. The Enquiry Officer considered all the evidence led before him and came to the conclusion that the charges framed against the respondents had been fully established.
 He recommended that the services of the respondents be dispensed with for misconduct. He also recommended the making of certain payments to the respondents. The appellant accepted the report of the Enquiry Officer and jai jai Ram was dismissed on 15th January, 1959, and Mohd. Mia on 1st May, 1959.
 The Delhi Administration referred the matter to the Industrial Tribunal for adjudication whether the respondent& should be re-instated with full back wages or whether they were entitled to any other relief. When the case was heard before the Tribunal, the appellant asked for an opportunity to adduce additional evidence and the Tribunal allowed both the parties to lead further evidence. The decision of the Tribunal was that the dismissal of Jai jai Ram was not justified and the findings recorded against him at the departmental enquiry were baseless. As regards Mohd. Mia.
 the Tribunal held that no order of dismissal had been served on him, and hence it could not be said that his services had been duly terminated by an order of dismissal. On these grounds, the Tribunal ordered the reinstatement of both the respondents. The appellant came to this Court by special leave.
 Held, that the order of dismissal passed against jai jai Ram was proper and valid. As regards Mohd. Mia, the appellant had failed to prove that the order of dismissal was served on him as required by law. The relationship of employer and employee can be effectively terminated not merely by the decision of the employer to terminate the employee's services but by the communication of the said decision to the employee, and that was not done in this case. Therefore, the appellant was directed to pay to Mohd.
 Mia the wages to which he would have been entitled if he had been In actual employment from December 1, 1958, to July 27, 1962, the date of the decision.
 As regards the scope of the powers of the Tribunal it wag held that it is only where the Tribunal is satisfied that a proper enquiry has not been held or that the enquiry having 463 been held properly the findings recorded at such an enquiry are perverse, that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to deal with the merits of the dispute. The employer may rely on the domestic enquiry in the first instance, and alternatively and without prejudice to his plea that the said enquiry is proper and binding, may seek to lead additional evidence. By adopting such a course, the employer does not give up his plea that the enquiry was proper and the Tribunal cannot go into the merits of the dispute for itself If the view of the Tribunal was accepted that as the appellant sought permission to lead additional evidence it was open to it to consider the merits of the dismissal of the employees for itself in the light of the whole of the evidence before it, it will lead to the anamoly that the employer would be precluded from justifying the dismissal of his employees by leading additional evidence unless he took the risk of inviting the Tribunal to deal with the merits for itself. The true and correct legal position is that if the employer seeks to lead evidence in addition to the evidence adduced at the departmental enquiry and the employees are also given permission to lead additional evidence it is necessary for the Tribunal to first consider the preliminary issue as to the validity of the domestic enquiry and then proceed to deal with the merits in case the preliminary issue is decided against the employer.
