 Finding that the assessments of the income from the properties of two Hindu deities in the hands of its shebaits as trustees were set aside on the footing that the status of the assessees had not been correctly determined, the Income- tax Officer initiated proceedings for the assessments against the shebaits of the deities and completed the assessments on the deities in the status of an individual and through the shebaits. On the question whether the assessments on the deities through the shebaits were in accordance with law, 
HELD : The Hindu idol is a juristic entity capable of holding property and of being taxed through its shebaits who are entrusted with the possession and management of its property.
 A Hindu deity fell within the meaning of the word 'individual' under s. 3 of the Act and could be treated as a unit of assessment under the section and was capable of being taxed through its shebaits. The word 'individual' in s. 3 of the 1922 Act included within its connotation all artificial juridical persons and this legal position was made explicit and beyond challenge in the 1961 Act. [750 C;
 751 D] Neither God nor any supernatural being could be a person in law. But so far as the deity stands as the representative and symbol of the particular purpose which is indicated by the donor, it can figure as a legal person and in that capacity alone the dedicated property vests in it. There is no principle why a deity as such a legal person should not be taxed if such a legal person is allowed in law to own property even though in the ideal sense and to sue for the property, to realise rent and to defend such property in a court of law again in the ideal sense.
