 The Government of Bihar (defendant No. 1) gave a lease of hills on April 1, 1928, to K (a company) for a period of 20 years for the purpose of quarrying lime-stones with a condition attached thereto that it would not assign its lease-hold rights to anyone without its consent. In 1933 K assigned its lease-hold rights to one Bose by an unregistered deed handing over the possession of the leased property to him. The Government stopped the assignee from working the quarry and forfeited the lease in favour of K in March- 1934; and recentered into possession. L (plaintiff) took the lease of the hills from the Government on the 1st April, 1934, taking possession thereof on the 15th April, 1934. K sued the Secretary of State for India in September, 1934, for a declaration that losses in its favour had not been validly forfeited and for an injunction restraining him from granting leases to anyone else and for damages. The suit, though dismissed by the trial court, was decreed by the High Court in appeal in 1936. Pending the appeal before the High Court K obtained an interim injunction restraining the Secretary of State from granting lease to L. The decision of the High Court was affirmed by the Privy Council. K, which had been reinstated into possession surrendered it when the lease in its favour expired on 31st March, 1948, and the Government entered into possession informing the plaintiff that it had decided to lease the hills to defendant No. 2. L obtained a decree against the Government for specific performance and compensation from the trial court for the period commencing from let April, 1948, till L would got possession of lease-hold property.
 The High Court dismissed plaintiff's suit on the grounds, inter alia, (i) that the agreement was void under s. 20 of the Indian Contract Act as both the parties were under a mistake of fact 959 (ii) that it wag void under a. 30 of the Government of India Act, 1915, as the conditions laid down in that section had not been complied with;
 (iii) that no relief under a. 18(a) of the Specific Belief Act could be granted to plaintiff as that would amount to a reconstruction of the agreement between the parties; and (iv) that no alternative relief under a. 15 of the Specific Relief Act could be granted as plaintiff had not relinquished all further claims.
 Held, (reversing the judgment of the High Court that neither party was under a mistake of fact as both know that K had assigned its interest to Bose and, the assignment having been made without the consent of the lessor, K's interest was liable to forfeiture and the mistake, if any, was a mistake of law as it was regarding the validity of the assignment deed under the registration law;
 (ii) that inasmuch as the objection founded on s. 30 of the Government of India Act, 1915, involved investigation into the fact whether the draft leases bore the signatures of the appropriate authority on behalf of the Government end the plaintiff had no opportunity in the trial court to produce necessary evidence to meet the point, the High Court was not justified in allowing the question to be raised at the time of arguments, in view of the provisions of Or. VI, r. 8 and Or. VIII, r. 2 of the Civil Procedure Code;
 (iii) that s. 18(a) of the Specific Relief Act applied to the case as when the Government entered into the contract to grant lease to L in 1934 it had an imperfect title, and it could not grant the fresh lease to anyone during the existence of previous lease in favour of K, but after 31st March, 1948, when the lease in favour of K had expired, the impediment in the way of the Government to grant leases of property was removed and L's right to get the leases had revived. It was therefore entitled to sue for a, specific performance but as a substantial portion. of the period had already expired relief could only be granted under s. 15 of the Specific Relief Act and in compliance with its conditions;
 (iv) that though s. 15 applied to the case it was not a fit case in which a decree for specific performance should be granted as only a few months were left before the expiry of the lease and it would not be worthwhile to carry on any quarrying operations. But nevertheless the plaintiff was entitled to compensation from 1st April, 1948, till the 31st March, 1954; and (v) that the relinquishment of the claim to further performance can be made as in the present case, at any stage of 'the litigation.
