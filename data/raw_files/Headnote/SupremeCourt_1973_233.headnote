 The party of the accused and the opposite party alleged that the other party had attacked them with deadly weapons when each of them was lawfully engaged in work in their respective fields. In the scuffle some members on both sides received injuries. One member of the opposite party died as a result of the injuries.
 Although the prosecution case was that only one incident took place in a field on that day no mention was made of the severe injury on the head of one of the men in the opposite party either in the First Information Report or in the statements of witnesses. The F.I.R. did not contain any of the important events in the fight nor did the investigating officer make full enquiries with regard to the fight between the two parties. The investigating officer had stated that, although he found injuries on the person of one of the party of the accused, yet he had made no enquiries from the witnesses as to how he had received these injuries.
 The trial court acquitted some of the accused, convicted the first appellant and sentenced him to imprisonment for life and convicted the others for offenses under ss. 147 & 149.
 The High Court reduced the sentence of the first appellant to 5 years, and that of other by half.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD: The duty of the Investigating Officer is not merely to bolster up a prosecution case with such evidence as may enable the Court to record a conviction but to bring out the real, unvarnished truth. In the instant case, it is apparent that the prosecution witnesses had tried to omit altogether any. reference to at least the injuries of the first appellant because there was a cross case in which such an admission could have been used to support the prosecution in that case. As neither the prosecution nor the defence has come out with the whole and unvarnished truth, so as to enable the Court to judge where the rights and wrongs of the whole incident or set of incidents lay or how one or more incidents took place in which so many persons were injured, courts can only try to guess or conjecture to decipher the truth, if possible. This may be done within limits to determine whether any reasonable doubt emerges on any point under consideration from proved facts and circumstances of the case. [615A-B; D-E] (2)Where so many witnesses who had an equally good opportunity to observe what the first appellant did, did not involve him at all and had omitted even mentioning so prominent a feature of the occurrence as attack on the deceased, it could not be held beyond reasonable doubt that the fatal injury to the deceased was actually caused by the lath of the first appellant and of no other person. The first appellant was entitled to the benefit of doubt. [616 FG] (3)The injured witnesses who have given specific acts of the accused who struck them, could be relied upon to convict particular accused persons. The trial court has correctly applied this test and the use of ss. 147 and 149 against them was justified. [618 B]
