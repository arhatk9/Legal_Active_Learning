 The appellant who was the son of the last male holder, was recognised by the revenue authorities as entitled to his father's estate. The respondent, who was the brother of the last male holder, filed two suits claiming to be the legal heir of the last male holder on the basis that his brother belonged tothe Kanikkar tribe governed by the customary Marumakkathayam law. The appellant contended that his father was a Makkathayee. The appellantalso filed a suit for eviction of his tenant.
 In appeals arising out of the suit, the High Court decided that the family of the last holder was governed by Marumakkathayam law, relying on certain admissions made by the last holder during his 'life time.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD:The High Court was in error (a)the evidence in the case and various reports and books, which came into existence at undisputed point of time, showed that the Kanikkar tribe was not governed by any particular custom. Different families of the tribe followed different customs, some of the Marumakkathayam, some of the Makathayam and others a mixture of the two. [790F-G] (b)The admissions by the last male holder were not uniform. He sometimes described himself as Marumakkathayee and sometimes as Makkathayee. [790H] (c)Further, the question in issue was whether the Kannikar clan was governed by Marumakkathayam law. The custom pleaded by the respondent was a tribal custom and not a family custom. He could not be permitted to prove a custom not pleaded by him and such proof would not help him. [789E] [Therefore,, respondents suits were dismissed and the appellant was give declaration in his suit or eviction, that he was the owner of the properties. The suit was however remanded for decision as to his right to evict his tenant, in view of the prevailing tenancy laws.] Abdul Hussain Khan v. Bidi Sona Dero, 45 I.A. 10 and Thakur Gokalchand v. Parvin Kumari, [1952] INSC 29; [1952] S.C.R. 825, referred to.
