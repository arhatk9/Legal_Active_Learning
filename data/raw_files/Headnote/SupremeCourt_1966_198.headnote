 The respondent, who was a Mauzadar in the Assam Valley, was dismissed from office without complying with the provisions of Art. 311(2) of the Constitution. His writ petition to the High Court was allowed on the ground that he held a civil post under the State of Assam and was entitled to the protection of the Article.
 In appeal by the State, 
HELD : In the light of the system of recruitment, employment and functions, a Mauzadar is a servant and the holder of a civil post, under the State,, entitled to the protection of the Article.
 A civil post means a post not connected with the defence and outside the regular civil services. It is an office or a position to which duties in connection with the affairs of the State are attached. It is under the administrative control of the State but need not necessarily carry "a definite rate of pay" and may involve only part-time employment. A person holding the post is a person serving or employed under the State. The existence of the relationship of master and servant between the State and a person holding a post under it, is indicated by the State's right to select and appoint the holder of the post, its right to suspend and dismiss him., its right to control the manner and method of his doing the work and the payment by it of his wages or remuneration. Such a relationship may be established by -the presence of all or some of these indicia in conjunction with other circumstances, and its existence is a question of fact in each case. [682 G, H; 683 A. B, H] Under the Mauzadari system of collecting revenue, prevailing in the Assam Valley, the revenue charge of a Mauza and the responsibility for the whole revenue of it, in the first instance, rest with the Mauzadar. Originally he may have been a revenue farmer and an independent contractor but under the existing system, he is a subordinate public servant working under the supervision and control of the Deputy Commissioner. He is a Revenue Officer and ex-officio Assistant Settlement Officer exercising delegated powers of Government, and the State has the power and the right to select and appoint him and the power to suspend and dismiss him. Though he may not be a whole-time employee and receives by way of remuneration a commission on his collections and sometimes a salary he holds an office on the revenue side of the administration to which specific and onerous duties in connection with the affairs of the State are attached. [683 E-G] Observations in Venkata Swamy v. Superintendent of Post Offices A.I.R. 1957 Orissa 112, that a part-time employee cannot be the holder of a civil post disapproved.
