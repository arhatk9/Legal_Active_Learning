 Appellants D and R, and respondent K were charged for the murder of a lady. The deceased who was sleeping with her niece--a child aged about 11 years, woke up on hearing sounds while some miscreants were stealing things in the house. She called out to the child. Two of the miscreants rushed at her and another killed her. The child pretended to be asleep, but did not cry out of fear, and continued lying on her cot till dawn. In the morning the child came out of the room and started weeping. On the enquiry of a passer-by, she told him about the murder, and a report was lodged in the police station. Her statement was recorded but she refused to disclose the names of the culprits as her mother had forbidden her lest the persons named might kill her. D, K and R were apprehended. A chadar and quilt stained with human blood were seized from R's 'room, and eartops and its container 'from a room in the house of D and his brother. The child was taken to police station, who 3 days thereafter at about midnight disclosed the names of the three culprits. She named K to be the actual killer and D and R as the attackers. Subsequently the child and her mother's statements were recorded under s. 164 Cr. P.C., and then the child was allowed to return home. D, K and R were convicted by the Sessions Judge under ss. 302 and 34 I.P.C. The High Court, in appeal, acquitted K holding that it was not safe to base any conviction on the solitary testimony of the child witness, but upheld the convictions of D and R, as the evidence of the child witness was corroborated by the recoveries. D and R appealed to this Court against the convictions and the State against K's acquittal.
 
HELD : The convictions could not be sustained. [820 C] There were a number of circumstances indicating that it would not be quite safe to rely on the child witness' evidence. It was very unlikely that she could have continued or pretended to be asleep the whole of the time.
 In the morning she did not disclose the names of the culprits to the passer-by. The conduct of the passer-by in not trying to find out the names from the child appeared to be quite unnatural. The explanation that her mother had warned her not to disclose the names lest she be killed by the persons named by her, was not convincing. At no stage the suggestion was that the thieves themselves had threatened to kill the child if she disclosed their names.
 She could not, therefore, be under any fear at the time when she met the passer-by and others. Further the illegal confinement by the police was reprehensive and very adversely affected the value of the evidence obtained by the police. The very fact that she was questioned at the odd hour of midnight made it obvious that compulsion was being used on her to disclose the names. Clearly the police was acting against law in keeping the child confined in the police station with a police constable posted all the time as her companion. The failure of mother to appear as a witness at the Sessions Trial, was another example of the unsatisfactory or unreliable conduct of the investigation of the present case. If she had-come in the witness-box, it seemed that she 811 could not have supported the prosecution case, so the unconvincing excuse was put forward that she disappeared on the day fixed for her evidence, even though she was staying at the same place as her daughter and was looking after her during the trial of the case. It is also significant that according to the child her mother had told the police that she had not forbidden the child to disclose the names of the culprits. [816 A-F; 817 A-D; 818 A--C] Even the corroborative evidence adduced, was of very doubtful character. No reasonable explanation was given by the prosecution of how blood came on the quilt and chadar recovered from the house of R. During the season in which and at the place where the murder took place quilt would not be in use. The child did not state that any of the persons was carrying the quilt or chadar or was trying to conceal his features by wrapping in them. The explanation for these blood stains by R had not been accepted and was not very satisfactory; but the failure of an accused to give an adequate explanation does not lead to an inference that these blood stains must be those of the blood of the deceased. [818 D-H] Similarly the recovery of the eartops and its container was highly suspicious. It was not established that the room from which it was recovered was of D. All the formalities for conducting the search were not complied, as a witness stated that the police inspector was already in the courtyard of the house, when the witness arrived. Further the prosecution made out that D was foolish enough to keep in his room an article connected with the murder about which there could be no difficulty of identification, because the container had on it the name of the daughter-in-law of the deceased and it was kept in a manner to attract the, attention straightaway.
