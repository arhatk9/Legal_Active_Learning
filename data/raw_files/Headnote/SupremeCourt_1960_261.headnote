 The appellants, a private limited company, carrying on business as brokers, managing agents and dealers in shares and securities and having as one of their objects the acquisition of managing agencies, purchased shares of the Dawn Mills at a rate much higher than the market rate for obtaining the controlling voting right and thereby acquired the managing agency of the Mills. Later on, they sold-some of those shares and suffered a loss of Rs.
 1,78,438. The Income-tax Officer in assessing the taxable income disallowed the loss and the Appellate 905 Assistant Commissioner on appeal confirmed that order. The Income-tax Appellate Tribunal held that the shares did not become stock-in-trade of the appellants, but since the loss incurred was incidental to their business of acquiring managing agency, it was allowable as a revenue loss. On reference, the High Court held that the shares acquired by the appellants were a capital asset and the loss suffered by the sale was of a capital nature.
 Held, that the High Court had taken the correct view of the matter and the appeal must fail.
 The question whether a transaction is or is not an adventure of the nature of trade has-to be decided in the light of the intention of the assessee judged by the legal requirements associated with the concept of trade or business.
 Since the shares in question were purchased by the appel- lants with the intention of acquiring the managing agency and not in the course of their business as dealers in shares with the intention of trading in those shares and what was acquired by such purchase was a capital asset in the shape of a managing agency, it could not be said merely because the managing agency could be utilised for earning profits, that those shares were stock-in-trade of their share business.
