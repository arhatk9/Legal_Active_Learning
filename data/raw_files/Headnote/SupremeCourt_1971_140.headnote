 The appellant in C.A. No. 1789/69 was a teacher in a private aided school in Kerala while the other appellants were at the relevant time teachers in government schools. The teachers associations of Government as well as aided schools submitted a memorandum to the Government making various demands, one of them being that the age of retirement of school teachers should be raised to 60 years. On July 1966 the Government issued an order by which the age of retirement was raised from 55 to 58 years. However on May 4, 1967 another order was made by Government in supercession of the earlier orders and the age of retirement of all government employees and aided school teachers was again fixed at 55 years. On both occasions necessary amendments were effected in the Kerala Service Rules made by the Governor in exercise of the powers conferred by the proviso to Art. 309 of the Constitution, as well as in the Kerala Education Rules, 1959 framed by the Government under s. 36 of the Kerala Education Act 6 of 1949. The 1959 Rules originally contained Ch. XXVII. In February 1965 this Chapter was renumbered as Ch. XXVII-A. Another Ch. XXVII-B was added. Rule in Ch. XXVII-A appearing under the head .pension' provided that in the case of those in service of any aided school prior to 4-9-1957 the age of retirement shall be 60 years. In Ch. XXVII-B however it was laid down that the rules therein shall apply to teachers in aided schools to whom the rules in Ch. XIV(C) Kerala Education Rules applied. Rule 4 of the said Chapter further laid down that the date of compulsory retirement on superannuation applicable to teachers of Government schools shall apply to teachers of aided schools. Rule 2 of Ch. XIV (c) provided that teachers who were in service on 1-10-1964 would have an option either to continue under the Rules in Ch. XIV(B) or to come under the Rules in that Chapter i.e. XIV(C). Such option when exercised was to be deemed to be final. The appellant in C.A. No. 1789/69 exercised his option within the period limited therefore and thus came to be governed by the Rules in Chapter XIV(C). When the Government sought to retire the appellants at the age of 55 years they filed writ petitions in the High Court. The petitions were dismissed.
 In appeal by special leave to this Court, 
HELD: (i) The division bench of the High Court was right in holding that the provisions of Ch. XXVIIA and Ch. XXVIIB were mutually exclusive. Chapter XXVIIB makes independent and separate provisions which are inconsistent with those contained in Ch. XXVIIA. As the appellant in C. A. No.
 1789169 was a teacher in an aided school the age of compulsory 655 retirement by virtue of r. 4 of the Ch. XVIIB would be the same as that of teachers of government schools. The age of compulsory retirement for the latter class of teachers was 55 years and it followed that that would be the age of superannuation for the aforesaid appellant. Rule 2(a) of the Ch. XIV(C) expressly states that teachers who come under the provisions of Ch. XIV(C) shall retire at the age of 55. Rule 8 of Ch. XXVIIA could not be applied to the said appellant as that was a general rule and when he opted to be governed by the rules in Ch. XXVIIB and Ch. XIV(C) he was relegated to the same position as that of a teacher of Government school even in the matter of superannuation.
 [658D-G] (ii) The power of the Government under Art. 309 of the Constitution to make rules regulating the conditions of service of government employees or of teachers in the aided schools under s. 12 of Act 6 of 1959 could in no way be fettered by an alleged agreement between the government and teachers even if such an agreement was proved. [659B-C] (iii) The rule of estoppel also could not be invoked in the circumstances of the case. There was no question of any representation having been made by the Government which was acted upon to their detriment by the appellants. [659F] Union of India & Ors. v. M/s Indo-Afghan Agencies Ltd.
 [1967] INSC 267; [1968] 2 S.C.R. 366, distinguished.
 (iv) Change in the rule relating to retirement can be validly made and it does not attract either Art. 311(2) or Art. 14 of the Constitution. [660C] Bishun Narain Mishra v. State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors., [1964] INSC 222; [1965] 1 S.C.R. 693, relied on.
 (v) The contention that once the age of retirement was raised to 58 it could not be reduced to 55 owing to the provisions of rr. 5 and 6 of the Kerala Service Rules was not raised before the division Bench of the High Court. The normal practice of this Court is not to allow a new point to be raised except in a case of very special nature. [660F]
