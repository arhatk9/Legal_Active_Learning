By the Amending Act (Assam) 14 of 1964 sales-tax wits leviable. on the sale of petroleum coke, under the Assam Sales Tax Act, 1947. Under the Act the rate chargeable was 5%. The appellant however contended that under s. 14 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, coal, including coke in all its forms, was one of the 'declared goods' and that under s. 15 as it stood at the relevant time. the tax leviable could not exceed 2%. The High Court held against the assessee on the ground that the word 'coke' implied, only coke obtained from coal.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : Parliament used the word 'coke' in s. 14(1) of the Central Act in its ordinary dictionary meaning which would cover petroleum coke. [319 E] Since the clause mentions that coal shall include coke in all its forms, the object was to extend the meaning of 'coal' to include petroleum coke which is one of the forms of coke.
