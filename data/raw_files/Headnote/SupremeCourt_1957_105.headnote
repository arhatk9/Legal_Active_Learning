 Submission of its report by the Advisory Board under s. 10 of the Preventive Detention Act within the time prescribed by that section is of the utmost importance to the detenu and if the Board fails to do so any further detention beyond that period becomes unlawful.
 Consequently, where the case of the detenu was that the Advisory Board had not submitted its report within ten weeks of his detention and his detention thereafter had, therefore, become illegal and no attempt was made on behalf of the Government to controvert that case in the counter- affidavits filed on its behalf, the detenu must be set at liberty.
