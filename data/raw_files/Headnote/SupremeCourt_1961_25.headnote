 Held, that the salt works was a factory within the definition given in the Act and that the appellant was rightly convicted for working it without a licence. The word " premises " is a generic term meaning open land or land with buildings or buildings alone; the salt works came within the expression "premises" in the definition of the word " factory ". The extraction of salt from sea water was not due merely to natural forces but was due to human efforts aided by natural forces. The process of conversion of sea water into salt was a " manufacturing process " as defined in cl. (k) of s. 2, inasmuch as salt was manufactured from sea water by a process of treatment and adaptation. By this process sea water, a non-commercial article, was converted into a different thing salt, a commercial article.
