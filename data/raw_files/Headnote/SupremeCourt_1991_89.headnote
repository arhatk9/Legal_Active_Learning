 Appellants in Criminal Appeals nos. 628 and 432 of 1979 were accused nos. 1 and 2 respectively in the trial court.
 Deceased was brother-in-law (sister's husband) of accused no.1-At the time of marriage of P.W. 4 (sister of accused no.1) with the deceased, her father-in-law presented her gold ornaments which, while her visit to her parents' house, were retained by her father and brother, accused no.1, who refused to return the same, Despite persistent demand by her husband she could not be able to bring them back and on being rebuked by the husband she went to her Parent's house on 25.5.1975 to bring the same. On the same day the deceased being left alone in the house, brought Km. Sunita (P.W. 11), daughter of his brother (PW.5) for house-hold job.
 In the intervening night between 27/28-5-1975 accused no.1 with 52 his friend accused no.2 stayed at the house of the deceased.
 They took their bed in the outer court-yard by the side of the deceased while PW-11 slept in the adjoining verandah. At about 3.15 a.m. PW-11 woke up and found accused no.2 sitting over the deceased and securing him firmly. Accused no.1 gave a blow with the wooden pestle (Moosal) on the head of the deceased, who shouted "MAR DIYA, MAR DIYA, BACHAO, BACHAO" (being killed being killed, save me, save me.) On being questioned by PW-11, the two accused threatened her, and while accused no.2 was dragging the deceased inside the house and accused no.1 kept on hitting him, PW-11 escaped from the scene and went to her father's house to inform him. On the way she met PW-3, but she was so dumb-sticken that she could not reply to his queries. On hearing the voice of deceased, "MAR DIYA, BACHAO, BACHAO", at 3.30 a.m.
 PW-1, a neighbour of the deceased and who had earlier seen both the accused lying on different cots in the court-yard, came from the upstairs of his terrace and saw accused no.2 dragging the deceased and accused no. 1 beating him. At that time PW-3 also reached there. Both PWs 1 and 3 shouted at the accused but on being threatened by the latter, the witnesses stepped back. PW-5, on being informed by PW-11, reached the scene with PWs 1,3 and 6, and saw from a distance of 8-10 paces running the accused from there. All the four witnesses entered the house and found the deceased dead. PWs 1 and 6 went to the police post concerned where PW-1 gave report before the Sub-Inspector incharge, PW-17 who endorsed the same to the main Police Station for registration of a case. PW-17 accompanied by PWs 1 and 3, went to the place of occurrence, recorded statements of PWs 3,5 and 6 and conducted the investigation. On 29.5.1975 he arrested both the accused. An identification parade was arranged but accused no.2 refused to participate on the ground that his face was never muffled and that the prosecution witnesses had seen him in the police station.
 The investigation completed in both the accused being charged for offence punishable under s. 302 read with s. 34, I.P.C. for committing murder of the deceased.
 Accepting the prosecution case, the Sessions Court convicted both the accused of the offence charged and sentenced them to undergo imprisonment for life. Appeal against conviction was dismissed by the High Court which affirmed the findings of the trial court and maintained the sentence. Hence the present appeals.
 Before this Court it was contended by the appellants that presence of the prosecution witnesses at the scene of occurrence was not believable and their evidence was highly tainted with interestedness; that in 53 the F.I.R. name of accused no.2 who was known to the eye- witness and presence of the sole eye-witness PW-11 at the scene were not mentioned; that there was 5 hours' delay in registration of the F.I.R. while the distance between the place of occurrence and the police station was only 3 km;
 and that no adverse inference could be taken on refusal to participate in identification parade by accused no.2 as he was seen by the witnesses earlier in the police station.
 On consideration of court's power under Article 136 of the Constitution and the scope of interference in appeal arising from concurrent findings of fact, Allowing the appeals, this court, 
 HELD:1 Under Article 136 of the Constitution, the Court within its restrictions imposed by itself has, in very exceptional circumstances when a question of law of general public importance arises or a decision shakes the conscience of the Court, the undoubted power to interfere with the findings of fact masking no distinction between judgment of acquittal and conviction, if the High Court in arriving at those findings has acted either perversely or otherwise improperly. [60C-D] The State of Madras v.A.Vaidyanath Iyer[1957] INSC 79; , [1958] SCR 580, relied on.
 Himachal Pradesh Administration v.Shri Om Prakash, [1972] 1 SCC 249; Arunachalam v. P.S.R. Sadhanathan, [1979] INSC 60; [1979] 3 SCR 482 and State of U.P. v. Pheru Singh & Ors, [1989] Suppl. 1 SCC 288, referred to.
 
 2.1 The trial court and the appellate Court, without making a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the evidence in the proper perspective and by overlooking the manifest errors and glaring infirmities surrounding the case, were not right in rendering their conclusions that the appellants were guilty of the offence charged .[65G-H;66A] 2.2. Although the place of occurrence and case of death of the deceased due to homicidal violence were not in dispute and the dispute regarding the gold ornaments served as motive for the crime, yet a meticulous examination of the entire evidence created a serious doubt about the truthfulness and trustworthiness of the evidence of the eyewitnesses. The credibility of the evidence was completely shaken and the circumstances attending the case also debilitate the entire prosecu- 54 tion case. To what extent falsehood in the evidence had taken root and spread over the entire prosecution case was hard to fathom. Hence the irresistible and inescapable conclusion was that the prosecution had failed to establish the guilt of the appellants beyond all reasonable doubts.
 [60E-H;65F-G;66A] 
 2.3 The prosecution story that PW-4's brother accused no. 1, who was said to have retained her jewels and refused to return them, and who consequent upon his defiant attitude, was ill-disposed of towards the deceased, came to his house within two days of his sister being driven away and took his bed in the front court-yard along with the deceased and accused no.2, was patently incredible and too big a pill to be swallowed. Moreover the deceased who had sent away his wife from his house on 25.5.1975 asking her either to get back the jewels or not to return to her marital home would not have allowed accused no.1 to come to his house and to enter a friendly talk with him and also would not have allowed him to sleep in his house by his side. [64B-D] 
 2.4 Though PWs 1,3,5, and 6 stated that they had seen accused no.1 and one another running from the scene of occurrence, they all in a chorus asserted that they did not know the name of the other culprit, It was quite amazing that none of the PWs except PW-11 know the name of accused no.2. The case of the prosecution that the accused who had been questioned by PWs 1 and 3 about their vicious attack, perpetrated on the deceased, continued to be in the scene house till PWs 1 and 3 along with PWs 5 and 6 returned back was not plausible and persuasive. The conduct of these witnesses sin not chasing and attempting to apprehend the accused or even not raising a hue and cry in order to collect other villagers and apprehend the accused especially when one when one of them was unarmed and another was armed only with a stick, created a hallow of suspicion in the veracity of the prosecution case and led to an inference that the culprits whoever they might have been might not have stayed back for 1-1/2 hours till the arrival of the witnesses but might have left the scene earlier. [63F;64A] 
 2.5 It was brought in the evidence that PW-1 was related to the deceased as a third degree collateral PWs 5 and 6 were the younger brother and father of the deceased respectively. PW-11 was the daughter of PW-5. Thus PWs 5, 6 and 11 were shown to be the members of the same family and PW-1 closely related to them. PWs 3 and 6 had married from the same village. [61G-H;62A] 
 3.1 The evidence of PW-11, who claimed to have known names of 55 both the accused even earlier to the incident, unambiguously made it clear that she had revealed their names to her mother, inmates of her house and neighbors even much earlier to the lodging of the report at the police station. The houses of PWs 1,3,5,6 and the deceased were all situated in the same locality. It was very surprising that in spite of the fact that PW-11 informed every one the names of the appellants excepts her father, name of accused no.2 was not mentioned in the F.I.R. which was registered by 8.15 a.m. on 28.5.9175. It is incomprehensible as to why this adolescent girl PW-11 had chosen to sleep in the house of the deceased when her house was situated within a short distance from there. The only irresistible inference was that PW-11 could not have been present at the scene house. [62C-D;63B-D] 
 3.2 The admission of PW-1 in the cross-examination that the D.S.P. came to the place of occurrence at 8.00 or 8.30 a.m. on 28.5.1975 and stayed there for about 5 or 10 minutes and that the S.H.O. came 10 minutes before the arrival of D.S.P., when examined along with the glaring admission of PWQ-3 that all the witnesses had a consultation before lodging the report, gave an impression that the report was obtained from PW-1 only at the scene place at a later point of time and thereafter the case was registered. [64E-G] 
 4. No adverse inference could be drawn by refusal of accused No. 2 from participating in identification parade as the case of the prosecution that the appellants were in the house of the deceased after perpetrating the heinous crime till the late arrival of PWs 5 and 6 along with PWs 1 and 3 was not acceptable; and it was admitted by PW-5 that he had seen the accused in the police station during the course of investigation.
