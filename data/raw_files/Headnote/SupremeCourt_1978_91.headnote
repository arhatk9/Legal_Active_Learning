 The appellant was tried, convicted and sentenced to death under Section 302, Penal Code for the double murder of Kartar Singh and Mada Singh deceased, by the Sessions Judge, Ganganagar. He was further convicted for offences under Sections 307, 459, 460 and 380 Penal Code. The case of the prosecution rested mainly on the confessional statement, Ex.
 p.27, part from supporting circumstantial evidence. The learned Sessions Judge found that the confessional statement though retracted at the time of examination under Section 313, Criminal Procedure Code, had been voluntarily made by the accused and that it was true and had been corroborated in some particulars by the other evidence on record.
 Shankaria's appeal to the High Court was dismissed, the reference made by the Sessions Judge was accepted and the conviction and sentence of death were confirmed.
 In appeal by special leave, it was contended that (i) the confession was not voluntarily made but was the result of police pressure, inducement and coercion and that this inference was deducible among others, from several features of the case. (ii) after the preliminary questioning, the Magistrate hardly give 20 minutes to the appellant for reflection before recording his confession, which according to the ruling of this Court in Sarwan Singh v. State of Punjab [1957] INSC 34; [1957] SCR 953 the Magistrate should have sent the accused back for at least 24 hours to jail to think and decide, as to whether or not he should make a confession and (iii) there is reason to suspect that after recording the confession, the appellant was handed back to the Police Superintendent who then took him to Hanumangarh. If that be a fact, it would amount to a contravention of subsection (3) of Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, giving rise to an inference that the confession was not voluntary.
 Dismissing the appeal, the Court 
HELD : 1. A confession recorded u/s 164 Criminal Procedure Code, if voluntarily and truthfully made, is an efficacious proof of guilt. [744 B-C] 
2. When in a capital case the prosecution demands, a conviction of the accused, primarily on the basis of his confession recorded under s. 164 Criminal Procedure Code, the Court must apply a double test;
 (1) Whether the confession was perfectly voluntary ? (2) If so, whether it is true and trustworthy ? Satisfaction of the first test is a sine qua non for its admissibility in evidence. If the confession appears to the Court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise, such as is mentioned in Section 24, Evidence Act, it must be excluded and rejected brevi manu. In such a case, the question of proceeding further to apply the 737 second test, does not arise. If the first test is satisfied, the Court must before acting upon the confession, reach the finding that what is stated therein is true and reliable. For judging the reliability of such a confession, or for that matter of any substantive piece of evidence, there is no rigid canon of universal application. Even so, one broad method which may be useful in most cases for evaluating a confession, may be indicated. The Court should carefully examine the confession and compare it with, the rest of the evidence, in the light of the surrounding circumstances and probabilities of the case. If on such examination and comparison, the confession appears to be a probable catalogue of events and naturally fits in with the rest of the evidence and the surrounding circumstances, it may be taken to have satisfied the second test. [744 C-F] 
3. (a) In the instant case. both these tests were satisfied. The confession (Ex. P-27) was found to be voluntary and true. Its perusal showed that there was nothing improbable or unbelievable in it. It appeared to be a spontaneous account, studded with such vivid details about the manner of committing the crimes in question, which only their perpetrator could know. The physical facts found at the spot in the morning following the night of occurrence, told a tale which was consistent with the one told by the accused in his confession. Among these physical facts was a dibbi bearing finger-prints, one of which according to the Expert of the Government Finger Print Bureau, tallied with the specimen finger-print of the, accused. The accused's finger-print on the dibbi which was seized from the spot and sealed before the arrest of the accused, and the seals on which remained intact till they were opened by the Finger- Print Expert, was a tell-tale circumstance, pointing towards the guilt of the accused. r 752 D, F, 754 D, 759 Al (b) The confessional statement received assurance from the other evidence also.
 (i) It was corroborated by the medical evidence in regard to the nature of the weapon (kassi) with which according to the confession the injuries were inflicted. This fact was further confirmed by the report of the Serologist who found human blood on the kassi.
 (ii) The moulds of the bare-foot prints found at the scene of crime, according to the Expert, tallied with the specimen foot-moulds of the accused.
 (iii) Although, by itself, such track evidence could not be deemed sufficient to carry conviction, yet it was a relevant circumstance which taken into account along with the other evidence, reinforced the conclusion as to the identity of the culprit. [755 B, C, 759 D, E] 
4. The condition precedent for recording a confession by a Magistrate in the course of Police Investigation, is provided in Section 164(2) Cr. P.C. which mandates the Magistrate riot to record any confession, unless upon questioning the accused person making it, he has reason to believe that it is being made voluntarily. In the instant case, the Magistrate fully complied with the condition. The large number of clear and pointed questions put by the Magistrate to the accused for this purpose and the answers given by the latter shows that the Magistrate had cogent reasons to believe that the confession was being voluntarily made. [749 E, F-G] 
5. How much time for reflection should be allowed to In accused person before recording his confession, is a question which depends on the circumstances of each case.
 The object of giving such time for reflection to the accused. is to ensure that he is completely free from police influence. If immediately before the recording of the confession, the accused was in judicial custody beyond the reach of the investigating police for some days, then such custody from its very nature, may itself be a factor dispelling fear or influence of the police from the mind of the accused. In such a case, it may not be necessary to send back the accused person for any prolonged period to jail or judicial lock-up before recording his confession.
 In the instant case, the accused was got admitted to the judicial lock-up on the 12th June for getting his confession recorded under s. 164 Cr. P.C., and, such admission was made 738 under the orders of the Magistrate who, ultimately recorded his confession on the 14th June. The accused was for about two days in judicial custody beyond the reach of the Police.
 On June 13, 1974 a written request was made to the Magistrate by the Police, for recording the confession of the accused. Even then the Magistrate postponed the recording of the confession till the following day, obviously because he wanted to give the appellant one day more in judicial custody to ponder over the matter free from Police influence. On the 14th June, notwithstanding the fact that the accused Shankaria was in judicial custody from the evening of the 12th June, the Magistrate after the preliminary questioning, allowed 15 minutes more to the accused for reflection. Thus, the accused had in fact about 38 or 40 hours in judicial custody, immediately preceding the confession, and this was rightly considered sufficient to secure to him freedom from fear or influence of the Police.

6. There was no infringement of sub-section (3) of s. 164 Crl. P.C. According to the testimony of the Magistrate (PW 6) and the Superintendent of police (PW 22) the custody of the accused was no handed to the to the investigating officer, but to the Challani guard who escort under trials to and from Jail/ Judicial' guard.[751 E-F, 754A] Regarding the sentence:
 
7. The crimes were committed in a most brutal and dastardly fashion. The victim were taken unawares when asleep. Two of them were blind. The Neronian conduct of the accused even after the occurrence, in languishing in the stricken premises, looking for something to cat in the kitchen, drinking water, smoking bidis, bringing water and bathing himself, mindless of the specter of the slain and the groans and gasps of the dying, betrays an extreme depravity of character. The grisly and gruesome nature of the murders, the hapless and helpless state of the victims, the fiendish modus operandi of the appellant the first kill and then steal- all, the heart of law to call for its extreme penalty.
