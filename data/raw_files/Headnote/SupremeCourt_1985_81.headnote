 The respondent-State issued notice u/s. 54 of the Bombay Town Planning Act 1954 (for short the Act) read with Rule 27 of the Bombay Town Planning Rules 1955 (for short the Rules) to the appellants to hand over possession of their lands lying within the limits of Borough Municipality of Ahmedabad to the Municipal Corporation of Ahmedabad as the same had vested absolutely - in the Municipal Corporation free from all encumbrance u/s 53 (a) of the Act and were required for construction of roads and other public purposes. The appellants challenged before the High Court under Art. 226 the constitutional validity of s. 54 of the Act and Rule 27 of the Rules. The High Court dismissed the writ petitions holding; (i) that the rights of the local authority (to own and obtain possession of such lands) with the corresponding liability of the occupants to suffer eviction therefrom did not exist under the general 11' law prior to the making of the Final Scheme , that such rights and liabilities were created for the first time by the Final Scheme which is to be read as part of the Act and since the Act while creating these new rights and liabilities provided for a special and particular remedy for enforcing them under s. 54 , the remedy of summary eviction must be held to be an exclusive remedy and the liability to eviction arising under s. 53 (a) or (b) cannot be enforced by the ordinary remedy of a suit; (ii) that s 54 conferred upon the local authority a quasi-judicial power and not administrative power and as such it was bound , in conformity with the principles of natural justice , to give an opportunity of hearing to the occupants before taking the threatened action of summary eviction and therefore no question of section being bad in law arose; and (iii) that since Rule 27 did not contain any express exclusion of such hearing and since s.54 impliedly required the observance of principles of natural justice on the part of the local authority 615 while exercising the power of summary eviction , the said requirement must also be read in Rule 27 and so read the Rule could not be regarded as ultra vires the section.
 In appeals to this Court , the appellants contended that even proceeding on the basis that s. 54 impliedly required a hearing to be given and consequently such a requirement could be read into Rule 27 which was asubordinate piece of legislation , there was no corrective machinery provided for by way of an appeal or revision to any superior authority against an adverse order that may be passed by the local authority acting under Rule 27 and in the absence of any such corrective machinery the entire provision must be held to be bad in law and therefore the impugned notices served on the appellants should be quashed.
 Dismissing the appeals , ^ 
 HELD: (1) Mere absence of a corrective machinery by way of appeal or revision by itself would not make the Power unreasonable or arbitrary , much less would render the provision invalid. Regard will have to be had to several factors , such as , on whom the power is conferred whether on a high official or a petty officer , what is the nature of the power-whether the exercise thereof depends upon the subjective satisfaction of the authority or body on whom it is conferred or is it to be exercised objectively by reference to some existing facts or tests , whether or not it is a quasi-judicial power requiring that authority or body to observe principles of natural justice and make a speaking order etc.; the last mentioned factor particularly ensures application of mind on the part of the authority or body only to pertinet or germane material on the record excluding the extraneous and irrelevant and also subjects the order of the authority or body to a judicial review under the writ jurisdiction of the Court on grounds of perversity , extraneous influence , malafides and other blatant infirmities. Moreover all these facts will have to be considered in the light of the scheme of the enactment and the purpose intended to be achieved by the concerned provision. If on an examination of the scheme of the enactment as also the purpose of the concerned provision it is found that the power to decide or do a particular thing is conferred on a very minor or petty officer , that the exercise thereof by him depends on his subjective satisfaction , that he is expected to exercise the power administratively without any obligation to make a speaking order then , of courtesy , the absence of a corrective machinery will render the provision conferring such absolute and unfettered power invalid. But it is the cumulative effect of all these factors that will render the provision unreasonable or arbitrary and liable to be struck down.
 [619F-H; 620A-D] (2) In the instant case , it is at the stage of execution of a town planning scheme that the power of summary eviction of occupants who have ceased to be entitled to occupy the plots in their occupation has been conferred upon the Local Authority itself-a highly responsible body , and that the power is required to be exercised by it in objective manner (it is to be found by reference to the Final Scheme and its interpretation whether the occupants are occupying 616 lands which they are not entitled to occupy.) Further , as already held by the High Court , the power conferred upon the local Authority is a quasi-judicial power which implies that the same has to be exercised after observing the principles of natural justice , and that too by passing a speaking order which implies giving of reasons and that ensures the application of mind to only germane or relevant material on the record eschewing extraneous and irrelevant , Moreover any order of summary eviction based on any extraneous , non- germane , irrelevant or malafide considerations would be subject to the writ jurisdiction of Court.
