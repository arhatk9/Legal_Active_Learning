 The appellant with his five sons constituted a Hindu undivided family and up to the assessment year 1950-51 the income received by the appellant was assessed to tax as the income of the H.U.F. The previous year of the Hindu Undivided Family for each assessment year was from October I to September 30 of the following year. The property of the Joint Family was partitioned on November 19, 1949. For the assessment year 1951-52 the income tax Officer assessed the appellant's income as that of the H.U.F. in appeal, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner directed that the income earned between October I and November 18, 1949 should be treated as that of the H.U.F. and excluded from the assessment. The I.T.O. thereafter made two orders of assessment, assessing Rs. 18,52.00 earned upto November 18 as the income of the old H.U.F. and assessing the balance also as income of a Hindu undivided family and liable to tax in the hands of the appellant by the application of s.
 16(3)(a)(ii), of the Income Tax Act, 1922. The appellant the* applied for rectification of an error in the second order of assessment under s. 35 of the Act claiming that his income assessed as that of an H.U.F.. Section 16(3) (a)(ii) did not apply. The I.T.O. accepted the plea that s.
 16(3)(a)(ii) did not apply to an H.U.F. but declined to give relief holding that for the period between November 19 1949 and September 30, 1950, the appellant should have been assessed as an, individual.
 A petition filed by the appellant in the High Court under Article 226 challenging the order of the I.T.O. was dismissed by a Single Judge holding, inter alia, that the appellant had not applied in revision to the Commissioner under section 33-A. A division Bench dismissed an appeal against the order of the single judge observing that the rectification under section 35 was "discretionary", and if the I.T.O. thought that the proceedings were "substantially fair" he was "not bound to rectify the assessment on technical grounds".
 On appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The income from November 19, 1949 onwards being assessed to tax as-the income of a Hindu undivided family consisting of the appellant, his wife and a new born minor son. s. 16(3)(a)(ii) plainly did not apply and writs must issue for the rectification of the appellant's assessments, Gowli Buddanna v. The Commissioner of Income-tax Mysore (1) 60 I.T.R. 293; N. V. Narendra Nath v. Commissioner of Wealth tax, (2) 74 I.T.R. 190, referred to. [686 E-F] The High Court was wrong in assuming that exercise of the power under s. 35 to rectify an error apparent from the record was discretionary and the Income-tax Officer could, even if the conditions for its exercise were shown to exist, decline to exercise the power. If a statute invests 684 a public Officer with authority to do an act in a specified set of circumstances, it is imperative upon him to exercise his authority in a manner appropriate to the case when a party interested and having a right to apply moves in that behalf and circumstances for exercise of authority are shown to exist. Even if the words used in the statute are prima facie enabling, the Courtswill readily infer a duty to exercise power which is invested in aid of enforcement of a right-public or private-of a citizen. [688 G, 689] While accepting the appellant's plea that the income of his minor children was not liable to be included in his assessment in the status of an H.U.F. his right to obtain the benefit of rectification could not be refused by changing the status on the basis of which the original assessment was made without investigating, after due notice, whether in assessing the income for the period November, 19, 1949 to September 30, 1950, a mistake in fact was committed.
 [688 B-C] Because a revision application could have been moved for an order correcting the order of the Income Tax Officer under s. 35, but was not moved, the High Court was not justified in dismissing as not maintainable the writ petition, which was entertained and was heard on the merits.
