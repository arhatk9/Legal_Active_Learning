 Thee appellant was declared elected in February 1967 from the Bhander Assembly constituency in District Datia of the State of Madhya Pradesh a seat which was reserved for a scheduled caste candidate. Under the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order 1950 and Scheduled Tribes Lists (Modification) Order 1956 the President of India had declared in respect of District Datia the various castes which were to be recognised as Scheduled castes. In items thereof the castes mentioned were : 'Chamar, Ahirwar, Chamar Mangam, Mochi and Raidas.' The respondent, an unsuccessful candidate at the said election filed an election petition inter alia on the ground that the appellant, was a Jatav by caste and therefore not a member of any of the scheduled castes mentioned in the Presidential Order. The appellant contended that the Jatav caste was a sub-caste of the caste chamar mentioned in the order. The High Court decided against the appellant who appealed to this Court.
 
HELD : From the evidence there was little room for doubt that although at one time Jatavs might have been chamars but they became a distinct caste or came to be recognised as a separate caste several years ago. The fact that they were shown separately as a caste in the Madhya Bharat and several others states in the Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribes Order (Amendment) Act 1956 shows that the existence of Jatav caste was recognised. [642 C] The evidence in the form of representations made by the members of Jatav community including the returned candidate himself apart from other oral evidence, established the existence if Jatav caste even in Datia district but it so happened that it was not included either in the Act of 1956 or the Presidential Order among the Scheduled Castes. [642 E] If the matter were res-integra there might have been a good deal of difficulty in reconciling with the constitutional provisions the scheme followed in the Presidential Orders by which the same caste has been included in some districts of the same State and excluded in other districts. This Court, however in Bhaiyalal v. Balkishan Singh & Ors. made observa- tions repelling the contention that under Art. 341 of the Constitution the president was not authorised to limit the notification to parts of a State. [644 C] In Bhaiyalal's case it was also held that the plea that though the appellant was not a chamar as such he could claim the same status by reason of the fact that he belonged to the Dohar caste which is a sub-caste of the chamar caste, could not be accepted. An inquiry of that kind was held not be permissible having regard to the provision of Art. 341 of the Constitution. The case of Basavalingappa v.
 Munichinnappa was referred 633 to. Following these two decisions it must be held that the returned candidate, in the present case, was not entitled to establish that Jatav caste was the same as Chamar. [644 F-H] the appeal must accordingly be dismissed.
 Bhaiyalal v. Harikishan Singh, [1965] INSC 22; [1965] 2 S.C.R. 877 and Basavalingappa v. Munichinnappa, [1964] INSC 199; [1965] 1 S.C.R. 316, applied.
