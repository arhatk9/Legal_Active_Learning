 The assessee whose head office was in India was also carrying on business in the Federated Malaya States. In respect of the assessment year 1951-52, the assessee claimed that a loss was incurred as a result of the sale of house properties and rubber gardens. Those properties were pur- chassed by the assessee, in Malaya, during the Japanese occupation, in Japanese currency, but sold in Malayan currency after enemy occupation had ceased. The Income-tax Officer scaled down the purchase prices in accordance with the Schedule of rates contained in the Debtor and Creditor (Occupation Period) Ordinance, 1948, of the Federated Malaya States. The result was that the assessee was shown to have made a profit instead of suffering any loss. On appeal by the assessee, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the Appellate Tribunal confirmed the order of the Income-tax Officer. The Tribunal also refused to state a case to the High Court and the High Court rejected the assessee's application to direct the Tribunal to do so. The assessee appealed to the Supreme Court.
 
 HELD: The Income-tax Officer was justified in adopting the schedule appended to the Ordinance for the purpose of ascertaining the cost price of the properties in Malayan Currency. [831 A-B] When a property is purchased in one currency and sold in another, the profit or loss -can be ascertained only when the conversion rate of the two currencies is known. The only material available to the officer for determining that common standard was the Schedule in the Ordinance. Though the Ordinance does not in terms apply to the scaling down of the cost price was enacted for the purpose of scaling down payments made by debtors to creditors during the occupation period-still, it was the result of a careful enquiry made by appropriate and responsible authorities in Malaya. Even if he bad adopted some other method in the previous years it did not prevent him from utilizing the correct method for the assessment year. [830 C; 830 G-831 A; 831 B-C] S. L. N.
