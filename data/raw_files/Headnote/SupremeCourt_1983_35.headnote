 The petitioner who joined the respondent Company as Sub Editor rose to the position of Assistant Editor in 1976. On completing the age of sixty years he was served with a notice of retirement dated November 6, 1976 informing him that he stood retired with effect from December 1, 1976. He was paid and he willingly received his dues on account of gratuity and Provident Fund following such retirement.
 Thereafter, he was offered fresh employment as an Assistant Editor for a period of twelve months under a contract. He accepted the employment on that basis. On the expiry of the period of twelve months, he raised a dispute alleging that his services had been wrongly terminated with effect from December 1, 1976 and that he was entitled to continue in service.
 The Labour Court held (1) that he had actually retired from service with effect from December 1, 1976, on reaching the age of superannuation and had received his gratuity and Provident Fund; (ii) that he entered into a fresh agreement with full knowledge of its contents and consequences and took up fresh employment with the employer for a period of twelve months only and (iii) therefore his case not being one of retrenchment, he is not entitled to the claim for reinstatement. Hence the petition for Special Leave to appeal against the Award. Dismissing the petition, the Court ^ 
 HELD 1 : 1. The subsequent service of the petitioner arose on a fresh contract and cannot be regarded as a continuation of the original service.[687 F] 1 : 2 The respondent employer is a Newspaper establishment, and Section 14 of the Working Journalist (Conditions of Service and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1955 provides that the provisions of the Industrial Employment (Standing Order's) Act, 1946, as in force for the time being will apply to every newspaper establishment. The Bengal Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Rules 1946 were amended by the State Government by a Notification dated October 14, 1946 and Rule 2 A directed that matters relating to superannuation would be additional included in the Schedule to the Industrial Employment (Standing Order) Act 1946. In the result the standing order 685 drawn up and applied by the respondent providing for retirement on reaching the age of superannuation fell within the scope of its powers. The relevant standing order provided that a Working Journalist would retire at the age of 60 years. On attaining that age, the petitioner's services ceased, and nothing more was required. In fact in acceptance of that position he drew his gratuity and Provident Fund dues. [687 D-G] 2 : 1. The age of superannuation marks the end point of the workman's services. If he is employed at least thereafter for a term, such employment cannot be regarded as employment contemplated within the definition of the expression "retrenchment" in Section 2 (00) of the Industrial Disputes Act. [689 A-B] 2 : 2. Section 25 'F' applies where a workman is retrenched and therefore the fresh employment of the petitioner not falling within the definition of "retrenchment" his case can not be governed by Section 25 'F'.
