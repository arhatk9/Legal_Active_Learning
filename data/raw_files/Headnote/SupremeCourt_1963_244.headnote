 The appellant transferred a certain amount from its Consolidated Revenue Account to the Investment Reserve Fund which it was entitled to do; By this transfer the appellant's surplus on which tax has to be assessed was reduced. The Income-tax Officer directed the appellant to reduce the transfer by a certain amount. The appellant challenged this direction.
 Held : (per Sarkar and Shah, JJ.) The assessment of the profits of an insurance business is by s. 10(7) of the Act completely governed by the rules in the Schedule to the Act and there is no general power in the Income-tax Officer to correct any error apart from these rules. Of these rules, rr. 2(b) and 3(b) were relevant to the present case.
 881 Under r. 2(b) of the Schedule the Income-tax Officer had no power to change the figures in the account of the assessee while r. 3(b) only compelled the Income-tax Officer to allow certain deductions and to include certain amounts in making the assessment. None of these rules warranted the adjustment of accounts made by the Income-tax Officer.
 Neither was it justified by the proviso to r. 3(b).
 (Per Hidayatullah J.)., (i) The Income-tax Act contemplates that the assessment of insurance companies should be carried out not according to the ordinary principles applicable to business concerns as laid down in s. 10 of the Income-tax Act.
 (ii) If the Income-tax Officer doubts the accounts his powers are defined by the proviso to r. 3(h). The proviso requires him to consult the Controller of Insurance. The proviso negatives the existence of a separate general power.
 Action has to be taken in the manner laid down in the proviso or not at all.
 (iii) In the present case the Income-tax Officer did not follow the proviso at all and therefore the impugned adjustment was improperly made.
