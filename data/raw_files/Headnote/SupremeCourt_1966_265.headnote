 The appellant was holding a substantive post as a Class II officer of the Western Railway. He was promoted to an officiating position as a Class I officer by the General Manager, with the approval of the Railway Board, as per r.
 134 of the Indian Railway Establishment Code. While he was officiating in that post, a private complaint was filed against him for offences under ss. 166 and 167, I.P.C.
 On the question whether sanction of the President of India was necessary under s. 197, Criminal Procedure Code, for prosecuting him, 
HELD : The appellant was not a public servant who was "not removable from his office save by or with the sanction of the Central Government" within the meaning of the section and, therefore, such sanction was not necessary. [292 C; 296 G-H] (1) A Railway officer who merely officiates in Class I cannot be said to belong to that Class within the meaning of Item I of Schedule 11, referred to in r. 1729 of the Discipline and Appeal Rules for Gazetted ,Officers (Indian Railway Establishment Code). He continues to be a Class II officer who could. be removed from his office with the sanction of the Railway Board. [294 F-G] (2) Section 2 of the Railway Board Act, 1905, indicates that the Railway Board is an entity separate from the Central Government and that the powers of the Board are derived by delegation, either absolutely ,or subject to conditions, by the Central Government. Therefore, the Railway Board is not a part of the Central Government. [296 E-F] (3) The appellant could not be deemed to be removable only by or with the sanction of the Central Government on the basis of the maxim qui facit per alium facit per se. For, once the Central Government has delegated its power to the Railway Board with regard to the appointment and removal of a public servant, then, for the purpose of s. 197, Cr.P.C., the public servant concerned will not be treated as one "not removable from his office except by or with the sanction of the Central Government." [297 A-C] Afzalur Rahman v. The King. [1943] F.C.R. 7, applied.
 (4) The Note to r. 1704, and r. 1705, would not apply to the appellant, as the first applies only to non-gazetted officers, and the second came into force on 1st August 1961, after the complaint against him was filed. [295 B, D] 291
