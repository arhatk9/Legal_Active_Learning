 In Md. Ibrahim v. State of U.P. etc. (C.A. No. 941A of 1976 etc. etc. decided on 6-12-1976), this Court set aside the judgment of the Allahabad HIgh Court passed in the Writ Petition quashing the orders of the City Magistrate and Session Judge u/s. 144 Crl. P.C., holding that High Court committed an error in pronouncing views on the 'orders passed by the criminal courts when they ceased to be operative and in giving finding on rights, title and property ,in a petition u/A 226 and227 'of the Constitution.
 In the Review Petition,the Review Petitioners contended that unless the court mentioned the correct principles on which jurisdiction is to be exercised u/s 144 Crl. P.C. by Magistrates, they may continue to exercise them on wrong principles.
 Dismissing the Petition the Court, 
HELD : 1. No hard and fast rules can be laid down for guidance in exercising a power on which decisions must necessarily be governed by the existing situation in each case. It has to be judged on facts and circumstances existing at a particular place at a particular time. [421CD] 
2. S. 144 confers a jurisdiction "to direct any person to abstain from a certain act or to take certain order with certain property in his possession or under his management".
 [420C] 
3. The kind of orders u/s 144(3) which "may be directed to a particular individual or to the public generally when frequenting or visiting a Particular place are intended only to prevent dangers to life health, safety or peace and tranquility of members of the public. A person may be prevented from doing something even upon his own property provided that the doing of a perfectly legal act constitutes a danger to human life, health or safety of others or to public peace and tranquility. They are only temporary orders which cannot last beyond two months from the making thereof. [420C-D] 
4. Questions of title cannot be decided for the first time either in a Writ Petition or in a proceeding u/s 144 Crl.
 P.C. at all, as the remedy lies by way ,of a Civil Suit for an injunction. But, previous judgments on them may have a hearing on the question whether, and, if so, what order should be passed u/s. 144 Crl. P.C. The magistrate is not concerned. with individual rights in performing his duty u/s 144 Crl. P.C. but he has to determine what may reasonably necessary or expedient in a situation of which he is the best judge. [420DE, 421A]
