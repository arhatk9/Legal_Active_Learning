 The respondent-plaintiff filed a suit under s. l2(l)(f) of the Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act, 196l, for eviction of the appellant-tenant, on the ground of personal necessity. The trial court rejected the plaintiffs claim that he was the owner of the house in question.
 On appeal, the Additional District.judge confirmed the finding of the trial court on the ground that the plaintiff did not produce the deed of partition, alleged to have been executed by the parties and, under which the house in question was said to have been allotted to him. In second appeal, the High Court reversed the finding and decreed the suit.
 In the appeal to this Court, on behalf of the tenant it was contended that it was essential for the plaintiff- respondent to establish that he was the owner of the premises, and that the concurrent finding of fact recorded by first two courts was binding on the High Court under s.
 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure and its reversal was illegal.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
 HELD: 1.1 The High Court's power to interfere with the finding of fact reached by the first appellate court cannot be denied if, when the lower appellate court decides an issue of fact, a substantial question of law arises, even PG NO 276 PG NO 277 though the High Court, while hearing the appeal under s. 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, has no jurisdiction to re- appraise the evidence and reverse the conclusion reached by the first appellate court.[280C] The court is under a duty to examine the entire relevant evidence on record and if it refuses to consider important evidence having direct B bearing on the disputed issue and the error which arises is of a magnitude that it gives birth to a substantial question of law, the High Court is fully authorised to set aside the finding. [280D] 1.2 A perusal of the language of the clause (f) of s.
 12(l) of the Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act, 1961, and comparison there of with that in the other clauses clearly indicates that it is essential for the plaintiff who claims that he requires the shop personally for starting a business, to establish that he is the owner of the premises.
 [278G-H] In the instant case, though the partition deed under which the D plaintiff claims exclusive title to the property was not produced in court, the first appellate court was under a duty to consider all the relevant evidence led by the parties along with the circumstances. The Civil Judge, who tried the suit as well as the Additional District Judge, confirming the decision of the trial court, had seriously erred in not considering the entire evidence on record including the reply to the notice sent by the plaintiff-respondent, wherein the tenant-appellant has accepted the plaintiff's title and counter-foil receipts signed by the appellant in which the plaintiff had been described as the owner of the property. In the circumstances, the High Court was fully justified in reversing the finding of the courts below. [279E, F-G, 280A]
