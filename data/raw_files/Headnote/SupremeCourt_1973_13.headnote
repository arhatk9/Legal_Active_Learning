 The petitioner challenged the order passed by the U.P. State Government on 26-1-1971 nominating 2/3rds of the total number of members of the committee of the management of the petitioner purporting to act under section 34 of the U.P.
 Cooperative Societies Act, 1965. The subscribed paid up capital of the Federation on 30-6-1969 was Rs. 34.04 lakhs.
 of this, the State Government owned shares of the value of Rs. 20 lakhs. The percentage of the State Government in the share holding was 58.75%. The State Government's contention Was that the membership of some co-operative bank had been terminated and, therefore the share capital was reduced by Rs. 53,000/-. The State Government also contended that another member, District Cooperative Federation, Saharanpur retired Rs. 50,0001- out of his share capital with the Federation. The State Government, therefore, claimed that its share holding had gone to 60% and, therefore, had a right under s. 34 to nominate its nominees to the committee of the management. The petitioner challenged the order on the ground that the condition precedent of the State Government holding 60% of the shares in the share capital of the Federation was not fulfilled. It also raised several other grounds including the constitutional validity of Sec.
 34 of the Act.
 Allowing the writ petition, 
HELD : (i) The provisions of the Act and Rules indicate that the Co-operative banks did not cease to be the members, as there was no resolution removing the banks from membership.
 Rule 32 indicates that there is no reduction of share capital a& the shares of the banks were not transferred to any other person. The shares still stood in the name of the co-operative banks and the share capital was not reduced by Rs. 53,000/-. [408H; 409A-C] 403 (ii) Saharanpur District Cooperative Federation was still a member, as it was not removed from membership. It share money cannot be taken out of share capital fund and treated as security money. The shares were not kept in security. Even if the shares were in security, the shares remained in specie. The share capital of the petitioner was not reduced by Rs. 50,0001-. [409F-H; 410A-C] (iii) As the shares in both the cases were still part of the share capital, the State Government was not justified to exercise right under section 34 of the Act. [410DL-F]
