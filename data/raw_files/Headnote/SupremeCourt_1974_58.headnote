 Pursuant to an order of detention under s. 3 (1)(a) (ii) read with s. 3 (2) of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971 the petitioner was arrested for hurling, soda water bottles, brickbats and bombs indiscriminately on a group of persons on different dates. The order of detention said that if left free and unfettered the petitioner was likely to continue to disturb maintenance of public disorder by acting, in a similar manner. in an earlier criminal case the petitioner was discharged by the court since no witness dared to depose against him in open court. Thereafter the petitioner was detained under the Act.
 In a petition under Art. 32 it was contended : (1) that the detention was mala fide because the petitioner was detained under the Act after his discharge by the court for want of evidence (2) that there had been a long interval of nine months between the criminal incidents and the detention order, (3) that the order of detention which did not specify a period was violative of s. 12 of the Act and (4) that the detention was founded on prevention of public disorder while the acts imputed to the petitioner were aimed at a particular person, not the general public, Dismissing the petition, 
HELD : Merely because the detaining authority had chosen to base the, order of detention on the discharge of the petitioner by the court for want of evidence it cannot be held that the order was bad in law. This branch of jurisprudence, as interpreted by this Court, has made it futile for a detenu to urge that because the grounds of detention have been the subject matter of criminal cases which have ended in discharge, therefore, the order of detention was mala fide. The basic imperative of proof beyond reasonable doubt does not apply to the subjective satisfaction component of imprisonment for reasons of internal security. There may be extreme cases where the court had held a criminal case to. be false and the detaining authority with that judicial pronouncement before him, may not reasonably claim to be satisfied about prospective prejudicial activities based on what a court has found to be baseless. In the present case where the order of discharge was made purely for want of evidence on the scope that witnesses were too afraid to depose against a desperate character cannot come under the exceptions carved out by the court to this category. [616C-F] .
 (2) it is true that there must be a live link between the grounds of criminal, activity alleged by the detaining authority and the purpose of detention. This credible chain is snapped if there is too long and unexplained an interval between, the offending acts and the order of detention. If the detaining authority takes the chance of conviction and, when the court verdict goes against it, falls back on its detention power to punish one whom the court would not convict, it is an abuse and virtual nullification of the judicial process. But if honestly finding a dangerous person getting away with it by overawing witnesses or concealing the commission cleverly, an authority thinks on the material before him that there is likelihood of and need to interdict public disorder at his instance he may validly direct detention. in the present case the acts were serious, being bomb hurling and brickbat 'throwing in public places creating panic. Involvement of the Petitioner was discovered only during the investigation of the offences. No ground exists for dismissing this statement as sham or factitious.

 (3) The argument that detention without defined duration is ipso jure invalid ,cannot be sustained. No responsible government should or would be irresponsive to the claim of citizen's freedom.

 (4) The nature of the act, the circumstances of its commission, the impact on people around and such like factors constitute the pathology of public disorder. These acts cannot be isolated from their public setting nor is it possible to analyse its molecules as in a laboratory but take its total effect on the flow of orderly life. it may be a question of the degree and quality of the activity of the sensitivity of the situation and the psychic response of the involved people. To dissect further is to defeat the purpose of social defence which is the paramount purpose of preventive detention. [623B-C] Mohd. Subrati v. State of West Bengal, [1973] 3 S.C.C.
