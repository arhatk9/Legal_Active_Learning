 The Municipal Council of Bhopal made bye-laws under the provisions of s. 358(7)(f) and (m) read with section 349(ii) of the Madhya Pradesh Municipalities Act, 1961.
 Bye-law 2 provided that no person inching of a motor-bus plying for hire shall for the purpose of taking up or setting down of passengers, park or stop his bus anywhere within the limits of the municipality ,except at the municipal Bus Stand. The other bye-laws provided for a levy of a fee of Re. 1 /- for every 8 hours or part thereof in respect of the use of the bus stand by such buses and for the issue of a permit on such payment. The respondent filed a writ in the High Court of Madhya Pradesh challenging the said bye-laws. The High Court held that bye-law 1 (c).
 which defined the expression 'Municipal Bus Stand' and bye- law 2 were valid but held bye-laws 3 to 7. which provided for the payment of fee and the giving of permit etc., as invalid and restrained the Municipal Council from giving effect to those bye-laws in any manner.
 Dismissing the appeal by certificate filed by the Municipal Council.
 HELD : (i) Section 349(ii) was not applicable to the case.
 The section itself does not enable the Municipal Council to require that permission should be obtained for any purpose.
 It deals with levy- of fees for permissions which are required to be taken for various purposes under other sections of the Act such as sections 187(3), 194 and 223(4).
 The relevant words in the section deal with permissions granted to individuals to temporarily occupy municipal land.
 It would be doing violence to that section to hold that it deals with the provision of a bus-stand. In the context of that section it was difficult to hold that when people were compelled to use the bus stand constructed by the Municipal Council it was a permission for temporary occupation of land belonging to the Council. [276F] (ii) It was not possible to relate the provision of clause (f) of sub-section 7 ,of section 358 as having anything to do with the provision of a bus-stand. As regards clause (m) of sub-section 7, "the regulating and prohibiting the stationing of carts..... on any ground under the control of the Council or the using of such ground as halting place of vehicles cannot be said to relate to the provision of Municipal bus stand. The power to regulate or prohibit the use of Municipal land as halting place of vehicles cannot be used to compel people use such land as halting places.
 Such a power must be specifically given. The power to compel persons in charge of motor buses to stop only at certain places for the purpose of taking up or setting down of passengers is a matter which relates to motor traffic and there is a specific provision in section 68 (2) (4) and (s) of the Motor Vehicles Act for this specific purpose. [277H] 2 75 T. B. Ibrahim v. S.T.C. Tanjore, [1952] INSC 68; [1953] S.C.R. 290. and Municipal Board, Pushkar v. State. Transport Authority, Rajasthan, [1963] Supp. 2 S.C.R. 373, referred to.
 (iii) The bye-laws compel persons in charge of motor buses to use the Municipal bus stand, which the Municipality had no power to do. Consequently it must be held that bye- law 2 is not valid and with it must go the other bye-laws.
 (iv) Further, in the present case the District Magistrate had admittedly declared the Bhopal Municipal Bus Stand as bus stand. Power to specify the place under section 68(2) (r) and (s) vests in the State Government. It has not been shown that the State Government had any power to delegate their power under this section to the District Magistrate,.
 It has also not shown that the District Magistrate issued any notification specifying the' Bhopal Bus Stand as one under the provisions of section 68(2)(r) and (s) of the Motor Vehicles Act. If at all the District Magistrate had taken any action it could only be under s. 76. But that section does not enable him to specify places for setting down or picking up of passengers.
