 Under Regulation 561 of the Civil Service- Regulations a member of the Indian Civil Service, who joined after 1921, was entitled on retirement to an annuity of Rs. 10666-10-8 subject to a minimum of & 1000. Regulation 983 provided that such Officers were entitled to payment of annuity, at the option of the recipient, either in rupees converted into sterling at a rate of exchange declared to exist on the date on which payment fell due, or. at the fixed minimum sterling. If payment was taken in India it would be either in rupees or at the fixed sterling minimum converted into rupees at the rate of exchange declared to exist on the due date. In 1928, the Secretary of State for India laid down the rate of exchange at 1 sh-6 d to a rupee and this rate of exchange continued upto the date of transfer of power to India, namely, 15th August, 1947. On 12th June, 1956, Regu- lation 561 was amended by the President under Art. 309 of the Constitution.As a result of the amendment the Indian members of the Indian Civil Service, on retirement, were entitled to an annuity of Rs. 13,333.33 p payable in India in rupees only. which was equivalent to pond 1000, converted into rupees at the rate of 1 sh 6-d to a rupee. Article 312- A was introduced by the Constitution (Twenty Eighth Amendment) Act, 1972. and it conferred power on Parliament to make a law to vary or revoke, whether prospectively or retrospectively, the conditions of service as respects pension of Persons who, having been appointed by the Secretary of State to a civil service of the Crown in India before the commencement of the Constitution. retired or otherwise ceased to be in service at any time before the commencement of that Amendment Act; Parliament passed the Former Secretary of State Service Officers (Conditions of Service) Act, 1972, and it came into force on 1st October, 1972. Section 7 of the Act provided that all members of the Indian Civil Service who joined the service after 1921 were entitled to an annuity of Rs. 13,333.33 P subject to certain reductions. Section 8 provided that no such officer shall be entitled or be deemed ever to have been entitled to claim, (a) pension in sterling; or (b) that his pension shall be paid outside India; or (c) where his pension was expressed in sterling or a fixed sterling minimum was applicable in respect of the pension payable to him, that his pension shall be computed in the rupee equivalent of the amount fixed in sterling at a rate of exchange exceeding the rate of Rs. 13,333.33 of pond 1000 sterling. Some members, who had joined the Indian Civil Service after 1921 and residing in India, contended that the Regulations could not be amended by the Act, on the ground that it was their basic right to be paid annuity by converting pond 1000 into Indian currency at the official rate of exchange.
 Rejecting the contentions, 
HELD: (1) The 1956-amendment of Regulation 561 does not infringe the provisions of Arts. 14 and 16. It makes no distinction, in the matter of payment of Pension to members of the Indian Civil Service retiring after 12th June, 1956, irrespective of the fact that they are citizens of India or are,of non-Indian domicile, if they draw their pension in India. On or after that date all members of the Indian Civil Service having their residence in India, on retirement, are entitled to their annuity only in India and in rupees alone.
 798 (2) The pension to which these members, were entitled on 15th August, 1947. has not been altered. [793 E] (3) All that has happend as as a result of the 1972-Act is, to lay down that the annuitants are not entitled to claim payment of pension in sterling or outside India or by converting pond 1000 at the rate of exchange exceeding the rate of exchange of Rupees thirteen and one third to the pound sterling. Indian currency is the legal tender and there is no constitutional vice in fixing the rate of exchange and mode of payment by legislation. There are neither basic rights nor merits in the alleged claim. [E- 4(3]
