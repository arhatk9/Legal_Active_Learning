 The appellant assessee owned a cement factory known as Udaipur Cement Works at Udaipur. During the assessment year 1971-72 and 1972-73, the sale of cement was controlled under the Cement Control order, 1967, issued by the Central Government, in exercise of the powers conferred by Sections 18 and 25 of the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act. 1951. Clause 7 of the Control Order specified a retention price of Rs. 161.40 per metric tonne for cement manufactured by all producers, other than those Mentioned in items 1 to 5 of the schedule, which included the assessee.
 Tho maximum price at which a producer could sell cement was prescribed in clause (8) which said that no producer shall sell "any other variety of cement at a price exceeding Rs.
 214.65 per metric tonne free on rail destination railway station plus the excise duty paid thereon", plus "such charges as may be fixed by the Central Government in respect of packing in jute bags or in any other containers". The Explanation to clause 8 clarified that for the purpose of the Control order, the expression 'free on rail destination railway station' means "the price including the cost of transport by the cheapest mode except where any other mode of transport has been specified by the Central Government under clauses (4) at the destination point".
 During the relevant assessment years, the assesses entered into diverse contracts of sale of cement with purchasers at the price of Rs. 214.65 per metric tonne, "free on rail destination railway station" plus packing charges plus excise duty. These contracts were on the terms and conditions set out in the form of "General terms and conditions of supply" adopted by the assessee. The assessee, in fulfilment of these contracts, despatched cement to the purchasers at various destinations by rail and the railway receipts were made out on the basis of 'freight to pay'. The invoices sent by the assessee showed the 'free on rail destination railway station' price of the cement despatched at the rate of Rs. 214.65 per metric tonne and added the amounts representing excise duty and packing charges and deducted the amount of railway freight, since it was to be paid by the purchasers. The assessee did not charge in the invoices sales tax on the railway freight, since in its view it did not form part of the 'sale price'; but in order to provide against a possible claim which might be made by the Sales Tax Authorities, the assessee claimed by way of deposit an amount 'towards contingent liability to sales tax on railway freight to be paid by you' that is, the purchasers.
 277 In the assessment of the assessee to sales tax under the Rajasthan Sales A Tax Act, 1954 and the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, the Sales Tax Authorities took the view that the amount of freight formed part of the "sale price" and was, therefore, liable to be included in the turnover of the assessee for the purposes of assessment of sales tax. The assessee challenged the correctness of the view by filing a Writ petition in the High Court of Rajasthan, but the High Court agreed with the view taken by the Sales Tax Authorities and held that since under clause 8 of the Control order, the price payable by the purr- chasers was f.o.. destination price, the amount of freight included in it formed part of 'sale price Dismissing the appeals, the Court ^ 
 HELD: 1. By reason of the provisions of the Cement Control order 1967, which governed the transactions of sale of cement entered into by the assessee with the purchasers, the amount of freight formed part of the "sale price" within the meaning of the first part of the definition of that term and was includible in the turnover of the assessee. [296 D- E] 
 2. (a) The Control order is paramount; it has over- riding effect and if it stipulates that the freight shall be payable by the producer, such stipulation must prevail, notwithstanding any term or condition of the contract to the contrary and any such term or conditions to the extent to which it is in conflict with the provisions of the control order would stand excluded. It is a statutory order having binding force and effect and it must govern the transactions of sale of cement entered into by the assessee with the purchasers.
 [292 C, 293 B-C, 295 A] (b) The Control order is designed to ensure availability of cement at a uniform prise throughout India irrespective of the distance from the place of manufacture and clause 8 of the order provides a maximum price of Rs.
 214.65 per metric tonne f.o.r. destination railway station at which a producer may sell cement manufactured by him. It was at this maximum price of Rs. 214.65 per metric tonne f.o.r. destination railway station that, in pursuance of this clause, the assessee sold cement to various purchasers.
 The price was clearly inclusive of freight. [292 D-E] li' (c) Under the scheme of the Control order the freight is paid by the producer who then recovers it from the purchaser. Clause 9 clearly contemplates that the f.o.r.
 destination railway station price would be realised by the producer, four the excess of such price over the retention price and selling agency commission is required to be paid over by the producer to the controller in the Cement Regulation Account. The amount of freight has, there- fore, to be realised by the producer from the purchaser and that postulates that it is the producer who pays the freight to the railway authorities. The proviso to clause. (9) makes this doubly clear by providing that "the expenditure incurred by the producer on freight.... shall be reimbursed to the producer and again clause (II) uses the expression" ....paying or equalising the expenditure incurred by the producer on freight". [294 A-C] (d) When the producer pays the freight, he does so because, as between him and the purchaser, he is liable to pay the freight and he then recovers it as part of the price. [294 D-E] 278 (e)If the obligation to pay the freight were on the purchaser, the amount of freight would obviously be deducted from the f.o.r. destination railway station price in the invoice and only the balance would be realised by the assessee. There would be no question of the assessee realising the amount of freight from the purchaser because the purchaser would have paid the freight in discharge of the his own liability and the assessee would have no claim to recover it from the purchaser. Then, the terms of clause 9 proviso to that clause and claue 11 of the Control order would not be satisfied. It would not be possibie to give effect to clause 9, if what is realised by the assessee is not the f.o.r. destination railway price but that price less the amount of freight. The assessee also would not be able to claim to be entitled to be reimbursed under. the proviso to clause 9, if he has not incurred any expenditure on the freight. The entire statutory scheme would become unworkable. [294 E-G] (f ) The scheme of the Control order clearly proceeds on the basis that the freight is payable by the producer and he recovers it from the purchaser as part of the f.o.r.
 destination railway station price. The provision in the contract that the delivery to the purchaser shall be complete as soon as the goods are put on rail and payment of the freight shall be the responsibility of the purchaser. is wholly inconsistent with the scheme of the Control order and must be deemed to be excluded by. it. [294 H, 295 A] 
 3. (a) The definition of Sale Price in section 2(p) of the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, 1954 is in two parts. The first part says that "sale price" means the amount payable to a dealer as consideration for the sale of any goods and therefore, the concept of real price or actual price retainable by the dealer would be irrelevant. The test would be. what was the consideration that passed from the purchaser to the dealer for the sale of the goods. The only relevant question to ask being what was the amount paid by the purchaser to the dealer as consideration for the sale and not as to what was the net consideration retainable by the dealer, it would be immaterial to enquire as to how the amount of consideration was made up, whether it included excise duty or sales tax or freight. [286 D, F-G] The amount of sales tax payable by a dealer, whether included in the price or added to it as a separate item as is usually the case, forms part of the "sale Price". It is payable by the purchaser to the dealer is part of the consideration for the sale of the goods and hence falls within the first part of the definition. And so would be the case regarding the amount of freight and handling charges.
 It would be payable by the Purchaser not under any statutory or other liability but as part of the consideration for sale of the goods and it would therefore form part of "sale price" within the meaning of the first part of the definition.

 279 (b) In a contract of sale f.o.r. destination railway station, the delivery of At goods to the purchaser would be complete at the destination railway station and till then the risk would continue to remain with the dealer. The agreed price being inclusive of the freight, it would be a matter of indifference to the purchaser as to what was the amount of freight paid by the dealer. The dealer may, in such a case, pay the freight and charge the agreed price to the purchaser or he may obtain a railway receipt on the basis of 'freight to pay' and request the purchaser to pay the freight at the time of taking delivery of the goods from the railway at the destination railway station and give the purchaser credit for the amount of the freight against the agreed price. The latter would merely be a convenient mode of paying the agreed price. Though the purchaser can very well refuse to accept the railway receipt which is not 'freight prepaid', but freight to pay', he ordinarily, as a reasonable businessman would, accept such a railway receipt and pay the amount of freight o l behalf of the dealer. When the purchaser, pays the amount of freight, in such a case.
 it would be as part of the agreed price and not as freight vis-a-vis the dealer. The amount of freight paid by the purhaser and shown in the bill as deducted from the agreed price would, therefore, clearly form part of 'sale price' and fall within the first part of the definition. [288 G-H, 289 A-E] (c) In a case, where the contract of sale is not f.o.r.
 destination railway station, but the price alone is so, the contract would not have all the incidents of f.o.r.
 destination railway station 'contract', but merely the price would be stipulated on that basis The terms of such a contract may provide that the delivery shall be complete when the goods are put on rail and thereafter it shall be at the risk of the purchaser. Such a stipulation would make the railway agent of the purchaser for tailing delivery of the goods. The freight in such a case would be payable by the purchaser though the price agreed upon is f.o.r. destination railway station. The price of the goods receivable by the dealer would. in that even, be the f.o.r. destination railway station-price less the amount of freight payable by the purchaser That would be the consideration payable by the purchaser to the dealer for the sale of the goods and the amount of freight being payable by The purchaser would not be included in the 'sale price' within the meaning of the first part of the definition. The position would be the same even if the dealer pays the freight and obtains railway reeeipt "freight pre-paid" and claims the full f.o.r.
 destination railway station price in the bill. The amount representing freight would not be payable as part of the consideration for the sale of the goods but by way of reimbursement of the freight which was payable by the Purchaser but in fact disburse(l by the dealer and hence it would not form part of the 'sale price'.

 4. The second part of the definition enacts an inclusive clause and says that 'sale price' includes "any sum charged for anything done by the dealer in respect of the goods at the time of or before the delivery thereof other than the cost of freight or- delivery or the cost of installation in case where such cost is separately charged".
 Therefore, 'any sum charged for anything done by the dealer in respect or the goods at the time of or before the delivery thereof'. is to be regarded as part of the 'sale price', even if it does not fall within the first part of the definition. But there is an exception carved out of this inclusion Not 280 all sums charged for something done by the dealer in respect of the goods at the time of or before the delivery thereof are covered by the inclusive clause. The cost of freight or delivery or the cost of installation certainly represents an amount charged for transportation or installation of the goods at the time of or before the delivery thereof and would, therefor, fall within the inclusive clause on its plain terms but it is taken out by the exclusion clause, "other than the cost of frieght or delivery or the cost of installation in case where such cost is separately charged".
 [295 C, F] (b) This exclusion clause does not operate as an exception to the first part of the definition. lt merely enacts an exclusion out of the inclusive clause and takes out something, which would otherwise be . within the inclusive clause. obviously, therefore, this exclusion clause can be availed of by the assessee only it the State, seeks to rely on the inclusive clause for the purpose of bringing a particular amount within the definition of 'sale price'. But if the State is able to show that the particular amount falls within the first part of the definition and is therefore, part of the 'sale price', the exclusion clause cannot avail the assessee to take the amount in question out of the definition of 'sale. price'. In the instant case, since the amount of the freight forms part of the 'sale price' within the meaning of the first part of the definition, it is not necessary for the State to invoke the inclusive clause and in fact the State has not done so. The exclusion clause is, therefore, irrelevant and cannot be called in aid by the assessee. [295 F-H, 296 A] (c) Even if the exclusion clause were read as an exception to the first pal-t of the definition which, cannot be done, it cannot avail the assessee. It is only there the cost of fl-eight is separately charged that it would fall within the exclusion clause and in the context of the definition as a whole, it is obvious that the expression ". .. cost of freight . .. is separately charged" is used in contradistinction to a case where the cost of freight is not separately charged but is included in the price. It is not intended to apply to a case where the cost of fright is part of the price but the dealer chooses to split up the price and claim the amount of freight as a separate item in the invoice. Where the cost of freight is part of the price, it would fall within the first part of the definition. and to such a case, the exclusion clause in the second part have no application. [296 A-C] Observation:
 (a) In respect of the assessee's several transactions of cement with the Central Government through the Director General of Supplies and Disposals, the opinion given by the law Department of the Government of India viz., "that freight was not part of 'sale price' within the meaning of the definition of that term and hence no sales tax would be payable by the assessee on the amount of frieght`' was not.
 correct and was unjustified. [296 E-H] (b) As this statement misled the assessee into not claiming the amount of sales tax on the freight component on the price from the Central Government in the circumstances fairness and justice demand that the Central Government, should pay to the assessee the amount of sales tax on the freight component of the price in respect of transactions of sale of cement entered into by the assessee with them under the provisions of the control order.
