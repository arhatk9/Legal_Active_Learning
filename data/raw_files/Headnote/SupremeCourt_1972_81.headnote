 The appellant on 26th July 1966 filed, shipping bill in triplicate before the Joint Chief Controller of Imports and Exports for the porpose of obtaining export licences in respect of 10,160. metric tonnes of iron ore. On 28 July 1966 export licence was granted to the appellant. On 30 July 1966 the agents of the vessel made an application to the Asstt. Collector of Customs, for the grant of entry outward to the said vessel to load iron ore, which was granted- on the same day with permission to ship cargo on board the said vessel. On 1 August, the appellant presented to the Customs authority under section 50 of the Customs Act, 1962., shipping bills in triplicate and the Customs authority made several endorsements on the shipping bill on the same day. On, the2 August 1966, further endorsements-on the shipping bill was made by the Customs authority indicating that the shipment was inspected, checked and payment was made in full.
 On 2 August 1966, a notification was issued by the Ministry of Commerce imposing a duty at the rate of Rs. 10 per metric tonne on lumpy iron ore. and on 28 January 1967, the Customs authority issued a notice to the appellant notifying that goods actually shipped by the appellant were subject to export duty and the appellant was liable to pay Rs. 98044 and the appellant was called upon to show cause as to why the amount should not be recovered from him.
 The appellant contended that the shipping bill was presented to the., Customs authority and the entry outward to-the ship was given prior to 2 August, 1966 when the notification came into force and so, the notification under S. 4A of the Tariff Act 1934 was not applicable to the consignment in question. The Customs authorities held that the appellant was liable to pay the export duty. The appellant impeached the order before the Judicial Commissioner Who also upheld the order of the Customs authorities.
 The only question which arose for decision before this Court was whether the shipment and export of iron ore by the appellant became liable to the said duty introduced on 2 August 1966. The appellant contended that the shipping bill was presented on 1 August, 1966 and the order of the Customs authorities for entry outwards to the vessel was also given on 1 August 1966 and so, the export in the present case was not liable to payment of duty imposed on 2 August 1966. The Customs authorities however contended that the vessel arrived at Marmagoa barhour on 3 August 1966 and the vessel commenced loading on 3 August, 1966, and therefore, under s. 16(i) of the Customs Act 1962, the shipping 875 bill which had been presented before the date of entry outwards "shall be, deemed to be presented at the earliest on 3 August 1966 when the vessel in question arrived.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : In the present case, the Customs authorities acted without jurisdiction in imposing duty on the export by holding that the date of entry outwards of the vessel was the date when the vessel, arrived. Section 38 of the Sea Customs Act 1878 was the Counter-part of Sec. 16 of the Customs Act, 1962. Section 38 had two provisos. Under the first proviso to that old section where shipment was permitted without a shipping bill, the rate of duty was to be the rate in force at the time when the shipment of goods commenced. Under the second proviso, the shipping bill must be deemed to have been delivered on the date on which that vessel arrived or entry outwards was given which ever was later. Under the provisos of S. 38 of the old Act, the Customs authorities had power to apply the rate in force on the date of the arrival of the vessel. Under S. 16 of the 1962 Act, it is not permissible to do so. The statute does not contain such a provision. S. 16 of the 1962 Act speaks of the fictional date only in relation to the order of date of entry outwards of the vessel. In, the present case, the order of entry outwards of the vessel was made prior to 2 August, 1966. Therefore, the Customs authorities. acted without jurisdiction in imposing the duty in question. 1879 G-880 C]
