 In 1942, a scheme was sanctioned under the Bombay Town Planning Act, 1915, for an area under the Ahmedabad Municipal Borough. The Arbitrator appointed under the 1915 Act finalised the scheme. From July 1, 1950, the Borough was converted into the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. The 1915 Act was repealed by the Bombay Town Planning Act 1954, with effect from April 1, 1957. On March 28, 1958, the Arbitrator passed certain orders affecting the appellants.
 Against the decisions of the Arbitrator the appellants preferred appeals before the Board of appeal set up under the Act. The question was whether the appeals were competent.
 Held that no appeal lay from the order of the Arbitrator appointed under the 1915 Act to the Board of Appeal set up under the 1954 Act. Under the 1915 Act an appeal lay from an order of the Arbitrator to the Tribunal of Arbitration.
 In the 1954 Act the Arbitrator was substituted by a Town Planning officer and the Tribunal of Arbitration by Board of Appeal. The saving clause in s. 90 of the 1954 Act continued the appointment of the Arbitrator made under the 1915 Act and also kept alive the proceedings before him, but it did not provide for the continuance of the Tribunal of Arbitration. The Arbitrator did not become a Town Planning officer and his decision or order did not have the effect of an order by the Town Planning officer so as to become appealable to the Board of appeal.
