 Respondent No. 1, an elector in the constituency in his election petition alleged that the appellant, the successful candidate, got printed and published and personally distributed on a large scale throughout the constituency a pamphlet containing statements in relation to the personal character or conduct of one of the candidates, reasonably calculated to prejudice the prospects of his election, and thereby committed the corrupt practice under s. 123(4) of the Representation of People Act, 1950. The High Court allowed the election petition.
 Allowing the appeal- ^ 
 HELD : (1) (a) The allegations mentioned in the document related to the personal character and conduct of one of the candidates and were reasonably calculated to prejudice the prospects of his election. If the distribution of the same by the appellant was established and if it was also established that the statements of facts therein were false and that the appellant either believed them to be false or did not believe them to be true, he would be guilty of corrupt practice under s. 123(4) of the Act. [815 E-G] (b) The charge of electoral corrupt practice being of a quasi-criminal character, the onus on an election petitioner is heavy as if in a criminal charge. The allegations must be established beyond reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of the court by independent and unimpeachable evidence. [817 G- H] 2.(a) There is no doubt that the pamphlet was in existence prior to the date of poll. [817 A-B] (b) The High Court committed a serious error in linking up the printing of the document allegedly at the instance of the appellant, for which there was no evidence whatsoever, with the distribution of the same by the appellant in the constituency. It further committed an error of law in not dealing with the two matters of printing and its distribuion separately and independently. [819 F-H] (c) The High Court did not adopt a uniform standard in appreciating the evidence of the witnesses of the contending parties. Nor was it right in its conclusion that the charge of distribution of the pamphlet by the appellant was established against him. While one of the defeated candidates took care to prepare a panchnama for the distribution of the offending pamphlet by the agents of the appellant, and lodged a complaint with the returning officer, there was no documentary evidence, no complaint or service of lawyers' notice or preparation of a panchnama in regard to the distribution of the pamphlet by the appellant himself. It is absurd to suppose that the respondent would not have moved in the matter when the appellant had personally distributed the pamphlet. The petitioner had not been able to establish the allegations about the distribution of the pamphlet by the appellant before the election. [820 B-F] 3 (a) An election dispute is not a private feud between one individual and another. The whole constituency is intimately involved in such a dispute. Shaky and wavering oral testimony of a handful of witnesses cannot still the dominant voice of the majority of the electorate. [826 A-B] 809 (b) It is difficult to hold that a serious charge of this nature is established on the mere oral testimony of the petitioner's witnesses. [825 E] (c) Oral testimony will have to be judged with the greatest care and an electoral victory cannot be allowed to be nullified by a mouthful of oral testimony without contemporaneous assurance of a reliable nature from an independent source.
