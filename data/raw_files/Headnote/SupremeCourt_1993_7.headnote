 The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 envisaged a three-tier fora comprising the District Forum, the State Commission and the National Commission for redressal of grievances of consumers. The Petitioner-Society preferred the present Writ Petitions complaining that the implementation of the provisions was sluggish since the machinery for redressing the grievances of poor consumers at the base-level viz. the District Forum had not been set up in all the districts except a few.
 As a stop-gap arrangement, this Court on 17.1.90 directed that every district should have a District Forum with the District Judge as its President This Court further directed the State Governments concerned to appoint two more members in every District Forum. It also scrutinised the information received from various States/Union Territories and considered the difficulties faced by them in the matter of setting up District Forum in each district Thereafter, disposing of the Writ Petitions by giving directions to States/Union Territories, this Court 
HELD : 1. Under Section 9 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 It is the responsibility of the State Government to set-up a District Forum with the approval of Central Government The State Government cannot absolve Itself of this responsibility by virtually perpetuating the ad hoc arrangement The High Courts have not withdrawn their personnel only 11 because they have respected this Court's request made to them. But there is a limit beyond which an ad hoc stop-gap arrangement cannot last In the circumstances it Is most appropriate to indicate to the State Governments that the ad hoc arrangement evolved by this Court will terminate within a fixed time-frame. [17EF] 
2. It is directed that wherever a sitting District Judge is functioning as the President of a District Forum, if the workload exceeds the minimum monthly load of 150 cases consistently for a six month period, the High Court will convey the same to the State Government/Union Territory Administration which will within a period of six months from the date of receipt of the communication appoint a regular independent District Forum as envisaged by section 9 of the Act. After the expiry of the said six months period, the High Court will be free to terminate the ad hoc stop-gap arrangement of loaning the services of a sitting District Judge work as the President of the District Forum under intimation to the State Government/Union Territory Administration and it will then be the responsibility of the latter to make provision for carrying out the purposes of the Act. [18C-D] 
3. It is further directed that in districts where the workload does not exceed the minimum fixed by this Court's order dated August 5, 1991, the ad hoc arrangement may continue for one year during which period the State Government/Union Territory Administration Will take steps to constitute an independent District Forum for each district or if the Central Government permits one such forum for 2 or 3 districts clubbed together. After the expiry of the period of one year, the concerned High Courts will be free to terminate the ad hoc stop-gap arrangement of loaning the services of sitting District Judges to work as President of the District Forum in which case it will be the responsibility of the State Government/Union Territory Administration to make provision for carrying out the purposes of the Act. [18E,G] 
4. A copy of this order will be sent to the Chief Secretary of each State Government/Union Territory Administration to take steps to meet Its statutory obligations under the Act within the above time-frame with a view to ensuring that the interest of the consumers is fully protected. Needless to point out that more than sufficient time has been allowed to the State Governments/Union Territories to fulfil their statutory obliga- 12 tion of setting up a District Forum in every district as envisaged by section 9 of the Act and the concerned Government will now be alive to its responsibility to do so within the time extended hereby.
