 The respondent's ancestors had been granted a cash allowance called Tainat by the Peshwas. After the defeat of the Peshwas by the British, by the Treaty of Gulgallee with Jamkhandi dated 6-6-1819 by the then Governor of Bombay on behalf of the East India Co. one of the terms which were granted to Gopalrao Jamkhandikar was regarding the terms which he held from the Govt. of His Highness the Peshwa, for the payment of his contingent (apparently army) out of his personal allowance. It stated that he was to continue all allowances and no complaints on this head were to be suffered to reach the Government. The allowance to the respondent's ancestors was one such allowance. The extract from the Petha Khata wahi of 1942-43 shows that the grant was permanent. But in 1944, the then Ruler of Jamkhandi converted the allowance to one for life. After the Jamkhandi State was merged in the State of Bombay, the Bombay Legislature passed the Bombay Merged Territories Miscellaneous Alienation Abolition Act, 1955. The respondent filed an application on 21-7-1956 under section 17 of that Act claiming that the cash allowance payable was both permanent and hereditary but that he learnt that the Ruler of Jamkhandi had passed an order that the said allowance be continued till his (applicant's) life time when the same :was continued to him after the, death of his father. He mentioned that he had moved the Rajasaheb by an application which was not disposed of. He, therefore, claimed that he would be entitled to seven times the cash allowance, permanent_ on the basis that it was permanent or in the alternative to three times the cash allowance on the basis that it was payable for life. However, by this time, the Ruler of Jamkhandi was no longer a Ruler and was not in a position to be of any assistance to the respondent on the basis of his application. The Assistant Commissioner of Jamkhandi passed an order granting a sum equal to three times the annual sum which the respondent was receiving. On appeal by the respondent to the Appellate Tribunal, the Tribunal held that the Ruler of Jamkhandi had sovereign power and was the fountain head of all sources of authority,. that is. executive, judiciary and legislature and he could change the Tainat cash allowance at his sweet will and pleasure. The Tribunal accordingly dismissed the appeal. The respondent thereupon filed a writ petition before the High Court. The High Court. directed that a sum equal to seven times the annual cash allowance be paid to the respondent on the basis that the grant was hereditary.
 The State Government thereupon appealed by a special leave to this Court.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) The constitutional position of the Ruler of every one of the Indian States before their integration with the rest of India and coming into force of the Constitution of India was that he enjoyed uncontrolled sovereign powers and there were no constitutional limitations upon his authority to act in any of the three capacities of legislature, executive and judiciary. It follows, therefore, that if the Ruler of Jamkhandi had changed the- permanent cash allowance granted to the respondents ancestors to one. for life, it is legally valid and it cannot be questioned.

 (11) The Tainat allowance being service allowance the deduction of the commutation amount is for the payment to.
 the person who was doing the service in place of the cash allowance holder. That is why-what was being paid to the respondent year after year was the cash allowance minus the commutation amount. The commutation amount is, therefore, deductible from the cash allowance while calculating the compensation payable to the respondent. [463 D-E]
