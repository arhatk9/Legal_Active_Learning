 The Petitioners in the Writ Petition ply cycle rickshaws which they hire for the day from the owners of those vehicles. They carry on that activity for about eight months in the year and then return to the region to which they belong. Por the hire of cycle rickshaws they pay the owners a certain sum for the day retaining the balance of the day's income to themselves. They are not in a position to purchase any cycle rickshaws. Unless they hire the vehicles they cannot carry on that activity. Oppressed by poverty this arrangement of cycle rickshaw hire has been resorted to with the owners who through such exploitation obtain an unduly handsome return on the paltry investment made in the purchase of the cycle rickshaws.
 The Punjab Legislature, enacted the Punjab' Cycle Rickshaws(Regulation of Licence) Act, 1976 and 8. 3 thereof provided that no owner of a cycle rickshaw shall be granted any licence in respect of his cycle rickshaw nor his licence shall be renewed by any municipal authority after the commencement of the Act, unless the cycle-rickshaw is to be plied by such owner himself. Sec. 5 663 of the Act provided for penal punishment of any person found to A be in possession of a cycle-rickshaw without a licence conforming to the provisions of the Act.
 The constitutional validity of the Punjab Cycle Rickshaw (Regulation of Licence) Act, 1976 was challenged and this Court In M/S Azad Rickshaw Pullers Union v. State of Punjab, [1980] INSC 147; [1981] 1 S.C.R. 366, framed the following scheme:
 (a) Every rickshaw puller in Amritsar or other municipality who had been a licence within one year of the coming into force of the Act shall be entitled to apply to the Municipal Commissioner for a certificate or other document to the effect that he had been a licence for rickshaw pulling.
 (b) The Municipal Commissioner will verify the records and will grant the necessary certificate or other document within one month from the date of the application.
 (c) On receipt of the Municipal certificate the rickshaw puller will apply to the Credit Guarantee Corporation of India (Small Loans) under the Guarantee scheme of 1971 for advance of a loan upto Rs. 900.
 (d) The loan amount shall be repaid by the rickshaw puller in 15 monthly instalments. If there are delayed payments of instalments of loan, higher rate of interest will be recoverable.
 (e) When the rickshaw pullers during the agricultural season go to work in their fields, they shall nominate other rickshaw pullers without employment to ply the rickshaws during that season. The Municipal Commissioner, if satisfied that the nomination made is bona fide will issue licence to such pullers, or nominees of the licensed rickshaw pullers, in the agricultural season.
 The petitioners in their Writ Petitions contended that the 1976 enactment resulted in making their conditions much worse, for whereas formerly they could at least ply the cycle rickshaws on hiring them from the owners for a sum, they were unable to do so now, especially as they did not have the funds, nor possessed the arrangements for obtaining a loan for the purpose, and as they were not permanent residents of Amritsar, no one was prepared to stand sure q for the amount they sought to borrow from the Banks. It was further contended that this scheme of this 664 Court in M/S Azad Rickshaw Puller's Union v. State of Punjab had not been implemented by the Amritsar Municipal Corporation and consequently the provisions of the Punjab Act of 1976 had continued to operate with unbated severity to their detriment, and that it be declared ultra vires as an unconstitutional violation of the fundamental right under sub.cl.(g) of cl.(l) of Article 19 of the Constitution to carry on occupation or business. As a similar restriction is not imposed on taxi drivers, cart load carriers, three wheeler auto rickshaw drivers and other vehicles plying for public hire the Punjab Act violates the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution, The scheme propounded by the Court has failed because the Municipal Administration did not make any real attempt to implement it.
 The Writ Petitions were contested by the Amritsar municipal Corporation. It was contended that the cost of a cycle rickshaw being about Rs.1200 a person with substantial financial resources would purchase a number of cycle rickshaws and hire them out to rickshaw pullers at Rs. 8 per day irrespective of the income earned by the rickshaw puller, thus earning over 150 per cent interest over his investment. To protect poor and needy rickshaw pullers from such exploitation, the Legislature enacted the Punjab Act of 1976 to enable rickshaw pullers to escape the clutches of middlemen. Between the enforcement of the Punjab Act and the formulation of the scheme in Azad Rickshaw Puller's Union the Corporation renewed more than nine thousand licences in favour of individual rickshaw pullers who were owners of the rickshaws plied by them. No limit on the number of cycle rickshaws to be plied had been imposed by the Municipal Corporation.
 On the question: (l) Whether the Punjab Act of 1976 is an instance of incomplete legislation and cannot serve the purpose for which it Was intended and because of the prohibitions and restraints incorporated in it, it constitutes an unreasonable restriction on the fundamental rights guaranteed under sub-cl.(g) of cl.(l) of Art. 19 of the constitution and also violates Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. (2) Whether the scheme framed by this Court in Azad Rickshaw Puller's Union is incapable of proper implementation, and therefore of no legal effect.
 Dismissing the Writ Petitions, ^ 
 HELD: 1. (a) The Punjab Cycle Rickshaws (Regulation of Licence) Act 1976 cannot be regarded as an unreasonable restriction on the fundamental rights of the petitioners under Art. 21 read with sub-cl.(g) of clause (1) of Article 19 of the Constitution. [680 A] 665 (b) The Punjab Cycle Rickshaws (Regulation of Licence) Act A of 1976 regulates the issue of licenses in respect of cycle rickshaws plying in any Municipal area in the State of Punjab. It essentially provides that no owner of a cycle rickshaw will be granted a license in respect of his cycle rickshaw unless the vehicle is plied by the owner himself.
 The intention of the statute is to ensure the plying of cycle rickshaws by rickshaw pullers who are owners of the vehicle thus eliminating the middleman who owns the vehicle.
 [675 E] (c) The true test of the validity of a statute must be the effect and consequence of its operation on the fundamental right of the citizen. The object underlying the legislation embodies the intent of the legislature in enacting it, but in construing its validity in the context of a citizen's fundamental right the question before the Court always must be whether its impact on the fundamental right can be regarded as a reasonable restriction on the exercise of the right. The focal point during such examination is the fundamental right, and the duty of the Court must be to consider the quality and degree of the encroachment made by the operation of the statute on the citizen's exercise of that right. [676 D-E] Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 621, R.C. Cooper v. Union of India, [1970] 3 S.C.R.53C, referred to.
 In the instant case, 8. 3 of the Punjab Act of 1976 has the effect of making it possible for the rickshaw puller to ply the rickshaw as owner of the vehicle and thereby to be the full owner of the income earned by him. No longer will he be obliged to pare with an appreciable portion of that income in favour of another who owns the vehicle. The Punjab Act is a beneficial legislation bringing directly home to the rickshaw puller the entire fruit of his daily toil. The enactment is intended as a social welfare measure against the exploitation of the poor and unemployed by rapacious cycle rickshaw owners who by reason of their superior financial resources fatten their wealth from the sweated toil of rickshaw pullers. The legislation constitutes a reasonable restriction on the right of such rickshaw owners to carry on the business of hiring out cycle rickshaw inasmuch as the exercise of the right ld excluded by legislation designed for the economic and social welfare of rickshaw pullers, who constitute a significant sector of the people, a sector 80 pressed by poverty and straitened by the economic misery of their situation that the 666 guarantee of their full day's wages to them seems amply justified. [676 F-677 B] 2.(a) The scheme framed by this Court in Azad Rickshaw Pullers Union is a good scheme, capable of implementation, and productive of the objective for which it was designed.
 If it has not been successfully implemented so far, it is in the main largely on account of circumstances which could have been avoided. Inherently there is no feature in the scheme which operates against its effectiveness. If the scheme has not succeeded as was intended by the Court, it is largely because appropriate action was not taken by the parties concerned to implement it. [680 D] (b) It is permissible to judge the reasonableness of a law on the basis of the surrounding circumstances as well as of contemporaneous legislation enacted as part of a single scheme. [678 D] The Lord Krishna Sugar Mills Ltd. & Anr. v. The Union of India & Anr. [1960] 1 S.C.R. 39, referred to.
 (c) The Punjab Act confers on the State Government by 
8. 7, power to frame appropriate rules in support of and for the furtherance of the object of the Act. In the event of the scheme being altered or modified by its authors to a degree incompatible with the true operation and success of the Punjab Act, the situation can always be met by the State Government framing suitable rules under 8 7 of the Act. The State Government is not only empowered to do so; it is under an obligation to frame rules appropriate to the successful implementation of the legislative goal. [679 F] (d) The Municipal Corporation should determine the maximum number of licenses which should be granted for plying cycle rickshaws within its jurisdictions limits, keeping in mind the needs of the travelling public on the one hand and the danger of uneconomic plying on the other.
 Every rickshaw puller proposing to take advantage of the scheme should apply to the Municipal Commissioner for a certificate, the period within which such applications may be filed being certified by the Municipal Corporation from time to time. All the applications will be consider ed, in the serial order in which they are received, for the grant of certificate on the basis of which the rickshaw puller may take further steps envisaged in the scheme for the grant of financial 667 assistance enabling him to purchase a cycle rickshaw for plying A by him. The issue of the certificate shall be subject to the following conditions: [680 H-681 B] 
 1. Each certificate shall be granted in respect of one cycle rickshaw only. [681 C] 
 2. The number of certificates issued shall / t exceed the maximum, if any, fixed by the Municipal Corporation as the total strength of the cycle rickshaws allowed to ply within its jurisdictional limits. [681 D] 
 3. No person shall be granted more than one such certificate. [681 E] 
 4. Preference shall be given in the matter of granting certificates to those rickshaw pullers who had plied a cycle rickshaw for one year before the Punjab Act came into force.
