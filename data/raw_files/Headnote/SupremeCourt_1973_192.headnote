 The appellant was prosecuted for possession of gold bars of foreign origin in his shop and a gold bar of indigenous origin in his residence. He was charged under r-. 126 I(10) read with r. 126 P(2)(ii), and r. 126 I(i) and r. 126P(1)(i) of the Defence of India Rules, 1962. The Customs authorities head recorded a statement of the appellant in which he said that the gold recovered from his house represented ornaments given to his wife by his mother, melted by her into a bar and kept without his knowledge in the almirah, the key of which was with him.
 The appellant was convicted by the trial court. On appeal he was acquitted on one charge but the sentence was sustained on other charges.
 It was contended in this Court that (i), r.126P(2)(ii) could not apply to smuggled gold consistently with the view that declaration of non-ornament gold. did not cover smuggled gold, and (ii) that s. 107 of the Customs Act did not apply to examination of the accused but only to other witnesses to be questioned and hence his statement (Ex. 9) should be excluded.
 Dismissing the appeal, and confirming the sentence.
 
HELD : (Per Krishna Iyer and Sarkaria JJ) Rule 126P (2)(ii) penalises a person who had in his possession or under his control any quantity of gold in contravention of any provision of Part XII-A of the Rul S. It is not possible to cut back on the width of the language used bearing in "mind the purpose of plenary control the State wanted to impose on gold and exempt smuggled gold from the expression "any quantity of gold" in that sub-rule. That construction, would stultify the law. There was no doubt that the accused was in control of the indigenous gold recovered from his residence and there was no case that a declaration had been made regarding it. It is clear from r.126P(2)(ii) that domestic gold was also subject to the declaration under this rule. Its possession was clearly an offence. [113B-C] Section 107 of the Customs Act is wide in its terms and is clearly designed to facilitate the investigatory process by examination without restriction on person, place or time.
 "Any person" in the section covers every person, including a suspect and potential accused. These words of the statute have to be interpreted in the light of the policy and purpose of the law. The object of 8. 1O7 indicates that while the normal process 0enquiry is' facilitated by s.108, investigatory emergencies are taken care of107.
 Situations may arise where the failure to question a witness quicklymay mean irretrievable loss of a valuable material and s. 107 meets this need. "he context in which the words ,,any person" occur, the object of the provision and the policy underlying ch. XIV assume relevance and become material in the construction of the text. Nor does the section exclude the customs House as a venue for such examination. "Any place" in the section obviously means any place and a contrary view is untenable. This provision is plain that an authorised customs official is entitled to examine any person at any time, at any place in the course of enquiry. [113D-G] Social and economic offenses stand on a graver footing in respect of punishment. The new horizons in Venal treatment with hopeful hues of correction and rehabilitation are statutorily embodied in India in some special enactments;- 108 but crimes professionally committed by deceptively respectable members of the community by inflicting severe trauma on the health and wealth of the nation--and the members of this neo-criminal tribe are rapidly escalating- form a -deterrent exemption to humane softness in sentencing. [114B; D] The penal strategy must be informed by social circumstances, individual factors and the character of the crime.
 Smugglers, hoarders, adulterators and others of their ilk have been busy in their underworld because the legal hard- ware has not been able to halt the invisible economic aggressor inside. While penal treatment should be tailored to the individual, in the extreme, category of professional economic offenders, incarceration is peculiarly potent. The offenses for which the appellant has been convicted are typical of respectable racketeers who, tempted by the heavy pay-off, face the perils of the law and hope that they could smuggle on a large scale and even if struck by the court they could .get away with a light blow. [114-EF] To the extent to which gold smugglers and other anti-social operators in the field of crime can be given an unhappy holiday in jail, the courts must help the process on conviction if judicial institutions are not to be cynically viewed by the community. [115B] Per Khanna J : There is nothing in the language of S. 107 to indicate that the words "any person" do not include a person who is subsequently arraigned ;as an accused. The examination contemplated by cl. (b) is of a per-son ac- quainted with the facts and circumstances of a case. Where a person is found in possession of smuggled gold he would obviously be a person who can be ,considered to be acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case. In most of the cases he would indeed be the best person to throw light with regard to the smuggled gold found in his possession. No valid reason can be discerned for excluding the examination of such a person from the purview of s. 107 of the Customs Act. [109B-C]
