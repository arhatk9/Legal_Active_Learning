 On the. issue of a notification under s. 3 Of the Madhya Bharat Abolition of Jagirs Act Samvat 2008 (Act 28 of 1951) all the property in jagirs including Jagir lands. trees tanks etc. stood vested in the State under s. 4 of the Act.
 Under s. 5(c) of the Act all tanks, private wells etc. in or on 'occupied land' as defined. in s. 2(i)(ix) of the Act were excluded from vesting. The Madhya Pradesh and Revenue Code 1959 (Act 20 of 1959) in s. 251 provided that all tanks as described therein which were situated on unoccupied land and had not already vested in the State under the Abolition ACt would vest absolutely in the State Government with effect from 6th April, 1959; the section also provided for compensation being paid in respect of such tanks. Certain tanks belonging to the respondent were treated as vested in the State! Government. At first he claimed compensation for them. but later he also claimed before the Revenue authorities that the tanks were situated on 'occupied land' and therefore under s. 5(c) of the Abolition Act they were exempt from the vesting provisions. The Revenue authorities having decided against him, the respondent filed a writ petition before. the High Court. The High Court held that the question raised by the respondent under s. 5(c) should be decided by the Jagir Commissioner under s. 17 of the Abolition Act and on this view quashed the orders of Revenue authorities. The State appealed, along with other appellants.
 HELD: (i) The High Court was in error in holding that s.
 17 of the Abolition Act was applicable to the case.
 Section 17 is included in Chapter Il1 which deals with compensation which Government is liable to pay to every jagirdar whose jagir land has been resumed under s. 3 of the Abolition Act. It follows therefore that the inquiry made by the Jagir Commissioner under s. 17 on the question of title is only for the purpose of enabling him to pay compensation to the persons who in his opinion are entitled to receive it. In other words the inquiry by the Jagir Commissioner or the decision of the State Government under s. 17 does not embrace within its scope any dispute as to whether any particular property falls within s. 4(1)(a) read with s. 5 of the Abolition Act and whether it has or has not in consequence vested in the State Government by notification issued under s. 3 of the Abolition Act. [829 D- G] (ii) However, if the respondent was right in his contention that the tanks and wells were constructed on.
 'occupied land' belonging to the jagirdar within the meaning of s. 5(c) of the Abolition Act, it was manifest that the appellants had no authority to take possession of those tanks and wells because the title therein did not vest in the State Government in view of s. 5(c) which has an overriding effect on s. 4 of the Abolition Act.'- 824 It was therefore the duty of the High Court in the present case to decide the jurisdictional 'fact as to whether the tanks and wells claimed by the respondent belonged to the Jagirdar within the meaning of s. 5(c) of the Abolition Act, and if the High Court reached the conclusion that the claim of the respondent was substantiated it would be open to the High Court to grant a writ under Art. 226 of the Constitution directing the appellants to hand over possession of the aforesaid tanks and wells to the respondent. [830 B-C] [Case remanded to the High Court accordingly.] Rex v. Shorediteh assessment Committee [1910] 2 K.B. 859 and White & Collins v. Minister of Health [1939] 2 K.B. 838, applied.
