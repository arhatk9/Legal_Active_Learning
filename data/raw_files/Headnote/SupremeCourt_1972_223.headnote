 In December, 1954, the appellant was arrested and prosecuted under section 5 (2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. He was suspended in the same month. In November, 1956, the appellant was served with a charge-sheet under Rue 7 (2) for the departmental proceedings to be held on two charges of taking illegal gratification. The appellant submitted his explanation on December, 18, 1956. The Enquiry Officer exonerated the appellant of charge 1 (a). In 1960, the appellant was discharged in the criminal case. The appellant was, thereafter, dismissed from service, on the finding of the Enquiry Officer, that charge, 1 (b) was proved. The High Court of Punjab quashed the dismissal order. After reinstatement, the appellant was served with another suspension order in May, 1963. A fresh enquiry for charge 1 (b) was ordered in 1965 but the same was later on withdrawn. On October 26, 1966, the appellant was again directed to show-cause why he should not be censured for his unsatisfactory explanation dated December 18, 1956. In reply to the showcause notice in November, 1956, the appellant's explanation was found unsatisfactory and a sentence of censure was imposed on him. Instead of granting full pay for the suspension period the authorities ordered that the appellant should not be paid more than the subsistence allowance received by him during the period of suspension. The writ petition filed against the said orders by appellant was dismissed by the single Judge of the Punjab High Court, and then by the Division Bench.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : The show-cause notice was vague, it did not indicate whether the explanation was called for regarding charge 1 (a) or charge 1 (b). As regards charge 1(b) it was finally withdrawn. The show-cause notice did not indicate which part of the explanation dated 18-12-1956 was unsatisfactory.
 In what way it was unsatisfactory and what was the material before the Government on which it was thought that the explanation was unsatisfactory. The notice being vague, the appellant did not get any chance at all to show cause that he did not deserve a censure upon his conduct. The appellant was not given an opportunity to show that the sus- pension order against him had been unjustified and that he was entitled to full pay and allowances. Under Rule 7 (3), the Govt. has to make two decisions (i) whether the suspension was justified and (ii) what portion of the pay and allowances should be paid to the delinquent officer? [328 C] 
HELD : Further that the order regarding pay affects the pecuniary interest of the appellant. No real opportunity was given to the appellant to make an effective representation against the said order. The order regarding pay during suspension period was not merely consequential order to the first order. [331 B] 324 M. Gopala Krishan Naidu v.
