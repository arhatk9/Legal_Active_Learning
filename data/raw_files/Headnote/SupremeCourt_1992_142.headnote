 Bye-laws for regulating the erection and re-erection of buildings within the area of the Respondent Board were made in 1947. Since these bye-laws did not contain adequate provisions to prevent overcrowding as a result of haphazard and high-rise constructions, the Respondent Board issued a new scheme of restrictions by its order dated 24.12.1982 laying down the minimum space required to be left open and floor space index to be adhered to in the matter of new constructions. Subsequently, in 1984 the Board modified its earlier order and issued the second scheme of restrictions on 26-3-1984. Thereafter, the Board framed new bye-laws known as Pune Cantonment (Building) Bye-laws, 1988 which superseded the 1947 Bye-laws. The new bye-laws, approved the second scheme of building restrictions which restricted the height of buildings to 18 metres and maximum number of storeys to ground plus two.
 The petitioners submitted their building plans before the First Scheme of building restrictions was brought into force. The Respondent-Board intimated the petitioners that their plans could be sanctioned only after conversion of the old grants into freehold tenure and subject to payment of conversion charges by them. The Respondent took notice of the fact that some of the petitioners started constructing buildings ignoring the First Scheme of restrictions and without making full payment of conversion charges. The petitioners were required to re-submit the plans 2 in accordance with the new scheme. The Board also made it clear that any sanction made was valid only for procuring cement and not for execution of work and so no construction should be started till final sanction for conversion was received from Government.
 Being aggrieved by the said decision of the Respondent- Board, the petitioners filed Writ Petitions before the High Court, and the same were dismissed. The High Court held that the condition of conversion was not severable from the sanction to the plan and was in fact a condition precedent and foundation of the sanction. It also held that the new scheme of regulations was legislative in nature and was not in conflict with the bye-laws. The High Court further held that the Respondent-Board would have to sanction a plan afresh after conversion and such plan would be governed by the building regulations prevailing at the time of the fresh sanction by the Board.
 Against the said judgment of the High Court, the petitioners have preferred the present Special Leave Petitions.
 The petitioners contended that the Second Scheme of restrictions and the 1988 bye-laws were not applicable to them and that they were willing to abide by the First Scheme of restrictions, and that the construction already made during the period of stay granted by the High Court or otherwise, may be allowed to stand.
 Dismissing the petitions, this Court, 
 HELD: 1. The schemes of building restrictions made on 24.12.1982 and 26.3.1984 and amended bye-laws in 1988 putting restrictions and reducing the height and floor space index in respect of multi-storeyed buildings, have been made in larger public interest and for the benefit of the entire population of the city of Pune. The validity of such schemes or bye-laws have not been challenged before this Court. The slogan of the builders and land owners of utilising the maximum area for construction of high-rise buildings for fulfilling the need of houses in big urban cities should always be subservient to the building restrictions and regulations made in the larger interest of the whole inhabitants and keeping in view the influx of population, environment hazards, sanitation, provision for supply of water, electricity and other amenities. [21 B-D] 3 
 2. This Court cannot be oblivious to the fact of thrust of population in all the Urban cities in our country and the problem of basic amenities to be made available to the residents of the cities. All planning is to be done on a long-term basis taking note of the growth of industries and overcrowding of population causing environmental and pollution problems in the cities. Growing awareness of these problems has activated the Government as well as the various social activists in taking notice of this menacing problem which is posing a danger to the very survival and existence of human race. [17 E,E] 
 3. The petitioners did not acquire any legal right in respect of building plans until the same were sanctioned in their favour after having paid the total amount of conversion charges in lump sum or in terms of sanctioned installments and getting conversion of their land in free hold tenure. The first scheme of restrictions was brought into force long back on 24th December, 1982 and the second on 26th March, 1984. The petitioners did not submit any fresh building plans in accordance with the first or the second scheme of restrictions. Many of the petitioners have not paid a single pie towards the conversion charges, some of them have paid only few installments and the others though have paid the installments have not made it according to the schedule. In any case the High Court was right in taking the view that the building plans can only be sanctioned according to the building regulations prevailing at the time of sanctioning of such building plans. At present the statutory bye-laws published on 30th April, 1988 are in force and the fresh building plans to be submitted by the petitioners, if any, shall now be governed by these bye-laws and not be any bye-laws or schemes which are no longer in force now.
