 The assessee-company purchased the proprietory interests in lands rich in coal and fireclay. The deeds assigned to the assessee the vendors right to receive arrears of rent and royalty in pursuance of the agreement between the vendors and third parties. Later the assesses sold its right since it could not win the mines for want of finances. The Income-tax Officerassessed the entire arrears of rent, and royalty to tax in the assessee's hands as revenue receipts.
 He also assessed the profit of the sale to tax as a business transaction. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner, and the Tribunal agreed with the orders. The Tribunal found that the assessee was heavily indebted to the vendor but there was no evidence that the payment of the amount was pressed for; the memorandum of association of the assessee empowered it to acquire, sell and dispose of and deal with mines and mining properties; as a major part of the land purchased by the assessee was in possession of other mining companies, it was pot possible for the assessee to undertake any large scale and profitable mining operations; the assessee sold the lands purchased by it for a profit; and the properties purchased were sold very soon after they were purchased.
 But the High Court differed from these conclusions. Dis- missing the appeals, this Court 
HELD : (i) The purchase of the right to collect arrears of rent and royalty could not be considered as an income. It was true that the assessee purchased the lessors' right from the vendor in pursuance of the agreements entered into by the vendor with third parties whose rights had been acquired by the assessee. The assessee company had been incorporated on Jan. 23, 1947. Therefore, it could not have got any right in the property prior to the conveyance in its favour on Dec. 22, 1947. As per the terms of the conveyance, the assessee becomes entitled to the arrears of rent and royalty as a purchaser of those rights. It had no right to collect these arrears of rent and royalty as the owner of the property. It may be that in determining the price payable under the conveyance, the arrears of rent and royalty were not taken into consideration. But that did not change the nature of the right acquired by the assessee. [520 D] (ii)The findings of the Tribunal did not afford any basis to it to come to the conclusion that the purchases made by the assessee and the subsequent sale were in the nature of a trading adventure. The circumstances that the memorandum of association of the assessee permitted the assessee to acquire and sell and dispose of and deal with. mining properties was an inconclusive one. It was not shown that the assessee had acquired or sold any other property. The fact that the assessee sold property purchased by it for profit was not decisive in finding out whether the sale was effected in the course of the business of the assessee.
 From the Tact 518 that the assessee could not undertake large scale and profitable mining in the area which was in its possession, no inference may be drawn that lands were acquired with a view to sell later on nor the circumstance that the properties were sold very soon after they were purchased affords any basis for the conclusion that the sale in question was effected in the course of the business. [52 B] (iii)If the finding of fact is based on an inference from the primary evidentiary facts proved in the case, its correctness or validity is open to challenge in reference proceedings within narrow limits. It is open, to the parties to challenge a conclusion of fact drawn by the tribunal on the ground that it is not supported by any legal evidence or that the impugned conclusion drawn from the relevant facts is not rationally possible. If such a plea is established, the Court has to consider whether the con- clusion in question is not perverse and should not, therefore, be set aside. On the facts of this case, the High Court was justified in examining the correctness of the inference drawn by the Tribunal on the basis of the primary facts found by that Tribunal. [521 E] G.
