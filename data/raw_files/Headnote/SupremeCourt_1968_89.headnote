 Section 7(3) (d) of the industrial Disputes Act provides that no person shall be qualified for appointment as the presiding officer of a Labour Court, unless he has held any judicial Office for not less than seven years. Since 1940 the first respondent held the Office of Sub-Deputy Collector and was vested with Magisterial powers. In 1959 he was appoint the presiding officer of a Labour Court and he gave an award against the appellant. The appellant questioned the appointment on the ground that the first respondent had not held 'judicial office' for 7 years prior to his appointment.
 
HELD : A Magistrate holds a judicial office. That his dudes are partly judicial and partly other does not in any way detract from the position that while acting as a Magistrate he is a judicial officer. An office means no more than a position to which certain duties are attached. A public office is one which entities a man to act in the affairs of others without their appointment or permission. The office of a Magistrate is a correct expression in English and in law. The word 'office' has been applied to Magistrates.
 The Judicial Officers Protection Act, is intended to protect not Civil Judges alone but also Magistrate. [620 F-621 C].
 The functions of a Labour Court are of great public importance and quasi civil in nature. Men of experience on the civil side of the law are more suitable than Magistrates. Persons employed on multifarious duties and in addition performing some judicial functions may not truly answer the requirement of s. 7. For it cannot be denied that the expression "holding a judicial office" signifies more than discharge of judicial functions while holding some other office. The phrase postulates that there is an office and that office is primarily judicial. In this case the distinction was unsubstantial because the Magistrate was holding a fixed position for nineteen years and performing functions primarily of judicial character. [622 B-D].
 Even if there be some doubt that is to be resolved in favour of upholding the appointment on the ground that the legislature itself by s. 9 contemplates that such appointments should not be called into question. Although the provisions of s. 9 cannot shut out an inquiry (if there is a clear usurpation) for purposes of a writ of quo warranto at least in an. unclear case the intent of the legislature is entitled to great weight. The High Court in a quo warranto proceeding should be slow to pronounce upon the matter unless there is a clear infringement of the law.
