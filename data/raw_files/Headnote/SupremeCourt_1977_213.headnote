 Article 131 of the Constitution of India provides that the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction in any dispute : (a) between the Government of India and one or more States; or (b) between Government of India and any State or States on one side and one or more other States on the other; or (c) between two or more States if and in so far as the dispute involves any question (whether of law or fact) on which the existence or extent of a legal right depends.
 A memorandum alleging corruption, favouritism and nepotism against the Chief Minister of the State of Karnataka was submitted to the Union Homo Minister by certain opposition members of the State Assembly. The Chief Minister repelled the allegations as frivolous and politically motivated. By a notification dated May 18, 1977 the State Government appointed under s.. 3(1) of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952, a one man commission presided over by a retired judge of the Karnataka High Court for inquiring into the allegations specified in the notification. By notification dated May 23, 1977, the Government of India appointed under s. 3(1) of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952, a one man commission presided over by a retired judge of the Supreme Court to enquire into the charges made against the Chief Minister excluding "any matter covered by the notification of the Government of Karnataka". Thereupon, the State Government filed in this Court a suit under Art. 131 of the Constitution. On the pleadings of the parties, three issues were framed by this Court. These were : (1) Is the suit maintainable ? (2) Is the impugned notification ultra vires the powers of the Central Government under s. 3 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 ? (3) Even if the notification falls within sec. 3 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act is the section itself unconstitutional ? It was contended on behalf of the plaintiff that : (1) the Central Government has no jurisdiction or authority to constitute the Commission of Inquiry in the purported exercise of its powers under the Act; (2) the action of the Central Government in appointing the Commission against the Ministers of the State Government is destructive of the federal structure of the Constitution and the scheme of distribution of powers between the Centre and the States;
 (3) under the Cabinet system of government the Council of Ministers is responsible to the Legislature for all its actions and the inquiry ordered by the Central Government against the State Ministers, while they are in office would subvert the principle of collective responsibility of Ministers to the Legislature; (4) by virtue of Art 194(3) it is the privilege of the Assembly (and not of 2 any other body) to appoint a Committee for inquiring into the conduct of any of its members; (5) interpretation of a.
 3 of the 1952 Act in such a way as to empower the Central Government to appoint a Commission for inquiring into matters relating to any of the entries in List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution-would make a. 3 itself ultra vires the provisions of Part XI of the Constitution;
 and (6) since on the basis of the report the Central Government cannot take any action against the Ministers of the State Government such a Commission cannot serve any useful purpose.
 On the other hand, the defendant (Central Government) raised preliminary objections as to the maintainability of the suit on the ground that the appointment of such a Commission does- not affect any legal right of the State; and.(2) also that the Central Government is competent to constitute a Commission to inquire into a definite matter of public importance, (3) that, furthermore, its notification does not cover any of the matters mentioned in the State Government's notification, namely, the conduct of Ministers of the State Government.
 (Per majority Beg, C.J. Chandrachud, Bhagwati and Kailasam, JJ) (Untwalia, Shinghal and Jaswant Singh, JJ dissenting) The suit is maintainable.
 G. C. J.
 1(a) The State concerned, which challenges the validity of the action of the Central Government against one or more of its Ministers in respect of acts involving exercise of its governmental powers, would have sufficient interest to maintain a suit under Art. 131 because it involves claims to what appertains to the State is a "State." [94 C-D] (b) The case involves consideration of the exercise of governmental powers which vest in the Government of the State and its Ministers as such vis-a-vis those of the Central Government and its Ministers. It also raises questions relating to the meaning and the ambit and the applicability of the particular provisions of the Constitution whose operations are of vital interest to every State. Interpretations given to those provisions must necessarily be of great concern to the Union as well. (91 C- D] (c) The Union of India, acting through the Central Government, could be said to represent the whole of the people of India. The individual States, acting through their Governments and Ministers, could be said to represent the people of each individual State and their interests.
 When differences arise between the representatives of the State and those of the whole people of India, on questions of interpretation of the Constitution, which must affect the welfare of the whole people, and, particularly that of the people of the State concerned, it is too technical an argument to be accepted that a suit does not lie under Article 131 of the Constitution. [91 E-P] (d) Article 131 can be invoked whenever a State and other States or the Union differ on a question of interpretation of the Constitution so that a decision of it will affect the scope or exercise of governmental powers which are attributes of a State. It makes no difference to the maintainability of the action if the powers of the State which are executive, legislative, and- judicial are exercised through particular individuals. [92 F-G] (e) The distinction between the State and its Government is, at the most,one between the whole and an inseparable part of the whole.It would be immaterial as regards claims on behalf of either the State or itsGovernment whether the two are distinct juristic entities. Assuming that these are distinctly separate entities, the claim of the Government would be that of the State. [91 H] (f)The fact that the State acts through its Ministers or officials cannot affect% the maintainability of a quit under Art. 131 of. the Constitution. Article 166(3) provides for allocation of the business of the Government ,be Ministers for "the more convenient transaction of the business". that the State cannot act merely through its Government as a whole but also 3 through its individual Ministers as provided by the rules.
 Articles 166(3) and 154(1), far from establishing any antithesis between the official capacity of a Minister and the State for which he acts, only show that, as a Minister, he is an agent or a limb of the Government of the State and, therefore, he can be treated as an officer for purposes of Art. 154(1). The result is that a Ministers official acts cannot be distinguished from those of the State on whose behalf he acts. There is nothing in Art. 131 of the Constitution itself to debar the State, which must always necessarily act through its officers or agents or Ministers, from suing the Central Government not only to protect one of its officers, agents or Ministers from being proceeded against, by the Central Government, but to prefer its own claim to exclusive power to deal with him and this is what the plaintiff has done by means of the suit.

 The Central Government's notification is valid. [94 G] 2(a) A perusal of the two notifications shows that while the State notification is meant to set up the commission which has to enquire whether the veil worn by certain transactions is correct in form and covers it fully, the Central Government notification is clearly meant to enable the Commission appointed by it to tear down the veil of apparent legality and regularity which may be worn by some transactions. It cannot be said that the two notifications would be covering "the same matter" as contemplated by proviso (b) to s. 3(1) of the Act. If the State notification is meant only to superficially scratch the ,surface of the allegations made whereas the Central Government notification is meant to probe into the crux or the heart of what may or may not have gone wrong with the body politic in the State, this Court could not be too technical or astute in finding reasons to hold that the subject-matter of the two inquiries is substantially the same. [36 G-H] (b)Since the two notifications authorise inquiries into matters which are substantially different in nature and object, the inquiry of the Central Commission cannot be said to be barred by reason of the State Government notification under proviso (b) to s. 3 (1 ) of the Act even if, in order to deal with a substantially different subject-matter, central areas of fact or rules governing the transactions may be common. If the objectives are different the examination of common areas of fact and law for different purposes will be permissible. [39 B] 3(a) The obvious intention behind the 1952 Act is to enable the machinery of democratic Government to function more efficiently and effectively. It could hardly be construed is an Act meant to thwart democratic methods of Government.
 [44 E] (b)In all democratic countries when allegations and rumours circulate causing crisisof confidence in the integrity of public life or about other matters of public importance, it is essential that public confidence should be restored and this can be done only by thoroughly investigating and probing the rumours and allegations. Such an inquiry might reveal either that the evil exists or that there is no force in the rumours. In either case confidence is restored. [40 H] (c)In England, the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 was passed "to displace the procedure of Select Parliamentary Committees which till then were used "to investigate alleged wrong doing in high places". Such a method of investigation by a political Tribunal was found to be wholly unsatisfactory 'because such bodies could never be free from party political influences. When 4 reports of these committees came to be debated in the House of Commons, the House was divided on party-lines and by a majority exonerated the ministers from all blame.
 Therefore, investigation by a political tribunal on matters causing grave public disquiet had been discredited and the 1921 Act was passed for setting up some permanent investigating machinery. Even in the United States, where the system of Congressional Committees is still in vogue, ad hoc tribunals (such as the Warren Commission) are appointed to avoid a matter being referred to Congressional Committees. This clearly, shows that, in democratic countries, not only does modem practice but statute can provide for inquiries of the kind which are to be conducted under the 1952 Act. The proceedings of the Commission can only result in a report which is to be laid before the Legislature concerned under s. 31(4) of the Act. The Act contains no provision for giving effect to the findings of the Commission or for enforcing any order which can be made by the Commission. [41 C-H; 44 E] 
4. The question whether a State Government or its Chief Minister is or is not carrying out the trust which the constitutional power places in the hands of a State Government and its head for the purposes of determining whether any exercise of extraordinary powers under Art. 356 is called for or not. is a matter which lay within the powers of the Central Government. What is contemplated by Art. 356 when it speaks of the "satisfaction" of the President from a report of the Governor "or otherwise" whether a particular situation has arisen in which the Government of the State can be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution is a matter which would be of public importance. If the President deems it necessary to give the State Government or its Chief Minister an opportunity of being heard before an impartial Commission of Inquiry constituted under the Act, it could not be said that such I mode of exercise of power under Art. 356 is not fully covered by what is necessarily implied in the provisions of the Constitution, that is, the Power to order an inquiry for the purposes of the satisfaction required by Art. 356.
 [48 F-H] 5(a) Provisions of either Art. 75(2) or Art. 164(2) cannot operate as bars against the institution of inquiries by Commissions set up under the Act. To infer such bars would be to misunderstand the object as well as the mode and sphere of operation of these articles as also the purposes, scope, and function of Commissions to be set up under the Act. [53 H] (b)'The Council of Ministers, though theoretically appointed by the Governor, is collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly of the State. But his collective responsibility does rot abridge or truncate the power of the Central Government to appoint a Commission under s. 3 of the Act. Collective responsibility has a scope and mode of operation which are very different from those of an inquiry under s. 3 of the Act even though the same or similar matters may some times give rise to both. Matters investigated under s. 3 of the Act may have no bearing on any collective responsibility. The sphere of inquiry under s. 3 is very different from that in which collective responsibility functions. While the object of collective responsibility is to make the whole body of Ministers collectively or vicariously responsible for acts of others even if an individual minister may not personally be responsible, the inquiry under s. 3 has been ordered by the Central Government to determine who is actually responsible for certain actions and what will be the motive behind them.
 [50 F] (c)Inasmuch as the Council of Ministers is able to stay in office only so, long as it continues the support and confidence of a majority of the Members of the Legislature, the whole Council of Ministers is politically responsible for the decisions and policies of each of the Ministers and of his department. So far is the Ministry's answerability to the Legislative Assembly is concerned. the whole Ministry has to be treated as one entity. The purpose of Art. 164(2) which embodies this Principle, is not to find out facts or to establish the actual responsibility of a Chief Minister or any other Minister or Ministers for particular decisions or governmental acts. The principle of individual as well as collective ministerial responsibility can work most efficiently only when cases requiring proper sifting and evaluation of evidence and discussion of questions: involved have taken place in proceedings before a Commission appointed under s. 3 of the, Art. [51 F-G) 5 6(a) The only sanction for the enforcement of collective responsibility is the pressure of public opinion., In England, the principle operators as a of convention backed by political judgment, but for us this principle in our Constitution itself [Arts. 75(2) and 164(2)]. Nevertheless here also it depends upon convention and public opinion, particularly as reflected in Parliament or in State Legislatures, for its effectiveness. The principle, of collective responsibility also exists separately and independently from the legal liability of a Minister holding an office in the Union or a State Government. [52 H] (b)An investigation by a Commission of inquiry should facilitate or help the formation of sound public opinion. A Minister's individual actions, however, do not bring into operation the principle of collective responsibility where his colleagues in the Government cannot reasonably be held guilty of dereliction or breach of any duty.

 7.A Commission of Inquiry has an orbit of action of its own within which it can move so as not to conflict with or impede other forms of action or modes of redress. A Commission of Inquiry is meant to explore and discover real facts. It is neither a substitute for action in a court of law nor can its report orfindings relieve courts of their duty. The appointment of a Commission isgenerally a confession of want of sufficient evidence to take the, matter toa court combined with an attempt to satisfy the public need and desire to discover what had really gone wrong and how and where, if possible. [53 G-H] 8.There is no force in the contention that Ministers answerable to the Legislature are governed by a separate law which exempted them from liabilities under the ordinary law.
 Articles 194 and 105 which deal with powers, privileges and immunities of each House as well as its Members, do not apply to legislative powers of Parliament or of the State Legislatures. The powers" meant to be indicated in these Articles are powers which depend upon or are necessary for the conduct of business of each House. [57 B-C] 9(a) The Constitution could not mention and exhaust every conceivable topic of legislation and it is precisely to meet such a situation that Art. 248, read with Entry 97 was inserted. Therefore, Art. 248 read with Entry 97 of List I will fully cover s. 3 of the Act even if Entry 94 of List I does not. The term 'constitutional law can be neither clearly nor exhaustively defined. A Constitution could be expected to contain only the basic frame-work., It is not a part of its nature to exhaustively deal with all matters.
 It is well accepted that nit all constitutional law need be written. There can be no clear-cut distinction between what could or should and what could not or should not be comprehended within the body of rules called constitutional law. In practice,, what is embodied even in a written constitution depends sometimes on the peculiar notions of a people. It reflects their views about what should be con- sidered so basic or fundamental as to find a place in the constitutional document. To expect the content of the Constitution to be so all-embracing as to deal with every conceivable topic of legislation exhaustively so as to leave no room for doubt is to expect the humanly impracticable, if not the impossible. The most that could be expected from the human foresight of Constitution-makers is that they should Provide for the residual power of legislation which could cover topics on which Parliament or State legislatures could legislate even though the legislation may not be easily assignable to any specific entry. Such a provision our Constitution-makers did make. [61 H; 59 G-H;
 61 B-C; D-E] (b)The term 'inquires' as used in Entry 94 of List I and Entry 45 of List III, without any limitations, is wide enough to embrace every kind of inquiry, whether a criminal offence by any one is disclosed or not by facts alleged.
 Entry 45 in List III must include inquires to cover allegations against all persons which bring them within the sphere of Entry I of List III relating to criminal law. All that "inquires" covered by Entry 45 require is that they 6 must be "for the purpose of any of the matters specified in List II or List III". The language used........ any of the matters specified. . " is broad enough to cover anything reasonably related to any of the enumerated items even if done by holders of ministerial offices in the States. Other subjects will be found in List II. Even assuming that neither Entry 94 List I nor Entry 45 of List III would cover inquires against Ministers in the States, relating to acts connected with the exercise of ministerial powers. Art.
 248, read with Entry 97 of List I, must necessarily cover an inquiry against Ministers on matters of public importance, whether the allegations include violations of criminal law or not. A contrary view would have the wholly unacceptable consequence of placing Ministers in State Governments practically above the law. [63 C-E] (c)Since the powers conferred by s. 3 upon the Central and State Governments, including the power to institute inquiries of the kind set up under each of the two Notifications, are covered by the express constitutional provisions, no question of any exclusion, either by necessary implication or by any principle, supposed to form a part of or to flow from the basic structure of the Constitution, can rise here. Nor is it possible to so read down and interpret s. 3 of the Act as to exclude from its purview inquiries of the kind instituted under the two notifications. To do so would be to give an incentive to possible misuse and perversion of governmental machinery and powers for objects not warranted by law. Such powers carry constitutional obligations with them. They are to be exercised like the powers and obligations of trustees who must not deviate from the purposes of their trusts. Whether a Minister has or his not abused his powers and privileges could be best determined by fair and honest people anywhere only after a just and impartial inquiry has taken place into complaints made against him so that its results as before them. [64 A-C] (d) There is no room for applying the rule Expression Union.v Est Exclusion Alterius to exclude what falls within in expressly provided legislative entry. Before the principle can be applied at all, the Court must find an express mode of doing something that is provided in a statute which, by its necessary implication, could exclude doing of that very thing and not something else in some other way. Far from this being the case here, the constitution-makers intended to cover the making of provisions by Parliament for inquiries for various objects which, may be matters of public importance without any indications of any other limits except that they must relate to subjects found in the List. [64 H] Colquhoun v. Brooks, [1888] Q.B.D 52 @ 65 referred to.
 (e)The proposition that what is not specifically mentioned in the Constitutionmust be deemed to be deliberately excluded from its purview so that nothingshort of a constitutional amendment could authorise legislation upon it is really to invent a "Casus Omissus" so as to apply the rule that, where there is such a gap in the law, the Court cannot fill it. The rule, however, is equally clear that the Court cannot so interpret a statute as to produce a casus omissus where there is really none. If the Constitution itself provides for legislation to fill what is sought to be construed as a lacuna, legislation seeking to do this cannot be held to be void because it performs its intended function by an exercise of an expressly conferred legislative power. In declaring the purpose of the provisions so made and the authority for making it, Courts do not supply an omission or fill up a gap at all. It is Parliament which can do so and his done it. [65 A-B] The Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v. V. Henderson Brothers, [1888] 13 A.C. 595 @ 602 referred to.
 10(a) The written Constitution by its very nature as the embodiment of the 'fundamental law of the land makes it imperative for Courts to determine the meaning of its parts in keeping with its broad and basic purposes and objectives.
 It must be read as a whole, and construed in keeping with its declared objects and its functions. Although the Courts, acting in exercise of judicial power. may supplement those parts where the letter of the Constitution is silent or may leave room for its development by either ordinary legislation 7 or judicial interpretation, they cannot nullify, defeat, or distort the reasonably clear Meaning of any part of the Constitution in Order to give expression to some theories of their own about the broad 'or basic scheme of the Constitution. This must be done with reference to the express provisions of the Constitution. The dubiousness of expressions used may be cured by Courts by making their meanings clear and definite, if necessary, in the light of the broad and basic purposes set before themselves by the Constitution-makers. The power of judicial interpretation cannot extend to laying down what is in direct conflict with express provisions of the Constitution.- Nor can express provisions be curtailed by importing limits based on a mere theory of limitations on legislative powers. [66 C-G] (b) In the matter of interpretation of. the Constitution, in a long line of decisions, this Court has held that where two constructions are possible, the Court should adopt that which will implement and discard that which will ,stultify the apparent intentions of the Constitution-makers, that the Court should adopt a construction which harmonizes rather than one which produces a conflict between its provisions, the construction which will ensure smooth and harmonious working of the Constitution and eschew the other which will lead to absurdity or give rise to practical inconvenience or make well-established provisions of existing law nugatory that the plenitude of power to legislate, indicated by a legislative entry has to be given as wide and liberal an interpretation as is reasonably possible. If a subject does not fall within a specifically demarcated field found in List II or List III, it would fall in List I, apparently because of the amplitude of the residuary field indicated by Entry 97, List I. Legislative entries only denote fields of operation of legislative power which is actually conferred by one of the articles of the Constitution. This Court has also rejected argument that the wide range given to Entry 97 of List I, read with Art. 248 of the Constitution, would destroy the federal structure of our Republic. On an application of a similar test, the powers given to the Central Government by s. 3 of the Act, could not be held to be invalid on the ground that the federal structure of the State is jeopardized.

 (c) Whenever the doctrine of basic structure has been expounded or applied it is only as a doctrine of interpretation of the Constitution as it actually exists and not of a Constitution which could exist only subjectively in the minds of different individuals as mere theories about what the Constitution is. The doctrine did not add to the contents of the Constitution. It did not, in theory, deduct anything from what was there. It only purported_to bring out and explain the meaning of what was already there. It was, in fact, used by ill the Judges for this purpose with differing results simply because their assessments or inferences as to what was part of the basic structure in the Constitution differed. This is the correct interpretation of the doctrine of the basic structure of the Constitution.
 It should only be applied if it is clear, beyond the region of doubt, that what is put forward as a restriction upon otherwise clear and plenary legislative power is there as a Constitutional imperative. [ 86 G-H] (d) If this is the correct view about the basic structure, as a mode of interpreting the Constitution only, the so called federalism as a fetter on legislative power must find expression in some express provision to be recognised by Courts. A majority of Judges who decided the Keshvanand Bharati's case have not treated "federalism" as part of the basic structure of the Constitution and none of them has discussed the extent of the "federal" part of this struc- ture. It is not enough to point out Art. 1 of the Constitution-to emphasise that 8 our Republic is a "Union" of States. The word "Union" was used in the context of the peculiar character of our federal Republic revealed by its express provisions. One has to find from other express provisions what this 'Union' means or what is the extent or nature of "federalism" implied by it. The Constitution itself does not use the word "federation" at all. It is not possible to discover any such fetter which could., by a necessary implication, prevent Parliament from enacting s. 3 of the Act. [87 B-D] Per Chandrachud, J.
 The preliminary objection to the maintainability of the suit ought to be rejected. The proceeding brought by the State of Karnataka is maintainable under Art. 131 of the Constitution. [100 C] (a) The jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme Court by Art.
 131 of the Constitution should not be tested on the anvil of rules which are applied under the Code of Civil Procedure for determining whether a suit is maintainable. A constitutional provision which confers exclusive jurisdiction on this Court to entertain disputes of a certain nature in the exercise of its original jurisdiction, cannot be equated with a provision conferring a right on a civil court to entertain a common suit so as to apply to an original proceeding under Art. 131 the canons of a suit which is ordinarily triable under s. 15 of the C.P.C. by a court of the lowest grade competent to try it. The Constitution does not describe a proceeding under Art. 131 as a suit but uses words and phrases commonly employed for determining the jurisdiction of a court of first instance to entertain and try a suit. It does not speak of a cause of action; instead it employs the word "dispute". Above all, Art. 131 is a self-contained code on matters falling within its purview. By the very terms of the Article, the sole condition required to be satisfied for invoking the original jurisdiction of this Court is that the dispute between the parties referred to in clauses (a) to (c) must involve a question on which the existence or extent of a legal right depends. [97 E-H] (b) The quintessence of Art. 131 is that there has to be a dispute between the parties regarding a question on which the existence or extent of a legal right depends. A challenge by the State Government to the authority of the Central Government to appoint a Commission of Inquiry clearly involves a question on which the existence or extent of the legal right of the Central Government to appoint the Commission of Inquiry depends and that is enough to sustain the proceeding brought by the State under Art. 131 of the Constitution. The Constitution has purposefully conferred on this Court a jurisdiction which is untrammelled by considerations which fetter the jurisdiction of a court of first instance which entertains and tries suits of a civil nature. The very nature of the dispute arising under Art.
 131 is different both in form and substance from the nature of claims which require adjudication in ordinary suits. [98 B-D] (c) Part XI of the Constitution is devoted specially to the delineation of relations between the Union and the States.
 The object of Art. 131 is to provide a high powered machinery for ensuring that the Central Government and the State Governments act within the respective spheres of their authority and do not trespass upon each other's constitutional functions or powers, Therefore, a, challenge to the constitutional capacity of the defendant to act in an intended manner is enough to attract the application of Art.
 131 particularly when the plaintiff claims that right "exclusively for itself. [98 F-G] (d) A proceeding under Art. 131 stands in sharp contrast with an ordinary civil suit. While in an ordinary civil suit rejection of a right asserted by the defendant cannot correspondingly and of its own force establish the right claimed by the plaintiff, proceedings under Art. 131 are adjudicatory of the limits of constitutional power vested in the Central or the State Governments. In a civil suit the plaintiff has to succeed on the strength of his own title;
 the competition in a proceeding under Art. 131 is between two or more Governments. There is no third alternative as in a civil suit wherein the right claimed by the plaintiff may reside neither in him nor in the defendant but In a stranger. A demarcation and definition of constitutional power between the 9 rival claimants and restricted to them and them alone is what a proceeding under Art. 131 necessarily involves. [98 H 
 (e) There is no force in the defendant's contention that if a State Government challenges the constitutional rights of the Central Government to take a particular course of action, Art. 131 will not be attracted. The contention ,of the State Government is not only that the Central Government has no power to appoint the Inquiry Commission for enquiring into the conduct of State Ministers but that such right is exclusively vested in the State Government.
 There is, therefore, not only a denial of the right claimed by the Central Government but an assertion that the right exclusively resides in the State Government. [99 D-E] State of Rajasthan v. Union of India A.I.R. 1977 S.C.I. 361 referred to.
 (f) A writ under Art. 226 is hardly a substitute for a proceeding under Art. 131. A dispute between one or more States or between the Government of India and a State on the one hand and another State or other States on the other, cannot properly be decided by a High Court under Art. 226.
 More,over, disputes of the nature described in Art. 131 being usually of an urgent nature should be decided by this Court to obviate dilatoriness of a possible appeal. The original proceeding is decided once and for all by this Court. [100 A_B] 
2. The notification issued by the Central Government is within the scope of s. 3(1) of the Act. The objection of the State Government that it offends against cl. (b) of the proviso to s. 3(1) of the Act is factually unfounded and theoretically unsound. [114 F; 101 H] (a) It is wrong to contend that the Central Government has appointed the Commission of Inquiry for the purpose of inquiring into the same matter into which the Commission of Inquiry appointed by the State Government is directed to inquire. [101 E] (b) Considering the terms of the notifications issued by the State Government and the Central Government and the matters into which the respective Commissions are directed to inquire, it is obvious that the object and purpose of the two inquiries is basically different. The primary object of the State Government in appointing the commission is to ascertain whether improper or excessive payments were made, undue favours were shown, irregularities or fraud had occurred in the conduct of official business etc; and secondly to find out as to who are 'the persons responsible for the lapses, if any, regarding the aforesaid and to what extent". On the other hand, the Commission appointed by the Central Government is specifically directed to inquire "whether the Chief Minister practiced favouritism and nepotism" in regard to various matters mentioned in the notification. (100 G; 101 D-E] (c) Moreover, it is hardly ever possible that the State Government will appoint a Commission to inquire into acts of corruption, favouritism and nepotism on the part of its Chief Minister. [101 G] 3(a) On a plain reading of s. 3(1) of the Act, it is impossible to bold that the section cannot be construed as authorising the Central Government to appoint a Commission of Inquiry for the purpose of inquiring into the conduct of a sitting Minister of a State Government. [102 B] (b) Section 3(1) cannot be given a restricted meaning.
 There is no justification for reading down the provisions of the section to limit the power of the 'Central Government to appointing a Commission of Inquiry for inquiring into the conduct of persons in relation to matters concerning the affairs of the Union Government only. The section empowers the Central Government to appoint a Commission for making an inquiry into any definite matter of public importance. It is inarguable that the conduct of Ministers of State Govern- ments in the purported discharge of their official functions is not a definite matter of public importance. Further, it cannot be said that the Central Government does not even possess the power to collect facts in regard to 10 allegations of corruption made by a section of the State Legislature against sitting Ministers of the State Government. [102 E-F] (c) The argument that s. 3(1) will offend against the principle of collective responsibility unless it is construed narrowly is without substance. Whatever may the findings of the Commission of Inquiry, the Council of Ministers whether at the Centre or in the States, continues to be collectively answerable or accountable to the House of the People or the 'Legislative Assembly. Neither the appointment of the Commission nor even the rejection by the Commission of all or any of the allegations referred to it for its inquiry would make the Council of Ministers any the less answerable to those bodies. The object of Articles 75(3) and 164(2) of the Constitution is to provide that for every decision taken by the Cabinet each one of the Minister- is responsible to the Legislature concerned. It is difficult to accept that for acts of corruption, nepotism or favouritism which are alleged by members against an individual Minister, the entire Council of Ministers can be held collectively responsible to the Legislature. If an individual Minister uses his office as an occasion or pretense for committing acts of corruption, he would be personally answerable for his unlawful acts and no question of collective responsibility of the Council of Ministers can arise in such a case. [105 C; 103 F-H] (d) The essence of collective responsibility of the Council of Ministers is that the Cabinet is responsible to the Legislature for every action taken in any of the ministries.
 In other words the principle of collective responsibility governs only those acts which a Minister performs or can reasonably be said to have performed in the lawful discharge of his official functions. [104, B] A. Sanjeevi Naidu etc. v. State of Madras & Anr., [1970] INSC 14; [1970] 3 SCR 505, 512 referred to.
 (e) In the absence of a specific provision in the Constitution the conduct of a member of the Legislature shall be inquired into by the Legislature only, it is impossible to hold that the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry under the Act constitutes interference with the privileges of the Legislature. English precedents relating to the privileges of the House of Commons which are relevant under Art. 194(3) do not support the States contention. [105 D] (f) The power conferred by Parliament on the Central Government to a Commission of Inquiry under s. 3 (1 ) of the Act for the purpose of facts in regard to allegations of corruption, favouritism and nepotism against a sitting Chief Minister or Ministers cannot be held to constitute inter- ference with the executive functions of the State Government or that it confers on the Central Government the power to control the functions of the State executive. [109 F-G] (g) An examination of the provisions and scheme of the Act shows that a Commission appointed under the Act is purely a fact finding body with no power to pronounce a binding or a definitive judgment. The larger interest of the community requires that sensitive matters of public importance should be enquired into by a high-powered Commission whose findings can command the confidence of the people. If, on receipt of the report, the Central Government decides to take any action the validity thereof may have to be decided in the light of the constitutional provisions. But, until that stage arrives, it is difficult to hold that the Central Government is exercising any control or supervisory jurisdiction over the executive functions of the State. 108 B-C] (h) The impugned Act cannot be held to suffer from want of legislative competence in the Parliament to enact it. Entry 94 of List I, Entry 45 of List III and failing these, Entry 97 of List I must sustain the Act. [112 B] (i) In Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Shri Justice S. R.
 Tendolkar and others this Court held that Parliament had the legislative competence to pass the law under Entry 94 of List I and Entry 45 of List III of the Seventh Schedule.
 The word "Inquiries" occurring in the two Entries must be held to cover the power to paw an Act providing for appointment of Commissions of Inquiry. Since 11 the power to appoint a Commission of Inquiry into the conduct of sitting Ministers of State Governments does not offend against the principle of collective responsibility or against the privileges of the Legislative Assembly, and, since it does not also confer on the Central Government the power of control over the State executive, the provision must be held to be a valid exercise of the legislative, competence of the Parliament. [111 B-C] Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Shri Justice S. R. Tendolkar & Others, [1958] INSC 30; [1959] SCR 279, 293 approved.

 (j) Entry 97 is in the nature of a residuary entry and the words "any other matter" which appear therein, mean "any matter other than those enumerated in List I". If entry 94, List I does not cover the Act, inquiries of the nature contemplated by the Act will fall within the description "any other matter" occurring in entry 97 of List I. If entry 45 of List III and ',he whole of the State List are to be kept out of consideration, the Act will relate to "a matter not enumerated in List II or List III [11 G] (k) The contention that by empowering the Central Government to appoint a Commission for inquiring into the conduct of the sitting Ministers of the State Government, Parliament has legislated, on the Centre-State relationship which is a constitutional subject, is without any force.
 The Act merely empowers the Central Government to appoint a Commission of Inquiry for collecting facts with a view to informing its own mind and the report of the Commission is not binding on any one. If a law is within the legislative competence of the legislature, it cannot be invalidated on the supposed ground that it has added something to, or has supplemented, a constitutional provision so long as the addition or supplementation is not inconsistent with any provision of the Constitution. [113 A; 112 F-G; 114 C-D] (1) Not only that the pith and substance of the Act is "inquiries" but it does not even incidentally encroach or trespass upon the constitutional field occupied by Part XI.
 If it does not touch the subject matter of Centre-State relationship, there is no question of its impinging upon a subject dealt with by the Constitution. Even assuming that legislation on the question of Centre State relationship is impliedly barred, the impugned Act does not fall within the vice of that rule and cannot, therefore, be pronounced as unconstitutional. [113 H] Per Bhagwati, J. concurring The suit filed under Art. 131 of the Constitution by the State of Karnataka against the Union of India is maintainable. [122 B] 
1. The State would have locus to challenge unconstitutional exercise of power by the Central Government which encroaches upon States exclusive sphere in relation to the conduct of its Council of Ministers. By reason of provision (a) to s. 3(1) of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952, it could challenge the impugned action of the Central Government because it prevents the State from exercising its power to direct inquiry into matters specified in the notification issued by the Central Government. [121 H] 
2. (a) The claim of the State that its Legislature and Government alone have power to investigate and control misuse of governmental power by the Chief Minister and other Ministers of the State and that Central Government has no power to enquire into the same or to set up a Commission of Inquiry for that purpose, clearly raises a dispute as to the extent of the power of the State and the existence of a superior or co-ordinate power in the Central Government to inquire into the conduct of the Chief Minister and other Ministers of the State in the discharge of their governmental functions. Such a dispute concerns the content of the respective powers of the State and the Union of India and the inter se relationship between the two entities and the State is vitally interested in it. The State is very much concerned whether the conduct of its Council of Ministers in the discharge of governmental functions can be enquired 12 into only by itself through its own agency or can be subjected to scrutiny by the Union of India. The State would have locus to say that the Union has no right to encroach upon its exclusive power to investigate into misuse of governmental power by its Council of Ministers. Apart from the Council of Ministers, the State can also competently make a claim that the Council of Ministers, acting on its behalf, is immune from subjection to the power of the Central Government to enquire into their conduct as Ministers. This immunity claimed in respect of- the Council of Ministers can be ascribed to the State and the State can raise a dispute touching upon the existence of this immunity.

 (b) The two limitations in regard to a dispute which can be brought before the Supreme Court under Art. 131 are parties and subject matter. The object of the Article is that since in a federal or quasi-federal structure disputes. may arise between the Government of India and one or more States or between two or more States, a forum should be provided for the resolution of such disputes and that forum should be the highest court in the land. Article 131 is attracted only when the parties to the dispute are the Government of India or one or more States arrayed on either side. The limitation as to subject matter is contained in the words "if and in so far as the dispute involves any question whether of law or fact on which the existence or extent of legal right depends" which indicates that the dispute must be one affecting the existence or extent of a legal right and not a dispute on the political plane not involving a legal aspect. [115 G-H] State of Rajasthan v. Union of India, [1977] INSC 145; A.I.R. 1977 S.C. 1361 referred to.
 (c) There are two fallacies in the argument based on the distinction between State and State Government : one in drawing a rather rigid, water-tight distinction between State and State Government and the other in assuming that it is only where the legal right of the plaintiff is infringed that the suit can be maintained under Art. 131. (117 B-D] (d) Although theoretically a distinction exists between State and State Government (and this finds recognition in s.
 3(58) and s. 3(60) of the General Clauses Act, 1897) constitutional authorities have pointed out that the distinction is analogous to that between a given human individual as a moral and intellectual person and his material physical body. By the term 'State' is understood the political person or entity which possesses the law- making right and by the term 'Government' is understood the agency through which the will of the State is formulated, "pressed and executed. The Government thus acts as the machinery of the State and those who operate this machinery act as the agents of the State. Again, the State itself is an ideal person, intangible, invisible and immutable and the Government is its agent. If the State Government is the agent through which the State expresses its will, the State cannot be said to be unconcerned when any right or capacity or lack of it is attributed to the State Government. It would be wholly unrealistic to suggest that since the State Government is distinct from the State, any action or capacity or lack of it in the State Government would not affect the State and the State would not be interested in it. To do this would be to ignore the integral relationship between the State and the State Government. Any action which affects the State Government or the Ministers in their capacity as ministers would raise a matter in which the State would be concerned. [117 D-H] (e) When any right or capacity or lack of it is attributed to any institution or person acting on behalf of the State, it raises a matter in which the State is involved or concerned. The State would, in the circumstances, be affected or, at any rate, interested if the Chief Minister and other Ministers in their capacity as such that is in the matter of discharge of their official functions, are subjected to unconstitutional exercise of power by the Central Government. If the Central Government were to issue a direction to the Chief Minister and other Ministers to exercise the executive power of the State in a particular manner, the State would be clearly affected if such direction is unconstitutional and would be entitled to complain against it. if 13 the Central Government proceeds Without any constitutional authority to enquire how the executive power of the State is exercised by the Chief Minister and other Ministers and whether it is exercised in a proper manner, the State would clearly have a locus to challenge the unconstitutional action of the Central Government. [118 E-G] (f) It is not a sine qua non of the applicability of Art.
 131 that there should be infringement of some legal right of the plaintiff before it can institute a suit under the Article. What the Article requires is that the dispute must be one which involves a question "on which the existence or extent of legal right depends". The legal right may be that of the plaintiff or of the defendant. In other words, what is necessary is that the existence or extent of the legal right must be in issue in the dispute between the parties.
 [118 H] (g) Article 131 does not lay down any particular mode of proceeding for exercise of the original jurisdiction conferred by it. Although the Supreme Court Rules contemplate that the original jurisdiction of the Court under this Article shall be invoked by means of a suit that is not the requirement of the Article. While interpreting the Article one is perhaps unconsciously influenced to import the notion of cause of action which is germane in a suit and read this Article as limited only to cases where some legal right of the plaintiff is infringed and consequently it has a cause of action against the defendant.
 But there is no reference to a suit or cause of action in Art. 131. That Article confers jurisdiction on the Supreme Court with reference to the character of the dispute which may be brought before it for adjudication. The requirement of cause of action, which is so necessary in a suit, cannot be imported while construing the scope and ambit of Art.
 131. (115 E & 119 B-C] (h) The only requirement necessary for attracting the applicability of Art. 131 is that the dispute must be one involving any question "on which the existence or extent of a legal right" depends irrespective of whether the legal right is claimed by one party or the other and it is not necessary that some legal right of the plaintiff should be infringed before a suit can be brought under that Article.
 [119 E-F] (i) The word "right" is used in Art. 131 in a generic sense and not according to its strict meaning. A right in its narrow sense constitutes the correlative of duty, but in its generic sense includes not only right strict to sense but "any advantage or benefit conferred upon a person by a rule of law." The word "right" has four different meanings : (i) Right stricto sensu; (ii) liberty, (iii) power; and (iv) immunity. In its strict sense 'right' is defined as interest which the law protects by imposing corresponding duty (in others. "Liberty" is exemption from the right of another and its correlative is " no right"; "power, is ability to change the legal relations of another and its correlative is liability. "Immunity" is exemption from the legal power of another and its correlative is disability.
 [119 H & 120 A] (i) The word 'right' is used in Art. 131 in the generic sense. If the State claims to be entitled to legislate exclusively on a particular Matter on the ground that it falls within List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and the Union of India questions this right of the State, the dispute would be one relating, not to any right of the State in the strict sense of the term. but to the 'liberty' of the State to legislate on such matters and it would come directly within the terms of Art. 131. Even a dispute relating to the power of the Union of India to abolish the legislative assembly of a State or to dissolve it would fall within the scope and ambit of Article 131.

 Untwalia, Shinghal and Jaswant Singh, JJ. (Dissenting) The suit is not maintainable. [126 D] 14 (a) The State by itself is an ideal person, a legal entity, unchangeable, invisible and immutable. The Government is the agency through which the will of the State is formulated, expressed and executed. [123 E] (b) In relation to the existence of a dispute between the Union of India on the one hand and one or more States on the other, the expression used in Art. 131 for the former is Government of India signifying that the dispute may be with the Government of India but the other party to the dispute must be the State only and not any limb of the State, namely, the executive, the legislature or the judiciary.
 Article 300 of the Constitution which states that the Government of India may sue or be sued by the name of Union of India and the Government of a State may sue or be sued by the. name of the State is only an enabling provision. An inroad upon the right of the Government may, in certain circumstances, be an inroad upon the legal right of the State, and if there is any invasion on the legal right of a State the agency through which action will be commenced, may be the Government of the State. Article 300 merely prescribes the mode of describing a party to the suit. But the real answer to the maintainability of the suit is to be found from Art. 131 itself. [123 F-G] (c) Article 131 does not specifically state whose legal right the question involved in the dispute must relate to and in what respect. To say that for the application of the Article it is sufficient that the plaintiff questions the legal or constitutional right asserted by the defendant may not be correct. Ordinarily and generally in any suit the competition is between the legal right of the plaintiff and the defendant. But primarily the plaintiff has to establish his legal right to succeed in the suit. if the defendant establishes his legal right, the suit fails. If either party fails to establish the legal right, yet the suit fails because the plaintiff cannot succeed unless he establishes his legal right. The expression "the existence or extent of a legal right used in Art. 131 is meant to bring about this result. It was neither necessary nor advisable to state further in the Article that the dispute must involve any question on which the legal right of the plaintiff must depend. (124 B; E-F] (d) It is well-established that a Minister is an officer subordinate to the Governor. The enquiry set up in this case is not against the State or the State Government, but against the Chief Minister and other Ministers to whom it is open to move the High Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution and the High Court would then have referred the question of vires of the Act to the Supreme Court under Art.
 131A. But, that in no way entitles the State to invoke the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Art. 131.

 (e) There is no force in the contention that it is only the State Government and not the Central Government which has the right to order an enquiry under s. 3. There may be competition between the power of one authority. (Central Government) and another (State Government), but unless the power exercised by one authority brings about a dispute impinging upon the legal right of the other party, the latter cannot come under Art. 131 and say that merely because it was within its power to do so, its legal right is affected by the illegal exercise of the power by the other party. The exercise of power must directly or by necessary implication affect the legal right of the other party.
 Suppose for example, if Parliament passes a law under Entry 8 (intoxicating liquors) in List II and in pursuance of that law, makes an order against a resident in a State, the order is bad as having been issued under an invalid law made by Parliament. The State Government, in such a case, cannot file a suit under Art. 131 merely because the order had been made against its resident under a law which encroached upon the legislative field of the State. In the instant case the concerned ministers can challenge the impugned notification but the notification can in no way be said to have affected or restrained the State Government from giving effect to its notification. [125 B; D-G] 15 (f) Moreover, if a restricted meaning were not to be given to the scope of the suit which can be filed under Art. 131 very anomalous results may follow. Any action taken by the Central Government under the Act or otherwise against any citizen residing in or an officer of a State, could be challenged by institution of a suit under Art. 131 by the State on the ground that the action of the Central Government is ultra vires and without any legal right. A Minister, being an officer of the State, the order affecting him cannot confer a right of suit on the State under Art.
 131. [126 B-C] (Concurring with the majority) 2(a) There is no justification for reading down the provisions of the Act nor are the provisions constitutionally invalid on any account. [137 C] (b) The Indian Constitution is not federal in character, but has been characterised as quasi-federal in nature. Even though the executive and legislative functions of the Centre and States have been defined and distributed, there runs through it all a thread or rein in the hands of the Centre in both the fields. Apart from the exclusive legislative power of the Centre and the States, both have concurrent powers of legislation in regard to the entries of List III.
 The residuary power lies with the Parliament (Art. 248, Entry 97 of List I). Parliament has a predominant hand in respect of matters in the concurrent list (Art. 254). In certain circumstances, Parliament has power to legislate on matters in the State List (Articles 249, 250, 252 and 253).
 Article 256 provides, inter alia, that the executive power of the Union shall extend to the giving of such directions to a State as may appear to the Government of India to be necessary for that purpose. There are also other important features which demonstrate the weak federal structure and the controlling hand of the Centre over the States. The Governor is appointed by the President and holds office at his pleasure. He reports to the Centre from time to time about the administration of the State. Entry 45 in List II empowers the Parliament to legislate on the subject of inquiries for the purpose of any of the matters specified in List II. Parliament has power to admit into the Union, or establish, new States (Art. 2) and can make a law for the formation of new States and alteration of areas and boundaries if existing States (Art. 3). [128 A-D; 129 C-E] State of West, Bengal v. Union of India [1964] 1 S.C.R. 371 referred to.
 (c) The law made under Entry 45 of List III can cover an inquiry in matters like corruption, nepotism or maladministration in any executive action of the State Government. Such an enquiry neither interferes with the legislative power of the State nor with its executive action. An inquiry under the Act by a Commission appointed thereunder, which is a fact finding body, is for the purpose of finding the facts. It cannot be said that a Commission appointed by the Central Government under the Act cannot be appointed for finding facts in relation to the allegations made against a Minister of a State. [131 B-C] (d) In an enquiry set up under the Act, there is no prosecution, no framing of a formal charge, no accused before the Commission of Inquiry and there is no exercise of any supervisory or disciplinary jurisdiction by the Central Government against the State Government nor is there any usurpation of any executive function of the State. The Centre is concerned with and interested only in knowing and ascertaining facts as regards the allegations made against a Chief Minister, Minister or any other officer of the State Government. [132 A-B; C] (3) It may be true to say that the Ministers of the State Government are not under the disciplinary control of the Central Government. But it would be incongruous and anomalous to say that it is only the State Government which is competent to appoint a Commission of Inquiry against itself or its Ministers. It is not likely that the Ministers, while remaining in office, would set up Commissions of Inquiry for enquiring into their alleged misdeeds even if it is assumed that this is possible, it does not lead to the conclusion that their power is exclusive and excludes the power of the Central Government under the Act. There is nothing in the Constitution to indicate that the power of the State Legislature or the State Government is exclusive. It may be co-extensive 16 and such a situation is postulated and provided for in the proviso to s. 3(1) of the Act. There is nothing in the Act or the Constitution which excludes the power of the Central Government to set up a Commission of Inquiry for finding facts in regard to the alleged maladministration of the State. After ascertaining the facts, further action may follow in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution or the law. The Act does not provide for any kind of disciplinary action against a Minister. [132 F-H] (4) The doctrine of collective responsibility does not grant immunity to the State Ministers from being subjected to the provisions of the Commissions of Inquiry Act. In truth, it is little more than a political practice which is commonplace and inevitable. All that it means is that Cabinet decisions bind all Cabinet Ministers even if they argued in the opposite direction in the Cabinet, and that the team must not be weakened by some of its members making clear in public that they disapprove of the Government's policy. It only means that the Council of Ministers will have to stand or fall together, every member being responsible for the action of any other. [134 E] "Representative and Responsible Government" by A.

 (5) The power granted to Parliament under Entry 45 of List III is clear and explicit for passing a law for inquiries in regard to any of the matters in List II. That being so the power cannot be curtail by the doctrine of implied prohibition. The doctrine of implied prohibition was definitely rejected by Courts in England and Australia and by an overwhelming majority of this Court in Kesavanda Bharati's case. The only way in which the Court could determine whether the prescribed limits of legislative power had been exceeded or not is by looking to the terms of the instrument by which affirmatively the legislative power was created and by which negatively they are restricted.

 (6) There is no substance in the argument that a commission appointed by the Central Government to inquire into the same matter for which a commission had already been set up by the State Government is violative of s. 3(1) (b) of the Act.
 The notification of the State Government has not, in terms, appointed any commission for inquiring into the matter-, of alleged corruption, nepotism, favouritism and mal- administration of the Chief Minister or any other Minister of the Government. The items referred to for inquiry by the State Commission were "irregularities committed or excess payments made in certain matters relating to contracts, grant of loan, allotment of sites, purchase IT of furniture, disposal of foodgrains, etc." In none of those clauses, is it mentioned as to the person responsible for the alleged irregularities or maladministration. There is no reference to any alleged misconduct, corruption or maladministration of the Chief Minister or any other Minister. In contrast, the terms of reference in the notification issued by the Centre is to enquire into the specific matters enumerated in Annexure I, one of which is covered by the notification of the State Government. In regard to specific matters in Annexture II, there may be some common matters which are the subject-matter of enquiry by the State Government. but in regard to matters in Annexure II, the notification in clear terms excludes any matter covered by the notification of the State Government. The Commission appointed by the Central Government, therefore, would he competent to exclude such matters from the purview, of its enquiry. [137 E-F] 17 Per Kailasam, J. (concurring) 1(a) The suit is maintainable. When the exercise of the executive functions of the State through its officers is interfered with by the Central Government, it cannot be said that the legal right of the State is not affected. [168 G;
 167 Al (b) The executive powers of the State will be exercised by the Governor with the aid and advice of the Chief Minister and other Ministers, The power is exercised either directly or indirectly through officers subordinate to the Governor in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.
 According to the impugned notification the Commission of Inquiry was appointed for the purpose of making an inquiry into a definite matter of public importance, namely, charges of corruption, nepotism, favouritism and misuse of govern- mental power levelled against the Chief Minister and certain other Ministers ,of the State. Therefore, the scope of the inquiry- would inevitably involve the functioning of the executive of the State. The dispute in the instant case relates to the functioning of the State in exercise of the powers conferred under the Constitution and so. the States legal rights are affected.

 (c) The Government of India Act, 1858, provided only absolute imperial control without any popular participation in the administration. The Government of India Act 1919, for the first time introduced dyarchy in the Provinces. Under this Act the Provinces were delegates of the Centre and the Central legislature retained the power to legislate on any subject for the whole of India. The Government of India Act, 1935 changed the unitary nature of the Government under the 1919 Act into a federal structure and made the Provinces as units. The 1935 Act divided legislative powers between the centre and the provinces; the Federal list comprising of subjects over which the federal legislature had exclusive powers of legislation, the Provincial List comprising of subjects over which the Provincial legislatures had exclusive jurisdiction and the Concurrent List comprising of subjects over which both the Federal and Provincial legislatures had power to make laws. Under the Constitution the States, in several respects, are subordinate to the Central Government in that the formation of the federation was not as a result of any treaty between the States and the Federation. There are various features of the Constitution which make it strictly not federal. It has variously been described as quasifederal or federal in structure or federal system with a strong central bias. In the scheme of distribution of powers between the Union and the States, there is a strong tilt in favour of the Union. For the purpose of settling disputes between the Centre and the States a machinery is also provided for in the ,Constitution itself. [140 C; 141 C; 142] (d) In determining what the respective powers of the Centre and the States are, one has to look into the Constitution.
 Since the States are not the delegates of the Central Government and the source of power both for the Union as well as the States being the Constitution itself, the Central Government cannot exercise any power over the States which is not provided for in the Constitution. There is no overriding power with the Union Government. [143 B] Atiabari Tea Co. Ltd. v. The State of Assam & Ors. [1960] INSC 123; [1961] 1 SCR 809, Automobile Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd. v. The State of Rajasthan [1963] 1 SCR 491. State of West Bengal v.

 (e) Under Article 254(1) when a law made by the State Legislature is In conflict with any provision of law made by Parliament or to any provision of any existing law with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List, then the law made by Parliament shall prevail and the State law shall be void to the extent of repugnancy. [149 C] (f) Before declaring a law as repugnant an attempt should be made to see whether the conflict could be avoided by construction. [149 C] (g) Article 248(1) and Entry. 97 in List I of the Seventh Schedule make it clear that the residuary power is with Parliament and when a matter sought 18 to be legislated is not included in List II or List II Parliament has power to make laws with respect to that matter or tax. But the function of the Lists is not to confer powers on the legislature; they only demarcate the legislative field. Since there is no provision in the Constitution conferring on the Union the power to supervise the governmental functions of the State reference to the Lists will not solve, the problem raised in this case.

 (b) The well accepted basic principles of construction of the Constitution as laid down by decided cases are that when a question arises whether the prescribed limit shave been exceeded, the only way in which it can be done is by looking into the terms of the instrument by which affirmatively the legislative powers were created and by which negatively they are restricted. If what has been done is legislation within the general scope of the affirmative words which give the power, and if it violates no express conditioner restriction by which that power is limited, it is not for any Court of justice to inquire further or to enlarge constructively those conditions and restrictions.If the text is explicit the text is conclusive. When the text is ambiguous, recourse must be had to the context and scheme of the Act. Yet another well-accepted aid to construction is that the history which lies behind an enactment is admissible because to find out the meaning of the law, recourse may legitimately be had to the prior state of the law, the evil sought to be remedied and the process by which the law was evolved. [150 H; 151 A] (i)The golden rule of interpretation that in construing words in a Constitution conferring legislative power, the most liberal construction should be put upon the words, admits of certain exceptions. If it is found necessary to prevent conflict between two exclusive jurisdictions a restricted meaning may be given to the words. Further, in interpreting the words of a statute the main object is to ascertain the intention expressed by the words used, that is, to ascertain "the intention of them that made it." [154 F-G] R.v.

 (j)Articles 256 and 257 list the obligations of the States and the Union and control of the Union over the States in certain cases. Article 257(A) (introduced by 42nd Amendment of the Constitution) empowers the Government of India to deploy any armed forces of the Union or any other force for dealing with any grave situation of law and order in any State. Except in cases referred to in these Articles, the Constitution does not provide for the Union Government to give any directions to the State Government. As there is no specific article in the Constitution enabling the Union Government to cause an inquiry into the governmental functions of the State the power cannot be assumed by ordinary legislation but resort must be had to a constitutional amendment. [152 C-D; F; H] (k)The Constitution being the fundamental law, no law passed under mere legislative power can effect any change in the Constitution unless there is an express power to that effect given in he Constitution itself. There are a number of articles which expressly provide for amendment of the Constitution by law. But where no power is conferred on the Parliament to make laws, it cannot add to the Constitution by ordinary law making process. [153 C] I.C. Golak Nath & Ors. v. State of Punjab & Anr. [1967] INSC 45; [1967] 2 S.C.R. 762 referred to.
 (1) Entry 45 in List III (Enquiries........ for the purposes of any of the matters specified in List II or List III) should not be given a wide meaning as, 19 conferring on the Union and the State Government powers to enact a provision to embark on an inquiry as to the misuse of the governmental powers by the other. [155 C-D] River Wear Commissioners v. Adamson [1877] 2 A.C. 743, R.M.D. Chamarbaugwalla v. The Union of India [1957] INSC 32; [1957] SCR 930 and Bengal Immunity Co. Ltd. v. State of Bihar [1955] 2 SCR 603 referred to.
 (m)The power conferred under Entry 45 List III cannot be construed in such a manner as to lead to the conclusion that if a law enacted by Parliament empowers the Union Government to conduct an inquiry into the misuse of governmental functions by a Minister of State Government, the State will have the power to legislate empowering it to enquire into the misuse of governmental powers by a Union Minister relating to matters in List III. Such an interpretation would not be conducive to the harmonious functioning of the Union and the States. [155 D-E] (n)The decisions on which the Union Government relied for the proposition that the words "definite matter of public importance" would embrace an inquiry into the misuse of governmental functions of the State, do not support that contention. In M. V. Rajwade v. Dr. S. M. Hassan and Others the commission appointedwas only a fact-finding body meant to instruct the mind of the Government andthe scope of the inquiry fell within s. 3 as it related to a definite matter ofpublic importance and not an inquiry into the misuse of governmental functions of a Chief Minister or a State Minister.In Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Shri Justice S. R. Tendolkar and others,, it was held that the act and conduct of individuals may assume such dangerous proportions as may well affect the public well- being and thus become a definite matter of public importance. But neither decision concludes the point arising in 'this case, namely, whether the words "definite matter of public importance" should be construed as to include the right to inquire into the abuse of governmental functions by a State Government. Again in State of Jammu & Kashmir v. Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad which is an authority for the proposition that inquiry into the acts of a person who had ceased to be a Chief Minister may continue to be a matter of public importance it was held that the inquiry into the past acts which have affected the public well-being would be matters of public importance and it was irrelevant if the person who committed those acts was still in power to be able to repeat them. [158 A-H] Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Shri Justice S. R. Tendolkar & Others [1958] INSC 30; [1959] SCR 279, State of Jammu and Kashmir v. Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad, [1966] Supp. SCR 401 and M. V. Rajwade v.
 Dr. S. M. Hassan & Others I.L.R. [1954] Nag. I held inapplicable.
