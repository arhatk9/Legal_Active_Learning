 The respondent acquired the lands of the appellants. Some of the lands were cultivated by the appellants themselves and others by tenants. As a result of the Mysore Tenancy Act, 1952, which was amended by Mysore Acts 16 of 1957, 24 of 1962 and 12 of 1963, and, the Mysore Tenants (Temporary Protection From Eviction) Act, 1961, the tenants, though they were inducted originally as annual tenants, they got as deemed tenants, a fixed and secured tenure for additional periods.
 The respondent fixed compensation at Rs. 600 per acre for tank-fed lands and Rs. 500 per acre for rain-fed lands. On a reference under s. 18 of the Land Acquisition Act. 1894, the compensation' was increased to Rs. 2500 per acre for tank-fed lands and Rs. 2000 for rain-fed lands.
 On appeal, the High Court fixed a uniform rate of compensa- tion at Rs. 1250 for all lands, whether tank-fed or rain- fed, and whether self-cultivated or cultivated by tenants.
 On the question whether the High Court followed a correct principle, this Court, in appeal, 
HELD : The matter should be remanded to the High Court for a fresh calculation of the compensation.
 (1) The High Court was in error in equating lands cultivated by the tenants and those under the personal cultivation of the appellants and applying to both a uniform measure. The two kinds of lands ought to have been separately treated and even if the rent in the case of tenant occupied land was taken as a measure for such land, that could not properly be the measure for arriving at the market value of the land under the appellants' personal cultivation, because, the net return to the appellants from each of the two kinds of lands is bound to differ. The annual rent paid by the tenant may not be the correct or real income obtainable by the appellants, the rent agreed upon several years ago may not be the fair rent by reason of several factors and the lands themselves may not be equal in quality, situation or productivity. [265 C] (2) in view of the provisions of the Mysore Act, it should have been ascertained whether the tenants had any interest in the land and whether they were entitled to any share in the compensation payable in respect of lands under their cultivation, subject to any bar of limitation under s. 18 of the Land Acquisition Act. If the tenants are entitled to any share of the compensation, it should be allocated to them. If this were to be done, the annual income of the lands will have to be ascertained afresh from the evidence on record or otherwise to arrive .it the correct market value. [266 F]
