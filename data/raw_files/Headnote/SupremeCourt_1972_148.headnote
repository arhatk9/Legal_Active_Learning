 In pursuance of detention order under s. 3 of the West Bengal Prevevenion of Violent Activities) Act, 1970, the petitioner was arrested. The State Government received a representation from the petitioner against his detention, which was rejected by the St-ate Government 27 days after the receipt of the representation. The delay in considering the representation of the petitioner was not explained.
 Allowing the petition under Art. 32, 
HELD : According to Art. 22(5) of the Constitution when any person is detained in pursuance of an order made under any law providing for preventive detention, the authority making the order shall, as soon as may be, communicate to such person the grounds on which the order has been made and shall afford him the earlier opportunity if making a representation against the order. The fact that the earliest opportunity has to be afforded to the detenu for making a representation necessarily implies that, as and when the representation is made, it should be dealt with promptly. Otherwise, the requirement would be reduced to a farce and empty formality. In case the authority concerned is guilty of unexplained delay in dealing with the representation, the detention. would be liable to be assailed and declared unvalid on the ground of interaction of Art. 22(5) of the Constitution. This is as it should be because the matter relates to the liberty of a subject who has been ordered to be detained without recourse to a regular trial in a court of law. [682B-F] Jayanarayan Suku v.
