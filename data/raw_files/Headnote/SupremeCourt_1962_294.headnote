 A company, running,a sugar mill was suffering losses every year due to insufficient supply of sugarcane and wanted to shift the mill. The cane-growers formed a cooperative society and purchased the mill. As agreed between the company and the society, the company terminated the services of the employees and paid retrenchment compensation to them under s 25FF of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1917. The society employed some of the old employees of the company but did not, employ 49 permanent and 103 seasonal employees out of them. The dispute arising out of the refusal of the society to absorb these workmen was referred for adjudication. The 'Tribunal, by its award, directed the appellant society to re-employ with continuity of service as many of old employees as were left out in favour of new employees, aid to re-employ the remaining employees as and when vacancies occurred, The society contended that it was not a successor-in-interest of the company and the claim for reemployment was riot sustainable and that the services of the employees having, been terminated upon payment of compensation by the company under s. 251, F no claim could be made against the transferee of the company Held, that the appellant society was the successor-in- interest of the company. The question as to whether a purchaser of an industrial concern is a successor-in- interest of the vendor has to be decided on a consideration of several relevant facts such as-, whether the purchaser purchased the whole of the business; was the business purchased is a going 731 concern; is the business carried on the same or similar as that carried on by the vendors is it carried on at the same place; is the business carried on without a substantial break in continuity; has goodwill been purchased; is the purchase of all the parts or only of some etc. The decision of the question depends upon the evaluation of all the relevant factors and it cannot be reached by treating any one of them as of over-riding or conclusive significance.
 In the present case the society purchased the concern for the purpose of manufacturing sugar and carried on the same business, at the same place without any appreciable break.

 Held, further that the claim of the employees for re- instatement was not sustainable. In all cases falling under s.25FF of the Act, if the transfer does not come within the proviso, the employees of the transferred concern are entitled to claim compensation against the transferor but they cannot make any claim for re-employment against the transferee. The employees were not entitled to both compensation for termination of service and immediate re- employment at the hands ,of the transferee. Section 25H was not applicable to the case as the termination of service upon transfers or closure is not retrenchment properly so called. Termination of service with which s. 25FF deals cannot be equated with retrenchment covered by s. 25 F. The words "as if" in s. 25FF clearly distinguish between retrenchment under s.2(00) and termination of service under s.25FF. Nor could the principles underlying, s. 25H be applied to the case. The general principles of social justice and fair play did not justify the claim for re- employment simultaneously with the payment of retrenchment compensation.
