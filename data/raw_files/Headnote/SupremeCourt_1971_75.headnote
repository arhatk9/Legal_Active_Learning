 The demand for vacation allowance of the workmen of the appellants, at the same rate as was granted to the higher staff, was granted by the Industrial Tribunal. The Tribunal decided the question on the basis that the appellant- employer had the financial capacity to stand the burden of such allowance being granted to the workmen at the rate claimed.
 Allowing the appeal and remanding the matter to be considered afresh by the Tribunal, 
HELD : (1) The ultimate object of industrial adjudication in this country is to help the growth and progress of national economy; and for realising that object, industrial disputes are settled on principles of fair play and justice harmonising the conflicting claims of capital and labour with full awareness of socioeconomic trends of thought.
 industrial law in this country, is therefore, expected to effectively secure, to the workers, conditions of service reasonably conducive to the improvement of their social and economic standard of living and their moral and material development. The industrial labour problems in this coun- try, having their roots in the historical background of social, economic and political conditions have, little in common with such problems in the United States or other developed countries. Therefore, the American lines of thought should not be too readily and indiscriminately followed, [861 D-G] (2) Wage policy relating to workmen is a complex and sensitive of public policy, because, the relative status of workmen in the society, their commitment to industry, their attitude towards the management, their motivation towards productivity, and their standard and way of life are all conditioned by wages. It is not a purely economic policy in which an employer and an employee alone are interested, but the consumer and the society at large and a fortiori the State, are also vitally interested. No wage policy can ever be applied in vacuum in disregard of the realities of the social and economic conditions in our country Considering the question of wages 'in the background of the Directive Principles in the Constitution, a wage structure should serve to promote a fair remuneration to labour ensuring due social dignity, personality and security, a fair return to capital, and strengthen incentives to efficiency,without being unmindful of the legitimate interests and expectations of the consumer in the matter of prices. Guided by this principle, if the financial capacity of an industry permits the workers should be allowed a due share in the prosperity of the industry to which they have contributed by their labour, so as to enable them, within reasonable limits to improve their standard of living. [863 D-H] (3) But in the present case, the Tribunal had committed a serious error in not considering the other allowances and amenities allowed to, 856 respondents-workmen, and comparing their total wage packet with the total wage packet of those employees to whom the allowancer had been allowed when determining the question. The difference between the amenities allowed to the workmen and to the staff to whom vacation allowance has been granted must in law and justice be looked into and the question then decided whether or nor the present workmen's demand is justified. [863 H-864 A, B-C] The principle of region-cum-industry has no doubt to kept ill view but then the comparable industries in the region have to co nsidered from all the relevant aspects which have been laid down by this Court in various decisions. The fact that in the refineries in the region similar allowance is granted as a result of settlement cannot, on that account alone be considered to be irrelevant, because, that may appropriately indicate that the demand of the workmen in those industries not considered, unjust. [864 B-D] The total Wage packet of the various categories of employees in the appellant's industry itself, including the question of the nature of their duties and functions. however, deserves to be given primary importance. so that. there is no reasonable chance of heart burning and discontentment amongst the different categories of workmen on account of differential treatment which, though seemingly justifiable may, in real effect be discriminatory.
