 -The Society levelled certain charges against him and some other erployee and a committee was appointed to enquire into the said-charges. The request made by Respondent No.2 that a 'railway worker or an official of the railway workers this account he refused to appear at the enquiry which proceeded in his Union be allowed to accompany him at the enquiry was turned down absence. On receipt of the enquiry committees report the Vice-President of the soceity gave a second notice to Respondent No. 2 asking him to show cause why he should not be dismissed. He asked for copies of the proceedings at the enquiry but this request was not complied, with and despite his -submissions he was di missed. Adverse orders were also passed against other employees. The railway workers Union thereupon raised an industrial dispute which was referred by the State Government to the industrial Tribunal. The Society filed a writ petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution on the ground that the dispute having been raised by, the railway workers Union and not the Society's own employees, the:
 reference to the Tribunal war, not competent. The High Court dismissed the petition. Tbereafter the Tribun, heard the matter and held, so far as Respondent No. 2 was conceme, that (i) the charges against him, were vagup, (ii) that he was not entititled to be accompanied at the enquiry by a stranger, and (iii) that the enquiry against him was vitiated owing to a denial of natural justice. The Society, by special leave, appealed to this Court.
 
HELD : (i) The appellant's plea relating to the competency of the reference was barred by res judicata as the same plea had been raised by the appellant before the High Court and had been rejected. Ile order of the High Court was not an interlocutory order but a final 6rdbr in regard to the proceedings under Art. 226. The appropriate remedy for to this Court' either bv a certificate underart. 133 or by special leave under Art. 136 of the constitution [483 F; 484 D] Sathyadhyan Ghosal & Ors. v.Sm. Deorajin Debi & Anr. [19W] 3 S.C.R, 590, distinguished.
 477 Ramesh and Anr. V. Gendalal Motilal Patni & Ors., [1966] INSC 5; [1966] 3 S.C.R. 198, relied on.
 (ii) The respondents were entitled to support the decision of the Tribunal even on grounds which were not accepted by the Tribunal or on other grounds which may not have been taken notice of by the Tribunal while they were patent on the face of the record. [486 D] Ramanbhai Ashabhai Patel v. Dabhi Ajitkumar Fulsinji & Ors.,A.I.R. 1965 S.C. 669 and Powari Tea Estate v. Barkataki (M.K.) and Ors., [1965] 11 L.L.J. 102, relied on.
 (iii) The Tribunal rightly held that the second respondent was not entitledto be represented by a stranger to the Society at the enquiry proposed to be held against him. [487 D-E] (iv)The charges against the second respondent were vague and the material which was available in support of them was never disclosed to him. In these circumstances the mere refusal of the second respondent to appear at the enquiry would not satisfy the requirements of natural justice and make the enquiry valid. [487 F-G] The second notice issued by the Society to the second respondent was not required by any rule or law analogous to Art. 311 of the Constitution, but In the instant case this subsequent opportunity was the only opportunity which could have satisfied the requirements of- natural justice. But this opportunity also was not adequate because copies of the proceedings against him were not supplied to the second respondent.-[487 H-488 A] The Tribunal was therefore fully justified in setting aside the order of removal based on the report of the committee of enquiry.
