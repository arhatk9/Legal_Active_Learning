 The petitioners were Tahsildars in the quondam state of Hyderabad. After the new state of Bombay was constituted with territories drawn from various existing States including Hyderabad, under the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, equation of posts and determination of inter se seniority was done by the Allocated Government Servants' (Absorption, Seniority. Pay and Allowance) Rules, 1957.
 Under these rules (1957-Rules) the Government of Bombay dec- lared that the posts of Mamlatdar in the former State of Bombay shall be deemed to be equivalent to the posts of Tahsildars from the former State of Hyderabad, and the posts of Deputy Collector in the former State of Bombay shall be deemed to be equivalent to the posts of Deputy Collector allocated from the former State of Hyderabad. The recruitment to the posts of Deputy Collector was provided for by Rules of 30th July, 1959, (1959-Rules) according to which vacancies to the posts of Deputy Collector were to be filled from three sources : 50% by nomination on the basis of the result of competitive examination; 25% by directly.
 recruited Mamlatdars who have put in at least 7 years, service including the period spent on probation and the remaining 25% by Mamlatdars promoted from the lower ranks in the revenue departments. The reservation of 25% in favour of directly recruited Mamlatdars was made by the second proviso to rule (1) of the Rules. On 7th April, 1961 the Government laid down the principles, for regulating the preparation and revision of select list of Mamlatdars/Tahsildars fit to be appointed as Deputy Collectors in posts to be filled by promotion. The procedure provided that a Review Committee should in July- August each year review the claims of all Mamlatdars for promotion to the posts of Deputy Collector and should draw up a select list for each division of those who are considered by the Committee as fit for promotion. When a vacancy arose in the posts of Deputy Collector in a division the Mamlatdar whose name was highest in the divisional select list was promoted as officiating Deputy Collector in the vacant post. The name of such Mamlatdars though so promoted, continued in the divisional select list until he was confirmed in the cadre of Deputy Collectors or retired from service. There was a periodical review of the working of the officiating deputy collectors and on such review the rank in the divisional select list was adjusted so as to reflect the assessment of the relative merits of the ,officiating deputy collectors. The promotions as officiating deputy collectors were thus made for each division separately on the basis of its divisional select list in which the ranking changed periodically as a result of review and assessment. Then, deemed dates of continuous officiation were given to the officiating deputy collectors from each division with a view to ensure that their inter se ranking in the divisional select list was not affected by the fact that an officer lower in rank in the divisional,- select list might have been officiating as Deputy Collector for a longer period than another in higher rank. _On the basis of the deemed dates of continuous officiation given to the officiating Deputy Collector in each division a combined statewide seniority list of officiating Deputy Collectors was prepared and confirmation in the cadre of Deputy Collectors were made in accordance with the seniority in such combined statewise seniority list. This procedure did not have the warrant of any legislative rules or administrative orders. It was in accordance with this pro- cedure that the petitioners were promoted as officiating Deputy Collectors but 2 1 7 some of the allocated Mamlatdars/Tahsildars in other divisions who were junior to the petitioners became officiating Deputy Collectors earlier than the petitioners and were consequently entitled to be confirmed in-the cadre of Deputy Collectors in preference to the petitioners. The petitioners filed a writ petition in this Court, challenging the procedure for promotion, 
HELD : The second proviso to rule (1) of the 1959-Rules is void as being violative of Art. 16 of the Constitution. The procedure for promotion to the cadre of Deputy Collectors followed by the State Govenment is also invalid on the ground that it denies equality of opportunity of promotion and is therefore hit by Art 16 of the Constitution, and hence the Government resolution dated 7th April 1961 must be quashed. The State Government should readjust the promotions as officiating Deputy Collectors as also the confirmation in the cadre of Deputy. Collectors and the readjustment should be made with retrospective effect and the petitioners should be given the benefit of seniority, pay and other allowances from the respective dates on which they would have been promoted had the promotions been made on the, correct basis. [238E-G], (1)The petitioners were not guilty of any laches or delay in filing the petition. [226F] (a) The rule that the Court may not inquire into belated and stale claims is not a rule of law, but a rule of practice based on exercise of sound judicial discretion depending on the facts of each case. In the present case, in January 1961, the petitioners were informed that the rules of recruitment to the posts of Deputy Collector in the reorganised State of Bombay had not yet been unified, that the petitioners continued to be governed by the rules of the exHyderabad State and that the 1959-Rules did not apply to them. It was only when the Bombay High Court decided Kapoor's case on 23rd March 1968, that the petitioners came to know that it was.the case of the State Government which was accepted by the High Court, that the 1959-Rules we-re the unified rules of recruitment to the posts of Deputy Collector applicable throughout the reorganised State of Bombay. The petitioners thereafter did not lose any time in filing the present petition. [226F-G 227 A-C] (b) Moreover, what is challenged is the validity of the procedure for making promotions to the posts of Deputy Collector and since this procedure is still being followed by the State Government it is desirable that its constitu- tionality should be adjudged when the question has come up before the Court. [227C-D] (c)In the present case all promotions that have been made by State Government are provisional and the position has not been crystallised. Even if the petitions were allowed and the reliefs claimed by. the petitioner were granted to them, it would not result in the reversion of any Deputy Collector or officiating Deputy Collector to the position of Mamlatdar/Tahsildar. The only effect would be merely to disturb their inter se seniority as officiating deputy collectors or as deputy collectors. Hence there is no question of rights, which have accrued to others by reason of the delay in filing the petition, being disturbed. [227G- 228B] (d) The claim of enforcement of the fundamental right of equal opportunity under Art. 16 is itself a right guarantees under Art. 32 and this Court, which has been assigned the role of a sentinel on the qui ve for protection of fundamental rights, cannot allow itself to be persuaded to refuse relief solely on the ground of laches. delay or the like. [228B-C] Tilockchand Motichand v. H. B. Munshi [1969] 2 S.C.R. 824, referred to.
 (2) The petitioners could not be said to have any adequate alternative legal remedy. [228F-G] (a)The petitioners could not have applies for review of the judgment of the Bombay High Court in Kapoor's case. They were not persons directly or immediately affected by the judgment and it could not be said that they were necessary parties to the petition who should have been heard before the judgment was given. [228D-E] 218 (b) The subject matter of the present petition is, barring only one question namely the validity of the second proviso to rule (1) of the 1959-Rules, wholly different from that of the petition in Kapoor's case [228E-F] (e) The remedy by way of review of a judgment given in another case in which the petitioners were not parties could hardly be said to be an adequate alternative legal remedy available to the petitioners. [228F-G] (3) Those who are already promoted according to the impugned procedure and whose position vis-a-vis the petitioner would be likely to be affected by the invalidation of such procedure are before the Court as parties to the petition. All those who are necessary parties are before the Court, and there is, therefore no impediment in the way of the Court dealing with the matter.
 [228H] (4) The inter se seniority of the Tahsildars/Mamlatdars allocated from the former State of Hyderabad etc., would be governed by rr. 7, 8 and 9 of the 1957-Rules; and neither the Government resolution dated 21st November 1941 as contended by the petitioners, nor the government resolution dated 29th July 1963 which superseded the 1941-Resolution, would have any application. [229C-E] (5) A right to be considered for promotion is a condition of service, but mere chances of promotion are not. By making promotions to the posts of Deputy Collector divisionwise and limiting such promotions to 50% of the total number of vacancies in the Posts of Deputy Collector as a result of the 1959-Rules, all that happened was to reduce the chances of promotion available to the petitioners. A rule which merely affects the chances 'of promotion cannot be regarded as varying a condition of service. Therefore, neither the 1959-Rules nor the procedure for making promotions to the posts of Deputy Collector divisionwise varies the conditions of service of the petitioners to their disadvantage, and hence could not be assailed on the ,round that the previous approval of the Central Government as required by the proviso to S. 115(7) of the Estates Reorganisation Act was not obtained. [230A-C] State of Mysore v. G. B. Purohit, C.A. No. 2281 of 1965, dated 25th January 1967 followed.
 (6) The petitioners were not right in their contention that the second proviso to r. (1) of the 1959-Rules was a valid provision. Both the directly recruited Mamlatdars as well as the promoted Mamlatdars form one class. They are both known by the same designation. They have the same scales of pay and discharge the same functions. The Posts held by them are interchangeable. There is nothing to show that the two groups are kept apart. Both are merged together in the same class. It is not competent to the Government thereafter to discriminate between directly recruited Mamlatdars and promoted Mamlatdars in the matter of further promotion to the posts of Deputy Collector. That would be violative of Art. 16 of the Constitution. Therefore, the second proviso to r. (1) of the 1959-Rules must be held to be bad.' [230D-G] Meryyn Coutindo v. Collector of Customs. Bombay [1966] 3 S.C.R. and S. M. Pandit v. The State of Gujarat, A.I.R. 1972 S.C. 252, followed.
 (7)(a) The State Government in tie absence of legislative rules, has to make up its mind on the question whether to treat the cadre of Mamlatdars as a State Cadre or a divisional Cadre,,, and it is competent to the State Gov- ernment to take a decision in the exercise of its executive power under Art. 162 of the Constitution. The State Government accordingly decided, on 1st November 1956, that while recruitment to the posts of Mamlatdars should be ,on all State basis" the cadre of Mamlatdars should be according to the divisions. [231D] B. N. Nagarajan v. State of Mysore' [1966] 3 S.C.R. 682 and Sant Ram v. State of Rajasthan, [1968] 1 S.C.R. 11, followed.
 (b) It is true that under the Bombay Civil services Classification and Recruitment Rules the service of Mamlatdars is regarded as Provincial Service 2 1 9 as distinct from Subordinate Service. But that does dot necessarily mean that it cannot be organised into divisional cadres. The only difference between Provincial Service and Subordinate Service reorganised in these Rules in the mode of recruitment. Clearly from 1st November, 1956, the State Government proconceeded on the basis that the cadre of Mamlatdars was a divisional cadre and not a State Cadre.
 [231F-232B] (8) But nothing turns upon this fact, because the procedure for promoting from the divisional cadre of Mamlatdars to the State Cadre of Deputy Collectors %,as not consistent with Art. 16. [232C] (a) The 1959-Rules provided that 50% of the vacancies in the cadre of Deputy Collector should be filled by direct recruitment. But since the cadre of Deputy Collector was a State cadre, 50% of the vacancies, to be filled by direct recruitment were determined on the basis of vacancies in the cadre for the State as a whole and not for any particular division of the State. But in regard to promotion by which the other 50% of the vacancies in the cadre of Deputy Collectors was to-be filled, the State adopted a wholly different procedure. Though a common seniority list of all the Mamlatdars in the State. irrespective of the divisions to which they belonged, could be, prepared without, any difficulty on the basis of the 1951-Rules for the allocate cl Mamlatdars Tahsildars and for the subsequent appointees, on the principle, of continuous officiation up to 29th July 1963 and thereafter according to the rule laid down in the Resolution of 29th July 1963, and a common statewise list could ' also be made of the Mamlatdars found fit for promotion as Deputy Collectors, and promotion to the cadre of Deputy Collectors, could be made on the basis of such Statewise select list, the State Government did not follow this method. and instead, made promotions to, the cadre of Deputy Collectors, which was a State cadre. on the basis of divisional select lists. Where promotion is made by selection on the basis of merit-cum-seniority, every Mamlatdar should have equal opportunity With others for being considered for promotion. But the actual procedure followed limits his opportunity for promotion to avacancy in his own division. This procedure amounts to denial of equality ofopportunity to the Mamlatdars, because it is wholly unrelated to the object and purpose of promotion which is to secure an efficient cadre of Deputy Collectors and in fact negates it. [232D-234F] (b) It is true that confirmations in the cadre of Deputy Collectors are made on the basis of a combined seniority list of officiating Deputy Collectors but that does not cure the infirmity in the mode of promotion. [234F-G] (c) The allotment of deemed dates of continuous officiation cannot help retrieve those who have had no opportunity to be promoted as officiating Deputy Collectors, not on account of want of higher seniority or better merit, but purely on account of lack of adequate number of vacancies in the post, of Deputy Collector arising in their division. The giving of deemed dates of continuous officiation no doubt reflects the relative merits of the Mamlatdars in each division taken as a separate unit, but it does not seek to adjust the seniority of the approved Mamlatdars in all the divisions taken as a whole on the basis of assessment of their relative merits. It does not, therefore, eliminate the initial inequality of treatment. [234G-235C] (d) The decision in Rain Saran v. D.I.G. of Police, [1964] INSC 79; [1964] 7 S.C.R. 228, shows that if the Cadre of promotion is a.divisional cadre, there was divisionwise promotion on the basis of divisional select lists. but if it is a State Cadre, promotion has to be on Statewise basis, so that every officer in the State has equal opportunity of promotion to the State Cadre. [237A-C] (e) It is true that, a Mamlatdar cannot be promoted to the cadre of Deputy Collector unless be officiates as Deputy Collector. But it cannot for that reason be contended that there is an intermediate cadre of officiating Deputy Col- lectors between the cadre of Mamlatdars and the cadre of Deputy Collectors from which promotion is made to the cadre of Deputy Collectors. There is no legislative rule or executive order providing for the creation of any such intermediate cadre of officiating Deputy Collectors. The 1959-Rules provided that the appointment to 50% posts of the Deputy Collectors should be made by promotion of suitable Mamlatdars, that is, promotion should be from the cadre of Mamlatdars to the cadre of Deputy Co lectors. [238B-E] 220 [The :need for simplifying and streamlining service rules and giving there statutory shape so as to promote contentment among the services by extending the area of equal treatment and imparting stability to conditions of service pointed out].
