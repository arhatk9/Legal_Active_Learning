 Allegations of mismanagement and misappropriation were made against the appellant who was the Mutawalli of certain Waqf properties governed by the Bihar Waqfs Act, 1948. The allegations were investigated by the Nazir-e-Awqaf, appointed under s. 22 of the Act and the charges were held proved. The report of the Nazir was accepted by the Sadr (chairman) of the Bihar Subai Sunni Majlis-E-Awqaf (or Majlis) which was supervising the waqf under the Act. After the accounts were checked, the Sadr ordered the appellant to deposit the amount found due from him. The Act was then amended on 24th May 1951, by Act 18 of 1951, by which the removal of a Mutawalli on the ground that he had wilfully disobeyed the orders and direction of the Majlis under the Act, could be made by the Majlis itself without the intervention of the District Judge. When the appellant failed to deposit the amount as ordered, the Sadr passed an order removing him from office and appointed another Mutawalli for one year. The appellant made an application to the District Judge, under s. 27(3) of the Act for setting aside the order. The application was dismissed, but the order appointing the temporary Mutawalli was also set aside.
 Both the appellant and the temporary Mutawalli appealed to the High Court. The High Court dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant and allowed the other appeal. In the appeal to the Supreme Court, it was contended by the appellant that, (i) a number of arguments brought to the notice of the High Court were not considered by the Court, (ii) under s. 27 (2) (h) be could be removed from office only for disobedience of orders and directions of the Majlis given after the Amending Act came into force and not in respect of orders and directions issued previously.
 
HELD : (i) This Court will not allow an argument to be raised on the allegation that the High Court omitted to consider the argument when raised in the High Court. The High Court is a Court of Record and unless an omission is admitted or is demonstrably proved, this Court will not consider an allegation that there is an omission. If any material point does not come under scrutiny, the fact should be brought to the notice of the High Court before judgment is signed and an order of the High Court on such submission obtained before the point is raised in appeal. [209 D-F] The growing practice of making such allegations against the High Court. deprecated. [209 D] (ii)The amendment no doubt conferred jurisdiction upon the Majlis to act prospectively from the date of the amendment but the power under the amendment could be exercised in respect of orders and directions of the Majlis issued by the Majlis and disobeyed by the Mutawalli before the coming into force of the amendment To hold otherwise would mean 206 that in respect of the past conduct neither the Majlis nor the District Judge possessed jurisdiction after amendment.
 A statute is not necessarily used retrospectively when the power conferred by it, is based on conduct anterior to its enactment, if it is clearly intended that the said power must reach back to that conduct. No vested right was being taken away, because there could be no vested right to continue as Mutawalli after mismanagement and misconduct of many sorts were established. [211 C-D, E-F]
