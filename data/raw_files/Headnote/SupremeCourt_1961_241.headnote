 Certain lands out of the petitioner's tea estate were requi- sitioned by the State under the Assam Land (Requisition and Acquisition) Act, 1948. The petitioner challenged the constitutionality of the Act on the ground-, that it was ultra vires the State Legislature in so far as it provided for the requisition and acquisition of tea estates as tea industry was a matter for exclusive legislation by Parliament and that it offended Art.31(2) of the Constitution as it neither provided for payment of compensation for property requisitioned nor specified the principles and the manner in which compensation was to be determined.
 Held, that the Act was not ultra vires the Assam Legislature and was valid. The Act was valid when it was made in 1948 and, would by reason of Art. 372 of the Constitution, continue in force after the commencement of the Constitution until altered, repealed or amended by a competent legislature. The Act in essence provided only for requisition or acquisition of lands in the public interest;
 it had nothing to do with the tea industry. The Tea Act, 1953, made by Parliament, which was mainly concerned with the development of the tea industry and had nothing to do with the requisition and acquisition of land, did not in any way alter, repeal or amend the Assam Act. Further, the Assam Act did not offend Art. 31 (2) of the Constitution.
 There were provisions in the Act for the payment of agreed compensation and in case of disagreement for a reference to the court, in which reference the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, would mutatis mutandis apply. Though the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, did not provide for requisition of land its provisions relating to payment of compensation for acquisition of land could be applied to requisition of land after due alterations.
