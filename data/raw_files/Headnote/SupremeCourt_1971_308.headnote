 The appellant, was convicted under s. 379 I.P.C. and sentenced to 6 months R.I.. He committed the theft along with another accused. At the time of the occurrence he was 16 years of age and at the time of conviction about 18 years. The Probation Officer recommended that he may be released on probation under s. 6 of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, but the trial court declined to do so on the ground that he was an associate of the other accused who was a hardened criminal. The order was confirmed in revision by the High Court.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The sentence should be set aside with the direction that the appellant be released under s. 4 of the Act on his entering into a bond, with his father as surety, to appear and receive sentence by the trial court whenever called upon to do so within a period of one year, and during that time, to keep peace and be of good behaviour. [385 C-D] Section 4 empowers the trial court to release an offender on probation and under the Act the power can be exercised by an appellate court. [384 C-D] In the present case, the report of the Probation Officer does not justify the conclusion that the appellant was an associate of the other accused, but on the contrary, the report was very favourable to him. The accused was neither a hardened criminal nor an associate of hardened criminals, and to sentence him to imprisonment would defeat the purpose of the Act to reform an offender and would achieve the object of associating him with hardened criminals.
