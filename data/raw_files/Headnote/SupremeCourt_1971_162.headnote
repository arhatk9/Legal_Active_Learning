 The appellant G was a member of the Rajasthan Administrative Service. Aggrieved by the order allotting seniority to him under the Rajasthan Administrative Service Rules, 1954, he filed a writ petition under Art. 226 in the High Court. A single Judge of the court allowed the petition. However in appeal by the State the Division Bench decided against the appellant who by special leave appealed to this Court. Two other members of the Rajasthan Administrative Service, similarly aggrieved filed writ petitions under Art. 32 before this Court. The common questions that fell for consideration in the appeal and writ petitions were; (i) whether rr. 28B(2) and 32 of the Rajasthan Administrative Service Rules were violative of Arts. 14 and 16 of the Constitution because they did not contain any guidelines in the matter of determining the merit of candidates; (ii) whether the circular dated August 27, _ 1966 issued by the State Government laying down a system of marking for the purpose of determining the merit of candidates was invalid because it was contrary to the relevant Rules in this regard. The appellant G also complained that adverse remarks in his confidential report which had not been communicated to him had been taken into account against him by the Departmental Promotion Committee.
 HELD:(i) Rule 32 in essence adopts what is stated in r.
 28B. The latter rule provides for two methods of selection one based on merit and the other based on seniority-cum- merit. In other words, the rule provides that the promotion based on merit in contradiction to that based on seniority- cum-merit shall strictly be on the basis of merit. The Selection Committee and the Promotion Committee consist of very responsible and senior officers of the State and being persons of experience they can be trusted to evaluate the merits of a particular officer. No doubt the word merit' is not capable of easy definition, but it can be safely said that merit is a sum total of various questions and attributes of an employee such as his academic qualifications, his distinction in the University, his character, integrity, devotion to duty and the manner in which he discharges his official duties. Allied to this may be various other matters or factors such as his punctuality in work, the quality and out-turn of work done by him and the manner of his dealing with his superiors and subordinate officers and the general public and his rank in the service.
 The various particulars in the annual confidential reports of an officer is 901 carefully and properly noted, Will also give a very broad and general indication regarding the merit of an officer.
 Therefore it cannot be stated that rr. 28B and 32 are in any manner vague or do not give any guidelines forassessing the merit of an officer. [921B-F] (ii)(a) The restriction contained in the proviso to sub-r.
 (2) of r. 28B is quitereasonable. Before an officer in the junior scale can be considered as fit for promotion to the senior scale it is necessary that he should have worked on a post in the service at least for some period of time.
 As to what the quantum of that period must be is not for this Court to lay down. The Government has fixed this period as six years. It cannot be said that it is an improper restriction. [922A-B] (b)The provisions contained in sub-r. (2) confining the selection to senior-most officers not exceeding 10 times the number of total, vacancies is also reasonable. Such a provision will encourage the members of the service to aspire for promotion for making themselves eligible by increasing their efficiencies in the discharge of their duties. [922B-C] (iii)The object of the impugned circular may be to bring about uniformity in the award of marks. But the directions contained therein do offend the rules. This is not a case of the Government filling up the gaps or of giving executive instructions not provided for by or not inconsistent with the rules. No discretion is given to the selection or promotion committee to adopt any method other than that indicated in the circular. According to the principle laid down by this Court in Sant Ram Sharma's case, if the circular dated August 27, 1966 or any part of it gives instructions contrary to or opposed to any of the rules, the circular or that part of the circular to that extent would be invalid. By this test the circular in question was invalid and must be struck down. [928F-929F] Sant Ram Sharma v. State of Rajasthan & Anr., [1967] INSC 168; [1968] 1 S.C.R. 111, applied.
 (iv)Appellant G had made a specific grievance in his writ petition before the High Court about the uncommunicated adverse remarks having been taken into account by the Departmental Promotion Committee. The Division Bench of the High Court was wrong in holding that since the Committee had not been made a party to the proceedings this question could not be gone into. The Government which was the appointing authority was a party before the High Court. It was the duty of the State Government to place before the High Court all the materials available before it to enable the Court to consider whether the grievance of the appellant was justified or not. The appellant's case must therefore be reconsidered in the light of the Rules. [932C-H]
