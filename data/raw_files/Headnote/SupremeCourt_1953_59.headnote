 Ordinarily a company will be a, "company, the directors whereof have a controlling interest therein" for the purposes of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, only if the directors thereof hold, and are entered in the share register as holders of, a majority of the vote-carrying shares of the company. It is not necessary that they must have a beneficial interest in such shares, but the mere fact that one of the directors of the company has been authorised by another company which held a majority of shares in the former company, to vote on its behalf in respect of the shares held by it, will not make the former company a director controlled company.
