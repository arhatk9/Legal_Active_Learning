 Luxmi Spinning and Weaving Mills Ltd. was ordered to be wound up compulsorily by an order of the High Court of Calcutta on a petition of the first respondent, Shankar Lal Poddar. Before the winding up order, the appellants instituted a mortgage suit against the said company and joint Receivers were appointed by the High Court. Later on, joint Liquidators were appointed in the winding up proceedings. The joint Liquidators applied for directions regarding the sale of the assets and properties of the company and the Court sanctioned the same. Tile sate was held after complying with the requirements of law with regard to advertisement. etc. The highest bid of Nandlal Agarwalla was for Rs. 3,37,000/- and the bid of the appellant firm was Rs.3,35,000/-. The bid of Nandlal was accepted and he was directed to pay immediately 25% of the bid money. As he stated that he had not brought cash, he was allowed to go and bring the same. As he did not turn up inspite of waiting for him for some time, the appellant firm was asked to stand by their previous bid for Rs. 3,35,000/- but they refused to do so. The property was then put up for sale once again and the highest bid of the appellant firm of Bansidhar Shankarlal for Rs. 2,25,000/- was accepted. The sale was confirmed by the Company judge. The first respondent filed an appeal against the order confirming the sale and his appeal was allowed by a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court. The liquidators were ordered to re- sell the property after due advertisement. The appellants came to this Court by special leave against the decision of the Division Bench.
 The questions for consideration before this Court were(1)Whether the order of the Company judge confirming the 718 sale was merely an administrative order passed in the course of the administration of the assets of the company under liquidation, and therefore not a judicial order subject to appeal, (2) whether on a proper construction of s. 202 of the Indian Companies Act it was a condition fort he availability of an appeal that the order should be open to appeal under cl. 15 of the Letters Patent of the Calcutta High Court and if the above were answered in the affirmative whether independently of s. 202, the order of the Company judge in this case amounted to Judgement within cl. 15 of the Letters Patent, and (3) whether the appellate court acted improperly in interfering with the order of the Company judge.
 Held, that the order of the Company judge confirming the sale was not an administrative but a judicial order. It is not correct to say that every order of the Court, merely for the reason that it is passed in the course of the realisation of the assets of the Company, must always be treated merely as an administrative one. The question ultimately depends upon the nature of the order that is passed. An order according sanction to a sale undoubtedly involves a discretion and cannot be termed merely an administrative order, for before confirming the sale the court has to be satisfied, particularly where the con- firmation is opposed, that the sale has been held in accordance with the conditions subject to which alone the liquidator has been permitted to effect it, and that even otherwise the sale has been fair and has not resulted in any loss to the parties who would ultimately have to share the realisation.
 It is not possible to formulate a definition which would satisfactorily distinguish between an administrative and a judicial order. That the power is entrusted to or wielded by a person who functions as a court is not decisive of the question whether the act or decision is administrative or judicial. An administrative order would be one which is directed to the regulation or supervision of matters as distinguished from an order which decides the rights of parties of confers or refuses to confer rights to property which are the subject of adjudicating before the court. One of the tests would be whether a matter which involves the exercise of discretion is left for the decision of the authority, particularly if that authority were a court, and if the discretion has to be exercised on objective, as distinguished from a purely subjective consideration, it would be a judicial decision. It has sometimes been said that the essence of a judicial proreeding or of a 'judicial order is that there would be two parties and a lis between them which is the subject of adjudication, as a result of that order or a decision on an issue between a proposal and an opposition. Nodoubt it 719 would not be possible to describe an order passed deciding a lis before the authority that is not a judicial order but it does not follow that the absence of a lis necessarily negatives the order being judicial. Even viewed from this narrow standpoint, it is possible to hold that there was a lis before the Company judge which he decided by passing the order. On the one hand were the claims of the highest bidder who put forward the contention that he had satisfied the requirements laid down for the acceptance of his bid and was consequently entitled to have the sale in his favour confirmed, particularly so as he was supported in this behalf by the Official Liquidators. On the other band, there was the first respondent and the large body of unsecured creditors whose interests, even if they were not represented by the first respondent, the court was bound to protect. If the sale of which confirmation was sought was characterised by any deviation from the conditions subject to which the sale was directed to be held or even otherwise was for a gross undervalue in the sense that very much more could reasonably be expected to be obtained if the sale were properly held, in view of the figure of Rs. 3,37,000/- which had been bid by Nandlal Agarwalla it would be the duty of the court to refuse the confirmation in the interests of the general body of creditors, and this was the submission made by the first respondent. There were thus two points of view presented to the court by two contending parties or interests and the court was called upon to decide between them, and the decision vitally affected the rights of the parties to property Under the circumstances, the order of the Company Judge was a judicial order and not administrative one. and was therefore not inherently incapable of being brought up it. appeal.
 Held, also, that Letters Patent Appeal was competent. The second part of s. 202 of the Indian Companies Act which refers to "the manner" and "the condition subject to which appeals may be had" merely regulates the procedure to be followed in the presentation of appeals and of hearing them, the period of limitation within which the appeal is to be presented and the forum to which the appeal would lie and does not restrict ox impair the substantive right of appeal which has been conferred by the opening words of s. 202.
 The words "order or decision" occurring in the first part of s. 202, though wide, would exclude merely procedural orders or those which do not affect the rights or liabilities of parties.
 Held, also that the appellate court did not act improperly in interfering with the order of the Company judge The Company Judge did not take into consideration the fact that certain bidders had left at the time when the property was put 720 up for auction once again. 'The judges of the Division Bench were justified in considering that the sale to the appellants ought not to have been confirmed.
