 The respondents were playing stage carriages on various routes in a district. On 17.5.1977, the appellant- Corporation gazetted about 70 draft schemes proposing to ply their buses to the complete exclusion of other private operators playing their vehicles in that district. The private operators raised their objection to the schemes, and only in 1983 when a new Government was formed, the schemes were approved by the Transport Minister. Against this order, the private operators filed writ Petitions and the High Court quashed the order with a direction that the operators should be heard afresh and the change in circumstances should be taken into account before finalising the schemes.
 Thereafter, fresh objections were invited and the Transport Minister heard the objections. The operators objected to this alleging that the Transport Minister had taken illegal gratification from some of the operators promising to defer the schemes. In the meantime there was again a change in the Government, but the Transport Minister continued as such in the new Government as well and he approved the scheme. Again there was a change in Government and the new Government issued various orders approving the schemes. Against this, Writ Petitions were filed before the High Court. Most of the Writ Petitions were dismissed on- 936 the short ground that the petitioners did not approach the Court with clean hands,as the petitioners claimed they bribed the Transport Minister for deferring the scheme of nationalisation. The other Writ Petitions were allowed, and the State Government was directed to give a fresh hearing to the petitioners before finalising the scheme afresh.
 The present appeals were filed against that part of the High Court's order allowing some of the Writ Petitions.
 On behalf of the appellants it was contended that there was hardly any case of bias made out against the Minister and the allegations made were vague and not substantiated;
 and that the gazette notifications approving the schemes were issued much later, when the Transport Minister was no longer in charge of the Ministry concerned, which indicated that the approval by the Minister had been ratified by the subsequent Government of which he was not a member.
 On behalf of the Respondents, it was urged that there was inordinate delay in the approval of the schemes and that the appellant-Corporation was not in a fit condition to ply buses on all the routes on account of its bad management and poor financial position.
 Allowing the appeals, this Court 
 HELD:1. The Transport Minister did not do anything to oblige the transporters who were said to have given him illegal gratification. In fact he acted contrary to their interests. His approval of the schemes could well have been motivated by his faith in the nationalisation policy rather than represent an attempt to get out of an embarrassing situation created by the allegations made against him as surmised by the High Court. This consideration apart, there was no specific material to substantiate the allegations of corruption referred to or relied upon by the High Court.
 Also, the approval was gazetted only almost a year later, after the concerned Minister went out of the picture.
 Having regard to all these consideration, the High Court's conclusion that the enquiry and approval were biased and therefore the scheme should be quashed is based on no material and cannot be sustained.[941E-G] 
 2. The contention as to the delay between 1977 when the draft schemes were gazetted and the first approval in 1983 has been examined- 937 and rejected by the High Court. The delay between 1983 and 1985 cannot, in the facts and circumstances of the case, be considered to be unreasonable.[942D] 
 3. By the interim orders passed by this Court, the State Government was permitted to act to on the schemes.
 The aggrieved operators were also given an opportunity to apply to the Government for modifying the schemes, but no application has been made. The schemes have been in operation for the past 6 years or more and, if disturbed now, it may lead to complete chaos by restoring a situation which has ceased to exist for more than six years. The interim order permitting the Government to implement the schemes will continue to be in force unless and until modified in appropriate proceedings.[941H,942,B,E]
