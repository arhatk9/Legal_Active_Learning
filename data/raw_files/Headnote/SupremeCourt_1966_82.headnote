 On the death of one of the plaintiffs-appellants in an appeal pending before the Subordinate Judge, an application was made for bringing on record his heirs and these heirs were two, viz., his widow and a major son. No objection was made to this application and consequently the widow and the major son were substituted on record as heirs. Later, when the respondent's further appeal was pending in the High Court, it was discovered that the deceased had left some other heirs besidesthe two who had been brought on record as his heirs. Consequentlythe respondents raised an objection that as some of the heirs of thedeceased had been left out and there could be no question of wantof knowledge of the existence of these heirs on the part of the widow and the major son who had applied for being brought on record, the appeal abated. The High Court upheld the objection In appeal,, this Court.
 
HELD:The estate of the deceased was fully represented by the heirs who had been brought on the record and these heirs represented the absent heirs also, who would be equally bound by the result.
 Even where the plaintiff or the appellant has died and all his heirs have not been brought on the record because of oversight or because of some doubt as to who are his heirs, the suit or the appeal, as the case may be, does not abate and the hears brought on the record fully represent the estate unless there is fraud or collusion or there are other circumstances which indicate that there has not been a fair or real trial or that against the absent heir there was a special case which was not and could not be tried in the proceedings [24 F-25B] Further, in this case, the respondents themselves did not object that some heirs of the deceased had been left out.
