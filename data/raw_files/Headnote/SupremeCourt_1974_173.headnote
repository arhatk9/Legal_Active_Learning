 The Andhra Pradesh Buildings cease, Rent and Eviction Control) Act, 1960, does not apply to any building constructed after August 1957.
 The appellant was the owner of a building which was constructed in 1958 and the respondent was the tenant. The appellant. by mistake, filed an application before the Rent Controller for eviction of the respondent on the ground of default in payment of rent. The petition was dismissed by Rent Controller and by the appellate authority. Thereafter, the appellant instituted a suit in tile Civil Court for eviction of the respondent. The trial court and the first appellate. court decreed the suit, but the High Court set aside the decree in favour of the appellant on the ground that the appellant was precluded by the principle of waiver claiming any relief Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The appellant was not disentitled to relief on the grounds of waiver, res judicata or estoppel. [36F] (1)Waiver is an intentional relinquishment at of a known right or advantage, benefit, claim or privilege which, except for such waiver. the party would have enjoyed and is based on the rule of judicial policy that a person will not be allowed to take inconsistent positions to gain advantage through courts. Voluntary choice is the essence of waiver, that is, there should be an Opportunity for choice between relinquishment and an enforcement of the right in question.
 It is consensus in nature and implies a meeting of the minds and is a matter of mutual intention. It cannot be held that there has been a waiver of valuable rights where the circumstances show that what was done was involuntary, and, there can be no waiver of a non-existent right. One cannot waive that which is not one's as a right at the time of waiver. Some mistake or misapprehension as to some of the facts which constitute the underlying assumption, without which the parties would not have made the contract may be sufficient to justify the court in saying that there was no consent. As one cannot confer jurisdiction by consent, similarly, one cannot by agreement waive jurisdiction of Courts. [35F-36C] Lachoo Mat v. Radhey Shyam. [1971] INSC 48; [1971] 3 S.C.R. 693, explained.
 (2)The Rent Controller bad no jurisdiction in respect of the budding because of the date of its construction. and only the civil court had jurisdiction. The in the suit before the Rent Controller cannot be pleaded as res judicata because the Rent Controller had no jurisdiction to try and decide not only the particular matter in the suit but also the subsequent suit in which the issue was raised. The date of construction was not before the Rent Controller. Under s. 44 the Evidence Act also the appellant could show that the judgment in the suit before the Rent Controller was delivered by a Court not competent to deliver it. [35C.E] Gokul Mandar v. Pudmanund, 29 I.A. 196, referred to.
 (3)The foundation of the doctrine of estoppel is that there is representation of existing facts. A status of control of Premises under the Rent Control Acts 33 ,cannot be acquired either by estoppel or by res judicata.
 The principle is that neither estoppel nor res judicata can give the court jurisdiction under the Acts which those Acts say it is not to have. The Rent Control Acts operate in rem. They. give a status to the house from which certain legal consequences follow. [36C-E] Dawson's Batik Ltd. v. Nippon M. K. Kaisha, 62 I.A. 100, referred to.
