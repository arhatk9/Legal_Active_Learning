 Section 18(c) of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, provides that no person shall manufacture for sale, or sell, or stock or exhibit for sale or distribute any drug except under a licence and s. 27(b) provides for punishment for its contravention.
 The appellant was a wholesale dealer and distributor of drugs and had the necessary licences prescribed under the Act. It had also the necessary licences authorising it to sell, stock or exhibit for sale or distribute by wholesale through its motor van. The appellant booked certain drugs by lorry but as the motor van was delayed, the drugs were released from the lorry and temporarily kept in the godown of a local drugs dealer.
 On the questions, (1) whether the licence which permitted stocking and selling in a specified vehicle, covered the brief interval of storage in the godown before loading on to the appellant's van, and (2) whether the act of the appellant in temporarily storing drugs, not for immediate sale there, but for ultimate sale in various parts of the State, is contrary to, s. 18(c) and punishable under s.
 27(b).
 
HELD :(1)(a) A licence in terms for a vehicle cannot do duty for one to keep drugs in a fixed place. Assuming that none of the prescribed forms provide for anitinerant wholesale distributor and that it would be impossible to furnish the very many possible places where for short intervals drugs may have to be stored awaiting the arrival of the van, an arguments ab inconvenience cannot be a defence. if the law requires a licence for a place and drugs are kept in such a place without the licence, even as a stop-gap arrangement.
 The paramount purpose of regulation through licensing is, to set in motion vigilant medical watch over the proper protection of drugs and medicines. verification of the expiry of the time of their efficacy, and the rejection of spurious products. If godowns, temporary stores etc., can be unlicensed, they can become foci of dubious, deceptive and harmful drugs. Therefore, every place where storage is made must be licensed. [290 D-F; 292 A-0] (b) The rules made under the Act, while they visualise wholesale distribution licences. the forms have not provided for licences for mobile vans or distribution depots so essential for a wholesale distribution system. The licence given to the appellants' vehicle is an improvised innovation without the law. 'Mere is no express power to thus modify the forms or innovate according to need. But such an authority to grant suitable licenses under rr. 61 and 62 (proviso), including the wayside depots or 'emergency' stores. could be implied. The appellant should therefore have applied for and obtained the necessary licence for the temporary storage. [291 C-H] (Law Lexicon of British India compiled and edited by Ramanatha Aiyar. sale there' or 'stocked for sale elsewhere late. The Central Government should however clarify the rules and provide for appropriate forms. The first interpretation permits abuse through loopholes, while the second tightens up but casts on the dealer the burden of obtaining more licences. Since risk 288 of life and health is avoided by the latter interpretation, it must be held that the storage, even though for short spells and on ad hoc basis and without intent to sell at that place but as part of the sales business, comes within stocking for sale in s. 18(c) and r. 62.
