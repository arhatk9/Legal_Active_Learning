 The MSM Railway, one of several British Indian Companies, was merged in the Indian Railways. The employees under the MSM Railway, who constituted the respondents, fell in two categories namely Commercial Clerks and Assistant Station Masters/Station Masters. The pay-scales at the various grades were substantially similar, although at the higher levels the Assistant Station Masters/Station Masters had higher scales of pay. In 1930 and thereafter several Commercial Clerks went over and became Assistant Station Masters/Station Masters and to some extent they enjoyed certain advantages on this score, and continued to work out their respective fortunes in the administrative service on the basis of the then rules and scales of pay. As 90 per cent of these posts were occupied by the lowest category, and there was long stagnation the appellant, Union of India around 1956 felt that there was need for revision of the set-up and with a view to give more relief and opportunities for increments to the Commercial Clerks, revised the pay scales, which was called the New Deal. When the New Deal was brought in some Assistant Station Masters/Station Masters found that although they were senior to certain Commercial Clerks at the early stages, their pay became less than that of Commercial Clerks.
 Being aggrieved, they agitated their grievances before the Andhra Pradesh High Court. That High Court took the view that Commercial Clerks and ASM/SM were substantially treated alike and when certain disparities and emoluments arose on account of the New Deal discrimination ensued. The special leave petitions to this Court against this judgment were dismissed.
 Certain employees also assailed the New Deal in the Madras High Court and the High Court observed that though it was not possible to agree with the view of the Andhra Pradesh High Court it had to be followed as the said decision had became final.
 In the appeals to this Court, it was argued on behalf of the appellant that the Madras High Court had expressly dissented from this reasoning of the Andhra Pradesh High Court and contended that Commercial Clerk and ASMs/SMs fall into two different categories and on the basis of the rulings of this Court there could not be any case of discrimination when distinct categories in Government service had different treatment in the course of the service, and only such of the employees as had a chance of going up in emoluments or drawing increments attributable to the New Deal could claim the benefits or advantages under the decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court. On behalf of the respondents, it 1201 was argued that the second decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court was correct and that the illustration given by the High Court graphically to clarify its conclusion was realistic and correct.

 HELD : 1. It is not possible to agree with the conclusion reached by the Andhra Pradesh High Court so long as Commercial Clerks and ASMs/SMs fall into two different categories. The well-established proposition is that there cannot be a case of discrimination merely because fortuitous circumstances arising out of some peculiar developments or situations create advantages or disadvantages for one group or the other although in the earlier stages they were, more or less alike. If one class has not been singled out for special treatment, the mere circumstances of advantages accruing to one or the other cannot result in breach of Article 14 of the Constitution. [1204E-G] Reserve Bank of India v. N. C. Paliwal & Others [1976] INSC 196; [1977] 1 S.C.R. 377, referred to.
 
 2. The employees (ASM/SMs) who, had they continued as Commercial Clerks would not have had any increments on account of the New Deal, could not claim such increments on the basis of the Andhra Pradesh High Court decision. All that the said decision sought to do was to see that ASMs/SMs were not prejudiced merely by leaving their earlier position as Commercial Clerks. It did not put them in a better position than they would have, if they had continued as Commercial Clerks. [1205H, 1206A] 
 3. The emoluments that the respondents in the appeals as well as the special leave petitions will draw will not be affected. Those not before the Court will not be entitled to amelioratory relief. [1204G-H, 1205A] 
 4. The Andhra Pradesh decision will prevail while the law laid down by the said decision will stand set aside.
