 Per BHAGWATI and IMAM jj. A decree for payment of owelty money by one co-sharer to another in a Partition Suit, even where it does not expressly declare a charge, creates one by necessary implication in favour of the latter or the property allotted to the former and such charge on lien has precedence over prior mortgagees of such property.
 Shahebzada Mohommed Kazim Shah v. R. S. Hill, I.L.R. (1907) 35 Cal. 388 and Poovanalingam Servai v. Veerai, A.I.R.
 (1926) Mad. 166, referred to.
 Consequently, in a case where the final decree in a Partition Suit passed by the High Court in appeal provided for payment of owelty money by one co-sharer to another and at the instance of the Official Receiver in Insolvency, in whom the estate of the former had vested, instead of expressly declaring a charge authorised him to pay the owelty from out of the sale proceeds of the property, the judgment-creditor of the co-sharer liable for owelty in respect of decrees previously obtained by him could claim no priority and the High Court, taking an erroneous view of the law and relying on a previous judgment of that Court passed in the creditor's appeals, set aside in a peals preferred by the Official Receiver the orders of the District Judge refusing his applications for refund of sale-proceeds deposited in Court to the credit of the, decree-holder co- sharer and for restitution under s. I44 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the monies, actually paid to him under the partition decree, the orders of the High Court must be set aside.
 Per SARKAR J. Whether the final decree had or had not created a charge over the insolvent's share for such sums as it directed the Receiver in insolvency to pay to the co- sharer that could not affect the Receiver's liability to pay thereunder and while the decree subsisted he was not entitled to claim restitution of such monies as he had paid in terms thereof on the ground that no charge had been created nor any other claim to priority existed.
 The rights of the co-sharer decree-holder who had obtained the decree against the 'Receiver himself stood on a different footing from those of a creditor of the insolvent and he could not, like the latter, be compelled to accept a dividend on the distribution of the insolvent's assets.
