 The appellant booked goods at Sealdah, which is on the border of the territorial limits of the Original Jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court, to be transported by the Bengal and Assam Railway, owned by the, State and having its head office at Calcutta. There was short delivery of the goods anti the railway authorities issued the necessary certificates of shortage. The appellant Wrote a letter to the Chief Commercial Manager (Claims and.
 Refunds) of the Railway within six months from the date of delivery of goods for carriage as required by s. 77 of the Act before its amendment by Act 39 of 1961, claim in the value of the goods short delivered. Failing to get any redress, he filed a suit on the Original Side of the High Court at Calcutta in 1946, within the period of limitations In 1954, the suit was dismissed on the ground that the Court had no jurisdiction to try the suit. Then the appellant filed a second suit in the Subordinate Judge's Court having jurisdiction, and prayed for exclusion of the time taken between the dates of institution and dismissal of the earlier suit, under s. 14 of the Limitation Act, 1908.
 The trial Court dismissed the suit. The High Court in appeal, held against the appellant on the ground that the appellant's letter addressed to the Chief Commercial Manager (Claims and Refunds) could not be treated as the notice required under s. 77 of the Railways Act, 1890, as that officer was not the authority to receive the notice under the section.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) The requirement of compliance with the terms of s. 77 should be liberally construed as the object of the notice was only to enable the railway administration to make an enquiry and investigate into the cause of the loss of the goods consigned to it. Section 140, before its amendment by Act 39 of 1961 provided that a notice required to be served on a State-owned Railway Administration may be served on the Manager. The Bengal and Assam Railway Administration did not have -in authority known as the Manager. It had a General Manager in over all charge but its Chief Commercial Manager (Claims and Refunds) was a high ranking office specially engaged in enquiring into claims by consignors and consignees against the Railway administration. He was therefore an officer competent to deal with such claims and the requirements -of s. 77 are satisfied by serving a notice on him; and it does not behove 'he State to contest a good claim on unsubstantial technical pleas.
