 Respondent companies flied suits in Civil Courts for perpetual injuctions restraining the Appellant State from demanding payment of royalty for removal of brick-earth from owners' lands and insisting upon obtaining of requisite mining licences or permits. They based their claim on the premise that though the brick earth was classified as minor mineral under the Rules, since the State of Punjab was not the owner of brick-earth in the lands concerned, no necessity arose for payment of royalty and for obtainment of mining licences or permits.The Civil Courts accepted the claim and decreed the suits, granting the reliefs prayed for..
 The Appellant State carried the matter before the First Appellate Court in vain. Further Regular Second Appeals before the High Court were also dismissed by a Common Judgment, impugned herein, by way of Civil Appeals by Special Leave. The Appellant contended (i) that the Courts below went wrong in holding that the brick-earth did not vest in the State on the basis of entries in wajib-ul-arz pertaining to the lands of the estates of the land owners;
 (ii) that as the presumption, drawn from the entries in wajib-ul-arz, to the effect that the brick earth in the lands 'concerned belonged to the lands' owners, was only rebuttable, the decrees should have been set aside, remanding the suits to the courts of first instance with a direction to them to afford an opportunity to the State to adduce rebuttal evidence.
 762 Dismissing the Appeals, this Court, 
HELD:1. Although Brick-earth is indisputably a minor mineral, it is not any of the mines or minerals covered by section 41 of the Revenue Act as would make it become the property of the State. If the owner of such brick-earth is the State of, Punjab, liability to pay royalty for removal of such brick-earth and to obtain permit or licence for such removal, would necessarily arise because of the operation of the Act and the Rules. But the courts below have concurrently found on their reading of the entires in wajib- ul-arz pertaining to the estates concerned that the brick- earth was in lands which formed the estates of the private owners and as such the same belonged to such landowners.
 [766G] 
2. Wazib-ul-arz document being record-of-rights of estates completed after 18th day of November 1871, and there being nothing expressly stated in them that the forest or quarry or land or interest in the estates belong to the Government, the lands in such estates including brick-earth in them shall be presumed to belong to the concerned land-owners as is declared in sub-section (2) of Section 42 of the Revenue Act. [767A.B] 3.The Courts have again pointed out that there being no provision similar to the provision in sub-section (3) which permits adducing of rebuttal evidence against the presumption that the lands belong to the State under Sub- Section (1) of Section 42 of the Revenue Act, the presumption which arises under sub-section (2) of Section 42 of the Revenue Act that the forest or quarry or land or interest belong to land her, cannot at all be rebutted by the State by adducing any contrary evidence. Even otherwise, when the State has not chosen to adduce any evidence to rebut the presumption arising from the entires in Wajibul-arz documents-record-of-rights there cm be no valid reason for the Courts to hold that the brick-earth in the lands of the estates concerned has become the property of the State, so as to require the brick-manufacturers to pay royalty for removal of such brick-earth and obtain permits or licences under the Rules. [767C-F] 
4. When all the Courts below have concurrently recorded findings to the effect that the ownership of the brick-earth belong to land-owners and not to the State on a correct appreciation of all evidence adduced in the case and on a proper application of the law governing the same, there could be no justification to interfere with such findings in these appeals.
 763 So also no valid reason has been shown to set aside the lower courts' judgments and decrees and send the matters to the Courts of first instance with a direction to permit the State to adduce rebuttal evidence as regards entries In record-of-rights. [767G-H] 5.Wajib-ul-arz is a document included in the record-of- rights since it contains the statements on matters envisaged under clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (2) of Section 31 of the Punjab Land Revenue Act, 1887.
