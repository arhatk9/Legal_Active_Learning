 Ordinarily when a person is accused of more than one offence, the sentences of imprisonment imposed are directed to run concurrently but assuming the sentences of imprisonment be consecutive, the undertrial prisoners here have suffered incarceration for the maximum period for which they could be sent to jail on conviction for multiple offences. There is absolutely no reason why the under trials be allowed to continue in jail for a moment longer since such continuance of detention would be violative not only of human dignity but also of their fundamental right under Art.
 21 of the Constitution. [1277A-C] [The Court directed the High Court to submit information regarding the location of Courts, the number of cases pending in each of them and the reasons for the delay in disposal of cases to enable it to give necessary direction for setting up more Courts, appointing additional Judges and providing more facilities by way of staff and equipment so as to ensure fulfillment of the fundamental right of the accused to speedy trial under Art. 21 of the Constitution.] ^
