 The appellant State was the proprietor of a reserved forest.
 The respondent took on lease from the appellant a plot of land for industrial purposes in the said forest area. As found by the High Court the lease was originally granted for one year in 1947 at an annual rent of Rs. 100. It was renewed in 1948 and 1949 for one year. After the termination of the lease in March 1949 the respondent continued to be in possession of the land and agreed to abide by the, terms to be fixed by the appellant. Under the terms fixed by the appellant the respondent was required to pay Rs. 100 as annual rent for the occupation of the land till July 15, 1950. The respondent remained in possession of the leased property after the determination of the lease in 1950, for a further period of three years. The appellant wanted to enhance the rent to which the respondent did not agree. In the consequent suit filed by the appellant the trial court passed a decree in the suit allowing Rs. 6000 as rent for the years 1950-51 and 1951-52 and Rs. 5000 as damages for 1952-53. The High Court reversed the decree.
 It held that no notice as required under s. 106 of the Transfer of Property Act had been given and since on the facts the respondent must be deemed to have held over within the meaning of s. 116 of the Transfer of Property Act, the rent was payable as under the previous lease, On this view it passed a decree in favour of the appellant for Rs. 300 being rent at Rs. 1000 per year for the three years in question. In appeal by special leave to this Court the appellant State contended that s. 116 of the Transfer of Property Act was not applicable to the case because of s. 2 of the Government Grants Act.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : The lease in the present case was for the purpose of erecting a temporary rice mill and for no other purpose.
 The mere fact that the State is the lessor will not by itself make it a Government grant within the meaning of the Government Grants Act. There was no evidence in the present case in the character of the land or in the making of the lease or in the content of the lease to support the plea on behalf of the State that it was a grant within the meaning of the Government Grants Act. [347E-G] In the present case the High Court correctly found on the facts that the respondent after the determination of the lease held over. Even if the Government Grants Act applied section 116 of the Transfer of Property Act was not rendered inapplicable. The effect of section 2 of the Government Grants Act is that in the construction of an instrument governed by the Government Grants Act the court shall construe such grant irrespective of the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act. It does not mean that all the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act are inapplicable.
 To illustrate, in the case of a grant under the Government Grants Act section 14 of the Transfer of Property Act will not apply because section 14 which provides what is known as the rule against perpetuity will not apply by reason of the provisions in the Government Grants Act. The grant shall be construed to take effect as if the Transfer of Property Act does not apply. [348B-D] Section 3 of the Government Grants Act declares the unfettered discretion of the Government to impose such conditions and limitations as it thinks fit, no matter' what the general law of the land be. The meaning of sections 2 and 3 of the Government Grants is that the scope of that Act is not limited to 345 affecting the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act only., The Government has unfettered discretion to impose any conditions, limitations, or restrictions in its. grants, and the right, principles and obligations of' the grantee would be regulated according to the terms of the grant, notwithstanding any provisions, of any statutory or common law.

 Lala Kishun Chand v. Sheo Dutta, I.L.R. 1958 All. 879, approved.
