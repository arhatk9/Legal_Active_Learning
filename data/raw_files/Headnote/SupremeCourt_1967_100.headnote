 The petitioners had their textile mills in the City of Ahamdabad, The properties in Ahmedabad were in three zones.
 In the inner zone were situated properties which did not bear land revenue on account of the exemption given in s.
 123 of the Bombay Land Revenue Code. In the middle zone were situated lands which though originally agricultural lands had been diverted to non-agricultural use. In the outer zone were lands which were purely agricultural. Under the Gujarat Education Cess Act, 1962 the Cess was of three separate kinds; (a) a surcharge on land revenue assessed an purely agricultural lands, (b) a surcharge on non- agricultural assessment in respect of lands used for non- agricultural purposes, and (c) a tax on lands and buildings which did not bear land revenue. As a result the Cess Act operated differently in the three zones. The properties of the petitioners were in the middle zone of Ahmedabad. In their writ petitions under Art. 32 of the Constitution they contended that by reason of their situation the Cess Act operated unequally against them because while the owners of property in the other two zones bore either a surcharge on the land revenue or a tax on the annual letting value, they bad to pay both the surcharge as well as the tax. Thus a violation of Art. 14 was alleged. It was also contended that the preparation of the assessment book on the basis of a flat rate on the floor area of a property having been struck down by his court in an earlier case (New Manek Chowk Spinning & Weaving Co. Ltd., etc. v. Municipal Corporation of the City of Ahmedabad & Ors., [1967] INSC 36; [1967] 2 S.C.R. 679 the tax under s. 12 of the Cess Act was no longer leviable, and that s. 12 being no longer operative. the Cess Act must fall as a whole. no validity of the Act was also attacked on the ground that it did not provide for objections being considered.
 
HELD : (i) If as a result of the decision of this Court the assessment book needed revision or the Principles on which valuation must be based had to be laid down afresh by the Legislature, the provisions of s. 12 of the Cess Act did not fail automatically. They would fasten on the new valuation when made. This cannot affect the validity of the section in the meantime. The section remains on the statute book to be worked into such assessment book as hereafter emerged.
 The argument fiat s. 12 had failed must therefore be rejected. [599 F-G] (ii) A double imposition on the middle zone was not by itself offensive of Art. 14 of the Constitution unless it could be shown that the double tax in one zone as compared with the single tax in the other zones fell more heavily than the single tax. According to the earlier decision of this Court a new assessment book would be prepared. Ever if, in the middle zone, the surcharge and tax both had to be paid, that rates might be so adjusted that the cess fell equitably on all landholder regard being had to the advantage; derived from the cess and the advantages derived from the situation of the lands. [601 D-F] (iii)The procedure for the levy of the cess cannot be said to offend natural justice in not providing opportunity for putting forward objections etc. The cess is nothing more than an addition to other taxes which allow the raising of objections and provide for appeals. There is no need for further scrutiny, objection or appeal. Nor is the Cess Act bad because it is not self-contained in the matter of assessment, this being the usual method by which cesses are levied. [601 H]
