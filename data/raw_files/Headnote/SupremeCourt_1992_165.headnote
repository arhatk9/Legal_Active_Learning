 Writ Petitions were filed before this Court, challenging the action of the owners/proprietors of the stone-crushers whereby stone-dust and smoke was allowed to pass into the air, and due to pollution, lives of the people living in some parts of South Delhi, especially rural, and workers, their families living at the site as well as people living in the villages bordering Haryana were suffering from different diseases and their lives were in danger, and praying for issue of writ of mandamus and directions to the respondents and authorities concerned to take steps to stop pollution, and provide necessary medical facilities to the affected persons.
 Giving directions, reasons for which to be followed later, this Court, 
 HELD : 1. Environmental changes are the inevitable consequence of industrial development in our country, but, at the same time the quality of environment cannot be permitted to be damaged by polluting the Air, Water and Land to such an extent that it becomes a health-hazard for the residents of the area. The authorities concerned in the Union Territories of Delhi have been wholly re-miss in the performance of their statutory duties and have failed to protect the environment and control air-pollution in the Union Territory of Delhi. Utter disregard to environment has placed Delhi in unenviable position of being the world's third grubbiest, most polluted and unhealthy city as per a study conducted by the World Health Organisation.
 Needless to say that every citizen has a right to fresh air and to live in pollution-free environment. [359 F-H, 360 A] 
 2. It is, therefore, directed that (a) the mechanical stone crushers 358 established/operating in Lal Kuan, Anand Parbat, Rajokri, Tughlakabad and in any other area of Union territory of Delhi and also in Suraj Kund, Lakhanpur, Lakkarpur, Kattan, Gurukul, Badkhal, Pallinangla, Saraikhaja, Anangpur and Ballabgarh areas of Haryana should stop operating/functioning with effect from August 15, 1992 and no stone crusher will operate in the above said areas from August 15, 1992 onward; (b) the stone crushers in the Union territory of Delhi/Faridabad-Ballabgarh Complex which do not have valid licences from the Authorities under the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957/Faridabad Complex Administration (Regulations and Development) Act, 1971 or from any other authority which the law requires, and the stone crushers, in respect of which closure- orders/directions have been issued by the Central Pollution Control Board under Section 31A of Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 or by the Central Government under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection Act, 1956, should stop functioning/operating with immediate effect; (c) the authorities concerned should ensure compliance of these order; and (d) the authorities concerned of the State of Haryana should demarcate, and allot the sites to the aforesaid stone crushers in the newly approved 'crushing zone' at village Pali - set up with the object of rehabilitating the existing stone-crushers who are being stopped from functioning as a result of the orders of this Court - by draw of lots or by any other fair and equitable method, and also to provide additional land in or around the "crushing zone" if there is not sufficient land in the said zone to accommodate all the stone crushers affected by this Court's orders within a period of six months. A progress report in this respect should be sent to the Registry of this Court before July 31, 1992. [360 B-C, E-H, 361 A-G] 
 3. Some Writ Petitions, which were filled by the owners/proprietors of stone-crushers in the Delhi High Court and which have been directed to be transferred to this Court are dismissed. [360 E]
