 The appellant entered into a contract with the Government of India. The contract contained an arbitration clause.For certain supplies made under the contract the appellant made representations to the Government or payment and for arbitration of disputes.On or about July 10, 1958 Government refused to refer the matter for arbitration. On July 11, 1961 the appellant flied an application in the Court of the District Judge under ss. 8 and 20 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, for filing the arbitration agreement and for an order of reference of the disputes to an arbitrator appointed by the court. The respondent contended that the application was barred by Limitation. The District Judge allowed the application, holding that there was no limitation for making an application under ss. 8 and 20. The defendant's appeal was dismissed by the High Court as incompetent in so far as it challenged the order under s. 8 but was allowed in so far as it challenged the order under s. 20. The High Court held that an application under s. 20 is governed 'by Art.
 181 of the Indian Limitation Act, 1908. In coming to this conclusion the High Court took into account the settled judicial view that the. operation of Art. 181 is limited to applications under the Code of Civil Procedure. and reasoned as follows: Article 181 should be construed as if the words 'under the Code' were added in it. The Arbitration Act, 1940 repealed paragraph 17 of the second schedule to the Code and re-enacted it in s. 70 with minor modifications.
 That being so s. 8(1) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 applied and the implied reference in Art. 181 to paragraph 17 of the second schedule to the Code should be construed as a reference to s. 20 of the Arbitration Act, 1940. Appeal against the High Court's judgment was filed with certificate.
 HELD: The 'appeal must be allowed.
 By the Arbitration Act, 1940 the Legislature amended Arts. 158 and 178 of the Limitation Act and made them applicable to the relevant proceedings under the Arbitration Act but no similar change was made in Art. 181. It is manifest that save as provided in Arts. 158 and 178 there would not be any limitation for other applications under the Act. Further there is nothing to indicate that for the purpose of limitation s. 20 of the 1940 Act should be regarded as a re-enactment of the corresponding provision of the Code and not of the Indian Arbitration Act, 1899. [236 D-G] In the circumstances it is not possible to construe the implied reference in Art. 181 to the Code of Civil Procedure as a reference to the Arbitration Act, 1940 or to hold that Art. 181 applies to applications under that Act. The rule of construction given in s. 8(1)of the General Clauses Act cannot be applied, as it appears that the legislature had a 233 different intention. It follows that an application under ss. 8 and 20 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 is not governed by Art. 181. The Limitation Act does not prescribe any period of limitation for such an application. [236 G-H] The present application under ss. 8 and 20 was therefore not barred by limitation. [237 A] Bai Manekbai v. Manekji Kavasji, [1880] I.L.R. 7 Born.
