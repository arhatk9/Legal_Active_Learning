 Allowing the petitions, the Court ^ 
 HELD: (1) The representation by the detenu under the COFEPOSA has not to be made in any prescribed form. There is no formula nor any magical incantation like "open seasame" to be repeated or chanted in order to qualify a communication as a representation. So long as it contains a demand or a request for the release of the detenu in whatever form or language couched and a ground or a reason is mentioned or suggested for such release, there is no option but to consider and deal with it as a representation for the purpose of Article 22(5) of the Constitution. [965D- E] In the instant case the communication dated July 27, 1980 by the counsel for the detenu in W.P. 4344 of 1980 was a representation which was in law required to be considered.
 The said representation admittedly not having been considered the detenu was entitled to be set at liberty.
 [965H-966A, C] (2)The obligation imposed on the detaining authority, by Article 22(5) of the Constitution, to afford to the detenu the earliest opportunity of making a representation, carries with it the imperative implication that the representation shall be considered at the earliest opportunity. Since all the constitutional protection that a detenu can claim is the little that is afforded by the procedural safeguards prescribed by Article 22(5) read with Article 19, the Courts have a duty to rigidly insist that preventive detention procedures be fair and strictly observed. A breach of the procedural imperative must lead to the release of the detenu. [966B] (3)Article 22(5) has two facets: (i) communication of the grounds on which the order of detention has been made;
 (ii) opportunity of making a representation against the order of detention. Communication of the grounds pre- supposes the formulation of the grounds and formulation of the grounds requires and ensures the application of the mind of the detaining authority to the facts and materials before it, that is to say, to pertinent and proximate matters in regard to each individual case and excludes the elements of arbitrariness and automatism. [966G] 963 (4) It is an unwritten rule of the law, constitutional and administrative, what whenever a decision making function is entrusted to the subjective satisfaction of a statutory functionary, there is an implicit obligation to apply his mind to pertinent and proximate matters only, eschewing the irrelevant and the remote. Where there is further an express statutory obligation to communicate not merely the decision but the grounds on which the decision is founded, it is a necessary corollary that the grounds communicated, that is, the grounds so made known, should be seen to pertain to pertinent and proximate matters and should comprise all the constituent facts and materials that went in to make up the mind of the statutory functionary and not merely the inferential conclusions. Now, the decision to detain a person depends on subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority. The Constitution and the statute cast a duty on the detaining authority to communicate the grounds of detaining to the detenu. The grounds communicated must reveal the whole of the factual material considered by the detaining authority and not merely the inferences of fact arrived at. The same result would follow if the matter is looked at from the point of view of the second facet of Art.
 22(5), namely the opportunity to make a representation against the order of detention. [966H-D] (5)The "grounds" under Article 22(5) of the Constitution do not mean mere factual inferences but mean factual inferences plus factual material which led to such factual inferences. The "grounds" must be self-sufficient and self-explanatory. Copies of documents to which reference is made in the "grounds" must be supplied to the detenu as part of the "grounds". [1967E-F] Smt.
