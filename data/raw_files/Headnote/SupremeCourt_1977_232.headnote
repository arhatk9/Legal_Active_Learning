 Under the second proviso to the Explanation to S. 11 (1) (h) of J & K Houses and Shop Rent Control Act, 1966 the court before evicting the tenant from part only of the premises, must satisfy itself after taking the entire evidence to fulfil the reasonable requirement of the landlord.
 The High Court in second appeal held that the trial court as well as the first appellate court have taken this point into consideration and found that it would not be feasible to order the eviction of the appellant only from a portion of the suit premises and therefore dismissed the appeal.
 Granting the special leave, allowing it and remanding the matter, the court.
 
HELD:The second proviso to the Explanations to S. 11 (1) (h) of the Jammu and Kashmir Houses and Shops Rent Control Act, 1966 mandates the court to consider whether partial eviction as contemplated therein should be ordered or the entire holding should be directed to be evicted.
 This aspect, therefore requires judicial exploration after giving opportunity to both side, to lead evidence in this behalf. The court must proceed on the footing that the absence of a specific pleading under the said proviso does not stand in the way of the obligation of the court to act in compliance with the mandate of the statute.
