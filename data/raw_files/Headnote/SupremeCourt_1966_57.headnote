 The appellant's father created a usufructuary mortgage of the land in dispute and the mortgagee admitted the respondents as tenants. During the continuance of the mortgage and while the respondents were in possession as tenants, the Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955, came into force.
 The mortgage was eventually redeemed but the respondents continued in possession. The appellant therefore sued for possession of the land before the revenue authorities and the Board of Revenue in appeal, held that by virtue of the provisions of s. 15 of the Act, the possession of the respondents was unassailable, that they could be ejected, in view of s. 161, only in accordance with the provisions of the Act, but that, none of the grounds available to the appellant had been proved. The High Court dismissed the writ petition of the appellant challenging the Board's decision.
 In appeal to this Court, on the question whether the respondents could be ejected on the ground that the mortgage had been redeemed, Act, a mortgagee cannot create an interest in the mortgaged property which will enure beyond the termination of his interest as mortgagee. But the rights of the tenants inducted by the mortgagee may be improved by virtue of statutory provisions which may meanwhile come into ope- ration, and that was precisely what had happened in the present case. During the continuance of the mortgage, s. 15 of Rajasthan Tenancy Act came into operation and that made the respondents Khatedars who are entitled to claim the benefit of s. 161 of that Act.
