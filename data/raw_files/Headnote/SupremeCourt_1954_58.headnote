 Out of 24 persons originally tried under sections 302/149 etc. I.P.C. only three were ultimately convicted by the High Court. The High Court however by mistake convicted N, one of the three, whom it meant to acquit. Later, it communicated its mistake to Government. Government passed orders remitting the sentence mistakenly passed on N and directed his release. N and the other two convicts presented an application under article 134(1)(c) for a certificate. The High Court granted a certificate to N considering that otherwise the stigma of the charge of murder might affect him adversely in the future. As regards the other two, there was nothing in their cases to warrant the issue of a certificate but the High Court granted them a certificate thinking that it was bound to do so because article 134(1)(c) speaks of a "case" and the only case before it was the appeal as a whole.
 Hold, (1) that the view of the High Court was wrong because the word "case" used in article 134(1)(c) means the case of each individual person.
 (2) That the High Court had misdirected itself about the law in respect of the two convicts and did not exercise the discretion vested in it thinking either that it had no discretion in the matter or that its discretion was fettered and therefore the Supreme Court having general powers of judicial superintendence over all Courts in India was bound to interfere.
 239 (3) The appeal must fail as the certificate under article 134(1)(c) was wrongly granted and in view of the facts the case was not a proper one for special leave under article 136(1).
