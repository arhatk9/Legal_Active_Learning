 The Respondent Company floated debenture loan of Rs. 2.50 crores and to -secure the repayment of the said loan executed debenture trust deed dated 10th April, 1962 mortgaging certain properties of the Company for a consideration of Rs. 2.50 crores in favour of the trustees who were petitioners before the High Court. Stamps to the extent of Rs. 2,50,00/- were paid under the Indian Stamp Act and apart from that when the document was presented for registration, a registration fee of Rs. 1,25,157.50 np. were demanded as registration fee by the Sub-Registrar under a notification issued by the appellant, the Chief ,Commissioner of Delhi on 15th December, 1952. The registration fee was paid by the Respondents under compulsion, but the trustees filed a petition in the High Court challenging the validity of the notification and the exorbitant amount realised as registration fee as illegal levy not fulfilling the essential conditions of a fee within the meaning of the Constitution. The plea of the trustees found favour with the High Court which held that the fee charged by the Registration Department under the notification was an illegal impost and could not be levied.
 The High Court accordingly quashed the notification.
 Dismissing the appeal by certificate, the Court 
HELD : A fee in order to be a legal fee must satisfy two conditions (a) There must be an element of quid pro quo, i.e. the authority levying the fee must render some service for the fee levied however remote the service may be; and (b) That the fee realised must be spent for the purpose of the imposition and should not form part of the general revenues of the State. [658 F-G] In the instant case, in view of the fact that it was not disputed that the fee realised by the Registration Department under the impugned notification dated 15-2-1952 was to form part of the general revenues of the State, the second element of a fee was wholly wanting and the High Court was, therefore, right in striking down this notification.
