 The appellants Dilip Kumar, Bharatsingh and Rohitsingh were convicted for committing the murder of one Arun Bhargava. The learned Sessions Judge convicted Dilip Kumar under s. 302 and Bharatsingh under s. 302 read with s. 34 and Rohitsingh under s. 303 IPC and sentenced them to death.
 One Prabhu was murdered before the incident in question took place for which Rohitsingh was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Sessions Court in May, 1972. In appeal, Rohitsingh was acquitted by Madhya Pradesh High Court in February, 1974, being the same day on which the High Court pronounced its judgment in the present case. The Sessions Court in the instant ease, had to impose the death sentence on Rohitsingh as he was, at the time of conviction for the present offence, undergoing sentence of imprisonment for life.
 The High Court confirmed the conviction and sentence of Dilip Kumar. The High Court also confirmed the conviction and sentence of Rohitsingh. While maintaining the conviction, High Court reduced the sentence of Bharatsingh to imprisonment for life.
 In May, 1974, this Court granted Special Leave to the appellants limited to the question of application of section 303 in the case of Rohitsingh and sentence in cases of all.

 HELD : (Per Chandrachud and Bhagwati, JJ.) 
 1. Bharatsingh has been convicted under s. 302 read with s. 34. He has been awarded the minimum sentence for murder under section 302 and that sentence cannot be reduced. [291-G] 
 2. As regards Dilip Kumar, there is no reason to reduce the sentence of death imposed on him by the Sessions Court and confirmed by the High Court. The deceased Arun Bhargava was sitting in front of a hotel at Ujjain. Bharatsingh and Rohitsingh caught hold of his arms from behind and Dilip Kumar stabbed him on the chest with a big knife. As a result of the injury the pleura, the pericardium of the right ventricle of the heart were extensively damaged. Motiveless murders are not necessarily acts of mad and unhinged people.
 Prosecution is often unable to collect satisfactory evidence on the motive behind the crime. Dilip Kumar's conduct cannot be viewed with leniency and the High Court was right in confirming the death sentence. [291-G, H, 292-A] 
 3. Rohitsingh's appeal arising out of Prabhu's murder was allowed by the High Court and immediately thereafter it took up for consideration the appeal arising out of Arun Bhargava's murder. Thus, when the High Court pronounced its judgment in the instant case Robitsingh was not under the sentence of imprisonment for life. The High Court erroneously held that for the purpose of determining the application of s. 303, the date on which the subsequent offence of murder is committed is the relevant date. S. 303 does not afford a clear clue to the solution of the problem raised in the appeal. When a person who is sentenced to imprisonment for life commits a murder the previous conviction 290 assumes a graver proportion and becomes an aggravating circumstance but the aggravation is on the assumption that the previous coeviction is lawful and valid. An order of acquittal in regard to the previous offence wipes out the guilt and turpitude attaching to the previous conviction, for the true implication of an acquittal is as if the offender did not commit the offence for which he was tried, no matter whether the aequittal is founded on benefit of doubt or based on the overall rejection of the case.
 Therefore, if a court, whether of the first instance or otherwise, finds on the date on which it records its decision that the accused before it is no longer under a sentence of life imprisonment it cannot under s. 303 sentence him to death. [292 D-F, G, 293 B-E] 
 4. It is a well-established proposition that a court seized of a proceeding must take into account events subsequent to the inception of that proeeding. That position is widely accepted in Civil Law and there is no reason why the principle should not be extended to criminal proceedings with appropriate modifications. According to the High Court there was no warrant for substituting the words "whoever is convicted for murder" for the words 'whoever commits murder". In taking this view the High Court overlooked the fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence that an accused is presumed to be innocent until his guilt is established. "Whoever commits murder" must mean "whoever is proved to have committed murder" and not "whoever is alleged to have committed murder". [294 B-C, F-G] 
 5. When s. 303 speaks of a person under sentence of imprisonment for life it means a person under an operative executable sentence of imprisonment for life. A sentence once imposed but later set aside is not executable and, therefore the court convicting the accused of murder cannot take such a sentence into account for imposing the sentence of death by the application of s. 303. [295-B] 
 6. On merits, there is no justification for distinguishing the case of Rohitsingh from that of Bharatsingh. Therefore Rohitsingh's sentence ought to be reduced from death to imprisonment for life. [295-C] Per Sarkaria J. (concurring) The key words in the phrase "being under sentence of life imprisonment" is "sentence". It is capable of a strict as well as a broad interpretation. In a broad sense it may include a sentence which has not become final but is still liable to be impeached by way of appeal or revision. In the strict sense, the ambit of the word would be limited to a sentence which has become final, absolute and indefeasible.
 S. 303 makes murder by a life convict punishable with death, leaving no discretion to the court. The section is draconion in severity, relentless and inexorable in operation. It is well settled that such a penal provision must be strictly construed and in the absence of clear compelling language should not be given a wider interpretation. If two constructions are possible upon the language of the Statute, the court must choose the one which is consistent with good sense and fairness, and eschew the other which makes its operation unduly oppressive. Unjust or unreasonable or which would lead to strange, inconsistent results or otherwise introduce an element of bewildering uncertainty and practical inconvenience in the working of the statute. If the strict construction is adopted either the hearing of the trial would have to be postponed till pronouncement of the sentence by the final judicial authority of a conditional sentence may be passed in the trial for the subsequent offence. However postponment of trial is not desirable.
 Passing of conditional sentence would be manifestly illegal.
 [295 H, 296A, D-G, 297 H], 298 A-B] 
 2. There is authority for the proposition that an order of acquittal particularly one based on merits, wipes off the conviction and sentence for all purposes and is void as if it had never been passed. It is a true annulment with retroactive force. [298-G] 291
