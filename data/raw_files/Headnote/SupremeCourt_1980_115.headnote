 1096 Allowing the appeal, the Court ^ 
 HELD : 1. The Municipalities in various States were created under the respective Municipalities Acts in order to facilitate the efficient administration of the Municipal areas and to provide lighting, watering and maintaining of public streets and places. The duties of the Municipal Boards are specified in S. 6 of the U.P. Municipalities Act.
 Under S. 118 of the Act, the Municipal Board is empowered to manage or control any property entrusted to its management and control. The vesting of the property, in the Municipality is under S. 116 of the Act. S. 116 provides that subject to any special reservation made by the State Government, all property of the nature specified in this section and situated within the Municipality shall vest in and belong to the Board, and shall, with all property which may become vested in the Board, be under its direction, management and control. While under clause (f) of S. 116, all lands and other property transferred to the Board by the Government by gift, purchase or otherwise for local public purposes vest in the Municipality, under Cl. (g), the streets vest only qua streets and not as absolute property with the Municipality. In the present case the property falls within the definition of `Street' under section 2(23) of the Act. [1100 A-D, E-F, H] 
 2. Though the street vested in the Municipal Council under section 116 of the U.P. Municipal Act, it does not transfer to the Municipality the right of the owner in the site or soil over which the street exists. Therefore, when a street ceases to be a highway by its being diverted to some other use, the interest of the Corporate body determines.
 Therefore, what is vested in the municipality under section 116(g) is the street qua street and if the Municipality put the street to any other user than that for which it was intended, the State as its owner, is entitled to intervene and maintain an action and to get any person in illegal occupation evicted.
