 The appellant is a public limited company owning various industrial units including the Delhi Cloth Mills (D.C.M.) and the Swatantra Bharat Mills (S.B.M.). Although separate balance-sheet and profit and loss accounts were prepared for each of these two mills, their workmen have always been paid bonus calculated on the basis of pooled profits of the two units treating them as one unit. Disputes and differences having arisen as regards payment of bonus between the workers of these two units, the following questions were referred to the Tribunal for adjudication.
 (i)Whether in calculating the bonus table for the accounting year in question, the allocation separately made by the company towards capital and reserves of the two units (D.C.M. and S.B.M. units) is fair and reasonable.
 (ii)Whether workmen of these two mills are entitled to bonus at higher rate for the said accounting year. .
 On the basis of documents filed both by the management and the workers, it appeared that according to the company, direct taxes which have to be deducted far computation of allocable surplus for payment of bonus was much higher, while according to the workers, direct taxes should be much less. If the computation of the management were to be accepted, the rate of bonus to each employee would remain at 7.30 per cent, while according to workers, the rate of bonus would be 16.64%. The Tribunal however, gave its award in favour of the workers. Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : The direct taxes under s. 6(c) of the Bonus Act were properly quantified by the Appellant company in their calculation and the rate of Bonus to each employee is 7.31 per cent of their annual wage bill and not 16.64 per cent as claimed by the workers. The bonus Act, being a complete Code, the provisions thereof must have effect of their own force. So far as the two mills are concerned, the gross profits must be computed in terms of the second schedule to the Act and the available surplus mentioned in s. 5, in terms of ss. 6 and 7 of the Act. Where a branch or undertaking has to be taken as an Establishment under the proviso to s. 2 for the purpose of the Act, the gross profits, prior charges, the available 595 surplus and the allocable surplus have all to be found out nationally applying the fiction to the branch or establishment. When the fiction is to have effect with regard to all other matters, it is not possible to hold that for the purpose of computation of direct tax, it has to be given a go-by and the actual realities of the situation taken note of only in respect of the amount of tax payable under the Income-tax Act for all the establishments which have to suffer taxation together and thereby to displace the fictional or notional liability.
