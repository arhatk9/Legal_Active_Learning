 Where the District Court appoints an administrator to the estate of a deceased person under rule 9 of the Bombay Regulation VIII of 1827, on the ground that the right of succession is disputed between two or more claimants none of whom has taken possession of the property, what the court has to consider is whether any of the claimants was in possession of the property at the date of the, commencement of the proceedings under the Regulation. The proceedings may commence either on an application made by one of the claimants or may be started suo motu by the Judge. In either case, the relevant point of time by reference to which the requirement as to possession has to be judged is the date of the commencement of the proceedings and not the date on which the order is passed. [173D-F.
