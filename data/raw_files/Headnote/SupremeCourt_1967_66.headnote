 A suit was filed by the respondents, on the basis of a promissory note executed in their favour by the appellant, and a decree was passed against the appellant. The decree provided for payment of the amount due in instalments and contained a default clause under which the whole decree could be executed. The decree also created a charge on certain immovable properties of the appellant. As default was committed by the appellant, the respondents sought execution of the decree. The appellant thereupon applied to the Court which passed the decree, under s. 4 of the U.P.
 Zamindar's Debt Reduction Act, 1953 to reduce the decretal amount. The first Court and the High Court on appeal, dismissed the appellant's application.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : Section 4 of the Act did not apply in the present case, and therefore the decretal amount could not be reduced.
 Section 3 of the Act provides for the reduction of debt at the time of the passing the decree in "a suit .... relating to secured debt", and s. 4 provides for reduction of the debts after the passing of "a decree...... relating to a secured debt". Whether the debt was secured or not is a matter that has to be tested, both for s. 4 as well as for s. 3, on the date the suit was filed. If on that date the debt was secured, as per the definition of a secured debt in s. 2(m) of the Act, by a mortgage or a charge under s. 100 of the Transfer of Property Act, the suit would be relating to a secured debt and so would be the decree which might later be passed in that suit. But if on that date, the debt was not secured it cannot be said that the decree related to a secured debt simply because the decree created a charge.
 The legislature could not have intended, that the fact that the decree created a charge should result in converting what was an unsecured debt into a secured debt for the purpose of s. 4. [202 A, C-G; 203 E, H; 204 A-B]
