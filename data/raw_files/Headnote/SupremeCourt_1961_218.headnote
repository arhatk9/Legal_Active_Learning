 In a suit instituted by the respondent for the recovery of monies which he alleged were due to him from the appellant, the latter pleaded that the liability had been discharged.
 In support of that plea the appellant sought to tender in evidence a statement which he said had been made by the respondent before the Income-tax Officer in certain proceedings relating to the assessment of Income-tax of the appellant for the year 1949-50. For this purpose the appellant applied to the trial court praying that the Commissioner of Income-tax might be asked to arrange for the production before the court of the record of the statement made by the respondent. On objection raised by the Commissioner of Income-tax, the court held that he could not be required to produce the statement, in view of the prohibitions imposed by s. 54 of the Indian Incometax Act, 1922. The appellant contended that the prohibition contained in s. 54 of the Act related only to the evidence given by an assessee himself and not to that of other witnesses, and that, in any event, the provisions in that section being in the interest of and for the protection of the assessee only, if the assessee waived the privilege, the prohibition contained therein would be inoperative.
 Held, that the prohibition imposed in s. 54 of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, is absolute and the operation of the section is not obliterated by any waiver by the assessee in whose assessment the evidence was tendered, document pro- duced or record,prepared.
