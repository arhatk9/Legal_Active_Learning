Article 19(1)(g) cannot be said to be violated if no commission agent shall act in the manner prohibited by section 32(5) of the Act or he cannot deduct any commission or delali from the sale proceeds payable to the producer or that he cannot act both for the buyer as also for the seller. In prohibiting such practices Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution cannot be said to be violated in any manner.
 Such restrictions being in the interests of the general public are protected by Article 19(6) of the Constitution.

The Act has been passed to protect innocent agriculturists who bring their produce to the market areas from the clutches of the commission agents. [534 E-F] n
