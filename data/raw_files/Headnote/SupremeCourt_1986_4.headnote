 The assessee, a subsidiary bank of the State Bank of India, used to maintain in the accounting years 1964, 1965 and 1966, its accounts in mercantile system making entries and calculating income and loss on accrual basis and adopted the calendar year as its previous year. The assessee, in the course of its banking business, used to charge interest on advances considered doubtful of recovery termed as 'sticky advances' by debiting the concerned parties but instead of carrying the same to its 'Profit & Loss Account', credited the same to a separate account called 'Interest Suspense Account' as the principal amounts of these 'sticky advances' themselves had become not bad or irrecoverable, but extremely doubtful of recovery. In its returns the assessee disclosed such interests separately and claimed that the same were not taxable in its hands as income for the concerned years.
 The business of the assessee bank also included buying and selling of foreign exchange and before devaluation of the Indian Rupee on August 6, 1966, the assessee bank held foreign 26 exchange by way of cash balances available with their foreign correspondents, forward contracts, items in transits, etc. in U.S. Dollars and in Sterling, which on devaluation of the Indian Rupee when converted back to rupees at the post devaluation rates gave rise to a profit of 57.5% in the transaction; the assessee bank-credited this surplus to an account designated "Provision for Contingencies". In the Assessment Year 1967-68 the assessee bank claimed that profit by way of exchange difference on devaluation should not be taxed as it was of a casual and non-recurring nature.
 The claim of the assessee bank on both these aspects was rejected by the Income-tax Authorities, Income-tax Appellate Tribunal and the High Court. The High Court held:
 (a) the assessee was following the mercantile system of accounting; such interest, therefore, had accrued to the assessee at the end of the accounting year; and (b) the assessee itself had treated such income as accrual of interest by charging the same to the parties concerned by making debit entries in their respective accounts. However, if any part of these debits had later on become irrecoverable in any year, the assessee could have, in that year, treated the same as such and claimed deduction under section 36(1)(vii) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
 In the appeals to this Court on behalf of the assessee bank it was contended: (1) that the three sums representing interest on 'sticky' advances, i.e. advances in respect where of there was high improbability of recovery of even the principal amounts, ought not to have been subjected to tax as income under the Act; that what are chargeable to income-tax in respect of a business are profits and gains actually resulting from the transaction of the previous year, that is to say, the real profits and gains and not hypothetical profits or gains on a doctrinaire theory of accrual; that even under the mercantile system of accounting regularly adopted by an assessee it is only the acrual of "real income" in the commercial sense which is chargeable to tax, that accrual is a matter of substance to be decided on commercial principles having regard to business character of the transaction and the realities of the situation and cannot be determined on any abstract theory of accrual or by adopting a legalistic approach and that if regard is had to the commercial principles and realities of the situation it will be clear that in 27 the case of banks, financial institutions and money-lenders, whose bulk profits mainly consist of interest earned by them, there is no accrual of real income so far as interest on sticky advances and the debit entries made in respect of such interest in the respective accounts of the concerned debtors following the mercantile system of accounting merely reflected hypothetical income that does not materialise in the concerned accounting year or years during which the advances remain sticky and hence it is but proper to carry such interest to "Interest Suspense Account' as carrying the same to 'Profit and Loss Account' would result in showing inflated profits and might even lead to improper and illegal distribution or remittance thereof; (2) that there is a clear distinction between an irrevocable loan and a sticky loan; the former is a bad debt in respect whereof the chance of recovery is nil and as such can outright form the subject matter of deduction under section 36(i)(vii) of the Act while the latter is a loan to which a high degree of improbability of recovery attaches in a particular year or years depending upon the financial position of the concerned debtor due to which interest thereon becomes hypothetical income during such year or years and, as such, the same, not being real income, cannot be brought to tax; (3) that right from August 1924 onwards till the decision of the High Courts distinction between an irrecoverable loan and a sticky loan was recognised by the Central Board of Revenue as also by the Reserve Bank of India in their diverse Circulars in the case of banks, financial institutions and money-lenders regularly following the mercantile system of accounting and that Instructions had been issued not to treat the unrealised interest on sticky loans as income by carrying it to 'Profit and Loss Account' so that the figure of distributable profits should not get inflated and preferably to credit the same to a special account 'Interest Suspense Account' and that if the banks, financial institutions and money-lenders, who kept their accounts on mercantile system, maintained a suspense account in which the unrealised interest was entered, the same should not be included in the assessee's taxable income, if the Income Tax Officer was satisfied that there was really probability of the loans being repaid; (4) that the Instructions contained in various Circulars were in consonance with the accepted principle that what was chargeable under the Income Tax Act was the real income of an assessee but these instructions which held field for over 53 years were changed, though wrongly, under fresh circulars issued by the Central 28 Board of Direct Taxes whereunder interest on doubtful or sticky loans became includible in the assessable income of the assessee with effect from the assessment year 1979-80, and (5) that in the case of banks and financial institutions who regularly adopted mercantile system of accounting the practice of carrying interest on such sticky loans to 'Interest Suspense Account' or 'Reserve for Doubtful Interest Account' in stead of crediting the same to 'Interest Account' or 'Profit and Loss Account' is a universally recognised practice invariably adopted by them and being wholly consistent with the mercantile system of accounting the Income Tax Officer was bound to give effect to it under section 145 of the Act and, therefore, the treatment of the three sums representing interest on sticky loans as the assessee's income for the concerned years would be unsustainable in law.
 On behalf of the Revenue it was contended: (1) that though it is the real income that is chargeable to tax under the Act and not any hypothetical income of an assessee and that under section 28 in respect of a business the chargeability must attach to real profits and gains arising from the transactions of the previous year, but under section 5 read with section 28 of the Act the liability attaches to profits which have been either received by the assessee or which have accrued to him during the year of account and that income accrues when it "falls due", i.e.
 becomes legally recoverable irrespective of whether actually received or not and "accrued income" is that income which "the assessee has a legal right to receive" and since the assessee has been maintaining its accounts on mercantile basis the three sums being interest on loans, whether doubtful or sticky, fell due and became payable to the assessee at the end of each of the three accounting years and constituted its accrued income and, therefore, justifiably brought to tax in the concerned assessment years; (2) that though, while imposing the tax liability under the Act, the Courts have recognised the theory of real income by having regard to the business character of the transactions and realities of the situation but these aspects have been taken into account for the purpose of determining whether the income could be said to have legally accrued or not and once it is found to have legally accrued it is brought to tax and that the theory of real income has been invoked and confined only to two types of cases (a) where there has been a surrender of income which may in theory have accrued, and (b) where there has been diversion of income at source either 29 under a statute or by over riding title but in none of the cases has the aspect of high improbability of recovery been regarded as sufficient to prevent accrual; therefore the theory of real income should not be extended so as to exclude from chargeability such income which has accrued but merely suffers from high improbability of recovery, because such extention would be neither permissible nor advisable - not permissible because it goes against the very concept of accrued income and not advisable because if done it will apply to all cases and not merely to cases of interest accruing to banks and financial institutions. Such extension will moreover entrench upon section 36(1) (vii) which provides for deductions of a debt or part thereof on its becoming bad on fulfilment of certain conditions specified in sub-section (2) thereof; for these reasons the extension of the theory of real income so as to take within its ambit the consideration of high improbability of recovery is not warranted. As regards the Circulars of C.B.R. and R.B.I., it was submitted that these merely granted a concession to and conferred no right in favour of the assessee which could be and has been withdrawn later by issuing fresh Circulars but since the benefit or the concession in favour of the assessee could not be withdrawn retrospectively, the withdrawal of concession has been effected prospectively from the assessment year 1979-80.

 HELD: Per Tulzapurkar, Mukharji and Ranganath Misra, JJ. (concurring).
 The principle that if the stock-in-trade remains unused or unsold the mere book appreciation in the value thereof cannot be brought to tax is well accepted. However, in the instant case, the assessee bank by carrying the surplus resulting from the devaluation of the Indian rupee to an account designated 'Provision for Contingencies' could be said to have clearly treated such surplus as its business income. Further, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner in his appellate order recorded a categorical finding that the stock in trade in terms of foreign currency was sold and used by the assessee in its normal business. Having regard to this factual position the exchange difference arising out of devaluation of the Indian rupee was rightly treated as income of the assessee in the assessment year 1967-68. [65 C; 66 G-H; 67 A & D] C.I.T. v. Mughal Line Ltd., 46 I.T.R. 590 referred to.
 30 Per Mukharji, J. (1) It is the income which has really accrued or arisen to the assessee that is taxable. Under Income-tax law, receipt of income, either actual or deemed, is not a condition precedent to the taxability. These were assessable if these had arisen or accrued or deemed to have accrued or arisen under the Act. This principle would be attracted even in cases where an assessee followed the mercantile system of accounting. However, in examining any transaction or situation, the court would have more regard to the reality of the situation rather than purely theoretical or doctrinaire aspect. [92 A; 86 F-G] 
 2. The profits and gains chargeable to tax under the Act are those which have been either received by the assessee or have accrued to the assessee during the period between the first and the last day of the year of account and are receivable. Income received or income accrued are both chargeable to tax under section 28 of the Act. [74 C] 
 3. By and large, two systems of account keeping are followed one is the cash and the other, mercantile. The cash system postulate actual receipt of money; and for exigibility of income tax, such receipt from business, profession or vocation or from other sources has to be actual in the relevant year of account. The mercantile system is one where accounts are maintained on the basis of entitlement to credit and/or debit. A sum of money, as soon as it becomes payable, is taken into account without reference to actual receipt and a debit becomes admissible when liability to pay is created even though the sum of money is yet to be paid.

 4. The income of the assessee will have to be determined according to the provisions of the Act in consonance with the method of accountancy regularly employed by the assessee. The method of accounting regularly employed by the assessee helps computation of income, profits and gains under section 28 of the Act and the taxability of that income under the Act, will then have to be determined. The circulars being executive in 31 character cannot alter the provisions of the Act and being in the nature of concessions could always be prospectively withdrawn.

Shrimati Singari Bai, 13 I.T.R. 224 & Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras v. A. Krishnaswami Mudaliar and Ors., 53 I.T.R. 122 referred to.
 
 5. Mere improbability of recovery, where the conduct of the assessee is unequivocal cannot be treated as evidence of the fact that income has not resulted or accrued to the assessee. After debiting the debtor's account and not reversing that entry - but taking the interest merely in suspense account cannot be such evidence to show that no real income has accrued to the assessee or treated as such by the assessee. If the actuality of a situation or the reality of a particular situation makes an income not to accrue, then very different considerations would apply. But where interest has accrued and the assessee has debited the account of the debtor, the difficulty of the recovery would not make the accrual non-accural of interest.

 Confinance Ltd., 89 I.T.R. 292 and James Finlay & Co. v.

 6. An acceptable formula of co-relating the notion of real income in conjunction with the method of accounting for the purpose of computation of income for the purpose of taxation is difficult to evolve. Besides, any straight- jacket formual is bound to create problems in its application to every situation. It must depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. It would be difficult and improper to extent the concept of real income to all cases depending upon the ipse dixit of the assessee which would then become a value judgment only. What has really accrued to the assessee has to be found out and what has accrued must be considered from the point of view of real income taking the probability or improbability of realisation in a realistic manner and dovetailing 32 of these factors together, but once the accrual takes place on the conduct of the parties subsequent to the year of closing, an income which has accrued cannot be made "no income". The conduct of the parties in treating the income in a particular manner is material evidence of the fact whether income has accrued or not. [91 B-C; E-F; 92 C] 
 7. The concept of real income is a well accepted one and must be applied in appropriate cases but with circumspection and must not be called in aid to defeat the fundamental principles of income-tax as developed. [92 F] 
 8. The concept of real income would apply where there has been a surrender of the income which in theory may have accrued but in the reality of the situation no income has resulted because the income did not really accrue. Where a debt has become bad and deduction in compliance with the provisions of the Act should be claimed and allowed. If there is any diversion of income at source under any statute or by overriding title then there is no income to the assessee. [92 A-C] 
 9. Once the accrual takes place and income accrues, the same cannot be defeated by any theory of real income. In some limited fields where something which is the reality of the situation prevents the accrual of the income, then the notion of the real income i.e. making the income accrue in the real sense of the term can be brought into play, but the notion of real income cannot be brought into play where income has accrued according to the accounts of assessee and there is no indication by the assessee to treat the amount as not having accrued. Suspended animation following inclusion of the amount in suspense account does not negate accrual and after the event of accrual, corroborated by appropriate entry in the books of account on the mere ipse dixit of the assessee, no reversal of the situation can be brought about.

 Commissioner of Income-Tax, West Bengal, 37 I.T.R. 1 relied upon.

 10. The concept of real income cannot be so used as to making accrued income, non-income simply because after the event of accrual, the assessee neither decides to treat it as bad debt nor claims deduction under section 36(2) of the Act, but still enters the same with a diminished hope of recovery in the suspense account. Extension of the concept of real income to this field to negate after the amount had become payable is contrary to the postulates of the Act. [82 B-C] Per Ranganath Misra, J. (concurring) Section 36(2) of the Act covers the entire field regarding deduction for bad debt. Though the concept of 'real income' is well recognised one, it cannot be introduced as an outlet of income from taxman's net for assessment on the plea that though shown in the account book as having accrued, the same became a bad debt and was not earned at all. The citizen is entitled to the benefit of every ambiguity in a taxing statute but where the law is clear considerations of hardship, injustice or anomaly do not afford justification for extempting income from taxation. [93 C-D] Mapp v. Oram, 1969 (Vol.III) All E.R. 219 (H.L.) referred to.
 Per Tulzapurkar, J. - (dissenting) 
 1. Under the Income Tax Act in order that income should accrue it should not merely fall due or become legally recoverable but should also be factually and practically realisable during the accounting year or years. In other words mere non-receipt of income, when it is reasonably realisable, will not affect accrual but factual or practical unrealisability thereof may prevent its accrual depending upon the facts and circumstances attending upon the transaction. [59 F-G] 34 
 2. This theory of real income could be and should be extended to interest on sticky loans and that on principle such interest being hypothetical cannot be brought to tax.
 [64 G-H] 
 3. That the stickiness of advances or loans objectively established to the satisfaction of the taxing authorities by producing proper material, is sufficient to prevent the accrual of interest thereon as real income and would have the effect of rendering such income hypothetical and the same cannot be brought to tax. [59 E-F] 
 4. Under section 145 the assessee's regular method of accounting determines the mode of computing the taxable income but it does not determine or even affect the range of taxable income or the ambit of taxation. In other words, any hypothetical income which may have theoretically accrued but has not truly resulted or materialised in the concerned accounting year cannot be brought to change simply because the assessee has been regularly employing the mercantile system of accounting and makes entries in his books in regard to such hypothetical income. [47 F-G] 
 5. The method of accounting regularly employed by an assessee is relevant only for the purpose of computation of income, profits and gains under s. 28 of the Act and that it cannot enlarge or restrict the content of the taxable income under the Act and that under s. 145 the assessee's regular method of accounting determines the mode of computing taxable income but it does not determine or even effect the range of taxable income or ambit of taxation. [49 C-D] 
 6. In the case of interest on sticky loans the practice of debiting the accounts of the concerned debtors with such interest and carrying the same to 'Interest Suspense Account' instead of to "Interest Account' or 'Profit and Loss Account' is a well recognised and accepted practice of commercial accountancy, that it is wholly consistent with mercantile method of accounting and that it prevents the wrong crediting and improper and illegal distribution or remittance of inflated and unreal profits. [52 D-E] 
 7. Under s. 5 taxability is attracted not merely when income is acutally received but also when it has 'accrued' and income accrues when it 'falls due', that is to say when it becomes legally recoverable irrespective of whether it is actually received or not and 'accrued income' is that income which 'the assessee has a legal right to receive.' [52 F-G] 35 
 8. Where income or part thereof has theoretically accrued but has been, either unilaterally or as a result of bilateral arrangement, voluntary relinquished or surrendered by the assessee before its accrual the same cannot be regarded as real income of the assessee and cannot be brought to tax. Such conclusion is reached having regard to the business character of the transactions and the realities of the situation notwithstanding that some entries have been made in the assessee's books maintained in the mercantile system. [55 C-D] 
 9. Even under the mercantile system of accounting whenever adopted it is only the accrual of real income which is chargeable to tax, that accrual is a matter of substance and that is to be decided on commercial principles having regard to the business character of the transactions and the realities and specialities of the situation and cannot be determined by adopting purely theoretical or doctrinaire or legalistic approach.
