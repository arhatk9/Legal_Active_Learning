 A suit for ejectment on the ground of failing to pay arrears of rent was instituted against the appellant by the respondents under the provisions of the Delhi & Ajmer Rent Control Act, 1952 on February 27, 1958. On February 9, 1959 the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 came into force and became applicable to the premises in question. On March 13, 1961 the appellant, relying on the provisions of s. 50(2) of the Act of 1958, filed an application before the trial court requesting it to hold that the suit had abated on the ground that the suit -related to premises the construction of which had been completed after the 1st day of June 1951 but before the 9th day of June 1955. The trial court, not satisfied that the premises was constructed during the said period., rejected the application. An appeal purporting to be under s. 34 of the 1952 Act was filed before the District Judge who held that the order of the trial court was under the Act of 1958 so that no appeal lay. The High Court dismissed the appellant's revision application. Appeal to this Court was filed under Art. 136 of the Constitution.
 
HELD : (i) The saving clause of sub-s. (2) of s. 57 makes it clear that the present suit which was pending under the Act of 1952 was to be continued and disposed of in accordance with the provisions of that Act though tinder the first proviso the court deciding the suit was required to have regard to the provisions of the Act of 1958. [62 E] Further the second proviso to s. 57(2) of the Act of 1952 laid down that the provisions for appeal under the Act of 1952 were to continue in force in respect of suits and proceedings disposed of thereunder. Consequently the right of appeal against the order continued to be governed by s.
 34 of the Act of 1952. [62 G-H] However the trial Judge had only decided a preliminary issue and the order not being a final order was not appealable under s. 34 of the Act of 1952. [63 H] Central Bank of India v. Gokal Chand, [1966] INSC 160; [1967] 1 S.C.R. 310, relied on Ram Charan Das v. Hira Nand, A.I.R. 1945 Lah. 298, referred to.
 (ii) The appellant's application was not one under s. 33 of the Act of 1952 and the order disposing it of was not a final order on that ground either. [64 C-D] It was open to the appellant to challenge the correctness of the decision of the trial -court in the appeal against the decree if passed against him. [64 E-F] 60
