 In the election held for the Metropolitan Council from the Narela Constituency, the appellant Hari Ram secured 12,369 votes and was declared elected. The respondent Hira Singh who secured 12,131 votes filed an election petition before the Delhi High Court making a number of allegations against the appellant. He preferred an interlocutory application praying for a direction to the Returning Officer to produce the marked electoral rolls for inspection and also for allowing inspection of the counter-foils. The High Court granted both the prayers and hence this appeal.
 Allowing the appeal, the Court ^ 
 HELD: 1.1 Before allowing the prayers at an interlocutory stage, the High Court must examine whether proper foundation was laid for inspection and sufficient materials placed before it and pass an order which would result in adversely affecting the secrecy and sacrosanct nature of the electoral process. Inspection of ballot papers and counterfoils should be allowed very sparingly and only when it is absolutely essential to determine the issue. In the garb of seeking inspection, the defeated candidate should not be allowed to make a roving inquiry in order to fish out materials to set aside the election. [934 A-C] Bhabhi v. Sheo Govind and Ors., [1975] Supl.] SCR 202, followed.
 
 1.2 The approach of the High Court, in the instant case, at the very outset was legally incorrect. It was under a wrong impression that it had ample powers to direct production of any document under Section 165 of the Indian Evidence Act and over-looked the fact that the Representation of People Act was a special Act and provisions of the Evidence Act or the Code of Civil Procedure would only apply where they are not excluded. [935 D-E] 
 2.1 A perusal of Rule 93 of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 clearly shows that the Legislature intended to make a clear distinction between 933 one set of documents and another. So far as the counterfoils and the marked copy of the electoral rolls were concerned, there was a strict prohibition for opening these documents unless the court was fully satisfied that a cost iron case was made out for the same; whereas documents mentioned in clauses (a) and (b) of Sub Rule (2) of Rule 93 (as amended) could be liberally allowed to be inspected. [937 D-E] Ram Sewak Yadav v. Hussain Kamil Kidwai & Ors., [1964] 6 SCR 238; applied.
 
 2.2 In the instant case, the attempt of the respondent petitioner for inspecting marked electoral role by making vague allegations was nothing but to fish out material for challenging the election of the appellant and it clearly violated the sanctity and secrecy of the electoral process.
