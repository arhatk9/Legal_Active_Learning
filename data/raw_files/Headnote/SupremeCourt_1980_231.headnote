 The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 by section 15(2) empowers the High Court in the case of any criminal contempt of a subordinate court, to take cognizance on a reference made to it by the subordinate court, or on a motion made by the Advocate-General, or in relation to a Union Territory by the notified Law Officer.
 In a proceeding under the U.P. Zamindari and Land Reforms Act 1950, the respondent-advocate, appeared as a counsel before the appellant who was a Member of the Board of Revenue to oppose the vacation of a stay order filed before the Board.
 The respondent, in his petition to the High Court under the Contempt of Courts, 1971 alleged that in the course of arguments before the appellant in the aforesaid proceeding, the appellant got infuriated, lost his temper and abused him saying "Nalayak Gadhe Salle ko Jail Bhijwadunga; kis Idiot Ne Advocate Bana Diya Hai", and that thereby the appellant had committed contempt of his own Court as well as that of the High Court as provided in sections 15 and 16 of the Contempt of Courts Act which was punishable under section 12 of the said Act.
 Before the High Court, the appellant raised a preliminary objection stating that the High Court was not competent to take cognizance of the alleged contempt without any reference from the subordinate Court or without a motion by the Advocate-General as envisaged by section 15(2) of the Act. The High Court rejected the preliminary objection and held that the application was maintainable.
 In the appeal to this Court, on the question whether the High Court can take suo motu cognizance of contempt of subordinate/inferior Court when it is not moved in either of the two modes mentioned in section 15(2) of the Act.
 ^ 
 HELD : 1. Sub-section (2) of section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act 1971, does not restrict the power of the High Court to take cognizance of and punish contempt of a subordinate Court, on its own motion [339 A] 
 2. In the facts of the instant case the High Court has not acted improperly or illegally in taking suo motu cognizance, on the petition of the respondent-advocate. [340 C] 332 
 3. Articles 129 and 215 preserve all the powers of the Supreme Court and the High Court, respectively, as a Court of Record which include the power to punish the contempt of itself. Parliament has, by virtue of Entry 77 of List I of the Seventh Schedule, and Entry 14 of List III of the Seventh Schedule, power to define and limit the power of the Courts in punishing contempt of Court and to regulate their procedure in relation thereto. [337 A-B] Mohd. Ikram Hussain v. The State of U.P., [1963] INSC 203; A.I.R. 1964 S.C. 1625 referred to.
 
 4. Section 15 does not specify the basis or the sources of the information on which the High Court can act on its own motion. If the High Court acts on information derived from its own sources, such as on a perusal of the records of a subordinate court or on reading a report in a newspaper or hearing a public speech, without there being any reference from the subordinate court or the Advocate-General, it can be said to have taken cognizance on its own motion. But if the High Court is directly moved by a petition by a private person feeling aggrieved, not being the Advocate-General, the High Court, has, a discretion to refuse to entertain the petition, or to take cognizance on its own motion on the basis of the information supplied to it in that petition. If the petitioner is a responsible member of the legal profession, it may act suo motu. [339B-E] 
 5. If the High Court is prima facie satisfied that the information received by it regarding the commission of contempt of a subordinate court is not frivolous, and the contempt alleged is not merely technical or trivial, it may, in its discretion, act suo motu and commence the proceedings against the contemner. However, this mode of taking suo motu cognizance of contempt of a subordinate court should be resorted to sparingly where the contempt concerned is of a grave and serious nature. [339 P-G] 
 6. If the intention of the Legislature was to take away the power of the High Court to take suo motu cognizance of contempt, there was no difficulty in saying so in unequivocal language, or in wording sub-section (2) of section 15 in a negative form. [338 H; 339 A] 
 7. The whole object of prescribing procedural modes of taking cognizance in section 15 is to safeguard the valuable time of the High Court or of the Supreme Court from being wasted by frivolous complaints of contempt of court. [339 E]
