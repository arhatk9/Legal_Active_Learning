 Out of fifteen applications for the grant of a stage carriage permit on the Rasipuram-Pallipalayam route, Salem District, the Regional Transport Authority granted permit only to Respondent No. 1. In the several appeals filed by the unsuccessful applicants, the Transport Tribunal took the view that a person having the maximum sector qualification was to be preferred if he possessed the other necessary qualifications. It accordingly held that as "sector qualification" was a vital factor, the qualifications of the competing applicants had to 'be considered only in that background. It allowed- the appellant's appeal by its order dated January 5, 1976, on the ground that she had a superior claim for the grant of the permit because of her sector qualification on the unserved portion of the route and dismissed the other appeals. The High Court allowed the revision petitions filed by the respondents u/s 64B of the Motor Vehicles Act and ordered a "fresh consideration" of their claims along with that of the appellant, as it found that (a) all of them had secured a total of eight marks each on the basis of their residence (or principal place of business) technical qualification, workshop facilities and viability of units (b) respondent Pachamuthu Udayar had more experience than the appellant and (c) that the Tribunal had not stated that in its opinion, why such experience should give way to the sector qualification.
