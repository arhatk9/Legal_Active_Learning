 The appellant, an Assistant Station Master, was convicted of the offence of criminal misconduct in the discharge of his duties punishable under a. 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, and the conviction was confirmed by the High Court. In appeal to this Court under Art. 136, it was contended that; (1) the prosecution was invalid for want of competent sanction; (2) the investigation was not merely illegal but caused serious prejudice to the accused;
 (3) the Court should have drawn an adverse inference against the prosecution from the non-examination of a key witness like the Deputy Superintendent of Police; (4) the uncorroborated testimony of accomplices or quasi-accomplices should not have been made the foundation for the conviction;
 and (5) the Court should not have drawn a presumption under s. 4 of the Act as the charge was under s. 5(1)(d ) read with s. 5 (2).
 Dismissing the appeal.
 
HELD :-(1) (a) The Divisional Officer (Senior scale) granted the sanction for prosecution in this case, and under r. 134 of the Indian Railway Establishment Code, he has the delegated power to appoint and dismiss officers like the accused, and therefore, was competent to grant the sanction.
 [802 C-D] (b) The construction sought to be put on 'the rule reading it with r. 3(a), that only Divisional Personnel Officers are in executive charge of the staff of Divisional Offices and are entitled to control them and therefore, by implication other divisional officers are excluded from the delegation of powers in regard to appointments has no substance. Rule 3 (a) refers to 'Establishment matters' which ordinarily cover routine items and not appointments and dismissals [802 H-803 A] (c) Moreover the appellant should have produced his appointment order if his case was that it was only a Divisional Personnel Officer and not a Divisional Officer that appointed him. [803 B] (d) This contention was not raised in the lower court nor in the High Court' In special circumstances the validity of a sanction which goes to the root of the case may be permitted to be raised for the first time in this Court but this is not one such.

 37. referred to.
 (2) The mandate of s. 5A regarding investigation is merely that no police officer below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police shall investigate any of the offences specified therein. There was no inaction by the police or misuse of the executive magistracy in this case.
 In the present case, a trap was laid by the Executive Magistrate, because the D.S.P. had no jurisdiction over railway premises, and after the trap episode was completed and the offence committed information was laid before the police officer who started the investigation; and he certainly was an officer of competent rank. While, laying a trap by a police officer, may be a step in investigation if a case had already been registered in the police station pursuant to which the trap was set, it cannot be said to be a part of investigation where a trap is laid only to find out whether an offence is going to be committed. There is nothing in s. 5A preventing an Executive Magistrate or other public officer laying a trap to catch the allegedly corrupt official. [804 A-D] I State of Bihar' v. Basawan Singh.

 -Lg4SuP. CT/75 800 (3) The non-examination of the Deputy Superintendent of Police is of no consequence at all in the case. [807 B] (4)(a) The special jurisdiction under Art. 136 of the Constitution cannot be diluted into a second appeal on facts. [804 E-F] (b) To condemn roundly every public official or man of the people as an accomplice or quasi-accomplice for participating in a raid is to harm the public cause. May be a judicial officer, should hesitate to get involved in police traps when the police provide inducements and instruments to commit crimes, because, that would sully the image of the independence of the judiciary. But there cannot be a total ban on public officers even though executive magistrates, playing a socially useful role in checking public men's corruption when the situation needs it. A flexible, realistic approach is the sound course.
 [805 C-E] In the present case. the magistrate was not a full-blooded judicial officer no de novo temptation or bribe money was offered by the Police and no ground to discredit the veracity of the magistrate had been elicited. [805 E] Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh v. State of Vindhya Pradesh, [1954] S.C.R. 1096, referred to.
 (c) The permission given by the Court to treat a prosecution witness as hostile was properly granted. it is discretionary power of the trial court and, if the witness strikes the court as imbued with partisan. zeal, cross-examination may be allowed by the party who calls him.
 [806 E-F] (5) Even if the statutory presumption is unavailable courts may presume what may in the ordinary course. be the most probable inference. That an Assistant Station Master has in his hand a marked currency note made over to him by a passenger whose bedding had been detained by him, for which no credible explanation was forthcoming, speaks for itself.
 Assuming that the passenger was using a pass intended for himself to take with him his wife and child illegally and thus tried to dupe the railway, it is no alibi for the Assistant Station Master to help himself to illicit gratification. [806 G-807 B]
