 The appellant who had a special interest in Obstetrics and Gynaecology for want of a vacancy in that department joined initially as a Registrar of Anesthesia and gave an undertaking to serve in that capacity for a period of one year as per the rules then existing. Though the tenure of the post was extended to two years instead of one, later on, the department did not take any undertaking from the appellant to serve the entire period. Rule 23 of the "Rules governing the appointment of Registrars and, Housemen in the Government Medical Colleges and attached Teaching Hospitals" lays down that "the candidates who are appointed on any of the resident posts and leave without completing the tenure of their appointment shall not be considered in future for the post of Registrar". When the appellant,applied for the post of the Registrar (Obstetrics and Gynaecology) his application on a wrong interpretation of rule 23 and on the ground that the appellant had not completed his two years' tenure as Registrar of Anesthesia, was not considered and respondent No. 4 was appointed. The Gujarat High Court summarily dismissed the writ petition challenging the said appointment of respondent No. 4 and the view taken by the department.. A Letters Patent Appeal preferred against the said dismissal also failed.
 Allowing the appeal by special leave, the Court 
HELD : (1) In order to understand the real purport and import of the word "leave" it is difficult to lay down any proposition of universal application. in the English language there are a number of words which can be used as Noun and also as Verb and more often their meanings are different when they are used as Noun from those when the words are used as Verb. The court has to determine the meaning having regard, first to context and the setting in which the word has been used; and secondly the court has to consider whether the word "leave" his been used as a noun or a verb. [812 D-E] (2) The word "leave" used in Rule 23 has been used not is a noun but as a verb. If used ,is a verb the word "leave" postulates that the candidates must have left or forsaken the job for ever and ceased to remain in service in which case alone he would not be considered for promotion. [813 E- F] (3) What Rule 23 contemplated was not that a person while in service should be debarred from applying for a higher post so long as he did not complete the tenure for which he was appointed. Rule 23 does not appear to require any causal connection between the promotion to higher job and the tenure of the service of the candidate concerned. It, merely signifies that those candidates who choose to relinquish the service once for all and cease to be in tile department would not be considered for higher promotion.
 The rule Making. authority intended to impose a penalty on a person, who in the midst of it job chooses to quit the same for ever by refusing to consider his case for promotion to a higher job which appear to have been confined only to those candidates who are serving the department and not those who had left the service.
 In the instant case the mere fact that the appellant applied for the job of registrar of Obstetrics and Gynaecology would not amount to his leaving the post which he was holding though with the permission of the department 810 so as to fall within the mischief of Rule 23. Rule 23 does not act as a bar to the appointment of the appellant as Registrar of Gynaecology. [813 F-H,814 A] [The court directed the respondents Nos. 1 and 2 to consider the case of the appellant and if he is appointed, revert respondent No. 4.[814 A]
