 The petitioner was detained under the Maintenance of Internal Seenrity Act, 1971 by an order of the District Magistrate Burdwan, West 'Bengal. He challenged the order of detention in a writ petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution. The contentions urged in support of the petition were : (i) that the two incidents of murder mentioned in the grounds of detention were germane to law and order but could have no impact on 'public order' as such; (ii) that the order of detention was passed during the pendency of a prosecution launched against the petitioner for the very same incidents in regard to which the order of detention had been passed; (iii) that there was unreasonable delay in considering the petitioner's representation by the State Government; and (iv) that it was not open to the Parliament especially in view of the long title to the Act, to confer power on the appropriate Government to pass orders of detention for the maintenance of public order, as "internal security" cannot comprehend public order.
 
HELD : (i) The murders were stated to have been committed by the petitioner and his associates with the definite object of promoting the cause of the party to which they belonged.
 These, therefore, were not stray or simple cases of murder Such incidents have serious repercussion's not merely on law and order but on public order. [648A] (ii) It has been held by this Court that the mere circumstance that a detention order is passed during the pendency of a prosecution will not vitiate the order. In conceivable cases it may become necessary to pass an order of detention in anticipation of an order of discharge or acquittal. [648E] W.P. No. 112 of 1972, decided on 17th August 1972, referred to.
 (iii) The petitioner's representation was received by the Government on 13th January 1972 and was rejected on 22nd February 1972. Apparently therefore there was delay in considering the P.-presentation. The affidavit on behalf of the State Government however showed that the representation could not be considered earlier because although the war with Pakistan had ended, its after-effects were still looming large in West Bengal and the officers of the State Government had to take appropriate steps for the return of the refugees who had taken shelter 'in West Bengal. The delay, thus, was satisfactorily explained. [648F] (iv) Under Entry 3 of List III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, Parliament has the power to legislate on "Preventive detention for reasons connected with the security of a State the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community." Section 3(1)(a)(ii) of the Act 647 confers power on the Central Government to pass orders of detention with a view to preventing any person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of the State or the maintenance of public order. This power cannot be controlled by anything stated in the long title of the Act.
 Besides the long title describes the Act as one for providing for detention for the purpose of maintenance of internal security and "matters connected therewith......
 "Internal Security" is an expression of width sufficient to comprehend the concept of public order. Internal disturbances can threaten the security of the State and such disturbances may assume grave proportion so as to have a direct impact on public order. [649B]
