 The third respondent was a Head Clerk in the Rajya Transport Authority, a departmental undertaking of the respondent State Government. His appointment was temporary terminable without notice and without assigning any reason.
 By an order dated February 18, 1959 he was discharged from service. On April 20, 1959, the State Government, in exercise of the power conferred under the Road Transport Corporation Act. 1950, set up the appellant corporation and under the notification the corporation was to "exercise all the powers and perform all the functions" till then exercised and performed by the Rajya Transport Authority.
 In February 1961 the State Government referred the question of termination of the third respondent's services to the Labour Court. The Labour Court held that he was a workman, that the termination of service was punitive in nature in view of the Corporation's letter addressed to the Conciliation Officer that the third respondent - had committed various irregularities in the discharge of his duties, and that the appellant Corporation was the successor in title to the Rajya Transport Authority. The Labour Court, therefore, held the termination illegal and directed the Corporation to reinstate the third respondent in its service A Writ petition in the High Court for quashing the award was dismissed. In the appeal to this Court, it was contended that (1) the third respondent was not a workman as defined in s. 2(s) of the industrial Disputes Act; (ii) the order terminating his service was an order of termination simpliciter and (iii) even assuming the order was illegal his remedy was against the State Government and not against the Corporation. Dismissing the appeal.
 
 HELD : (i) Prima, facie the third respondent was neither an officer nor a member of the office staff in the administrative offices. The standing orders, therefore, were applicable to him. The definition of workman in s.
 2(s) of the Industrial Disputes Act being a comprehensive one, the third respondent must be held to be a workman within the meaning of S. 2(s) whose conditions of service were governed by the standing orders,[7l2 B] (ii) The standing orders do not provide any precedure for dealing with an employee guilty of misconduct enumerated therein, but it is well established that termination of service on the ground of misconduct could only be done in conformity with the principles of natural justice. Even though the order of termination may be couched in terms of an order of termination simpliciter the Labour Court is entitled to go behind the 709 apparent language of the order and consider whether the order is termination simpliciter or is imposed by way of punishment. The conclusion of the Labour Court that the termination of service of respondent 3 was not one of termination simpliciter but was by way of penalty for irregularities committed in the discharge of duties was neither unreasonable nor perverse and the High Court rightly refused to Interfere with such a finding in a writ of certiorari. [712F-713C] (iii) Employment of staff and regulating their condition of service, including disciplinary action, was clearly one of the powers and functions of the Rajya Transport Authority and this was also to be exercised and performed by the appellant corporation under the notification. The averment of the Corporation that it had taken over such employees of the Rajya Transport Authority as were "on the rolls" of the Authority only meant those employees who were in the service of the Authority and be- cause that termination of service of the third respondent was held to be ,illegal he was deemed to be continuing in the service of the Authority and hence on its rolls. The appellant corporation must therefore be deemed to have taken over the services of respondent 3. [713 H-714 E]
