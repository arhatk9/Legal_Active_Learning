 By a notification issued on the 27th June, 1969, under s. 16(1) of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act 1956 the Central Government banned with immediate effect all forward trading in shares on recognised stock exchanges in the country. The proviso to the notification, which dealt with how all existing contracts remaining outstanding as on the date of the notification should be closed or liquidated, contained a direction to the effect that "a contract other than a spot delivery contract or contract for cash or hand delivery or special delivery may be entered into between its members or though or with any such member for the purpose of closing out or liquidating all existing contracts remaining to be performed after that date." It further provided that "such contracts shall be subject to the rules, bye-laws and regulations of the recognised stock exchange" that come into force when further new dealings are prohibited and subject also to such terms and conditions as the Central Government may impose.
 In terms of the notification the respondent called upon all its members to submit a list of outstanding transactions in all securities on the cleared list and to deposit along with it, interim margins in cash or approved shares calculated on the basis of differences between the rates of the last clearing and certain average specified rates fixed by it. Appellant no. 2 who was a partner of appellant no. 1, contended that the demand for interim margins was by way of "carry over" of the forward transactions which, in view of the ban contained in the notification, was illegal. Instead of submitting a list of his outstanding transactions on the basis of the rates fixed by the respondent, he enclosed a, statement of his outstanding transactions adjusted at the last official closing rates which were higher than the rates fixed by the respondent, suggesting thereby that he was not liable to pay anything. The respondent rejected the appellant's contention and again called upon him to comply with its earlier notice. Eventually since the appellant did not comply with the notice the respondent by a resolution declared him a defaulter which exposed him under the bye laws to a rigorous enquiry into his financial condition and entailed other disabilities including termination of membership. By another resolution the appellant was called upon to deposit additional security of Rs. 20,000/-.
 In his writ petition before the High Court, challenging the resolutions, the appellant contended that all his transactions which remained outstanding on June 27, 1969 were forward contracts pertaining to cleared securities and as such were affected by the notification which banned all forward contracts, that these had to be adjusted at the last official closing rates, and therefore, the respondent's action in calling upon him to deposit interim margins calculated 374 on the basis of certain average specified rates fixed by it was not warranted by the proviso of the notification and was illegal. The High Court dismissed the petition.
 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: The directions issued by the respondent were proper and legal. [383 H] The proviso clearly permitted the closing out or liquidation of all outstanding transactions in the normal manner by entering into a forward contract (which would include "carry over") in accordance with the rules, bye-laws and regulations of the respondent. There was no warrant for the stand taken by appellant no. 2 that all outstanding transactions had to be or could be adjusted on the basis of "previous official closing." [381F] 
 1. For the purpose of closing or liquidating existing outstanding transactions a forward contract was permitted to be entered into. The expression "such contracts" occurring in the last part of the notification meant those as were referred to in the first part of the notification, the making of which was banned after June 27, 1969. The expression "such contracts" was not referable to the existing outstanding "contracts nor to 'a contract' that could be entered into for closing or liquidating the existing outstanding contracts. The last part of the notification has nothing to do with the existing outstanding contracts, the closing or liquidating of which was independently provided for by the proviso. [381 C-D] 
 2. Moreover the letter of the Joint Director Ministry of Finance addressed to the President of the respondent and the Press Note issued by the Ministry of Finance clearly brought out that as per the notification itself all outstanding contracts were permitted to be liquidated in accordance with the relevant rules, bye-laws and regulations of a recognised stock exchange and secondly no specific period was mentioned in the notification for liquidation of outstanding business but that the members operating on a recognised stock exchange were expected to clear the outstandings in a smooth and orderly manner within a reasonable period. [382G-H] 
 3. The two documents which came into existence almost simultaneously with the issue of the notification, could be looked at for finding out the true intention of the Government in issuing the notification. The principle of contemporanea expositio can be invoked, though the same will not always be decisive on the question of construction. In construing a statute courts will give much weight to the interpretation put upon it at the time of its enactment and by those whose duty it has been to construe, execute and apply it. Contemporaneous construction placed by administrative or executive officers charged with executing a statute, although not controlling, is nevertheless entitled to considerable weight; it is highly persuasive.
