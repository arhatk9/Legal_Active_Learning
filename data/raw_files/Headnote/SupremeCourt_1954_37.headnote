 Held, that among agricultural Jats of Village Relia, in the District of Barnala, State of Pepsu, daughter's sons will inherit, to the exclusion of collaterals, the non- ancestral lands which had devolved by inheritance on their mother.
 A gift by the daughter to her sons would amount to acceleration of succession. Omission to include a small portion of the whole property due to ignorance or oversight does not affect the validity of the surrender when it is otherwise bona fide.
