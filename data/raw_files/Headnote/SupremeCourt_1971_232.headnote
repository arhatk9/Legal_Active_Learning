 The Commissioner of Income-tax found that the orders of the Income-tax Officer granting registration to the assessee firm and renewal of registration for the next year were erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of revenue. He therefore proceeded against the assessee under s. 33B of the Income-tax Act, 1922, after issuing notice to the assessee.
 The High Court, on reference, held that the notice was not valid and that therefore, the Commissioner had no jurisdiction to proceed with the enquiry.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : Section 33B, unlike s. 34 of the Act does not prescribe any notice to be given. For the assumption of jurisdiction to proceed under s. 33B a notice is not a condition precedent. The section only requires the Commissioner to give an opportunity to the assessee before reaching his decision and not before commencing the enquiry.
 The requirement is only a principle of natural justice, and its breach may affect the legality of the order, but does not affect the jurisdiction of the Commissioner. Therefore, the question as to what the notice given in the present case should have contained did not arise at it]. [592 C-H] Gita Devi Aggarwal v. C.I.T., West Bengal, 76 I.T.R.
