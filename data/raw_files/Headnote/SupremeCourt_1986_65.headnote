 The dispute in these appeals relates to the inter se seniority between the direct-recruits and promotees to the cadre of Deputy Collectors formerly designated as 'Bombay Civil service Executive Branch : Deputy Collectors (Upper Division) ' and now designated as "Gujarat Civil Service Class I and Class II". In the predecessor Province of Bombay the source of recruitment to the posts of Deputy Collectors used to be Mamlatdars who were promoted as Deputy Collectors. In 1939, direct recruitment policy was also introduced for this post, but during the years 1950 to 1959 the scheme of direct recruitment to the cadre of Deputy Collectors was discontinued. However, the Bombay Government by its Resolution dated 30.7.59 again revived the scheme of direct recruitment and fixed the ratio of appointment by the direct recruits and the promotees as 50:50 as far as practicable.
 On 1.5.1960 the Bombay State was bifurcated into Gujarat and Maharashtra. During the period 1960-62 no direct-recruits were appointed to the posts of Deputy Collectors due to administrative difficulties and 61 Mamlatdars were promoted to those posts. However, since 1963 onwards, the direct-recruits 251 also came to be appointed. The Government of Gujarat issued on Dec. 12, 1971 a seniority list as on Jan. 1, 1971. The list of the promotees was prepared on the basis of their continuous length of service and the list of the direct-rec Nits was prepared on the basis of the dates of their respective appointments. A combined seniority list showing seniority inter se between the promotees and the direct-rec Nits was also prepared. The direct-rec Nits challenged the aforesaid seniority list before the High Court and the matter ultimately came up before the Supreme Court in N.K.
 Chauhan and Ors. v. State of Gujarat and Ors., [1976] INSC 274; [1977] 1 S.C.R. 1037. The Supreme Court, after discussing the case law, summed up its conclusions and gave the requisite directions for reframing inter se seniority as under :
 a. The quota system does not necessitate the adoption of the rotational rule in practical application. Many ways of working out 'quota' prescription can be devised of which rota is certainly one.
 b. While laying down a quota when filling up vacancies in a cadre from more than one source, it is open to Government, subject to tests under Art. 16 to choose 'a year' or other period or the vacancy by vacancy basis to work out the quota among the sources. But once the court is satisfied, examining for constitutionality the method proposed, that there is no invalidity, administrative technology may have free play in choosing one or other of the familiar processes of implementing the quota rule.
 c. Seniority, normally is measured by length of continuous, officiating service - The actual is easily accepted as the legal. This does not preclude a different prescription, constitutionally tests being satisfied.
 d. A periodisation is needed in the case to settle rightly the relative claims of promotees and direct recruits.- 1960-62 forms period A and 1962 onwards forms period B. Promotees regularly 252 appointed during period A in excess of their quota, for want of direct recruits (reasonably sought but not secured and because tarrying longer would injure the administration) can claim their whole length of service for seniority even against direct recruits who may turn up in succeeding periods.
 e. Promotees who have been fitted into vacancies beyond their quota during the period - the year being regarded as the unit - must suffer survival as invalid appointees acquiring new life when vacancies in their quota fall to be filled up. To that extent they will step down, rather be pushed down as against direct recruits who were later but regularly appointed within their quota." The Government of Gujarat accordingly prepared a seniority list pursuant to the directions given by the Supreme Court in Chauhan's case. The direct recruits and the promotees again filed writ petitions before the Gujarat High Court challenging the aforesaid seniority list. The main contention of the direct recruits before the High Court was that there were only 30 substantive vacancies in the permanent strength of the Deputy Collectors cadre and the balance of 31 vacancies was in the temporary posts created by the said Government or ex-cadre posts and consequently the 31 promotees could not be deemed to be regularly appointed as required by direction 'd' given in Chauhan's case. On the other hand, the promotees contended that quota was not distributed on the basis of actual or utilised vacancies but only the filled up vacancies of the officers who had continued to officiate till retirement or death.
 Accepting the contention of the direct recruits, the Division Bench of the High Court observed that the officers promoted during the period 'A' to the posts of Deputy Collectors fell in four categories, namely, (i) Promotees appointed to substantive vacancies in the cadre of Deputy Collectors.
 (ii) Promotees appointed to hold ex-cadre posts.
 (iii) Promotees appointed to temporary posts cadre posts or ex-cadre posts.
 253 (iv) Promotees who were first placed on conditional select list during period 'A' and were placed on unconditional select list after their performance was found satisfactory.
 The High Court held: (a) that the promotees falling under category No. (1) in excess of their quota would be senior to subsequently appointed direct recruits in accordance with their length of continuous officiating service; (b) that so far as the last category is concerned, the Mamlatdars were placed on a conditional select list and were appointed to hold the posts of Deputy Collector and if their performance was found satisfactory during the trial period, they would be confirmed in those posts and that such confirmation had nothing to do with the length of continuous officiating service of such Mamlatdars and that it was the placement of the Mamlatdars on the select list which was material. As regards the second and the third categories, the Division Bench held that the expression "promotees regularly appointed during the period A in excess of their quota" had a direct reference to promotees regularly appointed in substantive vacancies which occurred in the cadre of Deputy Collector between 1960 and 1962 and that reading the principle laid down in the direction 'D' in Chauhan's case in the light of the Government Resolution of 1959, promotees appointed in substantive vacancies which occurred in the cadre of Deputy Collectors during the period 'A' in excess of their quota could alone gain seniority over the direct recruits in terms of the principle of the length of continuous officiating service and that those who were promoted to the posts of Deputy Collectors for being appointed to ex-cadre posts could not be said to be regularly appointed because their appointments were not in substantive vacancies in terms of the said Government Resolution and that the seniority of those who were so promoted had to be determined from the date on which they were appointed to fill the substantive vacancies in the cadre of Deputy Collectors and, therefore, those who were promoted to the posts of Deputy Collectors for being appointed to hold temporary posts could not be said to have been "regularly appointed" within the meaning of the decision in Chauhan's case.
 Allowing the appeal of the State in full and that of the promotees-appellants in part, 254 ^ 
 HELD : 1.1 The judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court in so far as it held that "promotees appointed to ex-cadre posts" and "promotees appointed to temporary posts, cadre posts or ex-cadre posts" were not regularly appointed during period A and, therefore, were not covered by direction (d) in Chauhan's case, was clearly wrong and is hereby reversed. [275 E-F] 
 1.2 It was not open to the direct recruits to contend before the High Court that promotees appointed to hold ex- cadre posts and temporary posts, whether cadre posts or ex- cadre posts, were not regularly appointed during period 'A' And the High Court after perusing Chauhan's case was in error in permitting them to raise this contention. This contention had been raised by the direct recruits in their earlier writ petition, namely, Special Civil Application No.
 1401 of 1972 and the learned Single Judge of the High Court had rejected this contention and had held that the appointments of the promotees between 1961 and 1963 were regular. The Division Bench of the High Court also did not disturb this finding nor was this finding upset by the Supreme Court in Chauhan's case. [272 B-E] 
 1.3 Although by reason of the Explanation which was inserted in s. 141 of the Code of Civil Procedure by the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act 1976, s. 11 of the Code does not in terms apply to any proceeding under Art.
 226 of the Constitution, the principle of res judicata does apply to all writ petitions under Art. 226. This point was, therefore, barred by the principle of res judicata and should never have been allowed by the High Court to be reagitated. [272 F-H] 
 2. The interpretation placed by the Division Bench upon the words "promotees regularly appointed" in direction (d) in Chauhan's case was wholly erroneous. Under the guise of interpreting the judgment in that case, the Division Bench of The High Court virtually sat in appeal over the judgment of the Supreme Court and modified it. The High Court ought to have taken the words in that judgment in the sense in which they were used and ought to have applied them to the facts before it, instead of trying to put words in the mouth of the Supreme Court. The Division Bench ignored the fact that the Supreme Court had categorically held that in the case before it the appointments had been regularly made in accordance with 255 the rules to fill substantive vacancies. Further, copies of the relevant Gazette notifications clearly bear out not only this fact but also show that the appointments of these promotees were regularly made. [273 A-C] In the instant case, the record shows that during period 'A' there were thirty vacancies in permanent posts and thirty-one vacancies in temporary additional posts.
 These thirty-one posts were created initially for a period of one year but renewed from year to year from 1960 onwards and have been in existence continuously since then. These temporary additional posts were, therefore, not fortuitous posts created for the purpose of special tasks but formed an integral part of the regular cadre, and appointments to those posts were made from the approved select list of Mamlatdars prepared in consultation with the Gujarat Public Service Commission. [273 D-F] 
 3.1 Rule 9(8) of the Bombay Civil Service Rules, 1959, defines "cadre" as meaning the strength of a service or a part of service sanctioned as a separate unit. The service of Deputy Collectors is admittedly a separate unit under the Revenue Department. A cadre consists of permanent posts and temporary posts added to the cadre from time to time according to the exigencies of the service. The difference between permanent and temporary posts is brought out by the definition of these expressions given in Rule 9. Under Rule 9(43), a permanent post is a post carrying a definite rate of pay sanctioned without limit of time and under Rule 9(56) a temporary post is a post carrying a definite rate of pay sanctioned for a limited time. Rule 71 sets out the manner of fixation of pay of the officer appointed to a temporary post. Even officers holding permanent posts are often deputed to hold an ex-cadre post. It was, therefore, immaterial whether these promotees after being appointed Deputy Collectors were deputed to hold an ex-cadre post or not. [273 F-H; 274 A] 
 3.2 The position that a temporary post can be held in a substantive capacity is now firmly established by the decisions of the Supreme Court. All persons holding substantive posts or temporary posts in substantive capacity are members of the service. A person can be said to hold a post, permanent or temporary, in a substantive capacity only if his appointment to that post is not fortuitous or ad hoc.
