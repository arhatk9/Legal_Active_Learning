 The petitioner as well as respondents 3 to 5 belong to the Judicial Service of Bihar. They joined service as Munsif, the petitioner in 1941 and the respondents 3 to 5 in 1944.
 They were promoted as Subordinate Judges and in 1962 the question of promoting them as Additional District and Session Judges was considered by the High Court and Government, and although the High Court wanted respondents 3 and 4 to function as Additional District and Sessions Judges ahead of the petitioner and its recommendation in that behalf was accepted by the Government, due to certain circumstances the petitioner started acting as such earlier than respondents 3 to 5 from January 1963. The Bihar Civil List, published in March, 1968 showed the petitioner as No.
 10, and respondents 1 to 5 as No. 12 to 14 in the cadre.
 The respondents made a representation to the High 'Court for a correction of their gradation in the list and the High Court accepted the representation in September 1968. In the same month, the District and -Sessions Judge at Arrah retired and respondent No. 3 who was the, third Additional District and Sessions Judge was asked by the High Court to officiate in the vacancy. The petitioner who was also working as first Additional District and Sessions Judge at the same place considered this to be a supersession and memorialized the Government and the Government took action on 17th October 1968 appointing the petitioner as officiating District and Sessions Judge. Thereupon the High Court transferred the petitioner to another district on 25th October 1968.
 In a writ petition under Art. 32 for quashing the High Court's order of transfer, 
HELD : (1) The position of a person in a Civil List gives no indication of his intrinsic quality as an officer. The.
 List merely shows the length of service, of the officers according to the dates of their appointment. their posting at the time when the list is published and their designation and scale of pay at that time. The gradation list of the High Court has no legal basis and its preparation is not sanctioned by the, Bihar Superior Judicial Service Rules.
 The seniority inter se of the petitioner and the three respondents would have to be determined when the question of their confirmation comes up for consideration since they are all holding only officiating posts. The order of the High Court could not be supported on the basis of seniority. [675 G] (2)But, the Government Notification of 17th October 1968 was not in compliance of Art. 233 of the Constitution.
 Under Art. 233 of the Constitution the appointment of a person to be District Judge rests with the Governor but he must make the appointment in consultation with the High Court. The Governor should make up his 667 mind after there his been a deliberation with the High Court, because, the High Court is the body familiar with the efficiency and quality of officers who are fit to be promoted as District Judges. The consultation is not to be an empty formality. The consultation or deliberation is not complete or effective before the parties thereto make their respective points of view known to the other or others and discuss and examine the relative merits of their views. It one party makes a proposal to the other who has a counter proposal in his mind which is not communicated to the proposer, the direction to give effect to the counter proposal, without anything more, cannot be said to have been issued after consultation [674 F-675 B] In the present case, the correspondence showed that whereas the High Court had definitely taken the view that respondent No. 3 as the senior Additional District arid Sessions Judge should take charge from the retiring District Judge the, Government was not of that view. But the Government never suggested to the High Court that the petitioner was senior to the 3rd respondent or that he had a better claim and as such was the person fit to be appointed temporarily :is District and Sessions Judge. Before issuing its notification dated October 17, 1968 the Government never attempted to ascertain the views of the High Court with regard to the petitioner's claim or gave the High Court any indication of its views with regard thereto. Therefore the Government notification cannot be sustained and as it was not valid, the High Court was within its rights to transfer the petitioner to another District, [674 C-F] State of Assam v. Ranga Mahammad and Ors. [1967] 1 S.C.R.

 [Desirability of avoiding misunderstanding between High Court and Government, and resolution of differences of opinion by mutual deliberation pointed out.]
