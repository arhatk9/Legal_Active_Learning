 One Dr. Miss Mitter who owned a house died leaving her mother and three sisters. The plaintiff respondent filed -a suit for a declaration that she was the owner of the house.
 Her case was that the deceased gave the house to Mrs. Momin another sister) by a will and Mrs. Momin in turn gifted the (house to the plaintiff. The case of Mrs. Judah, the defendant appellant was that Dr. Miss Mitter had bequeathed the house by a will in favour of her mother who in turn bequeathed the house to her by a will. Admittedly no probate of either of the wills alleged to have been made by Dr. Miss Mitter was taken out. The another died and it was alleged 295 that she had executed three wills one in favour of each of three daughters. Applications were filed by each of the daughters for letters of administration each claiming that the will in her favour was the last will of Mrs. Mitter.
 Each of the alleged wills include the house in question among the properties of the deceased. The application of the was granted while the other two application were Appeals were filed by the two sisters whose application were rejected. The appellate court while rejecting their claims for granting letters of administration in favour of the present appellant. The, appellant thereupon appealed to the Privy Council and; the Privy Council allowed her appeal.
 The respondent then filed the suit out of which the present appeal has arisen claiming a declaration that she was the owner of the house in whole or to the extent of two-thirds.
 The trial court found the defendant-appellant became the owner of the house under the will of Mrs. Mitter and the suit of the plaintiff-respondent was barred by res-judicata and estoppel. The plaintiff-respondent took the matter -in appeal to the High Court. The High Court held that as the will of Dr. Miss Mitter in favour of her mother was not probated the latter did not acquire the house under the will and therefore the mother alongwith her three daughters took equal share in the house. Since the appellant got the mother's share under her will and she had got one fourth share of the house in her own right she was entitled to one half share of the house in all. The appellant has come upto this Court on a a certificate granted by the High Court.
 Apart from the pleas of res-judicata and estoppel the appellant contended that it was not necessary to obtain probate of the will of Dr. Miss Mitter in favour of her mother in order to success. fully claim the house under the will of her mother in her favour.
 Held, that s. 218 of the Indian Succession Act is a have to the establishment of any right under a will by an execution or legatee unless probate or letters of administration have been obtained. This bar operates irrespective of the fact that the right is claimed by a plaintiff or a defendant in suit. The bar, is not restricted only to cases in which the claim is made by a person directly claiming as a legatee of executor but it applies also to any person who might find in necessary in order to establish the right of some legatee of executor from whom he might have derived title.
 Questions of title are not decided in proceedings for the grant of probate or letters of administration and therefore the decision given ill such proceedings cannot operate a 296 res-judicata in subsequent proceedings relating to the dispute title.
 Estoppel can arise as is clear from s. 115 Evidence Act when one person has by his declaration, act, or omission intentionally caused or permitted another person to believe a thing to be true and to act on such belief. No estoppel arose in the present case on the facts.
 Ghanshamdoss v. Gulab Bi Bai, (1927) I. L. R. 50 Med. 927, approved.
