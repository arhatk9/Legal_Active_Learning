 The respondent Company's tender for the movement and depositing of earth on the right dyke of the Hirakud Dam was provisionally accepted by the Government in December 1951.
 The work started in Fehr any 1952 and a formal contract was executed in March 1953. The earth work was done by manual labour for a year in the beginning and thereafter it was done to a large extent by machinery. The vertical movement was styled as "lift" and the horizontal movement as "lead".
 When the company started employing the heavy machinery from the beginning of 1953 onwards a number of ramps had to be constructed to enable the machinery to go up from the borrow pits to the dyke. After the work was completed, the respondent Company was paid a certain amount on the basis of a scale set out in the contract; but it claimed an addi- tional substantial sum in respect of lifts and extra leads and certain other items together with the interest on the amounts duo. It was provided in the contract that if the average lead mentioned bad to be exceed, the orders of the Chief Engineer in writing had to, be obtained by the contractor. The respondent Company claimed that it had 'sought the orders of the Chief Engineer in writing for the extra leads resulting from the conversion of lifts into leads and that although the Chief Engineer did not himself make any such order, the Superintending Engineer with whom the Company had been dealing did sign an order for the Chief Engineer. The contract provided for arbitration of disputes and differences. After the matter was taken up for arbitration, issues were framed by the arbitrator and considerable oral and documentary evidence was led by both the parties before him. On the basis of this evidence the arbitrator found that the tender must be taken to have been made and accepted on the basis that the whole work was to be done by manual labour; he believed the evidence of the Chief Engineer that he passed no order allowing any extra leads and eventually held that no further amount was payable by the Government to the Company. The respondent thereafter filed a plaint under Sections 30 and 33 of the Indian Arbitration Act, 1940, challenging the award on various grounds and praying for it to be set aside. The subordinate Judge who heard the ease set aside the award in March 1962.
 In an appeal to the High Court the two Judges who constituted the Division Bench gave dissenting judgments, i.e. one of them holding that the award could not be substained and the other one being of the view that the award was not liable to be set aside. The appeal was then heard by a third judge who held that the award was liable to be set aside on two of the issues; as he held these issues to be severable, he proceeded to set aside the award in res- On appeal to this Court, 185 
HELD : The appeal must be allowed and the order of the High Court setting aside the award in part must be reversed. The proceedings instituted by the respondent under Sections 30 and 33 of the Arbitration. Act must be dismissed.
 A bare perusal of the judgment of the third learned Judge of the High. Court clearly showed that he decided the matter as it he was entertaining an appeal against the award. He re-examined and reappraised the evidence which had been considered and believed by the arbitrator It was not open to the High Court to sit in appeal on the arbitrator's award.
 [189 C] Once it was found that under the terms of the contract the Order of the Chief Engineer in writing had to be obtained before the work involving additional leads was executed,- in the absence of any such written order it was not open to the court to hold that the appellant was liable for payment of extra leads by applying some principle or rule analogous to estoppel. Although it was true that the company had been writing to the Engineering Department in the matter and that the latter did not, for a considerable time, send any reply but the Company was debarred from asking for any additional payment in the absence of the Chief Engineer's order in writing. If the arbitrator came to that conclusion, it could not be said that there was any error apparent in his award which would justify setting aside. 1190 C]
