 The appellant was a Lance Naik in a military regiment. He was appointed as Granthi of a temple used by military personnel. While working as such he was charged with an offence under s. 376 of the Indian Penal Code. The police officer investigating offence held an identification parade with the permission of the military authorities and there- after the appellant was handed over to the civil authorities to stand his trial. The Assistant Sessions Judge convicted him. The Sessions Judge dismissed his appeal. The appellant then filed a criminal revision in the High Court where it was contended on his behalf that according to noti- fication dated November 28, 1962 issued by the Ministry of Defence, Government of India, the appellant must be considered to have been on active service on the material date and consequently the appellants' trial should have been before a court martial. It was further urged that if the Assistant Sessions Judge decided to proceed with the trial it was obligatory on him to have given notices to the Commanding Officer of The Army under s. 126(1) of the Army Act read with r. 4, and since these provisions had not been complied with the appellant's trial and conviction were null and void. The High Court dismissed the revision petition.
 With certificate the appellant appealed to this Court.
 
HELD : Since the appellant was alleged-to have committed rape in relation to a person who was not subject to military, naval or air law, under s. 70 of the Army Act he would be normally, triable by the ordinary criminal court but by virtue of notification dated November 28, 1962 he must be deemed to have been on active service on the material date. Therefore. this was a case where both the court martial and the ordinary criminal court had concurrent jurisdiction to try the appellant. [863 H] The provisions of the Army Act and the decisions of this Court make it clear that in respect of an offence which could be tried both by a criminal court as well as a court martial, ss. 125, 126 and- the rules have made suitable provisions to avoid a conflict of jurisdiction between the ordinary criminal court and the court martial. But it is to be noted that in the first instance the discretion is left to the officer mentioned in s 125 to decide before which court the proceedings should be instituted. Hence the officer commanding the army, army corps, division or inde- pendent brigade in which the accused person is serving, or such other officer as may be prescribed, will have to exercise his discretion and' decide under s. 125 in which court the proceedings shall be instituted.
 858 It is only when he has so exercises his discretion and decides that the proceedings should be instituted before the court martial that the provisions of s. 126(1) come into operation. If the designated officer does not exercise his discretion and decide that the proceedings should be instituted before a court martial the Army Act would not be in the way of criminal court exercising its ordinary jurisdiction in the manner provided by law. [865 H-866 C] In the present case surrender of the accused by the military authorities to the civil authorities to be dealt with the latter, after being made aware of the nature of the offence alleged against the appellant was clear indication that the decision of the military authorities was that the appellant need not be tried by a court martial and that his trial could take place before the criminal court. Under these circumstances there was no occasion to follow the procedure under s. 126 or r. 4 as the military authorities had made abundantly clear that the appellant need not be tried by the court martial. That being so it would have been altogether superfluous for the magistrate to give notice as required by the said provisions. [870 A-D] The High Court was therefore right in holding that there had been substantial compliance with the provisions of the Act and the rules and hence the trial of the appellant and his conviction by the Assistant Sessions Judge we're valid and legal.
