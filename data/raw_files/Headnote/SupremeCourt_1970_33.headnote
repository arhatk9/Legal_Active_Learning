 Certain disputes arose between the appellant and the respondent who were partners in a firm. After the respondent had sent to the appellant a notice for dissolution of the partnership, the appellant withdrew certain funds from the firm account. The respondent thereafter lodged a complaint against the appellant alleging criminal breach of trust within the meaning of Section 406 I.P.C. He also instituted a suit for the, dissolution of the partnership and for accounts. The. Additional Chief Presi- dency Magistrate issued summons to the appellant under Section 406. The appellant instituted proceedings in the High Court for quashing the criminal proceedings but the High Court rejected his prayer.
 On appeal to this Court, HELD: Dismissing the appeal:
 The offence of criminal breach of 'trust under section 406 of the Indian Penal Code is not in respect of property belonging to the partnership but is an offence committed by the person in respect of property which has been specially entrusted to such 'a person and which be holds in -a fiduciary capacity. [768 F] In the present case. the appellant denied that there was any special entrustment of any property or that he was holding any. property in 'a fiduciary capacity. It was neither possible nor desirable to express any opinion on the merits of such a plea. It was not possible to do so because the facts were not in possession of the court and furthermore the facts could not be before the court without proper investigation and enquiry. It was not desirable to do so because if any such opinion be expressed it might prejudice or embarrass either party. [768 G] R. P. Kapur v. State of Punjab, [1960] 3 S.C.R. 388;
