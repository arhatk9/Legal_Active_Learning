 The dispute between the appellants and the respondents, as to who were the bhumidars of certain properties, war, referred by the Consolidation Officer under the U.P.
 Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953, to the,Civil Judge, who referred it to an arbitrator appointed under the Apt. The arbitrator held that the respondents had no title as bhumidar , relying upon a judgment of the High Court, which, according to the arbitrator operated as res- judicata between the parties. That judgment was delivered in a suit instituted by the appellant's predecessor and the Present respondents for a declaration that a mortgage decree in favour of the defendant in that suit did not affect the shares of the respondents in the properties in dispute, and the High Court held that the appellant's predecessor alone was entitled to the properties, accepting the contention of the defendant in that suit that the respondents had no title whatsoever.
 The Civil Judge held that the award was manifestly wrong because, that judgment according to him did not operate as res-judicata between the parties. He therefore set aside the award and remitted the case to another arbitrator. The second arbitrator held that the appellant and respondents were cobhumidars and determined the shares of the parties holding that the judgment of the High Court did not operate as res judicata. This award was confirmed by the Civil Judge and the High Court agreed with the Civil Judge.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD: (a) If a judgment is to operate as res judicata between co- defendants it is necessary to establish (i) that there was a conflict of interest between the co-defendants, (ii) that it was necessary to decide the conflict in order to give relief to the plaintiff, and (iii) that the Court actually decided the question. There is no reason why a Previous decision could not operate as res judicata between co-plaintiffs also if these three conditions are satisfied mutatis mutandis. [467 H;.468 B-C] (b) In the judgment of the High Court which was relied upon as having operated as res judicata there was actual conflict of interest between the present appellant on the one hand and the present respondent on the other, they were the plaintiffs in that suit, and it was necessary to decide that conflict in order to give relief to the defendant in that suit; and the High Court decided that the properties belonged exclusively to the appellant's predecessor. The effect of that judgment is that the present respondents failed to-establish their contention that they had title to the properties. [467 F-H] (c) There was no finding by the arbitrator that by adverse possession the respondents had acquired title to the property at any time. [468 F] (d) The Provisions of Arbitration Act apply to proceedings before an arbitrator under the U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act. Therefore, if the judgment of the High Court operated in law as res judicata it would be an error of law apparent on the face of the award if it says that the judgment would not operate as res judicata. Hence, the Award in the present case was liable,to be set aside under s. 30 of the Arbitration Act. [468 F-H] (e) Under s. 39 of the Arbitration Act no appeal lies from an order remitting an award to an arbitrator under s. 16 of the Arbitration Act. Therefore, 465 the appellant could not have challenged the order when the Civil Judge set aside the first award and remitted the case to the arbitrator for passing a fresh award. Hence, there is no reason why the appellant should be precluded from challenging the correctness of that order in this appeal and getting relief on that basis. [469 B] (f) Since, in the circumstances of the case it would be an empty formality to remit the case again to the arbitrator the award of the first arbitrator is restored. [469 C].
