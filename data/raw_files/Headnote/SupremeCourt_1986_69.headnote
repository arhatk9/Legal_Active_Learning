 The appellant-tenant neither paid the arrears of rent in spite of verbal demand, notice of demand, and notice under s.106 of the Transfer of Property Act, nor vacated the premises. The landlord, therefore, filed a suit claiming arrears of rent and damages for the period of default as also pendente lite and future.
 The claim was resisted by the tenant contending that he was not a defaulter, that the landlord had refused to accept the rent tendered by him and that he deposited the same in the Court under s. 7C of the United Provinces (Temporary) Control of Rent and Eviction Act, 1947. The trial Court decreed the suit holding that the deposit of arrears of rent by the tenant was not a valid deposit and, therefore, it could not absolve the liability of the tenant from eviction inasmuch as the tenant had failed to establish that the landlord had refused to accept the tender made by him.
 The Additional Civil Judge allowed the appeal by the tenant and held that he was not a defaulter on account of the deposit made under s. 7C of the Act.
 In the second appeal by the landlord, the High Court set 462 aside the judgment and decree of the Lower Appellate Court as regards eviction and restored the decree of the trial Court.
 In the appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant-tenant: (i) that if the arrears of rent had been deposited with permission of the Court under s. 7C of the Act, it must be presumed that the landlord had refused to accept the rent tendered by the tenant; (ii) that as the landlord did not raise any objection in the proceedings under s. 7C he can neither question the validity of the order passed in those proceedings nor the Court can go into the question of validity of the deposits made; and (iii) that the First Appellate Court had recorded a finding of fact believing the statement of the tenant that the landlord had refused to accept the rent when tendered to him and also refused to accept the amount sent by money-order and this finding could not have been set aside by the High Court in second appeal.
 Dismissing the appeal and disposing of the Civil Miscellaneous Petition, ^ 
 HELD: 1. There is no error, much less a manifest error, for interference with the judgment of the High Court. [469 D-E] 
 2. The mere fact that an application under s. 7C for permission to deposit the arrear of rent has been allowed by the Munsif will not absolve the tenant from establishing before the Court, where the suit for eviction was filed that the landlord had refused to accept the rent lawfully tendered. The tenant must establish before the trial Court the factum of refusal by the landlord when the payment was sought to be made to him. [469 C-D] 
 3. Section 7C permits a tenant to deposit the arrears of rent in Court only under two conditions : (i) when the landlord refuses to accept any rent lawfully paid to him by the tenant in respect of any accommodation, and (ii) where any bona fide doubt or dispute has arisen as to the persons who were entitled to receive any rent referred to in sub-s.
 (1) in respect of any accommodation. If the deposit of arrears of rent was a valid deposit in accordance with the requirements of s. 7C certainly it will amount to payment to the landlord and the tenant will be absolved from the liability of being 463 evicted. But the Court itself cannot go into the question whether the landlord had refused to accept the rent paid lawfully or otherwise. If the Munsif had only to accept the application and accord permission to the tenant to deposit the arrears in Court merely on the basis that necessary allegations in the application as required by s. 7C had been made, he was not obligated to enquire whether the allegations were correct or not. However, the Court trying the suit for eviction cannot be precluded from enquiring about the validity of the permission under s. 7C. [467 C-F] 
 4. In the instant case, the finding of fact recorded by the First Appellate Court believing the statement of the tenant that the landlord had refused to accept the rent when tendered to him and also refused to accept the amount sent by money-order, is based on surmises and conjectures than on the basis of the material on record. Therefore, the High Court was fully justified in reversing this finding in second appeal as it was vitiated in law. The only evidence is the deposition of the tenant which the trial Court did not rely upon, and even the First Appellate Court did not categorically say that it believed the deposition of the defendant. Since the compliance of the ingredients of s. 7C had not been established, the tenant-appellant was liable to be evicted. [467 G; 469 A-B]
