 The appellant was a horse-breeder. On receipt of a notice under s. 10(2) of the U.P. Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings Act, 1960 he claimed exemption under s. 6(vii) of the Act on the ground that his farm was a specialised farm within the meaning of that sub-clause. The prescribed authority under the Act, the appellate court and the High Court in revision held against the appellant. In appeal by special leave, 
HELD:The sub-clause specially mentions two types of specialised farms, namely, those devoted to poultry-farming and dairying. As regards others it leaves them to be prescribed by rules under s. 44 of the Act. In this context it is impossible to read the word 'and' as 'or'. Rule 4(4) prescribes those specialised farms, but farms used for horse-breeding are not included. The appeal must therefore fail. [718F]
