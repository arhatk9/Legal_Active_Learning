 Where a person owns and maintains a private forest and sells trees of spontaneous growth therein but does not do anything towards the production of the trees or their uprooting, he is not a 'dealer' within the meaning of s. 2(viii) of the Kerala General Sales Tax Act, 1963. In order to fall within the definition, a person must sell goods produced by him by manufacture, agriculture, horticulture or otherwise. The intention of the Legislature in using the word 'produced' was to introduce an element of volition and effort involving the employment of some process for bringing into existence the goods. Trees which have grown spontaneously without any plantation by a person cannot be said to have been produced by him by agriculture or horticulture or 'otherwise', since the element of 'production is not present.
