 The U.P. High Court (Abolition of Letters Patent Appeals) Act came in-to force on November 13 1962. Section 3(1) of- the Act provided that no appeal arising from a suit or a proceeding instituted or commenced whether prior or subsequent to the enforcement of the Act, shall lie to the High Court from a judgment and order of one Judge of the High Court, made in exercise of appellate jurisdiction in respect of a decree or order made by a court subject to the superintendence of the High Court, anything to the contrary contained in cl. 10 of the, Letters Patent of Her Majesty dated 17th March 1866 read with cls, 17 of the U.P. High Court Amalgamation Order of 1948, or in 'any law, notwithstanding. In subs. (2) of the section an exception was made in the case of appeals pending before the, High Court on the date immediately preceding the date of en- forcement of the Act. The memorandum of appeal in Special Appeal No. 1880 of 1962 was presented in the High Court of Allababad on November 9, 1962. The High Court directed the payment of additional court fees and on that being done that memorandum was 'accented and registered in January 1963.
 Eventually, however the High Court held that the appeal was not saved by s. 3(2) of U.P. Act of 1962, since in view of s. 4 of the Court Fees Act the memorandum of appeal had no effect before the making good of the deficiency in court fees. In appeal by certificate, to this Court, the question for decision was whether there was an appeal pending before the High Court on November 12, 1962 i.e. tile date immediately preceding the date of the enforcement of Act 14 of 1962.
 
HELD : In considering the question as to the maintainability of an appeal when the court fee paid was insufficient to start with but the deficiency was made good later on, the provisions of the Court Fees Act and the Code of Civil Procedure have to be read together to form a harmonious whole and no effort should be made to give precedence to provisions in, one over those of the other unless the express words of a statute clearly override there of the other. In the present context this could only-be done by readings s. 149 of the Code of Civil Procedure as. a proviso to s. 4 of the Court Fees Act by allowing the deficiency to be made good within the period of time fixed by it. [261 F- H] Although there is no definition of the word "appeal" in the Code of Civil Procedure, it can be instituted by filing a memorandum of appeal as provided in O. 41, r. 1 of the Code.
 The filing of a memorandum of appeal therefore bring an appeal into existence; if the memorandum is deficient in court-fee, it may be rejected and if rejected, the appeal comes to an end. But if it is not rejected and time is given to the appellant 254 to make up the deficiency and this opportunity is availed of s. 149 of the Code which expressly provides that the document is to have validity with retrospective effect as if the deficiency had been made good in the first instance comes into play. By reason of the deeming provision in s.
 149 the memorandum of appeal is to have, full force and effect and the appeal has to be treated as one pending from the date when it was before the Stamp Reporter and the deficiency noted therein. [264 H; 265 D-H] Applying the above principle the bar of s. 3(1) of U.P. Act 14 of 1962 would not operate in the instant case since the appeal in question must be held to have been 'pending' within the meaning of s. 3(2). [265 D]
