 Section 187A of the Sea Customs Act provides that no court shall take cognizance of any offence relating to smuggling of goods punishable under Item 81 of the Schedule to s. 167 except upon a complaint in writing made by the Chief Customs Officer or any other officer of Customs not lower in rank than an Assistant Collector of Customs authorised by the Chief Customs Officer. Section 196A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, so far as relevant, provides that no court shall take cognizance of the offence of criminal conspiracy punishable under s. 120B of the IPC unless a Chief Presidency Magistrate has, by order in writing consented to the initiation of the proceeding.
 The appellant, who was Assistant Collector of Customs, sought the consent of the Chief Presidency Magistrate under s. 196A of the Code of Criminal Procedure for the prosecution of the respondents under s. 120B IPC as they were guilty of a conspiracy to commit offences under Item 81 of the Schedule to s. 167 of the Customs Act and s. 5 of Import and Exports (Control) Act. This was accorded. The appellant was authorised by the Chief Customs Officer to prosecute the respondents. A complaint was accordingly filed against them.
 In the course of proceedings before the Chief Presidency Magistrate, one of the respondents moved the High Court alleging that the Chief Presidency Magistrate had no power to give his consent because till the date of their prosecution the appellant was not an officer holding the authorisation envisaged in s. 187-A of the Act and that the Magistrate could not act under s. 196A of the Code unless an application was made to him by a person holding such authorisation.
 The High Court upheld the respondent's contention.
 It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the High Court erred in interpreting s. 196A so as to incorporate therein the provisions regarding authorisation enacted by s. 187A of the Act.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD : The authorisation contemplated by s. 187A of the Act, which could be given only in respect of complaints embracing offences under Item 81 of the schedule to s. 167 of the Act, was actually obtained by the appellant from the competent authority before the complaint was filed. The complaint cannot be said to be hit by the provisions of s.
 187A of the Act. [683 A-B] 680 Section 196-A of the Code does not envisage any application whatsoever and, therefore, no application at all is necessary for action under that section. Assuming that such an application was necessary it would not follow that the same had to be made by a person holding the type of authorisation envisaged by s. 187-A of the Act. Under s.
 196-A, there is no bar at all against the power of the Chief Presidency Magistrate to consent to the initiation of proceedings being exercised on an application made by any person, whether or not he is connected with the official machinery normally burdened with the duty of initiation of prosecutions. The status of the person who supplies facts is not relevant. [683 D-E] In the instant case the requirements of both the sections viz., s. 196A of the Code and s. 187-A of the Act were fulfilled before the complaint was filed and, therefore, there is no infirmity in the impugned proceeding.
