 Though the court would not grant relief to the plaintiff on a case for which there was no foundation in the pleadings and which the other side was not called upon or had no opportunity to meet, yet, when the alternative case which the plaintiff could have made was not only admitted by the defendant in his written statement but was expressly put forward as an answer to the claim which the plaintiff made in the suit. there would be nothing improper in giving the plaintiff a decree upon the case which the defendant himself makes. In such circumstances, when no injustice can possi- bly result to the defendant, it may not be proper to drive the plaintiff to a separate suit.
 The plaintiff brought a suit for specific performance of an agreement to sell a house alleging that he had paid Rs. 30,000 towards the price and had been put in possession in part performance of the contract, but the defendant pleaded that the amount of Rs. 30,000 was received as a loan and the plaintiff was put in possession only to facilitate payment of interest, and the court found that the defend- ant's plea was true: Held, that a decree could be passed in favour of the plaintiff for recovery of the sum of Rs.
 30,000 and interest remaining due under the agreement of loan pleaded by the defendant, even though the plaintiff had not set up such a case and it was even inconsistent with the allegations in the plaint.
