 Section 11 of the Hyderabad Jagirdar Settlement Act, 1952, enables a creditor or a Jagirdar (debtor) to move the Board under the Act for settlement of debts due by the Jagirdar.
 Such application should be made on or before June 30, 1953, the date notified under the section and if no such application was made the debt stood extinguished. Under s.
 25, if a suit or appeal or execution proceeding was pending in relation to such debt in any court it had to be transferred to the Board.
 The respondent-bank filed a suit in July 1956 against the appellants for recovery of Rs. 40,000/- and odd due in July 1954, on account of a cash and credit account opened by the appellants with the respondent. The suit was decreed. In December 1959, the bank filed an execution petition for executing the decree.
 On the question whether the execution petition should be transferred to the Jagirdar Debt Settlement Board under s.
 25(1) of the Act.
 HELD : There are two conditions for the applicability of s.
 
25. (a) The expression 'pending' in s. 25(1) must relate to proceedings which were pending on the notified date and could not take in any proceedings which came to be instituted after such date; and (b) The suit and other proceedings must be in respect of a debt with regard to which a Jagirdar or the creditor could make an application to the Board on or before the notified date. Thus, only those-debts which were due on or before the notified date from a debtor or in respect of which any proceedings were pending in any court or before the Board could be the subject-matter of the settlement by the Board. [142 E-H] Since both the conditions for the applicability of s. 25 of the Act were not satisfied in the present case the proceedings were not liable to be transferred. [143 B-C] Babibai thakuji v. Fazludin Usmanbai, I.L.R. [1954] Bom 535, approved.
 Since the liability of the principal debtor and the surety is a joint and several liability, a direction that the bank should proceed first against the principal debtor and only afterwards for any balance which could not be realised, against the surety, could not be granted. [144 A-B]
