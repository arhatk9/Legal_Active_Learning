 Article 254(2) of the Constitution is, in substance, a reproduction of s. 107(2) of the Government of India Act, 1935, the concluding portion whereof is incorporated in a proviso with further additions. The principle embodied therein is that when there is legislation covering the same ground both by the Centre and by the State, both of them being competent to enact the same, the law of the Centre should prevail over that of the State.
 Section 7 of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946, was amended in 1948 and 1949 and thereafter by Act LII of 1950.
 Held, that Act LII of 1950 is a legislation in respect of the same matter as Bombay Act (XXX VI of 1947) within the meaning of Art. 254(2) of the Constitution and therefore s.
 2 of Bombay Act XXXVI of 1947 cannot prevail as against s. 7 of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act as amended by Act LII of 1950.
 It is a well-settled rule of construction that if a later statute again describes an off once created by a previous one and imposes a different punishment or varies the procedure, the earlier statute is repealed by the later statute.
