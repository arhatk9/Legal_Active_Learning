 Under the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, while computing the income from business, an assessee was entitled to an allowance of depreciation at a percentage of the actual cost to the assessee or the written down value of the relevant asset owned by him, and used for the purposes of business.
 This Act was replaced by the Income-tax Act, 1961. Under both the Acts, `written down value' was defined with reference to `actual cost'. Initially between 1922 and 1952, the expression `actual cost' was defined to mean just the actual cost of the asset to the assessee. However,consequent on the decision of some of the High Courts that in ascertaining the actual cost of an asset to the assessee, it was immaterial that someone else had recouped the assessee, wholly, or in part, towards such cost, the 1922 Act was amended by the Income-tax Amendment Act of 1953, with effect from 1.4.1952, nullifying the effect of the aforesaid decision, and permitting only a limited exclusion. The Income-tax Act, 1961, however, directed the exclusion in the computation of the actual cost, of all amounts reimbursed to the assessee by any person whatsoever.
 The appellants in the appeals before this Court were all electric supply undertakings in various parts of the country. They had installed service connections during the relevant previous year to the assessment year 1962-63. A part of the expenditure incurred in connection with the installation of these lines was recovered by the companies from consumers of electricity. They claimed that the depreciation to be allowed for the assessment year 1962-63 and thereafter on the service connections installed in the previous years should be based only on the actual cost and written down value determined earlier, and there was no justification in disturbing the same. However, the Revenue was of the view that 118 though the assets had been acquired in earlier previous years, the statutory mandate of Section 43(b) was that the actual cost should be determined afresh for each assessment year and this, for assessment year 1962-63 onwards, could only be in accordance with the definition contained in the 1961 Act. Accordingly, it ignored the written down value of the assets as per the earlier record, computed the actual cost of the service lines by excluding therefrom the contributions of consumers, but gave credit thereafter for all depreciation allowed in respect thereof (on the basis of the higher actual cost as then determined) in all the earlier years.
 On appeal by the assesses, the concerned High Courts upheld the view of the Revenue and held that the actual cost of all assets for purposes of assessment year 1962-63 and onwards, whatever might have been the date of acquisition of the assets, had to be computed in accordance with the new formula laid down by the Income-tax Act, 1961.
 In the appeals before this Court, on behalf of the assessee companies it was contended that the interpretation of the Revenue approved by various High Court, would result in absurdities and anomalies, that the figure of the actual cost ascertained in respect of any asset in any of the earlier previous years could not be altered in a subsequent year, that both the 1922 Act as well as the 1961 Act envisaged a continuance of the figure of actual cost once arrived at in respect of any plant or machinery, throughout the life-time of such plant or machinery, that for the assessment year 1962-63, the question of determination of actual cost could arise only in respect of assets acquired during the relevant previous year under clause (a) of s.43(5), and so far as the assets which had been acquired in earlier previous year were concerned, depreciation had to be calculated on the basis of the written down value, and since the written down value in respect of these assets had already been ascertained for the assessment year 1961-62, all that had to be done further, to find out the written down value for the assessment year 1962-63, was to deduct therefrom the depreciation allowed for the assessment year 1961-62. It was further contended that though the actual cost as determined for the earlier years was not sacrosanct or untouchable and there may be circumstances in which it may have to be modified in the light of subsequent events, and changes in actual cost could be taken into account for purposes of the definition in s.43 (1) read with sub. sec.
 (6), in certain situations, the actual cost could not be altered merely because a subsequent legislation provided for a different formula for ascertainment of actual cost, and that formula could not be retrospect- 119 tively made applicable to assets which had been acquired much earlier and the actual cost of which had already been determined in accordance with the earlier prevalent law, that the legislation could not be given retrospective effect so as to affect existing rights, unless the legislation stated so expressly or by necessary implication, that there was an indication in the language of Section 43(6) itself to show that it was available to be invoked only in respect of assets which had been acquired in earlier years, and that if the intention had been that the actual cost of assets which had been acquired earlier to the previous year should also be covered, the legislature would have used the words "as had been met" that the Revenue's interpretation may lead to the computation of a negative written down value and consequent difficulties in applying various other statutory provisions, and that it was also incompatible with the terms of Explanations 2, 4 and 6 to Section 43(6), and would also lead to difficulties in the calculation of assessable profits under Section 41(2) or the allowance under Section 32(i)(iii).
 Dismissing the appeals, this Court, 
 HELD : 1.1 Though, in substance, depreciation on an asset for any assessment year is calculated on its written down value which is normally carried forward from an earlier assessment year, the phraseology of the Income Tax Act, 1961 does not bear out that the actual cost of the asset has to be determined only once, viz., in the previous year of its acquisition. S.43(6) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 specifically deals with two categories of assets: (i) those acquired during the relevant previous year and (ii) those acquired earlier to that. Even in respect of the latter class of assets, the Act envisages a computation of the actual cost of the asset and the deduction therefrom of all depreciation allowed in earlier years in respect of that asset. Thus, the first step, statutorily prescribed, for the determination of the written down value of any asset for any year, is for the Assessing Officer to determine its actual cost. This is a mandatory step which the Officer cannot be prevented from taking merely because the actual cost of the asset has already been determined in one or more earlier years, though it may be true that in ninety nine (and perhaps even more) percent of the cases, the result (barring mistakes and some special situations) will just be the equivalent of the written down value taken for the immediately preceding assessment year less the depreciation allowed for that year. [129B-E] 
 1.2 In the light of the clear language of the statute, it is not possible to accept that in the instant case, the Income Tax Officer had no justification to compute first the actual cost of an asset which had been 120 acquired before the previous year. Besides, whatever its validity over the period of continuous operation of the same Act (of 1922 or 1961) it can have no application for the assessment year 1962-63. There is no provision in the 1961 Act which permits or compels the adoption or continuance of the figure of Actual cost and written down value determined under the provisions of the earlier statute which has been repealed by the 1961 Act. Therefore, it cannot be accepted that the figure of actual cost ascertained in respect of any asset in any of the earlier previous years could not be altered in a subsequent year.

 2.1 The definition of the expression "actual cost" in S.43(1) envisages the computation of the actual cost of each asset, for every assessment year, not only in respect of assets acquired during the previous year but also in respect of assets acquired during the previous year. This naturally has to be done with reference to the factual or legal position that may prevail during the relevant previous year and can be taken into account for the relevant assessment year. The section does not say that the computation of the actual cost of the asset has to be based only on the facts or law as they stood at the time of acquisition of the asset and as could have been taken into account for the assessment year relevant to the previous year of acquisition. Once it is conceded that the figure of actual cost can require modifications it is not possible to confine such modifications to only three situations viz., (a) subsequent factual occurrences, which called for a modification of the figure of actual cost as at the time of acquisition determined earlier; (b) discovery of arithmetical errors in the earlier computation of the actual cost or written down value of any asset; and (c) redetermination of the original actual cost necessitated by a specifically retrospective statutory provision. [131B-D, 130B-C] 
 2.3 Where subsequent information - factual or legal reveals that the actual cost determined originally was wrong, there can be no doubt that the original figure of actual cost has to be altered, if need be, and, if possible, by reopening the earlier assessments and, if that be not be possible, at least for the future. [131E] Maharana Mills v. I.T.O., [1959] 36 I.T.R. 350, referred to.
 
 2.4 There are clearly situation in which the actual cost does get 121 altered prospectively and not retrospectively. One such instance is where the cost of an asset increases or decreases on account of a fluctuation in the value of the currency. Another situation would be where, subsequent to the acquisition of the asset, substantial capital expenditure has been incurred thereon (not amounting to the addition of a separate asset on which depreciation etc.
 could be independently allowed). Such expenditure is added, under the rules, in practice to the actual cost and allowance given thereon subsequently. Therefore, it cannot be accepted that the actual cost cannot be determined year after year on the factual or legal position applicable for the relevant previous year and that the actual cost once determined cannot be altered except in the aforesaid three situations, where the original figure itself requires a modification .

 3.1 The rule as to the prospective application of statutes is wellsettled. A retrospective operation is not to be given to a statute as to impair an existing right or obligation otherwise than as regards a matter of procedure, unless that effect cannot be avoided without doing violence to the language of the enactment. If the enactment is expressed in language which is fairly capable of either interpretation, it ought to be construed as prospective only.

 3.2 The instant case is not at all a case of retrospective operation of the statute. It is not the case of the revenue that the actual cost as determined in the assessment year 1962-63 should be applied to revise the computations for earlier years. All that the department says is that, though in respect of these particular assets the assess might have obtained depreciation for earlier assessment years on the basis of a higher figure, that will no longer be available in future and that the figure of actual cost should be taken not as was originally calculated but only at a lower figure for the assessment years 1962-63 and onwards. It is just the case of a provision, a part of the requisites for the operation of which is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing.[134G, 135A-B] 3.3. The interpretation of the Revenue does not operate against the well-known principle that retrospective operation-assuming that the provision has a retrospective effect-should not be presumed where existing or part rights are interfered with. [137A] 122 4.1 There is no doubt or ambiguity about the provision.
 It is clear and explicit, that the actual cost has to be determined, in each assessment year, even of assets acquired before the commencement of the previous year relevant to the assessment year. Not only is this intention plain and clear, it does not create any injustice or hardship; on the contrary, it is only reasonable and just. The object of the provision dealing with the grant of depreciation is, generally speaking, to enable an assessee to get the capital expenditure incurred by him in acquring the asset written off to his profits over the years though it is true that, in certain situations, the statute specifically relaxes this rigidity. In earlier years, he had been obtaining depreciation on a particular footing. But the language used lent itself to an interpretation that he could get a deduction even in respect of expenditure he did not incur.
 There is no doubt about the correctness of this interpretation. [137B-C] 4.2. Where a person purchases an asset, it may be correct to say that the cost of the asset does not change because a part of the cost is met by some one else. But the legislature had to decide whether an assessee should be allowed to claim an allowance of depreciation in respect of the asset on the artificial basis of the cost of the asset rather than what he has actually spent to acquire that asset and whether the wording of the original provision as interpreted by courts, had not conferred an undue advantage or benefit on the assessee. This was not considered by the legislature to be equitable and, therefore, it was altered by legislation. It accords with reason that the provision should be interpreted to say that, at least after the amendment, the assessee should not be allowed depreciation on the basis of the earlier figure of actual cost. It is, therefore, incorrect to describe this provision as creating any undue hardship or injustice or inconvenience to an assessee. [137D-F] Govind Das v. I.T.O. [1976] 103 I.T.R. 123 at p.132, distinguished.
 
 5.1 When an assessee acquires an asset, he does not acquire a right to obtain depreciation thereon equal to the actual cost of the asset a s originally determined for tax purposes. The effect of clause (c) of proviso to Section 10(2) (vi) of the 1922 Act and Section 34(3) of the 1961 Act is that, while allowing depreciation in respect of any asset, the officer should be careful to see that the aggregate of the depreciation allowed to the assessee in respect of that asset does not exceed the actual cost of the asset. In other words, as and when the provision is applied for each and every assessment year and the depreciation on any asset is calculated, it should be ensured that the depreciation allowed does not exceed the actual cost of the asset. The `actual cost' referred to is not the actual cost as originally determined at the time of the acquisition.
 [136B-D] 123 
 5.2 Thus, in the instant cases, while examining whether a particular asset is entitled to any depreciation for the assessment year 1962-63, the officer will find that it has already secured depreciation much more than the actual cost of the asset as determined by him and will grant no further depreciation in respect thereof. It is no doubt true that in past years the asset had become eligible to amounts of depreciation the aggregate of which exceeds the actual cost as presently determined and, if that depreciation is deducted from the actual cost subsequently arrived at, a negative figure may result. But such a situation will arise even in the category of cases in which the revision of actual cost is permissible [136E] 5.3. In the instant case, there was no negative written down value in earlier years and, equally, there will be none in the year of revision as the effect of the proviso is not to produce a negative written down value but only to preclude further grant of depreciation on the asset in future. Read thus a limitation on the maximum amount of depreciation that an assessee can claim in respect of a particular asset, there is no question of arriving at a negative written down value. [136G] 
 5.4 The use of the words "has been met" is very appropriate and proper in the present context once the mechanics of the provision are understood. It is incontrovertible that, under S. 43(1) read with S. 43(6) the officer has to determine the actual cost for all assets, new and old, and the definition in S. 43(1) only requires that, at the time of doing so, he has to examine whether the actual cost has been fully laid out by the assessee or has been met by some one else in whole or in part. The words "has been met" squarely fit into this reading of the section and the use of the words "has been met" does not restrict the definition in S. 43(1) to assets acquired in the previous year. [138D-E] Carson v. Carson and Stoyek, [1964]1 All England Law Reports 681, referred to.
 
 5.5 The proviso to clause (c) really places a limitation on the depreciation deductible at any point of time and hence, there can never be a negative written down value. Explanations 2 and 4 to Section 43(6) fall in line with the interpretation favoured by the Revenue once it is understood that the reference to "depreciation actually allowed" should be read subject to the limitation of clause (c) of proviso to S. 10(2) (vi). Explanation 6 offers no difficulty as the relationship as "parent" and "subsidiary" between the companies involved in the transfer for the purposes of this clause has to be determined as at the time of the transfer 124 of the asset and will not be a wobbling or fluctuating one.
 [138G-H, 139A] 
 5.6 There is no difficulty or anomaly resulting from the Revenue's interpretation in the Calculation of assessable profits under Section 41(2) or the allowances under Section 32(1)(iii). [139B, E] Birmingham Corporation v. Barnes [1935] 3 I.T.R. Supp.
