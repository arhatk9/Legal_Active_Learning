 Section 5(2) of the Uttar Pradesh Consolidation Act enacts, inter alia, that upon the issuance of a notification under sub-section (2) of section 4 "every suit or proceedings in respect of declaration of rights or interest in any land lying in the area" "shall on an order being passed in that behalf by the court or authority before whom such suit or proceeding is pending, stand abated." The appellant is the tenure holder of a large area of land.
 Since the appellant did not file a statement of its holding as required by s. 9 of the U.P. Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings Act. the Prescribed Authority under the Act served on it a statement prepared under section 10 in respect of its holdings. The appellant filed objections to the statement indicating the plots it wanted to retain as its ceiling area. The Prescribed Authority did not accept the appellant's choice wholly. While the proceedings were pending before the authorities under the Ceiling Act consolidation proceedings were initiated in respect of appellant's lands under the Consolidation Act. A large number of persons filed claims to the plots of the appellant before the consolidation authorities. The appellants thereupon filed applications before the authorities under the Ceiling Act for stay of the proceedings under the Ceiling Act. These were rejected. In- a writ petition the High Court accepted the contention of the appellant that the authorities under the Ceiling Act should have accepted entirely the choice of plots which it wanted to retain as the ceiling area and directed the authorities to decide the matter afresh. The High Court also directed that the proceedings before the Consolidation Authorities would remain stayed during the continuance of the proceedings under the Ceiling Act. On the question whether the proceedings under the Ceiling Act are "in respect of declaration of rights or interest in any land lying in the area," within the meaning of that expression in s. 5(2), 
HELD : Allowing the appeal, that the proceedings under the Ceiling Act were abated under s. 5(2) of the Consolidation Act.
 (i)The Prescribed Authority acting under Ss. 10(2) and 12 of the Ceiling Act is an "authority" within the meaning of that expression in s. 5(2). [256E-F] (ii)Section 5(2) will not apply where a tenure holder voluntarily files a statement of his holdings under section 9 and there is no dispute about the right or interest in the holdings, or when the tenure holder accepts the statements sent to him by the Prescribed Authority under s. 10. But where the tenure holder does not voluntarily file a statement under s. 9 and claims that he is not the tenure bolder of all or some of the plots' included in the statement prepared under s. 10 there ensues a dispute about a right or interest in land and there is adversary proceedings between him and the government. The prescribed authority decides under s. 12 whether the tenure holder has any right or interest in all or some of the plots, and those plots in which he has no right or interest are excluded from the statement served on him under s. 10. This is the very question in issue before the Consolidation Authority under the Consolidation Act. If the claims made to the appellant's plots pending under the Consolidation Act are allowed a large area of land included in the statement under S. 10 of the Ceiling Act Bill have to be excluded from consideration by the prescribed Authority. Therefore. non- stay of proceedings under the Ceiling Act would cause hardship to the appellant. As soon as consolidation operations are closed the proceeding under the Ceiling Act may be resumed. [256H] (iii)The purpose of the non obstante clause in s. 49 is to exclude the operation of any other overlapping Act.
 Section 5(2) and 49 indicate clearly 254 that the proceedings in the instant case are to be abated under s. 5(2). Further, the absence of a provision like s.
 48A in relation to the jurisdiction of the Prescribed Authority under the Ceiling Act lends support to this inference. [258A]
