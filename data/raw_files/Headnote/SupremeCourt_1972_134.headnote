 The petitioner was detained in pursuance of an order under the .Maintenance of Internal Security Act 26 of 1971. The order of detention was passed by the District Magistrate on August 24, 1971. The order was approved by the State Government under s. 3(3) of the Act on September 4, 1971.
 The petitioner who was absconding after the making of the detention order was arrested on September 9, 1971. Soon after he was served with grounds of detention. On October 7, 1971 a representation made by the petitioner was received in the offices of the State Government. The representation was rejected by the State Government on November 17, 1971.
 On the same date the Advisory Board before which the representation had been placed by the Stale Government under s. 10 of the Act reported that there was sufficient ,cause for the petitioner's detention. On November_ 26, 1971 the State Government confirmed the order of detention in exercise of its powers under s. 12(1) of the Act. In a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution the petitioner urged that (i) the theft of overhead copper-wire by him mentioned in the grounds of detention was an offence under the Indian Penal Code which could be tried under the ordinary law; (ii) there was undue delay in the consideration of his representation by the State Government which rejected it only on November 17, 1971 ;after having received it on October 7, 1971.
 Dismissing the petition, 
HELD : (i) Undoubtedly the State Government could if it had chosen, have proceeded to put the ordinary criminal law in motion. But conditions in West Bengal were far from normal when the act, imputed to the petitioner were committed.
 Wagon breaking and removal of overhead traction wire posed a major problem to the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community. If therefore the authorities concerned felt that the trial of such cases under the ordinary law of the land would not meet the requirements of the situation and particularly, in the case of activities of the kind mentioned in the grounds which were committed in the middle of the night when there could be 'few eye witnesses and even those who viewed such incidents would be apprehensive of their own safety if they were asked to give evidence against such dangerous persons who went about arm- ing themselves with swords and daggers not only to prevent their apprehension but also to terrorise persons who might feel inclined to put up any obstruction, the State would not be unjustified in proceeding in the way it did. [555 G-556 B] No doubt the removal of overhead traction wire would be a case of theft but that is not to say that such removal would not also be 553 prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community, specially when indulged in on a large scale. [556 C] (ii)The alleged delay in the consideration of the Petitioner's representation by the State Government did not render the detention illegal under the provisions of the Act or of the Constitution. The Act does not make it obligatory on the State Government itself to consider the representation of the detenu but makes it obligatory on the part of the State Government to place the case I before the Advisory Board along with the representation if any made by the person affected by the order. Although s. 15 of the Act gives the appropriate government power to release a detenu for a temporary period with or without conditions, the Act does not empower the Government to release ,a detenu finally except after the report of the Advisory Board.
 [560 H-561 D] Further, the detenu made no grievance in his writ petition about the delay in the consideration of his representation.
 if any such plea had been taken the Court would have had to consider whether Government had any explanation to offer for the delay. In this case the Government had approved of the order of detention as early as September 4, 1971 and submitted the report to the Central Government. There was nothing in the representation of the petitioner apart front the bare denial of his commission of any offence which necessitated the immediate consideration of his representation. As the Act did not empower the Government to release the detenu on the strength of the representation without sending the matter to the Advisory Board,the Government's consideration of the representation, after its prior approval of the detention order would have little significance or import.
