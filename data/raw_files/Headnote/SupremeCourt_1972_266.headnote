 The Import Control Order 1955 passed by the Central Government under ss. 3 and 4A of the Imports and Exports Control Act 1947 laid restrictions on the import of newsprint. As an essential commodity newsprint was also subject to control under s.3 of the Essential Commodities Act 1955. The Newsprint Control Order 1962 was passed under s. 3 of the Essential Commodities Act. Sub-clause 3 of clause 3 of the 1962 Order states that no consumer of newsprint shall in any licensing period consume or use newsprint in excess of quantity authorised by the Controller from time to time. Sub-clause 3A of clause 3 states that no consumer of newsprint other than a publisher of text books of general interest shall use any kind of paper other than newsprint except with the permission in writing of the Controller. Sub-clause (5) of Clause 3 of the 1962 Order states that in issuing an authorisation under this clause the Controller shall have regard to the principles laid down in the Import Control Policy with respect to newsprint announced by the Central Government from time to time. The newsprint Policy for 1972-73 was challenged in this Court in petitions under Art. 32 of the Constitution. The questions that fell for consideration were : (i) whether the petitioners being companies could invoke fundamental rights;
 (ii) whether Art. 358 of the Constitution was a bar to any challenge by the petitioners on violations of fundamental rights; (iii) whether the restriction on newsprint import under the 1955 Order was violative of Art. 19(1) (a) of the Constitution; (iv) whether the newsprint Policy fell within clause 5(1) of the Import, Control Order 1955 and was valid;
 (v) whether clauses 3 and 3A of clause 3 of the 1962 Newsprint Order were violative of Arts. 19,(1) (a) and 14 of the Constitution; (vi) whether Remarks V, VII(a), VII(c), VIII, and X of the Newsprint Policy for 1972-73 were violative of Arts. 19(1) (a) and 14 of the Constitution because of the following objectionable features : (a) No new paper or new edition could be started by a common ownership unit (i.e., a newspaper establishment or concern owning two or more news interest newspapers including at least one daily) even within the authorised quota of newsprint; (b) there was a limitation on the maximum number of pages to 10, no adjustment being permitted between circulation and the pages so as to increase the pages; (c) no interchangeability was permitted between different papers of common ownership unit or different editions of the same paper; (d) allowance of 20 per cent increase in page level up to a, maximum of 10 had been given to newspapers with less than 10 pages; (e) a big newspaper was prohibited and prevented from increasing the number of pages, page areas, and periodicity by reducing circulation to meet its requirement even within its admissible quota; (f) there was discrimination in entitlement between 758 newspapers with an average of more than 10 pages as compared with newspapers of 10 or less than 10 pages.
 Allowing the petitions, 
HELD: Per Majority (Sikri. C.J., Rayand Jaganmohan Reddy, JJ.) (1)The Bank Nationalization case has established the view that the fundamental rights of shareholders as citizens are not lost when they associate to form a company When their fundamental rights as shareholders are impaired by State action their rights as shareholders are protected. The reason is that the shareholders' rights are equally and necessarily affected if the rights of the company are affected. The rights of shareholders with regard to Article 19(1) (a) are projected and manifested by the newspapers owned and controlled by the shareholders through the medium of the Corporation. [773C-D] In the present case the individual rights of freedom of speech and expression of editors,Directors and Shareholders are all expressed through their newspapers through which they speak. The locus standi of the shareholder petitioners is beyond challenge after the ruling of this Court in the Bank Nationalisation case., The presence of the company is on the same ruling not a bar to the grant of relief. [773D- F] (ii)The present- petitions which were originally filed to challenge the Newsprint Policy for 1971-72 were amended to challenge the 1972-73 policy. The impeached policy was a continuation of the old policy. Article 358 does not apply to executive action taken during the emergency if the same is a continuation of the prior executive action or an emanation of the previous law which prior executive action or previous law would otherwise be violative of Art. 19 or be otherwise unconstitutional. [774 F, G, H] Executive action which is unconstitutional is not unusual during the proclamation of emergency. During the proclamation Art. 19 is suspended. But it would not authorise the taking of detrimental executive action during the emergency affecting the fundamental rights in Art. 19 without any legislative authority or in purported exercise of power conferred by any pre-emergency law which was invalid when enacted. [775A-B] (iii)The power of the Government to import newsprint cannot be denied. The power of the Government to control the distribution of newsprint cannot equally be denied.
 This Court cannot adjudicate on such policy measures unless the policy is alleged to. be mala fide. The Court could also not go into the dispute as to the quantity of indigenous newsprint available for newspapers. [776D; 776E] (iv)The records with regard to the making and publication of the news print policy for 1972-73 showed that the policy was published under the authority of the Cabinet decision.
 The policy was therefore validly brought into existence.
 (v) Although Art. 19(1) (a) does not mention the freedom of the Press, it is the settled view of this Court that freedom of speech and expression includes freedom of the Press and circulation. The Press has the right of free propagation and free circulation without any previous restraint on publication. If a law were to single out the press for laying down prohibitive burdens on it that would restrict the circulation, penalise its freedom of choice as to personnel, prevent newspapers from being started and compel the press to Government aid, this would violate Art. 19(1) (a) and would fall outside the Protection afforded by Art.
 19(2).
 [777B-D] 759 The concept of regulation of fundamental rights borrowed and extracted from American decisions cannot be accepted. The American First Amendment contains no exceptions like our Art. 19(2) of the Constitution. This Court has established freedom of the press to speak and express. That freedom cannot be abridged and taken away by the manner the impugned policy has done. [783B; 784C] (vi)A newspaper control policy is ultra vires the Import Control Act and the Import control Order. The machinery of Import Control cannot be utilised to control or curb circulation or growth or freedom of newspapers in India.
 The pith and substance doctrine is used in ascertaining whether the Act falls under one Entry while incidentally encroaching upon another Entry. Such a question does not arise here., The Newsprint Control Policy is found to be newspaper control order in the guise of framing an Import Control Policy for newsprint. [780H; 781A-B] (vii)This Court in the Bank Nationalisation case laid down two tests. First it is not the object of the authority making the law impairing the right of the citizen nor the form of action that determines the invasion of the right.
 Secondly, it is the effect of the law and the action upon the right which attracts the jurisdiction of the court to grant relief. The direct operation of the Act upon the rights forms the real test. [781C-D] An examination of the provisions of the newsprint policy indicates how the petitioner's fundamental rights had been infringed by the restrictions on page limit, prohibition against new newspapers and new editions. The effect and consequence of the impugned policy upon the newspapers is directly controlling the growth and circulation of newspapers. The direct effect is the restriction upon circulation of newspapers., The direct effect is upon growth of newspapers through pages. The direct effect is that newspapers are deprived of their area of advertisement. The direct effect is that they are exposed to financial loss.
 The direct effect is that freedom of speech and expression is infringed. [782B-C] (viii)It is indisputable that by freedom of the press is meant the right of all citizens to speak, publish and express their views. The freedom of the press embodies the right of the people to read. The freedom of the press is not antithetical to the right of the people to speak and express.
 [782G] (ix)In the present case fixation of page limit will not only deprive the petitioners of their economic vitality but also restrict the freedom of expression by reason of the compulsive reduction of page level entailing reduction of circulation and demanding the area of coverage for news and views. [790D-E] If as a result of reduction in pages the newspapers will have to depend on advertisements as the main source of their income, they will be denied dissemination of news and views.
 That will also deprive them of their freedom of speech and expression. On the other hand if as a result of restriction on page limit the newspapers will have to sacrifice advertisements and thus weaken the limit of financial strength, the Organisation may crumble., The loss on advertisements may not only entail the closing down but also affect the circulation and thereby infringe on freedom of speech and expression. [790F-G] (x)The impeached policy violates Art. 14 because it treats newspapers which are not equal equally in assessing the needs and requirements of newsprint. The 7 newspapers which were operating above 10 page level are placed at a disadvantage by the fixation of 10 page limit and entitle- ment to quota on that basis. There is no intelligible differentia.
 [791H; 792A-B] 760 The basic entitlement in Remark V to quota for newspapers operating above 10 page level violates Article 19(1)(a) because the quota is hedged in by direction not increase the page number above 10. The reduction of page limit to 10 for the aforesaid reasons violates Article 19(1)(a) and Article 14 of the Constitution. [792C] (xi)Under Remark VII(C) those-newspapers within the ceiling of 10 pages get 20 per cent increase in the number of pages.
 They require circulation more than the number of pages.
 They are denied circulation as a result of the policy., The big English dailies which need to increase their pages are not permitted to do so. Other dailies which do not need increase in pages are permitted quota. for increase but they are denied the right of circulation. This is not newsprint control but newspaper control. [792F-G] (xii)Discrimination is apparent from Remark VII in the newsprint Policy for 1972-73 by which newspapers with less than 1,00,000 circulation have been given 10% increase in circulation whereas those with more than 1,00,000 circulation have been given only 3% increase in circulation. [795C-D] (xiii) The first part of Remark VIII prohibits increase in pages by reducing circulation. in the past adjustability between pages and circulation was permitted.
 The individual requirements of different dailies render it eminently desirable in some cases to increase the number of pages than circulation. The denial of this flexibility or adjustment is rightly said to hamper the quality, range and standard of the dailies and to affect the freedom of the press. Big dailies are treated to be equal with newspapers who are not equal to them thus violating Art. 14. [793E-F] (xiv) The second prohibition in Remark VIII prevented common ownership units from adjusting between them the newsprint quota alloted to each of them. The prohibition is to use the newsprint quota of one newspaper belonging to a common ownership unit for another newspaper belonging to that unit. Newsprint is allotted to each paper. The news- paper is considered to be the recipient. A single newspaper will suffer if common ownership units are allowed to adjust quota within their group. [794 B; & D] (xv) Under Remark X a common ownership unit could bring out a newspaper or start a new edition of an existing paper even from their allocated quota. it is an abridgment of the freedom of expression to prevent a common ownership unit from starting a new edition or a new newspaper. A common ownership unit should be free to start a new edition out of their allotted quota and it would be logical to say that such a# unit can use the allotted quota for changing the page structure and circulation of different editions of the same paper. Newspapers however cannot be permitted to use allotted quota for starting a new newspaper. Newspapers will have to make necessary application for allotment of quota in that behalf. It will be open to the appropriate authorities to deal with the application in accordance with law. [794G-H] (xvi) The liberty of the press remains an Ark of the Covenant. The newspapers give the people the freedom to find out which ideas are correct. Therefore the freedom of the press is to be enriched by removing the restrictions on page limit and allowing them to have new editions of newspapers. [796A-C] (xvii) The Press is not exposed to any mischief of monopolistic combination. The newsprint policy is not a measure to combat monopolies.
 761 The newsprint policy should allow the newspapers that amount of freedom of discussion and information which is needed or will appropriately enable the members of the society to preserve their political expression of comment not only upon public affairs but also upon the vast range of views and matters needed for free society. [797D-F] (xix) Clause 3(3A) of the 1962 Order provides that no consumer of newsprint other than a publisher of text books of general interest shall use any kind of page other than newsprint except with the permission of the Controller. It was therefore wrong to say that it was open to newspapers to make unrestricted use of any form of paper so long as news- papers did not apply for newsprint. [798F] (xx) In the result the provisions in remarks V, VII(a), VII(C) and VIII of the Policy being violative of Arts. 14 & 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution must be struck down as unconstitutional. The prohibition in Remark X against common ownership unit from starting a new newspaper periodical or a new edition must be declared unconstitutional and struck down as violative of Art. 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution.

 Per Beg J. (concurring) The ambit of the conditions in a licence cannot under the provisions of the Imports and Exports Control Act, after newsprint has been imported under a licence, extend to laying down how it is to be utilized by a newspaper concern for its own genuine needs and businesses because this would ?.mount to control of supply of news by means of newsprint instead of only regulating its import.
 [833C-D] The relevant enactments and orders seem to authorise only the grant of licences for particular quotas to those who run newspapers on the strength of their needs, assessed on the basis of their past performances and future requirements and other relevant data, but not to warrant an imposition of further conditions to be observed by them while they are genuinely using the newsprint themselves in the course of carrying on a legitimate and permissible occupation and business. The impugned restrictive conditions thus appear to go beyond, the scope of the Essential Commodities Act 1955 as well as the imports & Exports (Control) Act, 1947.
 Nor could any legal 762 authority be found for them in the provisions of the Press Books Act 1867, Registration of Newspapers (Central Rules) 1956, and Press Council Act, 1965, to which reference was made. [833D-G] Therefore the argument put forward on behalf of the petitioners that after the allocation of quotas of newsprint to each set of petitioners, on legally relevant material, the further restrictions sought to be imposed, by means of the notified newsprint control policy, on the actual mode of user of newsprint for publication of information or views by the licensees, similar to those which were held by this Court in Sakai Papers case to be invalid, are not covered by any law in existence, had to be accepted. Hence it was not even necessary to consider whether they were reasonable restrictions warranted by either Art. 19 (2) or Art. 19 (6) of the Constitution. They must first have the authority of some law to support them before the question of considering whether they could be reasonable restrictions on fundamental rights of the petitioner could arise. [833H-834B] Per Mathew J. (dissenting) (1) Art. 19 (1) (a) guarantees to the citizens, the fundamental right of the freedom of speech and Art, 19(2) enumerates the type of restrictions which might be imposed by law. It does not follow from this that freedom of expression is not subject to regulations which may not amount to, abridgment. It is a total misconception to say that speech cannot be regulated or that every regulation of speech would be anabridgment of the freedom of speech. No freedom however absolute, can be free from regulation. Though the right under Art. 30(1) is in terms absolute, this Court said in In Re the Kerala Education Bill 1957, ([1959] S.C.R. 995), that the right is subject to reasonable regulation. [803F-G] (ii) If, on account of scarcity of newsprint, it is not possible, on an equitable, distribution to allot to the petitioners, newsprint to the extent necessary to maintain the present circulation of the newspapers or their page level has to be reduced, it cannot be contended that there has been abridgment of freedom of speech. Surely the reduction in the page level or circulation is the direct result of the diminished supply of newsprint. Yet it cannot be said that there is an abridgment of the freedom of speech of the petitioners. There might be an abridgment of speech, but not an abridgment of the freedom of speech. [807C-D] (iii) The pith and substance test, although not strictly appropriate, might serve a useful purpose in the process of deciding whether the provisions in question which work some interference with the freedom of speech are essentially regulatory in character. [807C-D] (iv) The crucial question today, as regards Art. 14, is whether the command implicit in it constitutes merely a bar on the creation of inequalities existing without any contribution thereto by State action. It has been said that justice is the effort of man to mitigate the inequality of man. The whole drive of the directive principles of the Constitution is toward this goal and it is in consonance with the new concept of equality. The only norm which the Constitution furnishes for distribution of the material resources of the community is the elastic norm of the common good [see Art. 39(b)]. It cannot be said that the principle adopted for the distribution of newsprint is not for the common good. [816C-F] That apart one of the objects of the Newsprint policy was to remedy the inequality created by the previous policies and to enable the dailies having less than 10 pages attain a position of equality with those operating on a page level of 10 or more.. The allowance of 20 per cent 763 increase for growth in the page level provided in Remark VII is based on a classification and that classification is grounded on an intelligible differentia having a nexus to the object sought to be achieved. [816G] (v) If the entitlement of a consumer of newsprint is calculated on the basis of page-level and circulation of the newspaper it would be an integral part of any system of rationing to tell the consumer that he should maintain the page level and circulation of the paper. The provision in Remark VIII does not say that the proprietor or publisher of a newspaper should reduce its circulation. The provision in effect only tells the proprietor/ publisher of the newspaper "maintain the circulation at the present level or increase it if you like by reducing the page level." This would not amount to an abridgment of the freedom of speech. [817 D & F] (vi) Under the theory of the freedom of speech which recognises not only the right of the citizens to speak but also the right of the community to hear, a policy for the distribution of newsprint for maintenance of circulation at its highest possible level as it furthers the right of the community to hear, will only advance and enrich that freedom. [819D] (vii) It is difficult to understand how the fixation of a maximum page level of 10 for calculation of quota of newsprint would offend the fundamental right of freedom of speech of the petitioners. The freedom of speech does not mean a right to obtain or use an unlimited quantity of newsprint., Art. 19(1) (a) is not the "guardian of unlimited talkativeness." [814F-G] (viii) It is settled by the decision of this Court in Hamdard Dawakhana ([1960] 2 S.C.R. 671) that commercial advertisement does not come within the ambit of the freedom of speech guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(a). Curtailment of speech occasioned by rationing of newsprint due to its scarcity can only affect freedom of speech indirectly and consequently there would be no abridgment of it. [815B-C] (ix) The Government may under cls. 3 of the Imports (control) Order, 1955 totally prohibit the import of newsprint and thus disable any person from carrying on a business in newsprint, if it is in the general interest of the public not to extend any foreign exchange on that score.
 If the affirmative obligation to expend foreign exchange and permit the import of newsprint stems from need of the community for information and the fundamental duty of Government to educate the people as also to satisfy the individual need for self expression, it is not for the proprietor of a newspaper alone to say that he will reduce the circulation of the newspaper and increase its page level, as the community has an interest in maintaining or increasing circulation of newspapers.. The claim to enlarge the volume of speech at the expense of circulation is not for exercising the freedom of speech guaranteed by Art.
 19(1) (a) but for commercial advertisement for revenue which will fall within the ambit of that subarticle. [820B-E] (x) The printer or publisher of each newspaper owned by a common ownership unit is a separate consumer and it is to that consumer that the quota is allotted. The application for quota made by the common ownership unit specifies the entitlement of each newspaper owned by it, and quota is granted to each newspaper on that basis. If it were opened to a common ownership unit to use the quota allotted for one newspaper owned by it for another newspaper, or for a different edition of the-same newspaper, that would frustrate the whole scheme of rationing. Prohibition of interchangeability has nothing to do with Art. 19(1) (a).
 [822C-D] 764 (xi) That there is a valid classification between a person owning no newspaper and a common ownership unit owning two or more newspapers cannot be denied. Any person desiring to express himself by the medium of a newspaper cannot be denied an opportunity for the same. The right guaranteed under Art. 19(1)(a) has an essentially individual aspect. A common ownership unit has already been given the opportunity to express itself by the media of two or more newspapers. if a common ownership unit were to go on acquiring or sponsoring new newspapers and if the claim for quota for all the newspapers is admitted, that would result in concentration of newspaper ownership and will accelerate the tendency towards monopoly in the newspaper industry. Since the quantity of newsprint available for distribution is limited, any system of rationing must place some limitation upon the right of a person to express himself through newspapers. [822H; 823A-D] (xii) The contention that the newsprint Policy was not binding since it had no statutory backing could not be accepted. The newsprint Policy was issued by the Chief Controller of Imports & Exports and the Additional Secretary to Government, had authenticated it. The newsprint Policy was placed before both the Houses of Parliament. Even if it was administrative in character it was capable of founding rights and duties. [823F; 824B] (xiii) The contention that after newsprint has been imported, there was no longer any power left in the Government or in the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports to direct the manner in which it should be utilized, could not be accepted. Even if it be assumed that Government or the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports has no power under cl. 5(1)(i) of the Imports (Control) Order 1955, to issue directions as regards the mode of utilization of newsprint after its import, it is clear that the Government has power by virtue of the provisions of s. 3 of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, to pass an Order as regards the utilization of newsprint, as newsprint is an "essential commodity" under s. 2(vii) of that Act. [824F; 825C-D] (xiv) Clauses 3(3) and 3(3A) of that newsprint order were not violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution. [826F] (xv) It was not necessary to express any opinion as regards the maintainability of the writ petitions on the ground that consumers of newsprint in question were not citizens. [826G]
