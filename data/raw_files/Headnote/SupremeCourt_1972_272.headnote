 From 1958 and even earlier, ex-factory prices of sugar were worked out on the basis of cost-schedules prepared by expert bodies appointed for that purpose. The prices in the cost schedules were prepared in respect of the entire production of sugar and not in relation only to that part of it which was required to be sold to government (referred to as levy sugar), although, partial control in one form or another was in vogue. Such cost-schedules were prepared on the basis of average duration and recovery, the minimum price of cane, the average cost of production in the various zones, taxes and a fair return on the capital employed in the industry.
 In 1967, the Central Government was confronted with the two problems : (a) the deterioration in the sugar industry, and (b) the conflicting interests of the manufacturer, the consumer and the cane grower. Accordingly Government announced its policy of partial control under which 60% of the output of sugar would be acquired and the balance of 40%would be left for free sale. To implement this policy sub-s.3 (3C) was enacted in the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. Under the sub-section there must be an order under s.
 3(2) (f) whereby a producer is required to sell sugar to the Government. There shall then be paid to the producer an amount there or, that is, for such stock of sugar as is required to be sold; and such amount shall be calculated with reference to such price of sugar as the Central Government may, by order determine, having regard to the four factors set out in cls. (a), (b), (c) and (d) of s.
 3(3C). Clause (a) provides for the minimum price, if any, fixed for sugar cane by the Central Government under s. 3;
 Cl. (b) refers to the manufacturing cost of sugar, Cf. (c) to the duty or tax, if any or payable thereon; and Cl. (d) to the securing of a reasonable return on the capital employed in the business of manufacturing sugar. The words 'notwithstanding anything contained in sub-s.(3) suggests that the amount payable to the person required to sell the stock of sugar would be with reference to the price fixed under sub-s (3C). [865 E; 868 F-H; 870 D-G; 874B] In pursuance of the power reserved to it under s.3(2)(f) and s.3(3C) the Central Government required sugar factories, including the appellant companies to sell to it 60% of their production during 1970-71 at prices fixed by it under the Sugar (Price Determination) Order, 1971. The prices were fixed on the principles laid down by the Tariff Commission and other expert bodies. The appellants filed writ petitions in the High Court for quashing the Order and for refixation of the ex-factory price for 1970-71 in respect of the sugar required to be sold to the Government under s.3(2)(f). The High Court dismissed the writ petitions. In appeal to this Court it was contended by the appellants that sub-section (3C), and its cl. (d) must be construed to be dealing with levy sugar only, that a reasonable return under cl. (d) should be assured unitwise, and that the profit on the free sale of sugar should not be taken into 861 account in considering whether a reasonable return has been allowed on the capital employed.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : On the construction of sub-s. (3C) and on the evidence produced there is no case for quashing the Sugar (Price Determination) Order, nor, for refixation of the price fixed by the Government under the sub-section. [881 D] (a) The sub-section provides two things, (1) the determination by the Government of a fair price during the process of which regard shall be had to the four matters set out therein, and (2) payment to the manufacturer, part of whose stock is levied, an 'amount therefor', calculated with reference to 'such price' as the Central Government may determine. The words 'amount therefor' mean the amount to be paid to the manufacturer in respect of such quantity of stock as is required to be sold Linder an order made with reference to sub-s. (2) (f). That amount is therefore referable to the stock of sugar specified in such order, that is to say, the levy sugar. The words 'such price of sugar' relate to the price which the Central government has to determine having regard to cls. (a), (b), (c) and (d).
 Though the payment would of course be for the- stock required to be sold to Government, there is nothing in sub- s. (3C) to suggest that the price to be determined is to be with respect to that part of the stock of a particular manufacturer which is required to be sold to the Government.
 [871.A-E] (b) A fair price for sugar had to be such that would harmonise and satisfy at least to a reasonable extent all the conflicting interests. It could not mean the actual cost and return of every individual unit because, (i) it would be impracticable and (ii) because it would be rewarding the inefficient and the uneconomic. The basis of a fair price would be cost schedules worked out with respect to a reasonable, efficient and economic representative cross-section of the industry. A claim that such a price had to be determined unitwise and a reasonable return is to be ensured to each unit or that such a price with such a return should only be in respect of that part of its stock required to be sold under sub-s. 3(2)(f) would be inconsistent with the concept of partial control, the background in which it was evolved, and the objects which it attempted to secure. Such a policy meant determination of a fair price on the basis of which a producer would be paid for part of stock required to be sold to Government. The fair price would have to be determined having regard to the four factors set out in the subsection. Though factors (a) and (c) would be static, factor (b) would largely depend on variables, such as duration and recovery. the prices of fuel, labour etc. differing from zone to zone or even within the same zone, necessitating the averaging and costing of ,a representative cross-section of units. Therefore, fair price could only mean securing a reasonable return to the industry as a whole and not to each unit, or in respect of only the stock required to be sold compulsorily to the Government. [873 H; 874 G-H; 875 A-F] (c) This does not however mean that Government can fix any arbitrary price, or on extraneous considerations, or a price which does not secure a reasonable return on the capital employed in the industry. Such a fixation would evoke a challenge, both on the grounds of its being inconsistent with the guidelines built in the subsection and its being in contravention of Arts. 19(1)(f) and (g) and 31 of the Constitution. [875 F-H] 862 [on the materials placed before it the Court found that the price fixed with respect to the appellants ensured a reasonable return on the capital employed and that there was no necessity for its refixation.]
