 The assessee was a Company limited by guarantee anti owned a Social end Sports Club one of whose. activities consisted of conducting horse. races with amateur riders.
 It charged for admission into-the enclosure of the club admission fee 10 the guests introduced by the members of the club as well as to the members of the public. It also charged a surcharge of eight annas solely earmarked for local charities. That was done pursuant to a resolution passed at the meeting of the General Body providing that the surcharge of eight annas on the entrance ticket should be earmarked for local charities.
 The Income Tax Officer prior to the assessment year 1960-61 did not treat the receipts on account of surcharge as trad- ing receipts of the assessee and bring them to tax as income of the assessee. While making the assessment for the as- sessment year 1960-61, the Income Tax Officer took the view that the receipts on account of surcharge were revenue receipts in the hands of assessee and they could not be excluded from the total income of the assessee merely on the ground that they were applied for charitable purposes. It was common ground that the amounts received by way of sur- charge had in fact been disbursed to local charities. The Income Tax Officer treated the receipts on account of sur- charge as income of the assessee and allowed rebate under s.
 15B in respect of the amounts actually disbursed in favour of local charities. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner confirmed the order of the Income Tax Officer on the ground that a person who wished to gain admission to the enclosure of the club had to pay the surcharge whether he was willing to contribute to the charity or not and the amount of the surcharge was therefore a part of the price charged by the assessee for admission and it was accordingly a revenue receipt in the hands of the assessee. On further appeal, the Tribunal held that the surcharge was levied on admission ticket for the purpose of charity and hence the receipts in respect of the surcharge were not income of the assessee at the point of time when they reached its hands and being earmarked for charity they never belonged to the assessee.
 The High Court on a reference made by the Tribunal agreed with the view taken by the Tribunal holding that since the surcharge was charged by the assessee and paid by the race goers for the specific purpose of being applied to local charities pursuant to, the resolution passed by the general meeting of the assessee, there was at the time of receipts of the amounts in respect of the surcharge, a legally enforcible obligation on the assessee to apply them to local charities and those amounts accordingly did not reach assessee as its income but were diverted to local charities before they reached the assessee.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
 HELD: (1) Income tax is a tax on income. Every re- ceipt by the assessee is not necessarily income in his hands. It is only when it bears the character of income at the time when it reaches the hands of the assessee that it becomes exigible to tax. [228 E] London County Council v.Attorney General [1901] AC 26.
 226 (2) The assumptions of the Revenue that the surcharge was received as part of the price for admission to the dab enclosure and that there was no legally enforcible obliga- tion on the assessee to spend the amounts on charity are erroneous. The admission to the enclosure was the occasion and not the consideration for.the surcharge taken from the race-goers. It is not a correct analysis of the nature of the legal relationship to say that there was nothing more than a mere desire or intention on the part of the assessee to apply the amounts received on account of surcharge to the local charities without any legally enforcible obligation.
 The resolution was passed at the general meeting of the assessee and pursuant to that resolution the surcharge was paid by the race-goers and received by the assessee for the specific purpose of being applied to local charities. The surcharge when paid was clearly impressed with an obligation in the nature of trust for being applied tot the benefit of local charities. A trust may be created by any language sufficient to show the intention and no technical words are necessary. [228 H, 229 A, C, D&G] C.I.T v. Thakar Das Bhargava, 40 I.T.R. 301, followed.
 (3) In the present case, the surcharge being impressed with an obligation the nature of trust for being applied to local charities was by this obligation diverted before it reached the hands of the assessee and at no stage it became a part of the income of the assessee. The amount of sur- charge never reached the assessee as parts of its income.
