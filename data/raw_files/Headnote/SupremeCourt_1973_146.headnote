 One R. died in 1941, leaving behind him his widow one minor son and .two minor daughters. Before he died, he had executed a will whereby he appointed his widow the executor of the will and the guardian of his minor son and daughters and bequeathed all his properties to the minor son with directions as regards maintenance and marriage of his daughters. In 1948, the widow mortgaged certain properties to raise a loan of Rs. 7,000/- for the purpose of marriage expenses of her elder daughter. She filed an application to this effect under ss.7 and 10 of the Guardian and Wards Act without disclosing anything about the will.
 The Court passed an order appointing the widow is the guardian of the personal property of the minor and son and daughter and by another order, granted her Permission to raise the said loan. Accordingly, she borrowed Rs. 7.000/- by mortgaging the houses. Thereafter, in 1950. she filed two applications seeking permission of the High Court to raise a loan of Rs. 40,000/and Rs. 15.0001- on the security of the two houses. She was allowed to raise Rs. 30.000/- and Rs. 10,000/- respectively by mortgaging the houses.
 Thereafter. the widow filed another application praying for permission to sell one of the houses in order to discharge the amount due to the appellants under the two mortgages.
 The permission was granted and the Indian Bank Ltd.
 Purchased one of the house properties for Rs. 41,500/-.
 Subsequently. the Bank came to know that R. had executed a will find the Bank applied to the High Court to have the sale set aside. This was done. When the existence of the will was brought to the notice of the Court, the High Court directed the Administrator General to take immediate possession of R.s estate and to apply for letters of administration. The Administrator General obtained letters of administration and took possession of the estate. In the course of administration, the A.G. after obtaining the sanction of the Court, put up sale one of the houses in question. The Indian Bank purchased it for Rs. 39,200/-.
 The sale proceeds are being retained by the A.G.
 The appellants thereafter, filed a suit before the High Court to recover The money given under the two mortgages executed in favor of the appellants by the widow as the guardian.
 The respondent namely, the Administrator General and the minor son contended that the widow had no authority to execute the mortgages and that she obtained the sanctions of the Court to execute the mortgages by practicing fraud etc.
 The High Court held that since the appellants were not parties to the fraud and as they are not required to go beyond the orders, the appellants were entitled to recover the amounts from the properties mortgaged and passed a preliminary decree.
 Against this decree, the respondents appealed to a Full Bench. The Full 'Bench held that an order under s. 31(ii) of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 can be relied ton by an salience and is a substitute for an honest enquiry to be made by him. The Court passed a decree for recovery of the amounts from one half of the properties mortgaged. It is against this decree that this appeal by certificate, has been preferred. In this Court, the following points were raised by the appellants 443 (i) That the finding of the High Court that the mortgages were valid only on respect of one half interest in the properties was not correct. According. to the appellants, since the widow was appointed guardian in respect of the person and the properties of her minor son, and the fact that the widow stated in the application to appoint her a guardian. that she was entitled to one half of the properties, and the minor to the other half, would not- conclude the question that she was appointed guardian only in respect of half share of the properties.
 (ii) That under the Act or under the inherent powers of the Court, a guardian can be appointed only with respect to all the properties of the minor and not in respect of any specific item.
 (iii) That if a guardian is appointed for all the properties of a minor in one district, it is not necessary that there Should be a fresh appointment for the properties of the minor in another district.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) Since the widow had no power to alienate the properties Linder the will, and since she did not disclose to the court about the curb on her power, the sanctions obtained from the Court Linder s. 31(2) of the Guardians and Wards Act 1890 on the application filed under s. 29 cannot be regarded as valid.
 The question, therefore, is whether appellants are entitled to get the money advanced, tinder the mortgages as a charge of the entire interest in these properties. [451B] (ii) The High Court granted the decree on the basis that the orders of sanctions for mortgaging the properties were valid. If to avoid a decree for recovery of the mortgaged money from the entire interest of the minor in these properties be refused on the ground that the orders sanctioning the mortgages were invalid, it would be contradictory to the of the finding of High Court on the basis of which it passed the decree. Order 41, r. 33 of the C.P. clothes the appellants that the power to pass any decree or order which the trial court ought to have passed and to pass or make such further or other decree or order as the justice of the case may require.
 The respondents would be entitled to avoid the orders of sanction in defence without the necessity of filing a suit.
 provided they give restitution. The High Courts have taken the view that as a condition for setting aside a disposal of immovable property made in contravention of s. 28 or s. 29 which is voidable under s. 30, it is just that there must be restitution of the benefits received. [451E,G] Parshotam Das v. Nazir Hussan, 54 IC. 846, Peria Karuppam Chetty v. Kandasamy Chetty (1933) Madras W.N. 791, and Abbas Hussain v. Kiran Sashi Devi, A.I.R. 1942 Nagpur 12, referred to.
 (iii) In the present appeal, one item of the properties has been sold by the A.G. through the sanction of the Court and the proceeds of the sale are with him. Therefore a decree is passed against the respondent/defendants directing them to pay the appellants the principal amounts due under the two mortgages 'together with 6% interest from June 1, 1950, on the principal amount upto the date of payment or realisation. The amount decreed will be a charge on the sale proceeds of one of the properties which are being retained by the A.G. and the entire interest in the other Property under the mortgage. [452E]
