 In a background of bitter hostility. there was a confrontation and exchange of violence between the complainants' group and that of all the accused-appellants.
 Several on the prosecution side sustained gunshot wounds, although not fatal, while the three accused-appellants received lathi blow injuries. The complainant's plea was that when attacked by guns, he and his men went at them, disarmed them and beat them with lathis. Twenty-three accused stood trial.. The trial court disbelieved the defence version out found that the prosecution testimony too partisan, and consequently acquitted everyone. The High Court maintained the acquittal of all but the three appellants-accused. In respect of the latter, it found that the injuries on the persons of the three appellants and) the fact ',hat one of them had a gun in his hands at the time of the occurrence, were sufficient, together with the other evidence to hold them guilty. On appeal by special leave to this Court by the said three appellants, 
HELD : (1) The principle of law is well established that merely because a. different view of the evidence is possible, you cannot cancel a finding against guilt Rut the appellate Court is untrammelled in its power to re-evaluate the evidence, bearing in mind the seriousness of overthrowing an acquittal once recorded. In that view we cannot find any error of law in the High Court reconsidering the probative value of the oral and circumstantial evidence in the case. Nor are we persuaded to think that the appellate Court has failed to observe the built-in.
 restraints on exercise of power while upsetting an acquittal. On the other hand, the Court has made the correct approach that only those accused against whom there was additional probative reinforcement could be convicted.
 [864 G-865 B] (11)Neither mere possibilities nor remote probabilities no,, mere doubts which are not reasonable can, without danger to the administration of justice,. be the foundation of the acquittal of an accused person, if there is otherwise fairly credible testimony. If a trial Courts' judgment verges on the perverse, the appellate Court has a duty to set the evaluation right and that is about all that has happened in this case. [865 E-F] (111)The fact that a large number of accused have been acquitted and the remaining who have been convicted are less than five cannot vitiate the conviction under s. 149 read with the substantive offence if-as in this case the Court has taken care to find-there are other persons who might not have been, identified or convicted but were party to the crime and together constituted the statutory number. On trust basis, the conviction under s. 307. read with S. 149 has to be sustained [866 A-B] Sukh Ram v. State of U.P. A.I.R. 974, S.C. 323, referred to.
