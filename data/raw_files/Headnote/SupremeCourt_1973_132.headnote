 The plaintiff-appellant filed the present suit for the cancellation of a saledeed dated 12-4-1932 to the extent of a half share claimed by him in certain plots of land and for the award of possession of the said half share. According to the plaintiff the vendor, who was his uncle had purchased the plots in question on behalf of the joint Hindu family which provided the funds for the purchase of the plots. The trial court dismissed the plaintiff's suit on 4-1-1960. The District Judge allowed the plaintiff's appeal, and decreed the suit on 30-4-62. The defendants-respondents filed a second appeal to the High Court on 18-8-1962 which was admitted for hearing. During the pendency of the second appeal, a notification under s. 4 of the U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act of 1954 was published in the Government Gazette on 22-10-1966 declaring that the village in which the plots in dispute were situated had come under conso- lidation operations. Consequently, the defendants- appellants filed an application under s.5 of the Act in the second appeal. The High Court by its judgment dated 5-5- 1967 after dismissing the defendants' applications under s.5 of the Act dealt with the merits of the case and accepted the appeal of the defendants-appellants. The High Court took the view that section 5 did not apply to a case in which the possession could be granted only after cancellation of the sale-deed to the extent of half before awarding possession. In the plaintiff's appeal to this Court by special leave, the defendants-respondents raised a preliminary objection to the hearing of the appeal on merits on the ground that the High Court should have held that the Dlaintiff's suit before it had abated under s.5(2) of the Act.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : A distinction can be made between cases where a document is wholly or partially invalid so that it can be disregarded by any court or authority and one where it has to be actually set aside before it can cease to have legal effect. An alienation made in excess of power to transfer would be, to the extent of the excess of power, invalid.
 All adjudication on the effect of such a purported alienation would be necessarily implied in the decision of a dispute involving conflicting claims to rights or interests in land which are the subject matter of consolidation proceedings. The existence and quantum of rights claimed or denied will have to be declared by consolidation authorities which would be deemed to be invested with jurisdiction, by the necessary implication of their statutory powers to adjudicate upon such rights and interests in land, to declare such documents effective or ineffective. But, where there is a document the legal effect of which can only be taken away by setting it aside or its cancellation, it could be urged that the consolidation authorities have no, power to cancel the deed, and, therefore, it must be held to be binding on them so long as it is not 'cancelled by a court having the power to cancel it. In the present case the plaintiff's claim was that the sale of his half share by his uncle was invalid, inoperative, and void. Such a claim could be adjudicated upon by consolidation courts.
 Accordingly it must be declared that the suit of the plaintiff had abated under s.5 of the Act. [342C-F] Ram Adhar Singh v. Ramroop Singh & Ors. [1968] 2 S.C.R. p.

 340 Since the High Court had dismissed the plaintiff's appeal it was not necessary for the defendants to appeal against the order of the High Court dismissing their application under ss. 4 & 5 of the Act, and the defendants were accordingly not precluded from raising the preliminary objection based on ss. 4 & 5 of the Act in this Court.
