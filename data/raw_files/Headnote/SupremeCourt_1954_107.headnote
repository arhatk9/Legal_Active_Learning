 Section 12-B of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 (inserted by Act XXII of 1947) which imposed tax on 'Capital gains' is not ultra vires the Government of India Act, 1935. The term 'Capital 106 830 gains' comes well within the meaning of the word 'income' used in item No. 54 of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Government of India Act, 1935.
 It is incorrect to say that income cannot signify 'Capital gains' and it is equally an incorrect approach to hold that there is a legislative practice which recognises a clear line of demarcation between income and capital. What is relied on here as a legislative practice is nothing but the judicial interpretation given to the word 'income' as used in the income-tax and fiscal statutes. Such interpretation does not necessarily cut down the ordinary natural meaning of the word 'income' as used in item No. 54 of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Government of India Act, 1935.
 Cardinal rule of interpretation is that the words should be read in their ordinary natural and grammatical meaning. But the words in a constitutional enactment conferring legislative powers should however be construed most liberally and in their widest amplitude, Commissioner of Income-tax v. Shaw Wallace & Co.
