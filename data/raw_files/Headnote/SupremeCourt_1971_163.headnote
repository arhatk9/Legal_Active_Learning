 The grant-in-aid system was introduced in 1859 and its main object was to permit voluntary effort and reliance on local resources in the field ,of education apart from such contributions as may be available from the funds of the State. After the re-organisation of the State of Bombay a unified code of grant-in-aid to non-government secondary schools throughout the State was introduced by the State from the year 1963-64. Under r. 2(1) an application for permission to start a secondary school has to be made in the prescribed form and such application has to reach the prescribed authorities by the end of October in the year preceding the year in which the school was proposed to be started. Under r. 2(2) the management which was permitted to open a school has so apply for recognition of the school and under r. 3, a school seeking recognition shall satisfy the Department that the school was actually needed in the locality that it did not involve any unhealthy competition with any existing institution and that the management was competent, reliable and was in the hands of a properly constituted authority or committee. Under r. 3(3) one of the conditions which has to be satisfied is regarding the financial stability of the proposed school. Other conditions which had to be satisfied by a proposed school are enumerated in the remaining 13, clauses of the rule.
 Rule 86(2) provides that schools which are not registered under the Societies Registration Act, would not be eligible for grant.
 On October 6, 1965, the State issued a press-note calling attention of all the managements intending to start new secondary schools to the relevant provisions of the Code.
 It was also stated that applications received for starting new schools would be scrutinised and considered by the District Committee comprising of the Chairman of the Education Committee, Zila Parishad Parishad Education Officer and a member of the Secondary School Certificate Examination Board, Poona, or Vidarbha Board of Secondary Education, Nagpur, that is, by persons who were familiar with the conditions prevailing in the particular areas, and the requirements in the area for a new or additional school, and that permission to start a new school would be communicated to the applicants concerned by the Deputy Director of Education of the region by the end of February.
 The applicants were also informed that the appeals to the Government against the orders of the Deputy Director of Education could be filed up to end of March, 1966. On the same date, Government sent communications for taking steps for constituting the District Committees. The State also sent a circular on the same :date to the various educational authorities stating that the Disrict Committees 880 should bear in mind, when considering the applications, the various matters, enumerated in items 1 to 14 Which related to the requirement of a school or an additional school in a particular area, its financial stability, the nature and competency of the management and several allied matters. It was obligatory on the District Committee to record its reasons in writing for recommending or not recommending a particular application, which would be considered by the Deputy Director of Education of the concerned region before granting or refusing permission to start a new school.
 The applications of the three applicants-societies were scrutinised by the concerned District Committees along with the applications and objections of rival applicants. In the case of the first applicant-society the District Committee recommended the rival applicant on the grounds that the applicant society had no funds but that the rival applicant was of good financial position and experience. The Deputy Director of Education accepted the recommendation and rejected the first applicants' application stating that the need of the place had been fulfilled by permitting the rival society to open a school at the place.
 In the case of the second applicant the Deputy Director of Education rejected the application on two grounds, namely:
 (a) that the application was made after the prescribed date, and (b) that the society was not registered. The appeals of these applicants to the State Government were rejected and they filed writ petitions in the High Court for striking down r. 3 of the Grant-in-aid Code.
 In the case of the third applicant, in spite of objections by a rival who was already conducting a school in that area the District Committee recommended the grant of permission to the applicant on the grounds that the applicant society was a good, experienced and popular society and it was also financially sound and that the population of the areas demanded as an absolute necessity an additional school from standard VIII onwards, The society which was already running a school filed a writ petition to quash the permission granted to the third applicant.
 The High Court struck down cls. 1 and 2 of r. 3 of the Code as violative of Arts. 14 and 19 of the Constitution and directed the educational authorities to grant permission to the first two applicants to start schools, as desired by them. It dismissed the writ petition filed for quashing the permission granted to the third applicant. The High Court also made certain observations regarding the policy that should be adopted by the educational authorities in the matter of permitting the starting of a new school or an additional school in a particular area.
 In appeals to this Court, 
HELD:(1) The High Court had misunderstood the nature of its jurisdiction when dealing with the claims of the first two applicants. It was not for the High Court to lay down the policy that should be adopted by the educational authorities in the matter of granting permission for starting schools.
 The question of policy is essentially for the State and such policy will depend upon an overall assessment of the requirements of the residents of a particular locality and other categories of persons for whom it is essential to provide for education. If the overall assessment is arrived at after proper classification on a reasonable basis, it is not for courts to interfere with the policy leading up to such assessment. [887E-H] (2)Clauses (1) and (2) of r. 3 are not vague or ambiguous in any respect. They should not be considered in isolation.
 If they are interpreted having due regard to the various other matters contained in other clauses of the rule and the detailed instructions contained.
 881 of the rule and the detailed instructions contained in the circular letter, the District Committee had ample guidance for deciding the need of a particular locality to have a school or an additional school, as also the further questions regarding the competency and reliability of the management. [895D-E; F-H] (3)The provisions of the Code are executive instructions and are in the nature of administrative instructions without any constitutional force. The State Government was competent to issue those executive instructions for the guidance of the educational authorities dealing with the applications for grant of permission to start schools, and they are perfectly valid. The applications in the present case were considered during the period when the Proclamation of Emergency was in operation. Article 19 could not therefore be invoked by the first two applicants and the view of the High Court that Art. 358 did not save the two clauses of r. 3 was erroneouse. [888A-B; 892C-E] (4)(a) The High Court erred in striking down the two clauses on the ground that unless a school was started in accordance with the rules contained in the Code they would not be recognised by the Secondary School Boards and students studying in such schools would not be able to appear for the examinations held by the Board and the University, and therefore, were violative of Art. 14. The provisions regarding grant of permission and recognition of schools under the Code are merely intended for the purpose of receiving grant from the Government, and are not concerned with the effect of starting a school without complying with the requirements of the provisions of the Code or in the face of refusal of permission by the educational authorities. So far as the distribution of grant to the schools recognised under the Code was concerned it was not the case of any of the applicants that such grants were being made arbitrarily or any discrimination was shown in that regard. It was also not the case of the applicants that the District Committees had acted arbitrarily, nor was it their case that the Deputy Director of Education had not based his decision on the recommendations of the District Committees. There was thus no violation of Art. 14. [892G- H; 893B-C, D-I] (b)The mere fact that there was no right provided for the applicant being heard before the application was rejected could not be a ground for holding that there was violation of the principles of natural justice. The particulars which had to be mentioned in the prescribed application form are very elaborate and complete. The provisions in the Code read along with the instructions given by the State in its circular letter referred to various relevant material factors that had to be taken into account for the purpose of deciding whether the application was to be granted or not.
 When all the relevant circumstances, claims and objections of the applicants and their rivals had been taken into account by the District Committees and the educational authorities there was no violation of any principle of natural justice. It was not the case of the applicants that the reasons given for rejection of their applications were not covered by the provisions contained in the Code. [893H;
 894D-E] (5)The High Court erred in issuing a mandamus to the State without considering the Various reasons given by the Deputy Director of Education for rejecting the application of the first two applicants.
 (a)The reason given by the Deputy Director of Education with respect to the first applicant for rejecting its application was that the need of the place had been fulfilled by permitting another society to open the school at the place, on the recommendations of the District Committee. It was open to the authorities to refuse permission if the school is not in a financially sound position. [896B-D, G] 56-1 S.C.India/71 882 (b)In the case of the second applicant the reasons given were that the application was sent after the prescribed date and that the society was not registered. Therefore the rejection was on valid grounds. [897D-E] (6)In the case of the third applicant, from the mere fact that by giving it permission to open another school some of the students of the rival society's school may seek admission in the new school, could not be a ground for stating that the rival society's legal rights had been in- fringed. In granting permission to another society no extraneous or irrelevant matters had been taken into account by the District Committee or the educational authorities.
 The reasons given by the District Committee for granting permission were valid reasons and the High Court rightly rejected the petition of the rival society. [898G-H]
