 The Madras Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961, was an Act to provide for fixation of ceiling on agricultural land holdings and for certain other matters connected therewith in the State of Madras. Its validity had been challenged by earlier writ petitions filed, in this Court on the ground that its provisions violated Arts. 14, 19 and 31(2) of the Constitution and this Court held that its pivotal provisions violated Art. 14 and therefore struct down the entire Act as unconstitutional. Similar attacks had been made on several other acts of other States imposing ceilings on holding of land, and in order to shield these Acts against such attacks Parliament passed the Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act, 1964. By that amendment several Acts were included in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution including the Madras Act. The Madras Act was again challenged on two grounds; namely (1) the Act having been struck down as invalid by this Court it was non est, and was void ab initio and Art. 31-B could not validate it without the State Legislature reenacting its provisions, and (2) the Act was incompetent for want of legislative power in the State.
 
HELD : Art. 31-B and the Ninth Schedule as they stood after the 7th amendment must be taken to have cured the defect, if any, in the various Acts mentioned in the said Schedule as regards any unconstitutionality alleged on the ground of infringement of fundamental rights; and, by the express words of Art.. 31-B such curing of the defect took place with retrospective operation from the dates on which the Acts were put on the statute book. These Acts, even if void or inoperative at the time when they were enacted by the reason of infringement of Art. 13(2) of the Constitution, assumed full force and vigour from the respective dates of their enactment after their inclusion in the Ninth Schedule read with Art. 31-B of the Constitution. Besides, the States could not, at any time, cure any defect arising from the violation of the provisions of Part III of the Constitution. Therefore, the objection that the Madras Act should have been re-enacted by the Madras Legislature after the Seventeenth Amendment came into force cannot be accepted., [1070 B-E] State of Maharashtra v.

 (2) Entry 18 in List II of the Constitution like any other entry in the three lists only gives the outline of the subject matter of legislation field of legislation governed by the entry is not to be narrowed down in and the words in the entry are to be read in their widest amplitude. The any way unless there is anything in. the entry itself which defines the limits thereof. Entry 18 is meant to confer the widest powers on the State Legislature with regard to rights in or over land and such rights are not to be measured by or limited to the rights as between landlords and tenants or the collection of rents. The words which follow the ex- pression 'rights in or over land', in the entry are merely by way of illustration. The specification itself shows that the genus of the rights mentioned is not the one which landlords have vis-a-vis their tenants or vice versa. All kinds of legislation regarding transfers and alienations of agricultural land which may affect the rights therein of landlords and tenants are envisaged by the entry as also improvement of land and colonisation of such land. If the State Government seeks to enforce a measure by which the condition of barren or unproductive lands can be improved it can do so even if the measure curtails the rights of the landlords and tenants. If the State wants to enforce a measure of acquiring lands of people who hold areas over a certain ceiling limit so as to be able to distribute the same among the landless and other persons, to give effect to the directive principles in Art. 39(b) and (c) of the Constitution, it is not possible to say that the same would be outside the scope of Entry IS in List II read with Entry 42 in List III. Such a measure can aptly be described as a measure of agrarian reform or land improvement in that persons who have only small holdings and work on the lands themselves would be more likely to put in greater efforts to make the land productive than those who hold large blocks of land and are only interested in getting a return without much effort. The measure does not transgress the limits of the legislative field because it serves to remove the disparity in the ownership of land. Persons who lose the ownership of land in excess of the ceiling imposed are compensated for the lands acquired by the State and distributed among others. Acquisition of land would not directly be covered by Entry 18 but read with Entry 42 in List III the State has competence to acquire surplus land so as to give effect to the policy in Art. 39 of the Constitution.
