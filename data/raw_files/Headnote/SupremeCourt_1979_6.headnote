 The deceased gifted his residential porperty to his wife, but continued to live there with her. On his death, while calculating the estate duty, the appellant included the value of the residential property, in the principal value of the estate, on the ground that the deceased continued to reside with the wife, even after the gift.
 Upholding the High Court's judgment, and rejecting the special leave petition, the Court ^ 
 HELD : Section 10 cannot be construed in a manner which would require the husband who has gifted residential house to the wife, to live separately from her. When the wife obtains possession of the house and remains in enjoyment of it, it cannot be said that the husband who resides with the wife, is, on that account, in possession or enjoyment of the house so as to attract the applicability of Section 10.
