 Appellant No. 1-land holder filed a return of his holding under the provisions of the Maharashtra Agricultural Lands (Ceiling and Holdings), Act, 1961. The Collector after making inquiry held that as his total holding of agricultural lands was 124 acres 23 guntas (converted into dry lands) and having regard to the number of his family members the appellant No. 1 was not a surplus holder.
 Through the order of the Collector was in favour of the appellant No. 1, he filed an appeal before the Revenue Tribunal, contending that he was not holding 124 acres 23 guntas of land and that his holding was lesser than that.
 The appeal was dismissed summarily.
 Sometime after the disposal of the appeal, the Additional Commis- 467 sioner issued a notice u/s.45 of the Act to the appellant No.1 calling upon him to show cause as to why the Collector's order be not revised; his holding be determined at 231 acres and why the surplus should not be directed to be surrendered.
 Appellant No. 1 submitted his objection u/s.45(2), proviso contending that when an appeal was filed against the order of the Collector, the power of suo motu revision was not available to the Commissioner u/s.45 of the Act.
 The Additional Commissioner rejected the preliminary objection and passed an order on merits, holding that the holding of lands of the first appellant was 202 acres and 31 guntas (when converted into dry crop land), that he was entitled to retain only an extent of 160 acres and that he was a surplus holder to an extent of 42 acres 31 guntas.
 The matter was remitted to the S.D.O. for delimiting the surplus area.
 The appellants questioned the validity of the Commissioners' order by way of a writ petition in the High Court, contending that inasmuch as the order of the Collector was appealed against, it could no longer be revised by the Commissioner in view of the express bar contained in the proviso to Section 45(2) and further and that the lands he obtained by way of exchange as well his lands which were given away under the said exchange, were both included in his holding.
 The High Court dismissed the writ petition, against which the appellants filed this appeal with the leave of this Court.
 The appellants contended that the appeal preferred by the appellant No. 1 before the Revenue Tribunal was a proper and competent appeal. Though that appeal was dismissed, it operated as a bar to the exercise of the revisory power under Section 45(2), proviso.
 The respondent submitted that an appeal was maintainable against the declaration or a part thereof. The part which was not appealed against was open to revision under Section 45(a); that the provision in Section 33 providing for a right of appeal and the provision of Section 45(2) conferring a supervisory power in the Government/Commissioner must be harmonised so as to give both the provisions their due play; that mere rejection of theory of exchange did not necessarily mean that the extent in gut No. 521 should be excluded from the appellants' holding when they 468 themselves claim that it was theirs.
 Partly allowing the appeal, this Court, 
 HELD : 1.01. The Maharashtra Agricultural Lands (Ceiling and Holdings) Act, 1961 was enacted by the Maharashtra Legislature with a view to impose a maximum limit (ceiling) on the holding of agricultural land in the State of Maharashtra and to provide for the acquisition and distribution of the land held in excess of such ceiling.
 [472B] 1.02. The Act is not intended to determine or declare titles. The finding as to the extend of a holding of a person under the Act is only a step towards its object an intermediate stage. [476B] 1.03. A person holding agricultural lands below the ceiling limit can acquire land only upto the ceiling limit but not above such limit. Evidently, acquisition of any land in excess of such limit is liable to be surrendered under the Act. [472D-E] 2.01. Section 21 makes it clear that the "declaration" contemplated by it is to be made only in the case of a surplus holder. The declaration has to contain the various particulars mentioned in clauses (a) to (e) of sub-section (1). This should be followed by a statement containing particulars of the land delimited as surplus. This statement has to be published in the village and other specified places. Sub-section (3) provides that the Collector shall take possession of the surplus land soon after "the announcement of the declaration", whereupon it shall vest in the State. All this shows that no "declaration" is to be made under Section 21 in the case of a person/family unit whose holding does not exceed the ceiling limit. [474B-C] 2.02. An appeal is provided only against a "declaration" made under Section 21 and not against any of the orders made under Section 14 to 20. A mere determination or a finding or order that a person/family unit holds land less than the ceiling limit is not a "declaration" and, therefore, not appealable. [476F] 2.03. Section 45 vests in the State Government the power of control and supervision over the officers under the Act, which power can be delegated by the Government to the Commissioner. [475E] 2.04. The High Court was right in holding that the order of the 469 Collector in the case of the first appellant was not appealable. The appeal filed by him was one not provided by law and, hence, no appeal in the eye of law. Such an incompetent appeal could not operate as a bar to the exercise of revisory power under Section 45(2). [476F-G] 
 3. In the subsequent proceedings for determining the surplus land, the order in the earlier proceedings determining one's holding at a particular figure, may not operate as res judicata. [477A] 
 4. It is no one's case that the appellant acquired the extent of 12 acres 24 guntas in gut No. 521 in some manner other than the exchange put forward by him. That area ought to be excluded from his holding once the theory of exchange is disbelieved and when the extent in gut Nos. 462 and 463 is also included in his holding. [478B]
