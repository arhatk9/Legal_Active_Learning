 A widow with a life estate in certain raiyati lands in the Sonthal Parganas in Bihar exchanged a part of the lands for other lands. After her death her husband's reversioners filed a suit challenging this exchange as well as certain other transfers. The trial court as well as the first appellate court decided in favour of the plaintiffs. The High Court however held that the, aforesaid exchange of land was a valid transaction and that the plaintiffs were not entitled to raise for the first time before it the plea that transfers of land by exchange were prohibited by s. 27 of the Sonthal Parganas Settlement Regulation 3 of 1872. The High Court gave two reasons for not allowing the plea to be raised for the first time before it, namely (a) that the defendants could have shown if the contention bad been raised earlier that as provided by s. 27(1) the record of rights had set out the right of the last female holder to transfer the said lands and that if that were so, s. 27 would not bar transfer of the said lands by such a person;
 and (b) that the defendants could also have contended that if the, said exchange was invalid by reason of 's. 27(1), they held the lands after the said exchange adversely to the reversioners and that they being in possession for more than twelve years their title was completed by adverse possession. Against the High Court's judgment the plaintiffs came as appellants to this Court. The questions that fell for consideration were : (i) whether the High Court was right in disallowing the appellants to raise before it the plea based on s. 27(1) of the Regulation 3 of 1872; (ii) whether the appellants' claim could be resisted on the ground of adverse possession under Art. 141 of the Indian Limitation Act, 1908; (iii) whether an exchange of land was transfer within the meaning of s. 27(1) of the Regulation; (iv) whether the validity of the exchange could not be challenged in view of s. 11 of the Regulation.
 
HELD : (i) The High Court was not right in disallowing the contention based on s. 27(1) on the ground that it was not raised earlier because from the District Court's judgment it was clear that the contention was in fact canvassed before it. [346 G-H] The language of s. 27 is moreover clear and unambiguous. It prohibits any transfer of a holding by a raiyat either by sale, mortgage or lease or by any other contract or agreement. The section is comprehensive enough to include a transfer of the holding by way of an exchange. Subsection (2) of the s. 27 in clear terms enjoins upon the courts not to recognise any transfer of such lands by sale, mortgage, lease etc. or by 343 or under any other agreement or contract whatsoever.
 Therefore, even assuming that the contention as to the invalidity of the said exchange under s. 27 was raised for the first time before the High Court, the language of sub-s.
 2 being absolute and clear, the High Court had to take notice of such a contention and was bound to hold such an exchange invalid if it was shown that sub-s. (1) applied to the transaction [347 C-E] The burden of showing that s. 27 applied to, the case was on the appellants. But once it was shown that the lands exchanged were raiyati lands situate in the Sonthal Parganas, if the respondent wanted to show that the prohibition did not apply by relying on the exception to the rule laid down in sub-s. (1), the burden to prove that exception would shift on to the respondent. It was, therefore, for the respondent to establish that the record of rights contained an entry to the effect that the transferor in respect of those lands had the right to transfer them. The High Court was, therefore, not justified in disallowing the appellants contention based on s. 27 on the ground that if it had been raised earlier the respondent would have shown that there was such an entry in the Record of Rights as to the Transferor's right to transfer the-said lands [348 C-E-] (ii) The High Court was also not correct in disallowing the said contention on the ground that the respondent could have shown that he had completed his title to the properties in question by adverse possession, if the said exchange was invalid under s. 27. Such a plea was in f act raised by the respondent and was rightly rejected by the District Court.
 A person who has been in adverse possession for twelve years or more of property inherited by a widow from her husband by any act or omission on her part is not entitled on that ground to hold it adversely as against the next reversioners on the death of such a widow. The next reversioner is entitled to recover possession of the property if it is immoveable, within twelve years from the widow's death under Art. 134 of the Indian Limitation Act, 1908. This rule does not rest entirely on Art. 141 but is in accord with the principles of Hindu Law and the general principle that as the right of a reversioner is in the nature of a spes successionis and he does not trace that title through or from the widow, it would be manifestly unjust if he is to lose his right by the negligence or sufferance of the widow.

 (iii) Under s. 118 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, a transaction is exchange when two persons mutually transfer the ownership of one thing for the ownership of another provided it is riot an exchange for money only. A transfer of property in completion of an exchange can be made only in the manner provided for the transfer of such property by sale. it is not therefore, right to say that an exchange does not involve transfer of property and therefore does not fall within the scope of s. 27. The exchange in the present case was made when s. 27 was in force and its subsequent repeal could not have the effect of rendering an invalid and void transaction a valid and binding transaction [349 C-F] (iv) The only, effect of s. 1 1 of the Regulation is that a decision of a settlement officer under the Regulation has the force of a - decree of a civil court and such a decision can only be challenged subsequently in a court of law to the limited extent provided, in s. 25A. However the question whether in the present case the exchange was valid or not by reason of s. 27 was neither agitated before, nor determined by, any settlement officer or court and therefore the bar of s. 11 could not apply to the present suit [349 H] 344
