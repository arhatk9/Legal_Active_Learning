 Respondent No. 1 was elected to Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly. Third respondent filed an Election Petition for declaring the election of the first respondent void.
 Respondent No. 1 made an application to the High Court raising objection that copy of the election petition and the affidavit served onhim were not signed and that it amounted to non-compliance with section 81(3) of the Representation of People Act, 1951, and the election petition was liable to be dismissed under section 86(1). Several persons including appellant intervened to say that respondent No. 3 had colluded with respondent No. 1 and that as a, matter of fact there was no non-compliance with the requirement of section 81(3). The appellant offered to substantiate his allegation. The intervention applications filed were rejected by the High Court. The High Court held that there was non-compliance with section 81(3) and, therefore, dismissed the election petition. The appellant filed an appeal to this Court under section 116-A of the Act. In the alternative, he prayed to treat it as the petition under Article 136. This Hon'ble Court allowed the appeal to treat it as a Special Leave Petition and granted Special Leave.
 The appellant was not permitted to challenge the order of the High Court made under section 86. He was, however, allowed to challenge the refusal 'of the High Court to allow him to intervene. The appellant contended :
 (1) That in substance and effect the action of the third respondent was tantamount to withdrawal of his election petition and in that view of the matter the procedure prescribed in sections 109 and 110 of the Act ought to have been followed and given effect to.
 (2) That in any view of the matter respondent no. 3 should not have been permitted to walk out of the field without an investigation of the facts alleged by the appellant which if found true, would have shown that there was no non-compliance with the requirement of the law and the election petition was not liable to be dismissed under- section 86.
 (3) In an election dispute the whole constituency is interested and any elector of that constituency from which a candidate had been returned and whose election has been challenged can intervene in the matter.
 
HELD : It is difficult to accept that in substance and in effect the action of' respondent No. 3 even assuming that it was collusive or fraudulent had the effect of withdrawing his election petition. The Legislature has chosen to make special provisions for the continuance of the election petition only in case of its withdrawal or abatement. It is not necessary for this Court to express any opinion as to, whether omission to do so is deliberate or inadvertent. It may be a case of Casus omissus. it is a well-known rule of construction of statutes that a Statute, even more than a contract. must be construed, utres magis valest quam pereat.
 so +hat the intentions of the Legislature cannot be treated a-, vain or left to operate in the air. Another consequence of this rule is that a statute cannot be extended to, meet a case for which provision has clearly and undoubtedly not been made. [598H; 599B-D] Shedhan Singh v. Mohan Lal, Gautam [1969] INSC 12; (1969) 3 S.C.R. 417 distinguished.
 
HELD FURTHER : There is undoubtedly a lacuna in the Act because it makes provision when an election petitioner is allowed to withdraw but makes no 596 such provision if he just refuses to prosecute it. However, in such contingency, if thought necessary it is for the Legislature to intervene. The Court was help'less. The appeal was dismissed. [600D]
