 The respondent was convicted for offences under section 135 of the Customs Act and the Defence of India Rules for smuggling contraband gold into the country and was variously sentenced. When his appeal came to this Court, the case was remanded to the High Court for a fresh decision.
 On remand the High Court accepted the prayer of the respondent that he be given the benefit of section 4 of the Probation of Offenders Act on the grounds that the contraband gold recovered from him had been confiscated;
 that he had been facing criminal litigation for a period of seven years which resulted in a lot of monetary expense and mental agony on his part; that he was behind the bars for a period of five months, that no other case on the criminal side was pending against him and that he was not in a position to pay any fine.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the State that in giving the benefit of section 4 of the Act, the High Court did not exercise its discretion properly.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD : Recourse to section 4 was not at all called for, the time lag between the commencement of the trial and the pronouncement of the impugned judgment notwithstanding.
 [737F-G] One of the major criteria in determining whether the benefit of the provisions of section 4 of the Act should be given to the offender or not is the nature of the offence.
 The other relevant factors are the age of the offender and the circumstances in which the offence was committed. [737B- C] In the instant case none of these factors goes to help the respondent because he was not a immature youth at the time of the commission of the offences; he was not less than 24 years of age then. The offences involved possession of a large quantity of contraband gold. That he was apparently a regular smuggler is evident from the fact that a large quantity of gold with foreign marking and a number of empty jackets meant for storage of the gold were found in his possession. The fact that such offence had become rampant and had already endangered the economy of the nation is part of current history and a Court cannot look upon the present state of affairs with equanimity and deal with such offences leniently. [737C-E] There is nothing on the record to show that the respondent was not in a position to pay any fine. [737F] 736
