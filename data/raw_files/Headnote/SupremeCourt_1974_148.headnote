 By an order dated September 10, 1965, A was removed from Membership of the Sikh Gurdwaras Tribunal and K was appointed to the vacancy so created. On October 18, 1966, the order of removal was quashed by the High Court. The ensuing.special leave petition was rejected by this Court.
 By two separate notifications dated October 22, 1966, the Tribunal was respectively dissolved and reconstituted with K as a member. A, who challenged by a writ petition the noti- fication of dissolution, died on July 18, 1969. His legal representatives confined their claim to the emoluments alleged to be due to him. The High Court dismissed the petition. On appeal, by certificate, to this Court, the appellants contended that the notification dissolving the Tribunal was issued for a collateral purpose ,Ind by a person who had no authority to do.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) Under Sec. 12(5) of the Act, it was not competent for the Government to remove a member once appointed except on the grounds specified therein and the fact that the High Court declared that the removal of A from the membership of the Tribunal was bad would not have warranted the removal of K from, the membership of the Tribunal under that provision.
 S. 12(5) provides for all, cases of removal of a member once appointed and since the removal of K would not, have been justified on any of the grounds mentioned in that section, the State Government could not have removed him from the membership and, therefore, an impossible situation was created which justified the dissolution of the Tribunal under S. 12(1). From the fact that the judgment of the High Court declared that the removal of A was bad in law, it would not follow that the appointment of K in the vacancy created by the removal of A was void. K's appointment remained unchallenged. He was functioning as a member of the Tribunal and was participating in the decision of cases.
 The provisions of s. 12(1) made it essential that on removal of A, there should be an appointment to the vacancy as the business of the Tribunal could not have been carried on without filling the vacancy created by the removal. On the ground of practical expediency also the appointment of K was not void or nonest in the eye of law. Therefore, the dissolution of the Tribunal' was not for a collateral purpose. [739A-740A] (ii) The notification dissolving the Tribunal did not abolish any public office of the description specified in sub-rule (1)(xxii) of R. 28 of the Rules of Business of the Government of Punjab, 1953. The Tribunal was not abolished.
 It was only re-constituted. Abolition means "to destroy, extinguish, abrogate or annihilate". The Secretary, Home Department was competent to issue the notification.
