 Under the Punjab Civil Service (Judicial Branch) Service Rules, which were applicable in the appellant-State, the State Public Service Commission was to hold an examination and prepare a list strictly in accordance with the marks obtained by the candidates. Under s. 8 of Part C of the Rules. no candidate shall be considered to have qualified unless he obtains 45% marks in the aggregate. Under r. 10.
 after the list is published in the Gazette. Government was bound to make the selection of the candidates strictly in the order in the list, and intimate the selection to the High Court. When vacancies are to be filled the High Court will send in the names in accordance with. and in the order in, the list, for appointment.
 In the present case. it was advertised that the Public Service Commission would hold an examination for recruitment of candidates for 15 vacancies. 40 candidates qualified by scoring 45% or more marks. The appellant selected the first seven who had scored more than 55% marks. The respondent, who ranked 8, 9 and 13 in the list, filed a petition for the issue of a mandamus claiming that since there were 15 vacancies, the appellant was not entitled to fill up only seven. The appellant justified their action on the ground that in the interest of maintaining-high standards of judicial competence, they were not prevented from fixing a higher standard while making the actual appointment.
 The High Court allowed the petition.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD: (1) In order that mandamus may issue to compel an authority to do something, it must be shown that the statute imposes a legal duty on that authority and that the aggrieved party had a legal right under the statute to enforce its performance. [170E-G] Rai Shivendra Bahadur v. The Governing Body of the Nalanda College, [1962] Suppl. 2 S.C.R. 144, followed.- (2) The advertisement that there were 15 vacancies did not give the respondent a right to be appointed. The fact that a candidate's name appeared in the list also did not entitle him to be appointed. [170A] (3) The effect of the rules is that, (a) the State Government shall not make appointments by traveling outside the list, and (b) the State Government shall make the selection for appointment strictly according to the order in the list. There is no other constraint or legal duty on the Government to make an.appointment in the judicial service.
 merely because there are vacancies or a list had been prepared. [17WE] (4) There is no constraint on the Government against fixing a higher score of marks for the Purpose of selection with a view to maintain a high standard. There was nothing arbitrary in fixing 55% for the purpose of selection, because, the High Court itself intimated such a view to the Punjab Government. The fact that that Government later fixed a lower score was no ground for the appellant to change their mind. [171A-D]
