 The appellant company purchased the business of a partnership firm towards the end of 1920, The firm bad carried on business as bankers, commission agents, agents of joint stock companies and dealers in shares and securities foreign exchange etc., in and outside India. Pursuant to the agreement of purchase the appellant company took over the business of the firm and also purchased shares and securities worth Rs. 1,93,79,521-3-1 at market value as on 31st December 1920. It further purchased between 1st January 1921 to 31st January 1921 from the market further shares and securities worth Rs. 4,28,05,627 in the ordinary course of his business. In the year of assessment 1949-50 the appellant company discontinued its business and claimed exemption on Rs. 33,40,057 under s. 25(3) of the Income- ,tax Act 1922. This claim was rejected by the Income-tax officer on the ground claimed and obtained a deduction (1)that in the year 1921 the assesses in respect of appreciation in shares and securities amounting to Rs.
 9,26,708 and (2) it had discontinued one of the business which the firm was doing namely dealing in stocks and shares. The Tribunal held that the business was assessed to tax under the Act of 191 & but found that the shares and securities were purchased by the company from the partnership firm not with the intention of dealing in securities but as an investment. The High Court in reference held that the company was a dealer in shares and securities immediately after it took over from the firm. On a different quest-,ton the High Court gave its answer against the assessee. Both parties appealed to this Court with certificates. The assessee did not press its appeal.
 In the appeal on behalf of the Revenue it was contended that the Tribunal had found that the shares and securities business carried on by the firm was not taken over by the company and therefore the company was not carrying on the same business as the firm with the result that 'it could not claim the benefit of s. 25(3).
 Dismissing the Revenue's appeal, 
HELD : An assessee to obtain relief under s. 25(3) has to satisfy their condition. Firstly, that the business, profession or vocation must be one on which tax was at any time charged under the 1918 Act. Secondly, the case must be one where them has not been a succession after 1st April 1939 attracting the application of sub-s. (4). Thirdly, the business must be discontinued; such discontinuance amounting to a complete cessation of business and not merely a succession or change of ownership. [1090C] In sub-section (3) there is a clear reference to the business and not to the assessee and therefore the sub- section applies even if the person claiming the relief was not himself charged under the 1918 Act but his predecessor- in-interest was so charged. [1090F] The High Court had taken into consideration the assessment Order for the years 1921-22 and 1922-23 dated the 10th January, 1923 for the 1085 conclusion that the assessee company was taxed on profits on dealings in shares and stocks in respect of those years which in its view showed beyond doubt that the company was trading in shares and securities for the year 1921 immediately after it took over from the firm. Even otherwise also there was sufficient material on the record to hold that the entire business of the firm which included dealing in shares and stocks was taken over by the assessee company as a going concern, that large holdings of stocks and shares were transferred to the assessee company and that there is no evidence to show that for the years 1920-21, 1921-22 and also for subsequent years, the assessee company was not dealing in shares. on the other hand the Statement of the case clearly disclosed that the company purchased in the market during the period 1st January, 1921 and 31st December 1921, shares and stock-, worth Rs. 4,28,05,627 in the ordinary course of its business. The logical inference which arose from the above circumstances was that the assessee company carrying on the same-business as that of the firm including dealing in shares and stocks. There was also no material on, record which would justify the Income- tax Authorities or the Tribunal in coming to the conclusion that the shares and 'stocks which were transferred to the assessees company were only intended to be held as investments. [1093F-1094B] There was no doubt that to Income-tax Officer had omitted for some to include in the income Rs., 9,76,708 being the appreciation of shares and stocks for the accounting year 1921 for which the assessment year is 1922-23, but that is not to say that the assessee cornpany did not deal in shares and stocks in that year. [1094E] In any case irrespective of the question whether the assessee company was dealing in shares after it had taken over the business from the Am, it was clear that the company was, carrying on several other businesses which it had taken over from the firm as a going concern. Even where one or two businesses activities were discontinued after the assessee company took over, nonetheless it would not justify the Court in holding that the business of the firm which was taken over had been discontinued, because under s. 25(3) there is no restriction to the applicability of the exemption only to income on which the tax was payable under any particular head.
