 The respondent-State leased its premises to the appellant for running a hotel and when the lease expired called upon the appellant to hand over vacant possession. On the appellant failing to do so, the Collector issued a notice under s. 4 of the Punjab Public Premises and Land (Eviction and Rent Recovery) Act, 1959 requiring the appellant to show cause why an order of eviction should not be passed under s.
 
5. The appellant thereupon filed a writ petition in the High Court contending that the Act violated Art. 14 of the Constitution in two ways : (1) that it discriminated between the occupants of public premises and those of other premises; and (2) that it discriminated between the occupants of public premises inter se as the State could arbitrarily proceed against an occupant either under the Act or by way of suit. The High Court dismissed the petition holding that the proceeding under the Act is the exclusive remedy for eviction of unauthorised occupants of public premises, that there was a valid classification between the occupiers of public premises and those of private properties, and that, as the Act was substitutive and not supplemental there wag no question of discrimination between the occupiers of public premises inter se.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) The High Court erred in holding that the Act impliedly took away the right of suit by the Government.
 The Act was only intended to provide an additional remedy to the Government which was speedier than the one by way of a suit under the ordinary law of eviction. [404G; 41 1B] (Per Subba Rao, C. J., Shelat and Vaidialingam, JJ.) : The impugned Act is neither in negative terms nor in such terms which result in negativing the right of the Government as a landlord to sue for eviction under. the ordinary law. Nor is it possible to say that the co-existence of the two sets of provisions relating to eviction under the ordinary law and under the Act, leads to any inconvenience or absurdity.
 The impugned Act deals with the Government's right to evict the occupants and tenants of public premises, but that fact, by itself would not lead to the inference that the Legislature intended to take away the Government's right to file a suit for eviction. [404C-E] (Per Hidayatullah and Bachawat, JJ.) : The Act does not create a new right of eviction. it creates an additional remedy for a right existing under the general law and does not repeal the ordinary law giving the remedy of a suit for eviction. [41 1C] (2) By Full Court : There is an intelligible differentia between the two classes of occupiers, namely, occupiers of public property and premises and other occupiers. The classification has a -reasonable relation to the object of the Act and does not offend Art. 14. The two classes of occupiers are not similarly situated in that, in the case of public properties and premises, the members of the public have a vital interest in seeing that such properties 400 and premises are freed from encroachment and unauthorised occupation as speedily as possible; and the impugned Art has properly devised a special machinery for the speedy recovery of premises belonging to the Government.

 (3) (Per Subba Rao, C. J., Shelat and Vaidialingam, JJ.)Sectioii 5 of the Act confers an additional remedy over and above the remedy by way of ,suit. The section violates Art. 14 by providing two alternative remedies to the Government and in leaving it to the unguided discretion of the Collector to resort to one or the other and to pick and choose some of those in occupation of public properties and premises for the application of the more drastic procedure under s. 5. [409F-G] Discrimination Would result if there are two available procedures one more drastic or prejudicial to the party concerned than the other and which can be applied at the arbitrary will of the authority. Assuming that persons in occupation of government properties and premises form a class by themselves as against tenants and occupiers of private owned properties and that such classification is justified on the ground that they require a differential treatment in public interest those who fall under that classification are entitled to equal treatment among themselves.

 (Per Hidayatullah and Bachawat, JJ. dissenting) : The impugned Act makes no unjust discrimination among the occupants of government properties inter se. It promotes public welfare and is a beneficial measure of legislation.
 [414D-E] The impugned Act is not unfair or oppressive. The unauthorised occupant has full opportunity of being heard and of producing his evidence before the Collector; he may obtain a review of the Collector's order by an appeal to the Commissioner and in appropriate cases ask for a writ of certiorari from the High Court. He is not denied equal protection of the laws merely because the Government has the option of proceeding against him either by way of a suit or under the Act. An unauthorised occupant has no cons- itutional right to dictate that the Govrnment should have no choice of proceedings. The argument based upon the option of the Government to file a suit is unreal, because in practice, the Government is not likely to institute a suit in a case when it can seek relief under the Act.
