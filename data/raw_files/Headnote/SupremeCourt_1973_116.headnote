 On July 6, 1963 there was a settlement between the appellant company and two unions of its workmen regarding dearness allowance. On April 1, 1965. there was another settlement in respect of certain demands but the workmen reserved their right to raise demands relating to wage scales, adjustment and dearness allowance. On July 23 1966 the Central Government accepted the recommendations made by the Wage Board-set up by it with effect from April 1, 1966. On November 1, 1966 the appellant and one of the unions of workmen (2nd respondent) entered into a settlement relating to payment of interim reliefas laid down by the Wage Board. The Union agreed not to raise any demandfor dearness allowance till the Wage Board made its final recommendations. This position was reiterated in another settlement between the 2nd respondent and the appellant on May 13, 1967. On May 16, 1967 the third respondent, another union of the appellant's workmen made certain demands regarding dearness allowance. By notices given to the appellant company it terminated the earlier settlements of 1963, 1965, 1966 and 1967 between the appellant and the 2nd respondent. Meanwhile on December 23, 1968/January 3, 1969, the Wage Board made its final recommendations. Since the appellant did not accept the demands of the third respondent and conciliation proceedings also failed the State Government on January 25, 1969 referred the dispute to the Industrial Tribunal. The appellant challenged the validity of the reference in a writ petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution. The High Court dismissed the petition. In appeal by special leave to this Court.
 
HELD The State Government's view that the settlements related only to interim relief was a possible one in the circumstances of this case. Hence it could not be said that the reference made by the State Government was incompetent.
 [244 F-G] None of the settlements entered into by the appellant with its workmen gives any indication that the said settlements were made in view of the statement made by the Minister for Labour, State of Maharashtra. On the other hand every one of the settlements was preceded by a demand made by the union concerned. It was really in the interest of industrial peace that the appellant appeared to have entered into those settlements. Therefore the decisions of this Court in Indo Afghan Agencies and Century Spinning & Manu- facturing Company Ltd. & Anr. did not apply to the case.
 [245G] Union of India & Ors. v. M/s Indo-Afghan Agencies Ltd.
 [1967] INSC 267; [1968] 2 S.C.R. 366 and Century Spinning & Manufacturing Company Ltd. and Anr. v. The Ulhasnagar Municipal Council and Anr., [1970] 3 S.C.R. 854 held inapplicable.
 The question whether there was discrimination between the appellant and another company in the matter of referring the industrial dispute to the Industrial Tribunal was not raised before the High Court and this Court could not go into the question. [246C] In the result the appeal must fail 241 [In respect of the question whether the third respondent had the right to terminate the earlier settlement and whether it represented the majority of workmen in the company, the Court observed that these questions must be decided by the Tribunal.]
