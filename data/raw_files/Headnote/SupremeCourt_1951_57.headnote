 The appellant who inflicted serious injuries on another was charged under s. 307 of the Indian Penal Code but the jury returned a verdict of guilty against him under s. 326 of the Penal Code, and the Sessions Judge, accepting the verdict, convicted him under s. 326. It was contended that the conviction was illegal inasmuch as the offence under s.
 326 was not a minor offence with reference to the offence under s. 307. Held, that as it was open to the Sessions Judge, on the facts of the case, to charge the appellant alternatively under ss. 307 and 326 of the Code the case was covered by s. 237 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and the conviction under s. 328 of the Penal Code was proper, even though there was no charge under the section. Begu v. King Emperor (52 I.A. 191) applied.
 In order that a conviction may be set aside for non- compliance with the provisions of s. 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code, it is not sufficient for the accused merely to show that he was not fully examined as required by the section, but he must also show that such examination has materially prejudiced him.
