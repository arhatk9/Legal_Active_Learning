 The assessee is a charitable trust created under two trusts deeds. One ,of the trustees, gifted certain fully paid up equity shares to the trust. On the said shares dividend accrued on which tax was deducted at source. The trustees claimed that the said income of the assessee was exempt from payment of income-tax in view of s. 4 (3) (i) of the Act and hence they claimed refund of the tax deducted at source.
 The Income-tax Officer refused to grant the refund on the ground that the trust deed did not contain any provision for receipts of gifts from outsiders and so the gift in question was not a valid gift.
 The Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the Tribunal held the gift valid and decided against the revenue. On reference, High Court held that the gift was a valid gift, but it did not have the effect of augmenting the assessee trust and the assessee was not entitled to get the refund of -the tax.
 
HELD : (i)That the gift was a valid gift. The trustees had accepted the gift. The trust deed does not prohibit the trustees from accepting a new gift. The trustees can accept gift from third parties for the purpose of furthering the objectives of the trust. So long as the trust deed did not prohibit from receiving such gifts and so long as the gift made did not in any manner impinge on the objects intended to be achieved by the Trust. In the present case, the shares gifted are vested in the appellant trust and therefore, the trust is entitled to the dividends received in respect of the gifted shares. Since the dividend is exempt from tax under s. 4(3) (i) the appellant is -entitled to the refund claimed. [397 A-D]
