 Section 6A of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 confers power on the Collector of the District to confiscate any essential commodity seized under s.3. Under s. 6C the State Government is required to appoint a judicial authority to entertain and bear appeals against the order of confiscation. The appellate against the order of confiscation. The appellate authority is empowered to modify or annul the order of confiscation.
 On the ground that the licensee had committed a number of irregularities in contravention of the Madhya Pradesh Foodgrains Dealers Licensing Order, 1965, the licensing authority, in addition to cancelling the licence issued to him and forfeiting the security deposit, directed confiscation of the foodgrains seized from the licensee.
 Against that part of the order by which the foodgrains were confiscated, the licensee appealed to the Sessions Judge who was the judicial authority constituted under s. 6C of the Act. Holding that it was not just to confiscate the grains the judicial authority directed sale of the seized grains at controlled rates and refund of the sale price to the licensee. On revision application by the state the High Court held that confiscation was just and proper and restored the Collector's order.
 On further appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the licensee that (i) the judicial authority constituted under s. 6C is not an inferior criminal court subordinate to the High Court and, therefore, is not amenable to its revisional jurisdiction under s. 435 read with s. 439 Cr.
 P. C., 1898 and (ii) that the High Court, in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction, was not justified in interfering with the order of the appellate authority merely because it was of opinion that the confiscation was justified.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) (a) Though the Sessions Judge was appointed as an appellate authority what the State Government did was to constitute an appellate authority in the Sessions Court over which the Sessions Judge presides. The Sessions Court is constituted under the Code of Criminal Procedure and indisputably it is an inferior criminal court in relation to the High Court. Therefore, against an order made under s.
 6C, a revision application would lie to the High Court and the High Court would be entitled to entertain that application under ss. 435 and 439. (fr. P. C. [739 A-B] (a) When the Sessions Judge was appointed a judicial authority it could be said that he was persona designate and was not functioning as a Court. [737 E] (b) The expression 'Judicial' qualifying the word 'authority' clearly indicates that authority alone can be appointed to entertain and hear appeals under s. 6C on which was conferred the judicial power of the State. The expression "judicial power of the State" has to be under- stood in contradistinction to executive power. Under the Constitution courts are the repository of judicial power of the State. By using the expression "judicial authority" in s. 6C it was clearly indicated that the appellate authority must be one such preexisting authority which was exercising judicial power of the State. If any other authority was to be constituted as persona designata there was no purpose in qualifying the word "authority" by the specific adjective "judicial [736 D-F] 733 (c) Secondly the concept of appeal inheres hierarchy and the appellate authority, broadly speaking, would be higher than the authority against whose order the appeal can be entertained. Sessions Judge is the highest judicial officer in the District and this situation would provide material for determining appellate authority. [736 G-H] (d) A look at the legislative history of the Act shows that under the Defence of India Rules, 1962 an appeal against an order of seizure of essential commodities lay to the State Government. Amending Act 25 of 1966 (by which ss. 6A to 6D were added) introduced a basic change which was that an order of confiscation being penal in character a person on whom penalty is imposed is given an opportunity of approaching a judicial authority. While before the amendment an appeal lay to the executive forum, after the amendment an appeal lies to the judicial authority which clearly envisages that a pre-existing judicial authority has to be appointed appellate authority under s. 6C. [737 A-C] (e) A seizure of an essential commodity on the allegation that the relevant licensing order is violated would incur three penalties : (1) cancellation of licence; (2) forfeiture of security deposit; and (3) confiscation of seized commodity. In respect of the first two penalties an appeal lies to the State Government but in respect of the third, though prior to the introduction of s. 6C an appeal lay to the State Government a distinct departure is made in providing an appellate forum which must qualify for the description and satisfy the test of judicial authority. [737 C-D] (f) Even if the judicial authority appointed under s. 6C is the Sessions Judge it would only mean the Judge presiding over the Sessions Court and discharging the functions of that Court. If by the Sessions Judge is meant the Judge presiding over the Sessions Court and that is the appointed appellate authority, the conclusion is inescapable that he was not persona designata which expression is understood to mean a person pointed out or described as an individual as opposed to a person ascertained as a member of a class or as filling a particular character.

 (2) The High Court was not justified in interfering with the order of confiscation. [741 E] (a) The High Court could not have lightly interfered with the order of the Sessions Judge setting aside the confiscation especially in exercise of the revisional jurisdiction under s. 439 without marking out any of the well recognised grounds for interfering in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction. [741 C-D] (b) For the purposes of satisfying itself as to the correctness, legality or propriety of the finding, sentence or order passed or recorded etc., by an interior criminal court the High Court, under s. 435 Cr. P. C. can call for and examine the record of any proceeding. While exercising revisional jurisdiction under s. 439 the High Court has the same power as is conferred on it as a court of appeal under s. 423, subject to certain exceptions. [740 B-C] (c) The revisional jurisdiction of the High Court under s.
 439 appears to be co-extensive with the appellate jurisdiction. In a number of cases this Court held that the revisional jurisdiction conferred upon the High Court under s. 439 is not lightly to be exercised but can be exercised only in exceptional cases where the interest of public justice requires interference or where there is a glaring defect in the procedure or there is a manifest error on point of law and consequently there has been a flagrant miscarriage of justice.

 (d) In the instant case the Sessions Judge, in exercising appellate jurisdiction, examined the penal character of the confiscation order and held that in the circumstances of the case confiscation was not just and proper. The appellate authority had power and jurisdiction to decide the same.
 The High Court, on the other hand, took an altogether different view and held that these defaults should not be lightly viewed,. [741 A-B]
