 The plaintiff filed a money suit claiming rent in respect of certain structures, for the period upto the date of suit and for future rent as damages. It was decreed by the trial court in its entirety, but the High Court negatived the claim for future damages on the sole ground that in a pure money suit, no decree could be granted for recovery of compensation after the date of suit or after the date of decree The plaintiffs then filed a suit claiming damages for the period upto the date of the second suit which included the period for which the claim was disallowed in the first suit. As the total period was more than 3 years, protection from limitation for the period beyond 3 years was claimed under s. 14 of the Limitation Act, 1908, by deducting the time during which the earlier suit was prosecuted, and also on general principles. The cause of action for the two suits was the same and it was found that the previous suit had been prosecuted in good faith and with due diligence.
 
HELD : The plaintiff was entitled to deduct the time during which the earlier suit was pending.
 (Per Shah and Grover, JJ.) : The condition for the applicability of s. 14(1) to, the present case is that the court in which the previous suit was filed should have been unable to entertain the claim relating to future mesne profits, 'from defect of jurisdiction or 'other cause of a like nature'. The words 'other cause of a like nature' must be construed liberally and two constructions have been placed upon the words. (a) In Nrityamoni Dassi v. Lakhan Chandra, I.L.R. [1916] 43 Cal. 660 (P..C.) it was held that if there was an effective decree by a competent court capable of being enforced until it was set aside, the period of litigation of that suit was deductible from the period of limitation 'for a second suit filed for that same relief;
 and (b) in Jaikishan Singh v. Peoples Bank, I.L.R. [1944] Lah. 451 (F.B.) it was held that the defect must have been of such a character as to make it impossible for the court to entertain the suit or application in its inception, or at any rate, prevent it from deciding the matter on merits, [400 G-H; 401 C; 402 B, F-G] In the present case, either of the tests is applicable, because, (a) In the earlier money suit the trial court had passed a decree for recovery of future mesne profits, which was effective till the High Court set it aside; or (b) It could not be said that the previous money suit was altogether misconceived, and therefore, the defect in it was of such a nature that it had to be decided before the claim could be disposed of on merits.
 [403 E] Makhan Lal Madak v. Girish Chandra 66 C.W.N. 692. referred to.
 The general principle deduced in Narayan Jivaji Patil v.
 Khandappagauda Patil, I.L.R. [1939] Bom. 173, from various pronouncements of the Privy Council that where a claim- was satisfied either by 398 agreement of parties or by a decree of court, and if the satisfaction or the decree was set aside subsequently in a judicial proceeding a fresh cause of action would accrue in favour of the claimant, was not relied upon because, s.
 14(1) was applicable to the present case. [404 A-B, C] (Per Hegde, J.) : Section 14(1) in terms does not apply, but in Mst. Ranee Surno Moyee v. Shooshee Mukhee, 12 M.I.A. 244 it was held by the Judicial Committee that a claim which is satisfied, an expression held to include even getting a decree on a claim, if reopened because of the decree of the appellate court or otherwise, a new cause of action accrues to the plaintiff on the date the earlier satisfaction is taken away. This view has field the field for a long time and it is not in public interest to disturb it. Applying the rule to the facts of the present case, a new cause of action must be deemed to have accrued to the plaintiff in respect of the mesne profits under dispute on the date the decree of the trial court was set aside by the High Court.
