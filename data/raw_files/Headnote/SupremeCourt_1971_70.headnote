 The appellant, who was the mortgagee purchased under two sale deeds dated 13th May, 1951 the mortgaged property in discharge of the mortgage. The respondents, who were the daughters of the original owner filed a suit claiming title to the property under gift deeds executed by their mother with respect to a share, (which she got under a sale deed from her husband) and by their father on 2nd May 1951, in respect of the entire property, and alleging that the sale deeds in favour of the appellant were collusive. The trial court held that the gift deed executed by the mother was valid but that the gift deed executed by the father was fraudulent and not binding on the appellant. On appeal, the first appellate court held that both-the gift deeds were invalid. It held that the mother had lost her right to her share, that the gift deed executed by the. father was antedated having been in fact executed after 13th May, 1951, and that it was intended to defeat the sale in favour of the appellant. It also held that a judgment in another matter inter parties, delivered during the pendency of the appeal, operated as res judicata. It held that the gift deed by the father was antedated on the grounds, (i) it was belatedly registered on 23rd August 1951 and (ii) the register of the petition-writer who wrote the gift deed was not produced thus raising a presumption against the respondents. In second appeal, the High Court held that the lower courts erred in deciding the case on the grounds of fraud or antedating when no such case was put forward in the pleadings, that on the question of res judicata there was not enough material, and that the case should be, remanded permitting the parties to make amendments, in their pleadings but only in respect of the plea of res judicata.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended that : (1) the High Courtwas not justified in setting aside the findings of the first appellate court that the gift deed executed by the father was fraudulent and ante-dated; (2) the appellant should have been given an opportunity to amend the, written statement so as to include pleas in respect of the fraudulent nature and antedating; and (3) the High Court in fact had set aside all the findings and therefore its order permitted the appellants to raise new plea& by amending the pleadings.
 
HELD : (1) (a) The pleadings in the written statement did not indicate that the appellant put forward the case that the gift deed was executed by the father after May 13, 1951 and that it was ante-dated. Not only was there no substance of such pleas there was not even a hint of such objections in the pleadings, and even the facts necessary for determining the, questions were not before the court. Even the parties and the trial court did not understand the pleadings as containing a plea that the gift deed was antedated and fraudulent in the sense of having been executed to defeat and delay the creditors of the father of the respondents. No issue, 930 was framed on the question of fraud or antedating. Even in the course of evidence no questions were put on behalf of the appellant to the witnesses of the respondents suggesting such fraud or antedating. The question of the gift deed being fraudulent was raised for the first time before the trial court in the course of arguments after the parties had already concluded their evidence. [934 B-D; 935 B-D; 937 E] Therefore, there was no justification for the trial court to go into the question and record its finding. [935 D] Nagubai Ammal v. B. Shama Rao, [1956] INSC 33; [1956] S.C.R. 451; Kunju Kesavan v. M. M. Phillip, [1963] INSC 140; [1964] 3 S.C.R. 634, Kidar Lall Seal v. Hari Lall Seal, [1951] INSC 59; [1952] S.C.R. 179 and Union of India v. M/s. Khas Karanapura Colliery .Ltd. [1968] INSC 104; [1968] 3 S.C.R. 784, referred to.
 (b) The first appellate court committed a similar error in affirming this finding of the trial court and committed a greater error in going into the question whether the gift deed was antedated, because, the plea was raised for the first time before it only in the course of arguments. The delay in registration was not explained by the respondents because the plea,was not raised in the trial court and was raised for the first time at the appellate stage. The register of the petition-writer was not a document maintained by or in possession of the respondents. Its non- production could only affect the evidence of petition- writer, but even if his evidence was not relied upon no finding of ante-dating could be given when there was no assertion and no evidence on behalf of the appellants. [935 E-F; 936 E-H] (c) Further, the appellant was the only creditor or of the respondents' father and the gift in respect of the properties already mortgaged could not in any way defeat or delay his right because the done could only take the properties subject to the mortgage. [935 G-H] (d) The plea that the mother lost her right to her share of the property and that her husband acquired the right was immaterial, because, even if her gift deed was disregarded the title to the properties was acquired by the respondents through the gift deed executed by the father. [939 D-E].
 (2) The pleas regarding the fraudulent nature and ante- dating of the gift deed, should not be allowed to raised by amendment because, a suit based on such pleas would be time barred and it would be unfair to the respondents to allow these pleas to be raised by amendment at such a late stage.
 The pleas of fraud and antedating in respect of the gift deed raise an entirely new cause of action and a case quite different from that pleaded in the original written statement. It would not be merely a case of a different or additional approach to facts already given in the written state ment. [941 B-C] L. J. Leach & Company Ltd. v. Jardine Skinner, & Co.
 [1957] INSC 4; [1957] S.C.R. 438 and A. K. Gupta & Sons v. Damodar Valley Corporation [1965] INSC 179; [1966] 1 S.C.R. 796. referred to.
 (3) In directing that the findings of both courts are set aside the High ,Court was only referring to the points which it considered and on, which it differed from the lower courts. Therefore, in permitting amendments the High Court had given only liberty to the appellant to amend his written statement by setting out the requisite particulars and details of his plea of res judicata and other amendments which relate to the plea of res judicata, 93 1 The permission to amend could not be interpreted as giving liberty to the appellant to raise any new pleas which were not raised at the initial stage.
