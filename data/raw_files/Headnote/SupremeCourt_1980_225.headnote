 Allowing the appeal by special leave, the Court ^ 
 HELD : (1) The recommendation by the High Court regarding its satisfaction that the appellant should be compulsorily retired, and the consequent order of the State Government, acting on that recommendation is invalid. The copy of an order-sheet dated 24th January, 1978 in Criminal Appeal No. 1021 of 1972 containing serious criticism of the manner in which the appellant had disposed of the sessions case was not communicated to him at all, although placed on the personal confidential file of the appellant. Further the two confidential reports made by two successive Chief Justices in respect of the appellant for overlapping periods ex facie do not agree with each other. One report dated 24th February, 1978 pertains to the year ending February, 1978 and contains general observations favourable to the appellant or other dated 12th July, 1978 pertains to the period 4th November, 1977 to March, 1978-a good part of which period is covered by the first report-and the detailed evaluation shows that the appellant was an undesirable officer. [300E-H, 301A-D] (2) The power to compulsory retire a Government servant is a power which may be exercised in various contingencies.

 (3) When considering the question of compulsory retirement, while it is no doubt desirable to make an overall assessment of the Government servant's record, more than ordinary value should be attached to the confidential reports pertaining to the years immediately preceding such consideration. It is possible that a Government servant may possess a somewhat erratic record in the early years of service, but with the passage of time he may have so greatly improved that it would be of advantage to continue him in service up to the statutory age of superannuation. Whatever value the confidential reports of earlier years may possess, those pertaining to the later years are not only of direct relevance but also of utmost importance. [300C-E] R. L. Butail v.
