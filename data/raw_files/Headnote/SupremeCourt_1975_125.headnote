 The appellant filed a writ petition before the High Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution impugning the order of the Deputy Director of Consolidation. The High Court dismissed he petition in limine but granted a certificate under Art. 133(1)(a) on the basis of valuation.
 On appeal to this Court, the respondent raised a preliminary objection that the certificate granted was not valid because the judgment of the High Court was one affirming the judgment of the Deputy Director, Consolidation.
 Setting aside the order of the High Court, 
HELD :The certificate granted by the High Court is competent. An order of a High Court under Art. 226 or 227 is an order in a civil proceeding of a High Court and so falls under Art. 133. But it cannot be said that such cases a party is exercising any right of appeal conferred on him by any statute nor is the High Court exercising any power of appeal. Whatever might be the position even in respect of petitions under Arts. 226 or 227 of the Constitution where the Court goes into the merits of the question, it cannot be doubted that where it dismisses such a petition in limine it simply refuse,,; to exercise its powers under Art. 226 or 227 and such an order cannot be said to be an order passed on appeal or as affirming the decision of the Court.
 immediately below. Therefore, the order of the High Court in the present case is not a judgment of affirmance. [427F, 427AB] Abdul Majid v.

 (2) The order of the Deputy Director of Consolidation is not clear and since the High Court dismissed the appellants petition in limine the reasons which led the High Court to dismiss are not known. Hence it is necessary that the High Court should deal with the petition before it and dispose of it by a proper order. [427 GH]
