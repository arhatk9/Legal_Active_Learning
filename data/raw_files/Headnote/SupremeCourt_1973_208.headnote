 The PSP and SSP were national parties with the election symbols 'Hut' and 'Tree', respectively. in May, 1971 there was a merger of the two parties. and the 'United Party' was known as the Socialist Party. The Election Commission was informed about the merger, and the Chief Election Commissioner, in November, 1971, held that the Socialist Party was a National Party for the purposes of the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968, and-that the symbol 'Tree' should be exclusively reserved and allotted to it. Thereafter, the appellant. and his group decided to dissolve this unity and they requested the Chief Election Commissioner to hold that there was a rebirth of the Socialist Party to be called the SSP and that the 'Tree' symbol may be allotted to the reborn SSP. The Socialist Party opposed this request. The Chief Election Commissioner, after considering the matter, held that the appellant's party now calling itself SSP could not be the old SSP but was a new party, and that the new SSP could not claim the 'Tree symbol for itself. In pursuance of the findings, he issued a notification, under paragraph 17 of 1968-Order, mentioning the Socialist Party as a National Party with 'Tree as its symbol.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended, (1) that the case was covered by ,paragraph 15 of the 1968-Order which deals with a case where rival sections of a recognised political party claim to be that party; (2) the case fell within the scope of rr. 5 and 10 of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, and paragraph 18 of the 1968-Order, and (3) as the Chief Election Commissioner did not hold any inquiry regarding the allegiance of the majority of members, his order was void.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) Paragraph 15 of the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968, is not attracted to the facts of the present case. [275D] A new political party is formed by the joining together of at least one recognised political party and another political party. The newly formed political party may apply for recognition to the Election Commission under Paragraph 16 of the Order. After due hearing, the Election Commission may recognise the newly formed political party either as a National Party or as a State Party and may allot a symbol to it. The decision of the Commission is binding on the newly formed political party and all the components units thereof.
 The expression "joining to gather in the paragraph is used in its broad meaning. There is nothing in the context to restrict its meaning to a case of merger of two or more political parties and their resultant extinction on the formation of a new political Party. The use of the expression "all the component units thereof", shows that it will also embrace a case of two or more political parties agreeing to form or federating into a new political party while retaining their separate identities. The expression 'joining together' also includes a third type of case where two or more politicAL parties, after deciding to destroy their separate identities, have brought into existence a new political party, even though the process of extinction was not formally completed or was invalid and ineffective. In such a case, they retain their separate identities and will be deemed to be component units of the new party. In the second and third types of cases also when the Commission has given recognition to the new formed political party as a National Party or a State Party and has allotted a symbol to it, his order will be binding on them since they are component units of the new party. [274D-275D] In the present case, the appellant's group did not claim the Socialist Party already recognised. The case set up by the appellant's group was that the 2 66 Socialist Party had-been dissolved and that a new Socialist party was. reborn. Admittedly there are important differences between the reborn SSP and the Socialist Party recognised by the Chief Election Commissioner. Their flags, their constitutions and their membership are all different.
 [275D-F] Sadiq Ali v. Election Commission of India, [1972] 2 S.C.R.
 318, referred to.
 (2)(a) Rule 5 of the Conduct of Election Rules, deals with the case where the Election Commission specifies the symbols that may be chosen by candidates in parliamentary and assembly constituencies. Rule 10(4) will apply only in a case where the Returning Officer is considering the choice of a symbol expressed by a contesting candidate in his nomination paper. These rules will not apply to the present case. Further, the provisions of paragraph 16 of the Order will prevail over rr. 5 and 10, because, they are expressly subject to any general or special directions or restrictions issued by the Election Commission. The Order had been made by the Election Commission in exercise of its powers under Art. 324 of the Constitution read with rr. 5 and 10 of the Conduct of Election Rules. [271H; 276C-D] (b) Paragraph 18(b) of the Order provides that the Commission may issue instructions and directions for the removal of any difficulty which may arise in relation to the implementation of the provisions of the Order. In the present case, no difficulty could arise in regard to the implementation of paragraph 16 of the Order. Assuming that the merger of the SSP in the Socialist Party was not a valid and accomplished fact on the date when the symbol 'Tree' was allotted to the Socialist Party and that the old SSP had been enjoying a ceaseless existence, even then, the SSP is bound by the decision of the Chief Election Commissioner under paragraph 16(2), because, it would be regarded as a component unit of the Socialist Party. [275F-H] (3)It is not necessary on this view to decide whether the SSP had merged in the Socialist Party and lost its separate identity and whether the association of the two parties could be dissolved by a majority.
