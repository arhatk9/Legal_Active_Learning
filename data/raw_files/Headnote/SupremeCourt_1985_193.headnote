 The Saurashtra Terminal Tax and Octroi Ordinance No. 47 of 1949 was promulgated and brought into force with effect from 31.8.1949, to enable the State Government to levy and collect octroi duty in specified cities and towns and other local areas of the State and to pass on the duty so collected to those cities and towns, until Municipalities therein were constituted under the Bombay District Municipalities Act, 1901 and those Municipalities made their own rule and bye-laws enabling them to levy and collect octroi. Section 3 of the Ordinance empowered the State Government to impose octroi duty in towns and cities specified in Schedule I thereto, and the town of Dharangadhra came to be included therein subsequently under a notification with effect from 26.12.49.
 The respondent-Municipality by its Resolution dated 30.3.53 enhanced the prevailing rate of octroi duty by 50% without complying with the provisions of sections 60 to 62 of Chapter VII of G the Bombay District Municipalities Act, 1901. The appellant challenged the enhancement in the rate of octroi duty by filing a writ petition, and also filed a suit for refund of the excess amount recovered from it for the period ending September 30, 1961. The High Court dismissed the petition and upheld the enhancement, taking the view that while enhancing the rate of 758 octroi, the Respondent-Municipality had followed the procedure prescribed by the Bombay Act for imposing the octroi and that the enhanced imposition was not under Ordinance No. 47 of 1949.
 On appeal, this Court held that the enhanced imposition of duty by the Respondent-Municipality was illegal as the mandatory provisions of sections 60 to 62 of the Bombay Act, had neither been complied with or could the enhanced levy be justified under Ordinance No. 47 of 1949, because the State Government alone had the power thereunder to impose the duty or prescribe its rate and not the Respondent-Municipality.
 To get over the effect of this Court's decision a validating Act being Gujarat Act No. 6 of 197 was passed where under the imposition of octroi levy and collection thereof prior to 30.4.65 was validated.
 During the pendency of the writ petition in the High Court, the Respondent-Municipality proceeded to frame its own octroi Rules and Bye-laws under the Bombay Act after complying with all the procedural steps. The Respondent- Municipality passed a Resolution on 17.12.63 approving the draft Rules and Bye-laws. The Divisional Commissioner sanctioned the draft Rules and Bye-laws, However, on March 10, 1965 the State Government issued a Corrigendum to the sanction that had already been accorded with a view to rectify certain printing or typographical errors that had come to the notice of the Respondent-Municipality.
 Thereafter, the Respondent-Municipality passed a General Board Resolution dated 29.3.1965 resolving to bring into force these Rules and Bye-laws called: "The Dharangadhra Municipality Octroi Rules and Octroi Bye Laws" with effect from 1.5.65, and the requisite Notification was published.
 By the aforesaid Octroi Rules and Bye-laws, 1965 the Respondent-Municipality increased the octroi rates by 12.1/2% on all the goods brought within the Municipal limits of Dharangadhra and also made some changes in the classification of goods so brought in; and issued bills of octroi payable every month. Feeling aggrieved by this action of the Respondent-Municipality, the Appellant filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging the levy of Octroi at the enhanced rate, which was dismissed.
 In the appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellants: (1) That since the exemption from the operation of the Octroi Ordinance No. 47 of 1949 as contemplated by Rules 3 as well as Bye-law 3 was not granted by the State Government, the Municipal Octroi Rules and Octroi Bye-Laws 1965 could not be said 759 to have come into force, and the Respondent-Municipality had no authority or power to bring them into force with effect from 1.5.65, and therefore, the levy to the extent of the enhanced rate was bad in Law. (2) That the impugned Octroi Rules and Bye-Laws were framed by the Respondent- Municipality under the Bombay Act, and sanction thereto had also been accorded by the Divisional Commissioner under the Bombay Act on 22nd April 1964, but since the Bombay Act was repealed by Section 279(i) of the Gujarat Act with effect from 1.1.65, and since these Octroi Rules and Bye-Laws were not brought into force before the repeal of the Bombay Act they would have no force of law as sub-section (2) of section 279 of the Gujarat Act does not save them, because under clause (vi) of sub-section (2) of section 279 only such Rules and Bye-Laws framed under the Repealed Act which were immediately in force prior to 1.1.65 would stand saved.
 (3) That the Corrigendum to the Octroi Rules and Bye-Laws issued by the Gujarat Government on 10.3.65 was not by way of purely correcting typographical or printing errors but virtually amounted to a modification of the Rules and Bye- Laws without following the procedure de novo and, therefore, the impugned Octroi Rules and Bye-Laws could not be said to be valid and could not be brought into force.
 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: 1.(a) It cannot be disputed that the subject matter dealt with by the Ordinance and the Government Rules framed thereunder was levy and collection of octroi duty and the subject matter dealt with by the Bombay Act and the Municipal Rules and Bye-laws framed thereunder is also levy and collection of octroi duty. Both the pieces of legislation, validly enacted and intended to operate within the Municipal limits of the Respondent-Municipality, dealt with the same subject matter. In such a situation of there 18 repugnancy between the two pieces of legislation, to such an extent that both cannot stand together and operate simultaneously, the later will have the effect of impliedly repealing the former. [766 A-C] Repeal by implication 18 not ordinarily favoured by the Courts But the principle, on which the rule of implied repeal rests, is that if the provisions of a later enactment are 80 inconsistent with or repugnant to the provisions of an earlier one that the two cannot stand together, the earlier is repealed by the later enactment is applied. [766 D] Kutner v. Phillips,[1891] 2 Q.B. 267 at 272. Zaverbai Amaidas v. The State of Bombay [1955] 1 S.C.R. 799 referred to.
 760 In the instant case, the two pieces of legislation are so inconsistent with or repugnant to each other that both cannot stand together and such repugnancy arises from (a) the conferal of power to levy duty on two different bodies, namely, the State Government under the Ordinance, and the municipality under the appropriate Act, and obviously the exercise of the power concurrently by both the bodies would be incongruous and entirely destructive of the object for which the power was conferred, and (b) the enhanced rate of duty prescribed by the Municipal Rules and Bye-laws. Having regard to such repugnancy obtaining between the two pieces of legislation dealing with the same Subject matter the later in point of time will have the effect of displacing the former by necessary implication. That such implied repeal or displacement was within the contemplation of the legislative authority which issued the Ordinance of 1949 is amply clear if regard is had to the object with which the Ordinance came to be promulgated to enable the State Government to levy and collect octroi duty, in the state of Saurashtra and to pass on the duties so collected by it those towns and cities until Municipalities therein were constituted under the appropriate Act and those Municipalities made their own Rules and Bye-laws enabling them to levy and collect octroi and other usual Municipal taxes. [767 D-H] 2.(a) The Municipal Octroi Rules and Bye-laws were validly made by the respondent Municipality on 17.12.63 by following the procedure prescribed by the Bombay Act, whereafter these were forwarded to the Divisional Commissioner who made some suggestions which were accepted by the respondent-Municipality and ultimately by order dated 22.4.64 sanctioned the Rules and Bye-laws. Up to this stage everything was validly done under the Bombay Act prior to its repeal on 1.1.65. Under clause (vi) of sub-section (2), any order made and which was in force immediately before the commencement of the Gujarat Act has been saved, inasmuch it was provided that such order shall be deemed to have been made under the Gujarat Act and will continue to operate until modified or rescinded by another order passed under the Gujarat Act. [770 E-G] (b) What is saved by the order of sanction dated 22.4.64 are the sanctioned Rules and Bye-laws. Clause (vi) uses both the expressions, 'order' and 'Rule and Bye-law' separately and distinct from each other but such separate or distinctive use is conceivably made to cover different situations. In a case where the order that is saved happens to be an order sanctioning rules and Bye-Laws, the two will have to be regarded as part and parcel 761 of a single INSTRUMENT which is saved in its entirety. What is saved under clause (vi) of sub-section (2) of section 219 are the sanctioned MunicipaI Octroi Rules and Bye-laws 1965.

 3. The material on record clearly shows that the Corrigendum dated 10.3.1965 was issued with a view to rectify typographical errors or mistakes that bad crept in the typed copies of the Rules and Bye-laws forwarded to the Divisional Commissioner which had come to the w dice of the Respondent-Municipality. Even the omission of sub-rule (5) of Rule 5 in the copies forwarded appears to be an inadvertent typographical mistake. 1772 E
