 The respondent, Who was elected to the State Legislative Assembly. was, at the time of filing nominations, Chairman of the Board of School Education of the State. having been nominated by the State Government under the Himachal Pradesh Board of School Education Act, 1969. The Board passed a resolution, fixing a scale of pay for the post, but the order appointing the respondent made it clear that he was appointed only in an honorary capacity. On the question whether he was holding an office of profit under the State Government and as such was disqualified for election under Art. 191 (1) (a) of the Constitution, 
HELD:(1) The Chairman of the Board is an office under the State Government but it is not an office of profit. The test for deciding whether the first respondent was holding an office of profit is whether he can sue for or otherwise claim the scale of pay fixed by the resolution of the Board.
 In the face of the order of appointment such a claim would not be upheld. [750G; 752F-G] (2)Assuming that the post itself carried a scale of pay the holding of the office has not resulted in any profit to the first respondent. It is not even a case where the Chairman was appointed to an office and a salary was provided by the order of appointment, and he gave up his right to the salary. [751A-C] (3) Further. the Board was not competent to fix a scale of pay for the Chairman: [751D] (a)Section 10(18) of the Act does not enable the Board to fix the scale of pay, because, fixing the scale of pay of the Chairman cannot be said to be an act ancillary to any of the purposes mentioned in cls. (1) to (17) of the section or, to be one for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of the Act. [751D-E] (b)Section 23(4), which enables the Board to make regulations regarding qualifications, conditions of service and scales of pay of officers and servants of the Board other than Secretary, Deputy Secretary and Assistant Secretary, would apply only to officers lower in rank than the, officers mentioned. Otherwise, the Act, while conferring on the Government the power to specify the condi- tion of service including the scale of pay of Assistant Secretary, Deputy Secretary and Secretary, would be leaving to the Board to determine the scale of pay of the Chairman by clubbing him along with Officers and servants of the Board lower in rank than an Assistant Secretary. [751F-752A] (c)Section 26(2)(i) which relates to the power of the Board to make regulations for the appointment of officers.
 clerks and other servants and the conditions of their service. cannot cover the Chairman, because, there is no question of the Board being competent to deal with the appointment or conditions of service of the Chairman. [752C] (d)Section 26(2)(p) which speaks of the emoluments and allowances of the members of the Board and all its committees, cannot refer to the Chairman, because, under the Act, there is a distinction between the Chairman and members. [752C-D] 750 (e)Moreover, though generally speaking. the Pay of a person can be said to be his emoluments the emoluments and allowances referred to in cl. (p) cannot refer to a scale of pay, because, the Act does not contemplate any scale of pay for members. [752D-E]
