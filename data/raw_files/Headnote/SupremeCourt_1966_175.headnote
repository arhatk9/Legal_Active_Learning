 The settlement of an excise shop in Dibrugarh area with the respondent was challenged before the Board of Revenue in an appeal by the appellant. The Board held that the respondent was not a suitable person because as a forest contractor and holder of a firewood mahal licence, he had compounded an offence of illegally felling green trees by paying com- pensation. The respondent filed a writ petition and the High Court relied on s. 345(6) Cr. P.C. in holding that the compounding of the offence had the effect of an acquittal with the result that once the offence was compounded the Board was not entitled to take into account the propriety or otherwise of the conduct of the respondent. In appeal to this Court, the appellant contended that (i) s. 345(6) Cr.P.C., had no application to an offence under the Assam Forest Regulation 7 of 1891, and (ii) that the Board was right in considering the respondent's conduct in rendering compensation for a forest offence.
 HELD.The appeal must be allowed.
 (i) The High Court was not right in coming to the conclusion that the effect of s. 62 of the Assam Regulation was the same as that of s. 345(6) Cr. P.C. and that no moral turpitude of any description could be said to be involved in the case. In effect the payment of compensation by the respondent amounted to his acceptance of the charge against him. Section 62(2) of the Assam Regulation only protected him with regard to further proceeding, but had not the effect of clearing his character or vindicating his conduct.
 [451 A-B; 452 B] If a person is charged with an offence, then unless there is some provision for compounding of it the law must take its course and the charge enquired into resulting either in conviction or acquittal. If the composition of an offence was permissible in law, the effect of such composition would depend cm what the law provided for. If the effect of composition is to amount to an acquittal then it may be said that no stigma should attach to the Character of the person, but unless it is expressly provided for the mere rendering of compensation would not amount to the vindication of the character of the person charged with the offence. [451 H] (ii) The High Court was not justified in quashing the appellate order of the Board under Art. 226 of the Constitution. The Board had not gone wrong in law in considering the respondent's conduct in rendering compensation for a forest offence. The Board therefore could be said to have exceeded its jurisdiction under the law or committed an error apparent on the face of the record. [453 A] Nagendra Nath Bora & Anr. v.
