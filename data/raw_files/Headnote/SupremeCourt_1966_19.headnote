 The appellant was a registered co-operative Housing Society, registered under the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960. S, respondent no. 4, applied for membership of the society but this was refused. He appealed under s. 23(2) of the Act to the Deputy Registrar Co-operative societies who decided in his favour. The appellant filed an application before the State Government for revision purporting to be under s. 154 of the Act which was rejected on the ground that Government had no revisional jurisdiction against orders under s. 23(3). The appellant then went to the High Court under Arts. 226 and 227 and failing there also came to this Court by special leave. The questions that fell to be decided were. (i) Is the finality under s. 23(3) subject to s. 154 and (ii) Has a. party a right to move the State Government under s. 154 ? 
HELD : (i) There is no doubt that s. 154 is potential but not compulsive. Power is reposed in Government to intervene to do justice when occasion demands it and of the occasion for its exercise Government is made sole judge. This power can be exercised in all cases except in a case in which a similar power has already been exercised by the Tribunal under s. 149(9) of the Act. The exception was considered necessary because the legality or propriety of an order having been considered once,, it would be an act of superetogation to consider the matter twice. it follows, therefore, that Government can exercise its powers under s.
 154 in all cases with one exception only, and that the finality of the order under s. 23(3) does not restrict the exercise of the power. The word 'final' in this context means that the order is not subject to an ordinary appeal or revision but it does not touch the special power legislatively conferred on Government, 'Me Government was in error in considering that it had no jurisdiction in this case for it obviously had.

 (ii)The fact that s. 154 does not expressly permit a party to invoke the revision jurisdiction under that section does not mean that a party is prohibited from moving the Government. But as Government is not compelled to take action, unless it thinks fit the party who moves the Government cannot claim that he has a right of appeal or revision. On the other hand Government should welcome such applications because they draw its attention to cases in some of which it may be interested to intervene. [371 F] 366 Sheffield Corporation v.
