 The plaintiffs and defendants were the descendants of a common ancestor who left behind vast movable and immovable properties and several business assets. On 9th December, 1932, each of the eight sons of the common ancestor executed a document conveying his share of property to the appellant Company stating that he was executing the document as Karta of the joint family consisting of himself and his sons. The suit by the plaintiffs (who were the son and wife of one of the sons) for setting aside all conveyances and transfers and for a declaration that they were entitled to separate properties and funds was decreed by the trial Court.
 The High Court dismissed the appeal holding that the family consisting of the common ancestor and his sons was a joint family until his death and thereafter his sons and grandsons continued to be joint until the institution of tile suit.
 It rejected the plea that even if the family was joint, the transfers were for better management of the immovable property and so would bind the joint family members.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended that the original joint family became divided into eight different families on 9th December, 1932 and that even assuming that there was no disruption of the joint family, since the impugned alienations were as a result of the unanimous decision of all the sons, they were valid because they were for the benefit of the family.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : The family became divided in status sometime before 1932. In any event the division' in status was effected in 1932. Even if there was a joint family in existence, since the transactions were for the benefit of the family, the other coparceners cannot challenge its validity. [269A-B] (a)The effect of the documents is that there were eight different joint families consisting of each of the sons and his-sons and that the properties, which were owned by several sons, were transferred to a company consisting of themselves alone. Even if the recitals in the document do not prove separation of status before the date of the document, they make it clear that the eight sons 'who were acting as Kartas of their sons and grandsons were transferring the properties to a company consisting of themselves alone. Though it may not be in the nature of a family settlement, this transaction had the effect of bringing about a separation in status and the members entered into the transaction as co-tenants. [265F-H] (b)It is well-established that the power of a manager of joint Hindu family to alienate joint family property is analogous to that of a manager for an infant heir. The manager of a joint Hindu family has power to alienate for value joint family property, so as to bind the interest of both adult and minor conarceners in the property, provided that the alienation is made for legal necessity or for the benefit of estate. [266E-F] Hunooman Persaud v. Musummat Baboose [1856] 6 Moo. I.A. 393 referred to (c) The transactions being for the benefit of the family, they would be binding on all the coparceners. The transactions while were entered into by all the 262 eight sons and adult coparceners of the eight branches were clearly the result of joint deliberations and unanimous decisions of all the adult members. [267D-E] (d)The question whether an alienation is for the benefit of the family Would depend upon the facts of each case. One view is that unless it is of a defensive nature calculated to protect the estate from some threatened danger or destination, it cannot be said to be for the benefit of the estate, the other is that it is sufficient if it is such as a prudent owner, or trustee would have carried out with the knowledge available to him at the time of the transaction.
 [266F-G] In the instant case, the purpose of the transactions wag to protect the properties for the benefit of the members of the family, and to prevent any member of the family from selling away any share of the property by transfer or mortgage.
 There was, therefore, no dissipation of the property. [267A- B] Bal Mukand v. Kamla Vati and Others, [1964] INSC 16; [1964] 6 S.C.R. 321, referred to.
