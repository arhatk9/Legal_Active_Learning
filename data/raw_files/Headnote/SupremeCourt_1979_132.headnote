 On the allegations that one Padam Singh was shot dead in the farm of the appellant by Doongar Singh and two others on 4-3-1978, that the appellant's car No. R.J.F. 2118 was made use of in carrying the dead body to be thrown into a well on the boundary of village Ramasani by Doongar Singh who latter brought the car back on the same day to the appellant's bungalow where it was washed the same day and thereafter the appellant got his car washed on 8-3-1978 at the Petrol Pump of one Umraokhan, the Sessions Judge framed a charge against the appellant of an offence under Section 201, Penal Code merely on the ground that there was material to show that the appellant got his car washed on 8-3-1978 at a petrol pump. The High Court refused to set aside the said order in revision under Section 482 Crl. P.C. 1973.
 Allowing the appeal by special leave, the Court, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The impugned order of Sessions Judge being based on evidential material whatever was manifestly illegal. [150A] (a) The mere washing of the car on 8th March could not be prima facie evidence of the factual ingredients of an offence under Section 201, Penal Code. [150A] (b) The presence of blood stains on the car on the 8th March stood negatived by the Prosecution's own assertion (in the Police Challan) that Doongar Singh had got the blood on the car washed on the day of the murder, itself, and [194G- H] (c) there was nothing in the statements of the Petrol Pump dealer and his servant that there was any blood on the car which was washed. There was not an iota of material on the record to furnish basis even for a grave suspicion that by getting the car washed on the 8th March, 1978, the appellant caused any blood or other evidence concerning the murder of Padam Singh to disappear.
