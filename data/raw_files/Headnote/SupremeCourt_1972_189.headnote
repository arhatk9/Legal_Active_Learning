 The assessee was a managing director of a company. Article 139 of the articles of association of the company enjoins that notwithstanding anything contained in the articles the managing director is expressly allowed generally to work for and contract with the company and specifically to do the work of an agent and manager and also to do other work for the company on such terms and conditions and on such remuneration as may from time to time be agreed upon between him and the directors of the company. Article 142 provides that the managing director shall work for the execution of the decisions that may be arrived at by the Board of from time to time and shall be empowered to do all that may be necessary in the execution of the decision of the management of the company and shall do all things usually necessary or desirable in the management of affairs of the company or carrying out its objects. Several clauses of article 140 specifically empower the Board of Directors to exercise control over the managing director. Under the terms of tile agreement entered into between the assessee and the company the managing director was appointed for 20 years but he could be removed within that period if he did not discharge his work diligently, or, if he was found not to be acting in the interest of the company. Under the agreement, in addition to monthly salary, car allowance, free board and lodging he was also to receive 10% of the gross profits of the company as commission. For the assessment year 1956-57, the assessee gave up the amount representing the 10% of gross profits, because, the company would not be making net profits if the stipulated commission was paid to him, And, claimed that the amount so given up was not liable to be included in hi,. total income. The Income-tax Officer, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, The Tribunal and the High Court, on reference, held that the amount was taxable as 'salary' under s. 7 of the Indian Income-tax Act. 1922, which includes commission.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The assessee had to exercise his powers under the agreement within the terms and limitations prescribed under the articles of association and subject to the control and supervision of the directors, This is indicative of his being employed as a servant of the company, and therefore, the remuneration payable to him was salary within the meaning of section 7. [995G-H; 996A-B] (a) The nature of the particular business and the nature of the duties of the employee should be considered in each case in order to arrive at a conclusion as to whether the person employed is a servant or an agent, and, it is not possible to lay down any precise rule of law to distinguish one kind of employment from the other. [989D- F] (b) A managing director has the dual capacity of a director as well as an employee, and whether he is the one or the other depends upon 986 the articles of association and, the terms of his employment. Anderson v. James Sutherland (Peterhead) Limited, [1941] S.C. 203., 218, referred to, [989G; 990B] (c)Whether a person employed by a company is a servant or an agent is not solely dependent on tile extent of supervision and control exercised on him. The control which the company exercises over the assessee need not necessarily be one which tells him what to do from day to day. Nor does supervision imply that it should be a continuous cise of the power to oversee or superintend the work to be done.
 [993F-F; 995D-F] (d)In the present case, a perusal of the articles and terms and conditions of the agreement definitely indicate that the assessee was appointed to manage, the business of the company in terms of the articles of association and within the powers prescribed therein. The control and supervision "exercised by the company is exercisable in terms of the articles of association by the Board of Directors and the company in its general meeting. [994G-H;
 995G-F] (e)Under s. 17(2) of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, regulation no. 71 of table A, which enjoins that the business of the company shall be managed by the Directors is deemed to be contained in the articles of association of the company in identical terms or. to the same effect. Since the Board of Directors are to manage the business of the company they have every right to control and supervise the assessee's work whenever they deem it necessary. As a managing director, the appellant function also as a member of the Board of Directors whose collective decision he has to carry out in terms of the articles of association and he can do nothing which he is not permitted to do. [995F-H] (f) The very fact that apart from his being a managing director he, is given the liberty to work for the company as an agent is indicative of his employment as a managing director not being that of an agent. [995B] (g)If the company is itself carrying on the business and the assessee is employed to manage its affairs in terms of its articles and the agreement and if he could be dismissed or his employment can be terminated by the company if his work is not satisfactory , it could not be said that he is not a servant of the company.
