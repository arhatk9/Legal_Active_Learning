 Har Charan, respondent's father, and his two brothers, owned certain lands. After the death of Har Charan his brothers sold the lands to the father of the appellants. The respondent filed a suit claiming a decree for possession of a third share in the property alleging that Har Charan and:
 his brothers were separated in interest. After notice of the claim of the respondent. the purchaser made some constructions in pursuance of an agreement with the Improvement Trust. The respondent's claim was decreed but, in execution of the decree it was ordered that she should file a suit for partition in which her rights would be worked out. In the suit for partition, the trial Court held that in equity she was only entitled to a decree for money representing the value of her third share, on the ground that the appellants' father had constructed buildings on the land. The High Court allowed her appeal holding that as the buildings were completed with the knowledge -of the respondent's claim, the appellants could not plead any equity in their favour. 'Me decree was challenged in appeal to the Supreme Court. While the appeal was pending the respondent died and only some of her legal representatives were brought on record. It appeared however that there was no want of diligence or bona fides in the appellants, in making an enquiry as to who the legal representatives were.
 
HELD : (i) The appellants' father was in the position of a trespasser with notice of the claim of the true owner and he could not claim any special equity based upon his having bona fide put common property to use and :effected improvements on it. [237B-D].
 (ii) Under 0. XX.11, r. 4(1) and (3) of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908, where a plaintiff or an appellant after diligent and bona fide enquiry ascertained who the legal representatives of a deceased defendant or respondent were, and brought them on record within the time limited by law, there would be no abatement of the suit or appeal, even though some other legal representatives remained unknown to him and were not impleaded, if those legal representatives who were impleaded sufficiently represented the estate and a decision obtained against them bound the entire estate. If however it is brought to the notice of the appellant during the pendency of the appeal that-some of the legal representatives had not been impleaded, it would be the duty of the appellant who was thus made aware of his default, to bring those others on record. [24OD-F; 242B].
