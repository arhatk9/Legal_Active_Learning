 The petitioner was called upon to show cause why land held by her in excess of the ceiling area shall not be deemed surplus land and shall not vest in the State under the Maharashtra Agricultural Lands (Ceilings on Holdings) Act, 1961. The petitioner thereupon challenged the validity of the Act on the ground that it violated the fundamental rights under Arts. 14, 19(1)(f) and 31 of the Constitution.
 It was contended that though the Act was, by the Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act, 1964, incorporated in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution and protected from challenge by Art. 31B, action sought to be taken in pursuance of such an Act infringing the fundamental rights was liable to be declared void, if that action was taken subsequent to February 27, 1967, the date -on which judgment of this Court in Golaknath's case[1967] INSC 45; , [1967] 2 S.C.R. 762 was delivered.
 HELD : The petition must fail.
 (1) In Golaknath's case five of the Judges upheld the Seventeenth Amendment on the basis of the 'doctrine of prospective overruling : five -relied upon the power of Parliament to exclude, from the pale of challenge, the Acts and Regulations in the Ninth Schedule, and one Judge was of the view that the Acts impugned in that case were protected by Arts. 31(1), (2) (2A) and 31A(1). Therefore, the majority of ten Judges of the Court expressly held that by virtue of Art. 31B the Acts incorporated in the Ninth Schedule were not exposed to challenge on the ground that they infringed the fundamental rights, [175 D-E, G-H] (2) Those judges who relied upon the 'doctrine of prospective of overruling', did not accept the doctrine in all its implications as understood by the U.S. Courts. They merely denied to Parliament power after February 27, 1967, to amend the Constitution so as to take away or abridge. any of the fundamental rights of the people, but amendments made prior to that date and action taken pursuant to the amendments,, both before and after that date were not to be deemed invalid on the ground that fundamental rights were infringed. [176 C-E] (3) This Court had upheld the validity of the Act as amended by Act 13 of 1962, in State of Maharashtra v.
