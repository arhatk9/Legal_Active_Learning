 The respondent as Bhumidhar filed an objection under section 240(G) of the U.P. Zamindari and Land Abolition Act, 1961, in respect of a preliminary statement compiled by the Compensation Officer under section 240(F) showing the appellants as Adhivasis of certain land. The objection was dismissed by the Compensation Officer on October 25, 1956, who held that the appellants had Adhivasi rights and the objector had no interest in the land. The Compensation Officer decided the matter without framing an issue and referring it for decision to a competent Court. in the meantime, in consolidation proceedings the respondent applied for correction of the records under section 10(1) of Consolidation of Holdings Act, but her objection was dismissed by the Consolidation Officer. However, on appeal, the Settlement Officer, (Consolidation), reversed this de- cision holding the,. the appellants were Asamis. The Director of Consolidation, U.P. dismissed a revision application. In these consolidation proceedings, the respondent claimed the advantage of the amendment of section 21(h) and section 157 introduced by the U.P. Land Reforms Act, XX of 1954, on the ground that her husband was suffering from physical infirmity and was incapable of cultivating land. The appellants' contention was that while section 21 had been expressly amended to have retrospective effect, the amendment of section 157 was not effective retrospectively; the, respondent was therefore not entitled to claim the advantage from the amendment of section 157.
 It was further contended by the appellants that the order of the Compensation Officer made on October 25, 1956, bad finally decided the status of the appellants as Adhivasis and not having been appealed against, the question could not now be reopened.
 
HELD : Section 157(1) (a) must, be read to apply retrospectively.
 If the new s. 21(h) is to be read retrospectively from the commencement of Land Reforms Act, the amendment of section 157(1) which was made simultaneously must also be clearly intended to operate with retrospection. There would be no point in making the amendment of s. 21(h) retrospective if the other clauses were to apply prospectively for then the force of the retrospectivity of clause (h) of s. 21 would be made neutral. [759 E-F] A law is undoubtedly retrospective if the law says so expressly but it is not always necessary to say so expressly to make it retrospective. There are occasions when a law may be held to be retrospective in operation. Retrospection is not to be presumed for the presumption is the other way but many statutes have been regarded as retrospective without a declaration. Thus it is that remedial statutes are always regarded as 753 prospective but declaratory statutes are considered retrospective. Similarly sometimes statutes have a retrospective effect when the declared intention is clearly and unequivocally manifest from the language employed in the particular law or in the context of connected provisions.
 It is always a question whether the legislature has sufficiently expressed itself. To find this one must look at the general scope and purview of the Act and the remedy the legislature intends to apply in the former state of the law and then determine what the legislature intended to do.
 This line of investigation is, of course, only open if it is necessary. [758 H] Main v. Stark [1890] 15 A.C. 384 at 388; referred to.
 The order of the Compensation Officer under s. 240-F did not have that finality which was claimed for it. That finality attaches only to the order of the Assistant Collector under s. 229-B on a reference of an issue from the Compensation Officer.
