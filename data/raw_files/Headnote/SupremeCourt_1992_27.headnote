 With a view to providing an incentive to teachers, preventing stagnation and also for improving their efficiency the University Grants Commission evolved a scheme called "Merit Promotion Scheme". On being selected under the said scheme a lecturer is designated as Reader and becomes entitled to a higher pay scale. One of the conditions under the scheme which a lecturer must satisfy before he becomes entitled to promotion is eight year's of continuous service of which at least four years should be in the institution where he is being considered for promotion.
 The respondent was appointed as a lecturer by the appellant-University, on temporary basis, on 26.8.1974 in the Department of Basic Principles in the Institute of Medical Sciences for a period of eleven months. At the end of eleven months, he was re-appointed on the same basis for a further period of eleven months. By means of such appointments he served as a temporary Lecturer from 26.8.1974 till 31.3.1980. There was no re-appointment thereafter and from 1.4.80 to 20.7.80 he remained without a job. On 21.7.80 he was appointed as a Reader in the Nagpur University where he served till 20.9.82. On 22.9.82 he was appointed as a permanent lecturer in the appellant- University in the same Department where he worked earlier 361 temporarily and his salary was fixed by giving him fourteen increments so as to protect his last pay drawn at Nagpur.
 In 1983 the respondent claimed promotion under the Merit Promotion Scheme but the University rejected his case on the ground that he does not satisfy the requirement of eight years' of continuous service in the cadre because there was a break in his service between 1.4.80 to 20.7.80 and that his service in the Nagpur University cannot be counted.
 The respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court and pursuant to an interim order passed by the High Court the respondent's case was considered by the Selection Committee and the decision of the Committee was kept in a sealed cover.
 The High Court allowed the petition by holding: (i) that the respondent's service in the Nagpur University was liable to be counted towards the eight years' continuous service because para 2 (a) of the scheme expressly recognizes service in more than one University; (ii) a long- standing practice of the University was to condone the breaks in service in such cases. Consequently the High Court quashed the University's order rejecting respondent's application and directed the University to place recommendations of the Selection Committee before the Executive Council and to promote him as Reader if he was approved by the Executive Council.
 The University filed an appeal in this Court contending that (i) the High Court erred in holding that the re spondent satisfied the requirement of eight years' continuous service; (ii) the power of the University to condone short breaks in service was exercised in cases only where the delays in reappointment were caused by procedural delays in the office of University; (iii) there was a definite break in the respondent's service and such a break has never been condoned by the University.
 On behalf of the respondent it was contended that para 2 (a) of the scheme recognizes a teacher serving two or more Universities for the purposes of "continuous eight years" service; (ii) the requirement of continuous service should be understood having regard to the underlying aim and object; (iii) In many other cases the University has condoned similar breaks and refusal to do so in his case was arbitrary and discriminatory.
 362 Dismissing the appeal, this Court, 
 HELD: 1. The expression "continuous service" has no single unalterable meaning and its content varies having regard to the context. [368-C] Jeevan Lal Ltd. v. Its workmen[1961] INSC 74; , [1962] 1 S.C.R. 717;

 2. The expression "eight years of continuous service" in para 2 (a) of the scheme should be understood in a reasonable manner having regard to the underlying aim and object. In understanding and construing the said expression the object underlying the said requirement should be taken into consideration. The object behind para 2 (a) of the scheme is to ensure that a teacher does have eight years' teaching experience. [366 F, H, 367-A] 2.1.Para 2 (a) of the Merit Promotion Scheme itself expressly recognizes that the eight years' service may be in more than one institution, the only requirement being a minimum of four years service in the institution where he is being considered for promotion under the scheme. In case of shift from one University to other or from one institution to the other it can reasonably be presumed that there is bound to be some interval. The interval may be of a day, a week or a month. What is relevant is not the length of the interval or break, as it may be called, but its nature.
 However, the length of such interval is not totally irrelevant; but one must take into consideration the reason for which break, or the circumstances in which such break, has occurred. [366 F-H] 
 2.2 The gap in the respondent's service is of the nature contemplated by para 2 (a) of the scheme. True it is that it is a bit too long but even so in the light of the circumstance that the respondent was reappointed on a permanent basis, on the very same post, in the very same department, the length of the said break pales into insignificance. [369 B-C] 
 3. It is also evident from record that in case of other two teachers who had not completed eight years' service by the prescribed date the Vice-Chancellor and the Executive Council decided to extend the eligibility period till the date of interview so as to make them eligible for consideration which shows that the University 363 has been passing appropriate orders wherever the justice of a case demanded. The same treatment ought to have been extended to the respondent, in all the circumstances of the case. [370 E-F]
