 The High Court in dismissing the suit for redemption brought by the appellant in reversal of the decisions of the courts below held that the document on which the suit was based was one of sale and not a mortgage by conditional sale. It was executed to meet pressing demands and not merely , to discharge a previous mortgage in favour of the respondent.
 it provided that in case of defect of title and consequent dispossession of the vendees, the executants would remain bound to refund, the consideration with interest which would be a charge on the property and that the executant would pay the rent for a short period after the execution. The document described itself as "tamashuk sarti kebala". The total area of the land mortgaged. to the respondent in the previous year was 13.17 acres and the amount advanced was Rs. 1,600/-. Only a year thereafter 12.6 acres out of the aforesaid area were transferred for Rs. 2,800/- to the respondents who were put in possession. There was no dispute that the lattter amount represented the real value of the land.
 Held, that there is a clear distinction between A mortgagee by conditional sale and a sale with a condition of repurchase. The former is a niortgagee and the right to redeem remains with. the debtor. The latter is an out and out sale by which by the owner divest and his rights to the property, reserving a right of repurchase. The question to which category a document belongs can be decided only by ascertaining the intention of the parties on a consideration of the document and other relevant circumstances. Decided cases are only illustrative and not exhaustive.
 In the instant case, the cumulative effect of the terms of the document and the surrounding circumstances left no manner of doubt that the document in question was not a mortgage but 83 a sale with . the condition of repurchase. Whatever ambiguity there, might,, be in the document the crucial circumstance that smaller area of the land was sold for a higher-amount in discharge of an earlier mortgage of a large area for a smaller amount, 'left no doubt as to the real character of the document.
 Pandit Chunchun Jha v. Sheikh Ebadat Ali [1955] 1 S.C.R.
 '174, distinguished.
 A decision on the construction of a document can hardly afford any guidance for ascertaining the intention of the parties in another unless the terms used arc exactly similar.
