 The appellant was a lessee of a plot of land belonging to the respondent-corporation. When the respondent issued notice to the appellant directing him to vacate the land on the date of expiry of the lease, the appellant applied for a grant to him of a lease for 99 years or at least for 10 years. The respondent passed a resolution that the land would be given to the appellant if he deposited certain amount as upset price and paid a higher rent, and that otherwise possession of the land should be taken back. The appellant did pot comply with the terms but made a counter offer., Having failed in his appeal to the Minister, 7 years after the resolution passed by the respondent, he offered to pay a part of the amount fixed by the resolution and the balance in instalments. This was accepted by the Municipal Commissioner. The appellant did not pay any amount and the respondent filed a suit for eviction. During the pendency of the suit the appellant offered to pay the full upset price, the rent that may be found due, as well as costs of the suit and requested that permanent lease for 99 years may be granted to him. He also sent a cheque for part of the amount (the rent having been calculated at the old rate) but after receiving reminders from the Commissioner paid the balance a few days later. The respondent however passed another resolution refusing to grant the lease to the appellant.
 The trial court and the first appellate court dismissed the suit holding that the appellant was a tenant holding over.
 The High Court in second appeal decreed the suit of the respondent-Corporation.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD:(1) No contract was concluded between the parties as a result of the payments by the appellant. [18 G] The Commissioner cannot enter into a contract by himself and can do so only if it is sanctioned by the Corporation under s. 80 of the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act. Nor was it open to the Commissioner to make any offer to the appellant or to accept any offer from the appellant in respect of the land except with the sanction of the muni- cipal council. Even the offer made by the respondent- corporation by its resolution came to an end with the filing of the suit by the 'Corporation and the Corporation, cannot be deemed to have kept it open. The appellant's offer,' after the suit was filed, was a new offer and it was rejected by the only authority competent to accept it namely, the Corporation. [18 G-H; 19 D-G] (2) The deposit of the rent by the appellant and acceptance of it by the Commissioner cannot be deemed to make the appellant a tenant holding over. [20 B] 16 The payment was at the old rate by the appellant and its acceptance by the Commissioner was not an acceptance of rent as such and in clear recognition of the tenancy right of the appellant. It cannot amount to the Corporation consenting to the appellant continuing as a tenant by paying the old rates of rent. There is thus no question of the appellant being a tenant holding over. He had become only a tenant by sufferance and hence there was no need for any notice before he could be evicted. [2O A-C] Kai Khushroo Bezonjee Capadia v. Bai jerbai Hirjibhey Warden Anr.
