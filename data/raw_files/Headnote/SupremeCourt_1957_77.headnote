 Rule 165-A of the Bombay Civil Services Rules, applicable to the State of Saurashtra, as amended, provided: " Government retains an absolute right to retire any Government servant after he has completed 25 years qualifying service or 50 years of age, whatever the service without giving any reason and no claim to special compensation on this account will be entertained. This right will not be exercised except when it is in the public interest to dispense with the further services of a Government servant such as on account of inefficiency or dishonesty...........
 On October 30, 1952, the Government of Saurashtra passed an order compulsorily terminating the services of the respond- ent, acting under the above rule. The respondent filed a writ application in the High Court challenging the validity of the order on the ground that it was made without any notice to him of any charge of misconduct or inefficiency and without any enquiry and was, in consequence, in contra- vention of Art. 311(2) of the Constitution of India. Though the respondent had completed the age Of 50 on the date of the order, his contention was that in view of the fact that R. 165-A provided that the right to retire wilt not be exercised except on grounds of inefficiency or dishonesty, an order retiring an officer before the age of superannua- tion was in substance one of dismissal or removal and must satisfy the requirements of Art. 3Ii(2), and that R. 165-A, in so far as it authorised the Government to terminate the services without any reason and without any enquiry, was repugnant to Art. 311(2) and therefore ,ultra vires.
 Held, that R. 165-A is not violative of Art. 311(2) and is intra vires, and that the impugned order, dated October 30, 1952, is valid.
 An order under R. 165-A is not one of dismissal or removal and Art. 311(2) is not applicable to such an order.
