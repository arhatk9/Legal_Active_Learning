 The appellants were convicted under s. 120B and S. 224/109 of the Indian Penal Code and s. 5(2) Of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, by the Court of Special judge constituted under the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1952. it was contended for them that the conviction was bad on the ground inter alia that the pardon tendered to the approver by the District Magistrate under S. 337 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by virtue of which he was examined as a witness by the Special judge was without 1219 jurisdiction. The contention was that the provisions Of s.
 337 were not applicable to the case, as the offence under s.
 5(2) Of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, was punishable with imprisonment which may extend to ten years, while S. 337 Of the Code of Criminal Procedure enabled a District Magistrate to tender a pardon "in the case of any offence triable exclusively by the High Court or a Court of Session or any offence punishable with imprisonment which may extend to ten years......... But under ss. 8(3) and 9 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1952, for the purposes of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Court of Special judge is deemed to be a Court of Session trying cases without jury :
 Held, that although the offence was triable exclusively by the Court of Special judge, the District Magistrate had authority to tender a pardon under s. 337 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as the Court of Special judge was, in law, a Court of Session.
