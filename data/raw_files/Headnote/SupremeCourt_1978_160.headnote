 By virtue of a notification dated 14th February, 1929 issued under s. 135 of the Indian Railways Act, 1890, the Bellary Municipal Council levied and realised municipal taxes in respect of railway property owned by the former Madras & Southern Mahratta Railway Co., which was a non- government company. The Municipal Council was realising taxes from the railway in accordance with the Madras District Municipalities Act, l92O, when the railways came to be owned by the Government of India, it was found that there was no provision under the Government of India Act, 1935, creating liability of the government railway to pay any municipal texes and that therefore no tax could be realised by the municipal councils. In 1941, the Railways (Local Authorities Taxation) Act, 1941, was passed. By a, notification issued under s. 4 of the 1941 Act. the Government of India revoked the notification dated 14th February, 1929 and issued in its place a fresh notification dated 18th June, 1946 declaring that the administration of the Madras & Southern Mahratta Railway shall be liable to pay taxes to the Bellary Municipal Council. the Railway continued to pay the tax until 1953.
 The Bellary district, which was formerly a part of the Madras State was added to the State of Mysore under s. 4 of the Andhra State Act, 1953. Even after Bellary became a part of the State of Mysore, the Madras District Municipalities Act, 1920 continued to be applicable to the Bellary area till October, 1955 when the Mysore Laws (Extension to Bellary and Amendment) Act, 1955 extended the operation of the Mysore State Municipalities Act, 1933 to the District of Bellary. Upto (October, 1955, the Southern Railway which was the successor-in-interest of the Government owned Madras & Southern Mahratta Railway did not dispute its liability to pay municipal taxes. The Government then raised a contention that the Government owned railway property was not liable to tax by any local authority in view of Article 285 of the Constitution and stopped payment.
 The Municipal Council thereupon filed a suit claiming from the railway a large amount as arrears of tax. The High Court. under Article 228 of the Constitution. withdrew the suit from the Bellary Court and passed a decree against the Union.
 574 In appeal to this Court it was contended for the Municipality that (1) the levy of tax was saved by clause (Z) of Article 285 and (2) clause (1) of Article 285 was not a bar in the way of imposing the tax in question, because the 194l Act was saved under Article 372 of the Constitution.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The property of the Railway is exempt from all taxes claimed by the Bellary Municipal Colonial under clause (1) of Article 285 unless the claim can be supported and sustained under clause (2) [580 Al The property of the Union is exempt from all taxes imposed by a State or by any authority within a State. But the Parliament may by law provide otherwise and then any tax on the property OF the Union can be imposed in accordance with the said law. The exception carved oui by clause (2) is not meant for levying any tax on such property by any State but is merely for the benefit of any authority including the local authority like the Municipal Council in question.
 Clause ( I ) cannot prevent such authority from levying any tax on any property of the Union if such property was expiable to such tax immediately before the commencement of the Constitution. The local authority can reap advantage of this exception only under two conditions namely, (i) that it is "that tax" which is being continued to be levied and no other; (ii) that the local authority in 'that state" is claiming to continue the levy of the tax. In other words, the nature, type and the property on which the tax wa6 being levied pourboire to the commencement of the Constitution must be the same as also the local authority must be the local authority of the same State to which it belonged before the commencement of the Constitution. On fulfillment of these two conditions, it is authorized to levy the tax on the Union property under clause (2). As in the case of clause (1), it lies within the power of the Parliament to make a law withdrawing, the exemption of the imposition of the tax on the property of the Union, so in the case of clause (2) it is open to Parliament to enact a law and take away the right of The local authority within a State to claim any tax on only property of the Union, a right it derived. under clause (2). [578 E-579 Bl 
 2. (a) The plain and Simple meaning which must must be culled out from the expression "that State" in the context of the other phraseology in clause (2) of Article 285 is that the local authority can claim protection under clause (2) if it is a, local authority in the same Slate in which it was before the advent of the Constitution There is no ambiguity in this matter and there is, there fore. no escape from the position that the Bellary Municipal Council in the city of Bellary which was a local authority within the State of Madras cannot take advantage of clause (2) on the ground that at the time when it was making the claim for realization of the tax it was part of the Mysore State. [581 A-C] (b) The mere fact that there is some variation in the amounts of the tax as payable by the Railway in the pre- Constitution and post Constitution periods will not rob the tax of being the same tax within the meaning of the expression "that tax", within in clause (2) of Article 285.
 [580 B] (c) The fact that the tax was being levied and claimed previously under the Madras Act of 1920 and now the claim is founded upon the Mysore Act of 1933 will not make it a tax different from "that tax" within the meaning of clause (2) of Article 285.
