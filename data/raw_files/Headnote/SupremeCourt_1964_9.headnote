 All the petitioners were appointed Sub-Inspectors in the former Hyderabad State. They were considered for promotion as Circle Inspectors and their names were included in the eligibility list. On account of the merger of certain areas of the former State of Hyderabad into Mysore petitioners were transferred to Mysore. The petitioners were promoted ad hoc Circle Inspectors from the eligibility list received from the former Hyderabad State and they continued to act for varying periods as such. When certain confirmed Circle Inspectors who were on leave or on deputation outside the State returned to the new State, the petitioners were ordered to be reverted. When that happened, the petitioners filed writ petitions in the Mysore High Court in which they claimed that as they had been put in the eligibility list by the former Hyderabad State, they were entitled as of right to promotion as Circle Inspectors and to continue as such thereafter and the order of their reversion amounted to reduction in rank. They prayed for a writ, order or direction quashing the orders of reversion and directing the State Government to continue them as Circle Inspectors and confirm them as such. Their writ petitions were dismissed by the High Court and they came to this Court by special leave. They also filed writ petitions in this Court in addition to the appeals. Two others who had not appealed against the orders of the High Court also filed writ petitions in this Court.
 The contentions raised before this Court were that as their names were put in the eligibility list, they got an indefeasible right to promotion as Circle Inspectors, that after promotion on a temporary or officiating basis they got a right not to be reverted under any circumstances, that as they had worked for more than two years on probation, they became automatically confirmed under R. 486, that their reversions amounted to reduction in rank in view of R. 2 (c) and that they should be considered senior to other Circle Inspectors who were promoted after they were promoted as Circle Inspectors and therefore they should not have been reverted but the other Circle Inspectors who were promoted After them as Circle Inspectors should have been reverted on the principle that junior most officiating persons must be reverted. Dismissing the appeals and writ petitions, Held: The mere fact that a Sub-Inspector's name is once put in the eligibility list does not give him an indefeasible right to promotion as a Circle Inspector.
 Moreover, after promotion on a temporary or officiating basis, he does not get a right not to be reverted under any circumstances.
 Rule 486 does not contemplate automatic confirmation after the probationary period of 2 years. The provision in the rule that promoted officers will be confirmed at the end of their probationary period, is qualified by the words "if they have given satisfaction". The competent authority must be satisfied about their work and the order of confirmation must be passed by that authority.
 Reversion in the present case does not amount to reduction in rank because the petitioners were never confirmed as Circle Inspectors and had no right to that post and their reversion was on account of exigencies of 281 service and not on account of any fault on their part.
 Reversion on account of exigencies of service as senior officers had come back from deputation or from leave, did not amount to reduction in rank.
 The petitioners could not rely on R. 2(c) in the peculiar circumstances prevailing in the State after re-organisation because promotions were made ad hoc without regard to inter se seniority of officers from different States. It cannot be said that reversion of the petitioners was on act of discrimination.
