 The respondents sought permission of the Court to with. draw certain moneys on furnishing security which was granted. A security bond was executed by the respondents by which a house was given as security. The Inspector of Stamps repor- ted that the security bond was insufficiently stamped and therefore it should be impounded and a deficit stamp duty of Rs. 482111 /-and a penalty of Rs. 4,826/14/- should be levied. Thereupon the Deputy Commissioner) acting as Collector, called for objections. The judicial officer before whom the security bond was filed impounded the bond and forwarded it to the Deputy Commissioner. After further objections were filed by the respondents before the Stamp Officer, the latter submitted a report to the Deputy Commissioner upholding the order of the Inspector of Stamps.
 Thereupon the Deputy Commissioner passed an order "realise".
 The respondents filed a revision petition against the order of the Deputy Commissioner before the Board of Revenue and while that petition was pending the Deputy Commissioner referred the matter to the Board of Revenue under s. 56 (2) of the Stamp Act and the Board of Revenue passed an order upholding the order of the Deputy Commissioner. The respondents then filed a writ petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution before the High Court. Their main contention was that they were not given a hearing either by the Board of Revenue or the Deputy Commissioner. The petition was heard by a Single Judge who dismissed the petition on the ground that neither the Stamp Act nor the-Rules framed thereunder Provided that a hearing should be given to the aggrieved person. Thereafter the appeal Court treated the matter as a reference before the Revenue Board under s. 56 (2) of the Act and held that the Act or Rules did not require that a hearing should be given by the authorities acting under s. 56 but that although they were acting only administratively. they were bound to give a bearing according to the principles of natural justice. The appeal was allowed.
 51 Held, that it is clear that s. 56 (2) deals with cases where there is a doubt in the mind of the Collector in regard to an instrument as to its construction and the provisions of the Act applicable to it. Such doubt itself shows that the point raised for the Collector's decisions is a difficult point of law and from the very nature of the duty to be performed in such circumstances it appears clear that the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority has to decide the matter judicially and would thus be a quasi-judicial tribunal.
 Where the provisions of the Act are silent, the duty to act judicially may be inferred from the provisions of the statu- te or may be gathered from the cumulative effect of the nature of the rights affected, the mariner of the disposal provided the objective criterion to be adopted and the phraseology used and other indicia afforded by the statute.
 The questions before the Board under s. 56 (2) being one of construction of an instrument and the application of the Act to it being a pure questions of law which may result in payment of large amounts by the executant of the document the Board should give, for the determination of such question, a hearing and it should act judicially in determining a pure question of law.
