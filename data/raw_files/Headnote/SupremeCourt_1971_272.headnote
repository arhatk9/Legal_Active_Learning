 The appellant was a Hindu undivided family carrying on the business of manufacturing oils. For the assessment year 1963-64 the appellant tied its quarterly returns under the U.P. Sales Tax Act, 1948. The Sales Tax Officer made an assessment enhancing the turnover which resulted in increase of the amount of tax. The appellant filed an appeal on October 21, 1965 which was three days' before the period of limitation prescribed for filing the appeal was to expire.
 There was some difficulty about the encashment of a cheque which had been deposited along with the rest of the cash amount towards payment of the amount of tax the liability for which stood admitted. The total payment was not made if the entire amount until May 27, 1966 when the treasury challan was produced. The assessee filed an application praying for condonation of delay, if any, in filing the appeal under s. 5 of the Indian Limitation Act 1908 which was applicable by virtue of s. 9 (6) of the U.P. Sales Tax Act, 1948. The Assistant Commissioner (Judl.) Sales Tax rejected the memorandum of appeal as defective on the ground that the deposit of tile amount of tax admitted to be due had not been made within the period of limitation and that the delay in doing so could not be condoned under s. 5 of the Limitation Act. The appellant's petition under Art. 226 challenging the Assistant Commissioner's order was dismissed. In appeal by certificate-, 
HELD : It is true that an appeal filed under s. 9 of the Act cannot be entertained by the appellate authority unless satisfactory proof is adduced of the payment of tax admitted by the appellant to be due. but in a case where the amount of admitted tax is deposited after the period of limitation has expired all that will happen is that the appeal will be come entertainable only on the day on which satisfactory proof of payment of that amount is produced. In other words the appeal will be deemed to have been properly filed on the date on which the amount of admitted tax is paid. If that is beyond the period of 30 days the appeal will be barred by time. Section 9(6) will immediately become applicable to that appeal and it will be open to the appellant to apply for condonation of delay under that provision. It was not possible to accept the argument that the deposit of the amount of admitted tax must be made within 30 days even though the delay in filing the appeal can be condoned under sub-s. (6). The correct approach is to treat the appeal as having been preferred on the date on which proof of payment of the tax was furnished and then to see whether under sub- s. (6) of s. 9 there was sufficient cause for excusing the delay in preferring the appeal. [1013 E-1014 B] Gangadharan Pillai v.

 In the present case when the assessee produced the necessary documents which showed that the deposit of the full amount had been made by May 27, 1966 the appeal became entertainable. It only suffered from the defect that it was barred by time, on that date. The assessee could, therefore, apply under s., 9(6) for extending the period of limitation in accordance with s. 5 of the Limitation Act.
 The appellate authority was, wrong in disposing of the appeal on the short ground that it had no, jurisdiction to extend the period of limitation.
