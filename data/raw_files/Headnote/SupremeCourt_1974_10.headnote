 The Sikh Gurudwara Act, 1925, enacted for providing control and management of Sikh Gurudwaras, was extended to the area known as PEPSU, by Punjab Act 1 of 1959 with certain modifications. The scheme of the Act is that places of worship about which there was no doubt were placed in Schedule 1. Part III of the Act, which describes and regulates the manner of management could be made applicable by speedy assertion of the claim made on behalf of the shrines to properties, under ss. 3 to 6. Section 3(4) makes the declaration in the notification under s. 3(2) that it is a Sikh Gurudwara conclusive and incapable of being challenged. Whether any place not included in Schedule I should or should not be placed under the provisions of Part III could be determined in the manner provided for in ss. 7 to 11. An application for such a purpose may be made by 50 or more Sikh worshippers under s. 7. The State Government shall publish the petition and the list of properties claimed by the Gurudwara by notification under s. 7(3) and s. 7(5) makes the publication of a notification conclusive proof that the provisions of sub-ss. (1) to (4) have been complied with. Section 7(4) provides for individual notice of the Gurudwara's claim to a right, title or interest included in the list, to the person in possession of such right etc.
 The Mahant of a Shrine included as a Sikh Gurudwara in Schedule 1, the Mahant of a Shrine declared to be a Sikh Gurudwara on an application under s. 7(1) and the Mahant of a Shrine regarding which an application under s. 7(1) was pending, challenged the Constitutional validity of ss. 2(4) defining a hereditary office holder, 3, 7 and 8 which provides for the procedure for a declaration that a Gurudwara asserted to be a Sikh Gurudwara is not a Sikh Gurudwara, on the ground of violation of Arts. 14, 19 (1) (f) and 26. Rejecting all the contentions.
 HELD (Per A. N. Ray, C.J., P. Jaganmohan Reddy and P. K.
 Goswami, JJ) : 1 (a) As regards the Gurudwara included in Schedule I of the Act it was declared to be a Sikh Gurudwara long prior to the coming into force of the Constitution and was managed by the Interim Gurudwara Board constituted by the Firman of the Maharaja which was the law of the PEPSU and has the force of law even after coming into force of the Constitution by virtue of Art. 372 and continues to be law till it was repealed and substituted by a law made by a competent legislature. The Mahant, therefore. had no manner of right during the entire period from 1946, when the Firman was issued till long after the amending Act, nor did he even assert his right thereto since then until the present proceedings. He cannot, therefore, be allowed now to challenge the factum that the Gurudwara is a Sikh Gurudwara.
 [174G-175B] (b)The respondent specifically raised the contention and asserted in the pleadings that the Gurudwara was a Sikh Gurudwara and that its possession and management had vested in the Interim Gurudwara Board in PEPSU. [175E; 176A-B] (c)The entry relating to the last Jamabandi for the year 1954-55 does not show that the Gurudwara was a Udasi Gurudwara. it shows that the Mahant was working under the management of the Interim Gurudwara Board. Many of the Sikh Gurudwaras were managed by Udasis and under the firmans, the interim Gurudwara Board, which was in management of the Gurudwara, could get the affairs of the Gurudwara looked after by others under their supervision. [175F-H] (d)Therefore, the question whether the Gurudwara was a Sikh Gurudwara or was a Udasis Gurudwara had been determined as early as 1946 by the firman 161 of the Maharaja. The, fact that the appellant alleged that he was in possession of the Gurudwara was of little moment because if the law vested the management in the Interim Gurudwara Board the possession of the appellant would either be permissible or hostile. In either case, the status of the Gurudwara as a Sikh Gurudwara had been determined before the Constitution and since it was a pre-constitutional law, which declared it so, the appellant cannot challenge it on the ground of violation of his fundamental rights. Even if the appellant continued to be in possession he has not acquired a right of management when once that right was 'vested in another body. The Firman of an erstwhile ruler of a princely State was law and continued to be law till repealed or substituted by a law of a competent legislature.
 [176G-177B] Ameerunnissa Begum and others v. Mahboob Begum and Others [1952] INSC 70; (1953) S.C.R. 404 and State of Rajasthan and Others v. Shri Sajjanlal Panjawar and others [1974] 1 S.C.R. at p. 511, followed.
 (e)The firman vested the management and possession of the Gurudwara in a body created by it, with a Constitution and membership, quorum etc. Such an order could be an administrative-order only if the Gurudwaras in respect of which the management was vested were already vested in the State. Therefore the contention of the appellant that the firman was only an administrative order not having the force of law would be fatal to the case of the appellant. The very fact that pending a comprehensive law the Maharaja was issuing a firman itself shows that it is a law. [177B-D] (f)The Maharaja envisaged a comprehensive law to replace his firmans but by that time the State was merged and the law embodied in the firmans which was continued to be the law after the merger was replaced by the Amending Act which provided for the Interim. Gurudwara Board being in possession and management during the transition period. The Fundamental rights conferred by the Constitution are not retrospective in operation. Therefore, it could not be contended by the appellant that the pre-constitutional law took away rights only for an interim period and that the rights existed after the interim period and were subject to the Constitution.

 (2)The whole object of the Act was to reduce the chances of protracted litigation in a matter involving the religious sentiments of a large section of a sensitive people proud of their heritage. The provision of law which shuts out further inquiry and makes a notification in respect of Certain preliminary steps conclusive, does not involve the exercise of any judicial function. [178F-H] (3)Sections 3(4) and 7(5) are statutory provisions. The prescription of rules of evidence by a legislature which is competent to provide for irrebuttable and conclusive presumptions not only as mere rules of evidence but even as a substantive pieces of law so long as the relevant provisions are within its legislative competence and are not otherwise unconstitutional, is valid.

 Izhar Ahmad Khan and others v. Union of India and others [1962] Supp. S.C.R. 234, referred to.
 (4)Section 3(2) provides that on the receipt of a list "duty forwarded under the provisions of sub-s.(1)" the State Government is expected to publish a notification. The publication of such a notification is made conclusive proof of certain facts by s. 3(4). The use of the expression "duly forwarded" shows that the State Government is expected to satisfy itself before the issue of a notification under s. 3(2), that the application was a proper application under if sub-s. (1) and has been duly forwarded, which implies, that the requirements of s. 3(1) have been fulfilled. The High Court was, therefore, right in holding that the provisions of s. 3(4) and s. 7(5) do not suffer from any constitutional or other legal impediment. [179F-180] 12-L379Sup.CI/75 162 (5)The notice to be served under s. 7(4) even though it was served subsequent to the notification under s. 7(5) is determined by the rule of conclusive proof. Once the provision of conclusive presumption under s. 7 (5) is held to be. valid and constitutional that question could not be allowed to be agitated on rebutted as that would militate against the conclusive nature of the statutory presumption, Non having regard to the object of the Act, can that, provision be: considered to. be unreasonable as these are only, preliminary steps necessary for holding an inquiry which inquiry forms an essential part to the determination of the his. To take advantage of preliminary steps to protract litigation is itself unreasonable. The presumption that the authorities enjoined by the Act to take certain steps will do so is an irrebuttable presumption and if that does not affect substantial justice being done between the parties to the lis, no question of unreasonableness will arise. [180B-E] (6)On the death of a Guru before he nominates his Chela or where a Guru marries and is disqualified and another person is appointed as a Mahant, it may be that such a person may not have the right to challenge the notification under s.
 7(3) because he is not a holder of a hereditary office. But if a hereditary office holder cannot be found then s. 8 provides for a challenge to the notification under s. 7(3) by any 20 or more worshippers of the Gurudwara. If the Bhekh of a Sampradaya is entitled to nominate a successor and a Mahant has been so nominated it could be resumed that the Bhekh will have more than twenty worshippers and they could challenge the notification even if the Mahant could not. [180E-181B] (7)Besides, whether such a person is a hereditary office holder is a matter for the Tribunal to determine having regard to well established rules of evidence by which courts determine such matters. The assumption that such a Mahant may not be considered to be a hereditary office holder is purely hypothetical. It is for the tribunal to apply the law for determining as to whether the person who challenges, the notification is a hereditary office holder and has locus start to do so. [181B-C] (8)The period of 90 days prescribed under s. 8 is not unreasonable. A period of limitation is by its very nature to some extent arbitrary but it could not be urged that 90 days is not sufficient time for 20 or more worshippers to get together to challenge: the notification which is designed to declare the gurudwara in which they were;
 worshipping to be a Sikh Gurudwara. [181D-F] Per Khanna. J.
 (1)In the notice issued under s. 3(3) the appellant (the Mahant of Gurudwara included in Schedule I) was mentioned to be in possession of the property in dispute.. Before the Tribunal when the appellant wanted to agitate the question that the property in dispute was a Udasi institution and not a Sikh Gurudwara he was not, permitted to do so. Therefore, the appellant has locus standi to file the petition before High Court under Art. 226. [185B-D] (2)But, the respondent has conceded that it is permissible to the appellant to makea claim that the property mentioned in the notification relating to the list ofproperties under s. 3(2) including the property described to be the Gurudwara itself, in respect of the item in the first Schedule, belongs to a Udasi Institution. If the above stand taken on behalf of the respondent were to be accepted the basis of the grievance of the appellant that there is a denial of opportunity to him to establish his claim that the institution is a Udasi institution disappears, and s. 3(4) would not be violative of the appellant's right under Arts.
 19(1)(f) and 26. [182G-183B] (3)There is a presumption of the constitutional validity of a statutory provision. If a provision like s. 3 (4) of the Act of a local enactment has been on the statute book for about half a century and a particular construction has been placed upon it by the High Court of the State which sustains its Constitutional validity this Court should lean in favour of the view as would sustain the validity of the provision and not disturb the construction which has been accepted for such a lengthy time. None of the impugned provisions has been shown to violate the constitutional rights of the appellants. [184E-F; 185F] 16 3 Raj, Narain Pandey & Ors. v. Sani Prasad Tewari & Ors.
