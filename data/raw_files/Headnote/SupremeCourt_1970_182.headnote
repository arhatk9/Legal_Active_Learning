 R was allowed to intervene in a petition for a writ of habeas corpius under Art. 32 of the Constitution. He was allowed, at hi-, request,. to address the court in Hindi but counsel on both sides as well as several members of the Bench were unable to follow his argument. He was asked by the court to address the court in English, or to allow his counsel to present his case, or to give written arguments in English. He refused to accept any of these suggestions.
 
HELD : In the circumstances it was futile to allow the intervener to continue his arguments in Hindi. The language of the court being English and the intervener not being agreeable to any of the suggestions made to him, the only alternative for the court was to cancel his intervention.
