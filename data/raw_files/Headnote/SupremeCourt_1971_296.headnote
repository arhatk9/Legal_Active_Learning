 The appellant declared for the assessment years 1959-60 a total turn-over of Rs. 13,04,097 in respect of the purchase of safety matches and claimed exemption on the entire turnover on the ground that it was a subsequent sale from the dealers in the State of Mysore. During the relevant assessment year sale of matches was taxable under s. 5(3)(a) of the Mysore Sales Tax Act, 1957 on the first or earliest of the successive dealers in the State of Mysore. The modus operandi of the appellant in purchasing these matches was that it placed orders with the sales depots of the manufacturers inside Mysore. The Managers of the depots forwarded the orders to the principles who has their head office at Sivakasi outside the State of Mysore. The matches were thereafter despatched by the principal to the appellant in accordance with the instructions received from the Sales Depots. The Sales Depots sent the appellant detailed in- voices of the matches despatched by their factories. The appellant gave credit to the value of the matches after deducting therefrom the amount covered by debit notes in respect of Octroi, lorry freight and other incidental charges incurred by it and at the request of the sales office the appellant remitted the value of the matches direct to the factory by means of draft and telegraphic transfer. The appellant's contention was that it purchased the matches from the sales depots inside Mysore State who were the first sellers of the matches in the State of Mysore liable to tax and the appellant being the second dealer in the State was not liable to tax in respect of its sales.
 The assessing authority came to the conclusion that the transactions were inter-State sales within the meaning of s.
 3(a) of the Central Sales Tax Act and since the appellant was the first dealer in matches in Mysore State it was liable to pay sales tax. The appellant's appeals to the Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, and to the Tribunal were unsuccessful. The High Court rejected the revision petition filed by the appellant. In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : From the facts the sales were made by the respective factories direct to the appellant. The sales price was also sent directly to the. factories at Sivakasi. No doubt the orders were routed through the sales depot but on that account it could not be said that the factory sold the goods ordered by the appellant to its sales depot. It was inconceivable that there could be a sale between the manufacturer and its Sales Depot. [215 E-G] The transactions in question under explanation 3(a) to s.
 2(t) of the Mysore Act were the first sales in favour of the appellant and they took place in the State of Mysore. The decision in the case of Ram Narain & Sons, if applied to the facts of the present case, would indicate that the first sale by the Sivakasi firms was in Mysore. In that view, the question of inter State sale not being urged as necessary for consideration, it was rightly held by the High Court that the sales in question fell within cl. (a) of Explanation 3 of s. 2(t) of the Act. As Such the appeal must be dismissed. [216 E, 217 D-E] 214 Ram Narain & Sons v. Asstt. Commissioner of Sales tax & Ors.[1955] INSC 41; , [1955] 2 S.C.R. 483, discussed.
