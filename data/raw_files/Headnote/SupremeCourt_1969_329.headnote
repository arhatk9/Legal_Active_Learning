 The Government of Uttar Pradesh issued a notification purporting be one under s. 4(l) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, to the effect that "the land mentioned in the Schedule is needed for a public purpose The notification did not specify the locality where the lands were needed It further stated that s. 5A was not applicable since the provisions of 17(l) was applicable to the land. This was followed by a notification under s. 6(l). The appellants challenged the proceedings in High Court on the ground, among others, that the notification under s. 4 was invalid for non-compliance with the mandatory provisions of the As rendering the whole proceedings void. The High Court dismissed the petitions.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : The issue of a notification under sub-s. (1) of s. 4 is a condition precedent to the exercise of any further powers under the Act an a notification which does not comply with the essential requirement of that provision of law must be held to be bad. Section 4(l) does not require that the identity of the land which may ultimately be acquired should be specified; but it enjoins upon the Government the duty to specify th locality in which the land is needed. Any notification which is the first step towards depriving a man of his property must be strictly construe and courts ought not to tolerate any lapse on the part of the acquiring authority in the issue of such notification if it be of a serious nature[281 E-F; 283 B-C] In the instant cases the notifications suffered from a very serious defect in that the locality where the lands were needed was not specified The notification merely indicated that the lands mentioned in th schedule were needed. The defect in a notification under s. 4(l) cannot be cured by giving full particulars in the notification under s. 6(l).
 is apparent that even before the issue of the first notification Governer had made up its mind to acquire the lands of the petitioners in as much as there was no enquiry in between the two notifications and no valid reason has been put forward why the details specified in the notification under s. 6(l) could not have been given in the one under s. 4(l).
