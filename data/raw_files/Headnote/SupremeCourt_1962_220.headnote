 Elections were held to a Panchayat in the State of Mysore.
 The appellant and five others filed their nomination papers within the prescribed date. The appellant and respondent 2 were duly declared elected. Respondent 1 filed an election petition under s. 13 of the Mysore Village Panchayats and Local Boards Act, 1959, for a declaration that the appellant was not duly elected and he himself was duly elected. The Munsif held that on the date fixed for filing of nomination papers, the name of the appellant was not in the authenticated list of voters an(!, therefore, he was not entitled to file his nomination papers. The election of the appellant was set aside. The High Court upheld the conclusion of the Munsif or the basis of a different reasoning. It held that though the name of the appellant was included before the prescribed date. in the electoral roll of the legislative constituency under s. 23 of the Representation of the People Act, 1950, it was so included in direct violation of r. 26 of the Representation of the People Rules, 1956, and, therefore, the said inclusion was void. The appellant came to this Court by special leave.
 Held, that in view of s. IO of the Act, it could not be said that there was any improper acceptance of the nomination papers of the appellant. As his name was in the list of voters, he was qualified to be elected as a member of the Panchayat. There was no provision it, the Act which autho- rised the High Court to set aside the election on the ground that though the name of a candidate was in the list, it had been included therein illegally. The action of the Electoral Registration Officer in including the name of the appellant 480 in the Electoral Roll might be illegal, but the same could not be questioned in a civil court. The mistake could be rectified only in the manner prescribed by law by preferring an appeal under r. 24 of the Rules or by resorting to any other appropriate remedy. The action of the Electoral Registration Officer was not a nullity. He had admittedly jurisdiction to entertain the application for inclusion of the name of the appellant in the Electoral Roll and take such action as he deemed fit. The non-compliance with the procedure prescribed did not affect his jurisdiction, although that might render his action illegal.
