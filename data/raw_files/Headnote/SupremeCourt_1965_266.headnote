 A firm, constituted by the assessees who were closely related, transferred assets to a Corporation carrying on money-lending business in the Federated Malaya States. In consideration of the assets so transferred the Corporation allotted shares to the partners of the firm.. The Incometax Officer assessed the partners of the firm separately under s. 44D of the Act in respect of the income of the Corporation, which on appeals were upheld by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. On further appeals by the assessees, the Tribunal allowed the appeals on the ground that the income from the assets transferred was not assessable to tax at the time of transfer. At the instance of the Revenue, the question was referred to the High Court which was answered against the assessee. In appeal to this Court :
 
 HELD : The High Court was correct in answering the question against the assessee.
 (i) The language of s. 44D(1) of the Act is plain. It does not say "when any person has transferred any assets" but it says, "by means of a transfer of assets". The person who transfers assets is not designated but emphasis is laid on the consequence flowing from such a transfer.Whosoever effects the transfer, if bY such a transfer the assessee acquires a right to enjoy the income, he is liable to tax.
 The words "means" and "acquired" in the context., are only words of passive nature. The hand that transfers is immaterial; what matters is the result envisaged by the said section, namely a non-resident is the transferee of the assets, but the assessee acquires the power to enjoy the income from those assets. The words by means of a transfer of assets" mean nothing more than .as a result or by virtue or in consequence of the transfer". [765 E-G; 766 E] Congreve and Congreve v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue, (1943-49) 30 T.C. 163 and Bambrdige v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue, (1953-56) 36 T.C. 313, applied.
 (ii) The construction that s. 44D(1) can be invoked only if at the time of the transfer the income from the said assets was liable to tax, is not only inconsistent with the phraseology used but will defeat the object of the section. The expressions "any income", "such income" and "that income" found in the sub-section refer to the same income. What is assessed in a particular year is that income which is deemed to be the income in the hand-, of assessee. "That income" is such income in regard whereof he has "the power to enjoy". "Such income" is any income which if it were the income of the assessee would be chargeable to income-tax. The quality of chargeability is referable only to the income from the assets transferred during the year in which it is sought to be [766 F; 767 B] 762 (iii) If the assessees were able directly or indirectly to control the income of the Corporation, they would be deemed to have the power to enjoy the income. Sub- section (5) of s. 44D gives an enlarged meaning to the words "power to enjoy" in sub-s. (1).
 In the present case, the circumstances were overwhelming to establish that the assessees had a controlling voice in the affairs of The Corporation. They were closely related, holding almost all the shares of the Corporation, and were the partners of the firm which transferred the assets. [767 H; 768 B-C] (iv) The burden was upon the assesee to show to the satisfaction of the Income-tax Officer that the transfer was saved under sub-section (3) of s. 44D inasmuch as it was not for a purpose to avoid tax liability but was only a bona fide commercial transaction. The Tribunal found as a fact on the material placed before it that the transfer was to avoid the liability to taxation; and that being a finding of fact, the High Court rightly accepted it. The correctness of the said finding of fact cannot be permitted to be canvassed in these appeals. [768 G-769 A]
