 The two appellants B and N, along with two others who were acquitted by the High Court, were charged with the offence of murder by shooting the deceased, committed on September 12, 1967. The evidence against them mainly consisted of six witnesses who had identified them at test parades. The High Court rejected the evidence of three of them and relied upon the evidence of the remaining three. Two of them claimed to be present at the time of the occurrence and the third came on the scene after hearing pistol shots and the alarm raised by others. The appellants were strangers to all the witnesses.
 One of the eye witnesses (P.W. 1) gave the first information to the police, but there was no description of the assailants in it. The P.S.J. recording the report also did not question the informant for the purpose of securing more information about the description of the assailants in order to be able to take measures to discover and arrest them.
 P.W. 1 identified the appellants at two identification parades conducted by a Magistrate. The identification parade in respect of N was held on October 21, 1967 and in respect of B on October 28, 1967. In the form relating to the identification parade, there is a footnote stating that it is very useful to note whether the witness knew the name of the person he had come to identify or only described him and that the witness should not be asked in a general way to identify whomsoever he knew. The Magistrate gave evidence that he had asked witnesses who had come to identify the accused (named) as to what he had seen the accused doing and recorded whatever the witness told him. Whatever the first witness bad told him was recorded word for word and since the other witness bad repeated the same thing he noted down against their names the words as above. The identification memorandum as regards the other accused, prepared by the Magistrate at the time of his identification parade, was similar. There was also unexplained error as to the date on which appellant B was admitted into the jail. In both identification memos there were no- remarks by the Magistrate in respect of the steps taken by the jail authorities to ensure proper conduct of proceedings. The eye witnesses also did not specify in court the accused who had actually fired the pistol.
 The second eye witness admitted in cross-examination that he had gone to the jail for identification on three occasions and that on two occasions be had identified the accused but on the third occasion be did not identify any. He was unable to state as to which accused he identified in the first and which in the second parade.
 The third witness deposed that he bad identified the accused who had a jhola in his hand (he was alleged by) by the three witnesses to have 565 taken a pistol from the Jhola) at one identification parade and the other accused at the second identification parade.
 Appellant 'N' had stated during the identification parade that he had been shown to the witnesses and had also been photographed.
 On the question whether the conviction could be sustained on this evidence :- 
HELD : Facts which establish the identity of an accused person are relevant under s. 9 of the Evidence Act. The substantive evidence of identification is the statement of the witness in court. But the evidence of identification at the trial for the first time is from its very nature weak.
 A prior test identification, therefore serves to corroborate the evidence in court. The purpose of identification parades which belong to the investigation stage is to enable the witnesses to identify persons concerned in the offence, who are not previously known to them, and thereby to satisfy the investigating officers of their bona fides by pointing out the persons they recognise as having taken part in the crime. These parades, thus furnish evidence which corroborates the testimony of the identifying witnesses in court. These parades do not constitute substantive evidence. Keeping in view the purpose of identification parades, the precautions to eliminate suspicion of unfairness and to reduce chances of testimonial error. They must take intelligent interest in the proceedings bearing in mind two considerations : (i) that the life and liberty of an accused may depend on their vigilance and caution, and (ii) that justice should be done in the identification.
 Generally, the Magistrates must make a note of every objection raised by an accused at the time of identification and the steps taken by them to ensure fairness to the accused, so that the court which is to judge the value of the identification evidence may take them into consideration in the appreciation of that evidence. The persons required to identify an accused should have had no opportunity of seeing him after the commission of crime and before identification and secondly that they should make no mistakes or the mistakes made are negligible. The identification to be of value should also be held without much delay. The number of persons mixed up with the accused should be reasonably large and their bearing and general appearance not glaringly disincline. [570 H; 571 A-H; 572 A- C] In the present case the evidence shows that the Magistrate paid scant attention to the direction in the identification memos. The memos do not show that the parades were held by the Magistrate with the degree of vigilance, care and anxiety their importance demanded, and they were filled up in a very casual manner. They could only have a somewhat fleeting glimpse of the assailants. The prosecution has also not explained why the second eve witness had to go to the jail for identification a third time. The two eve witnesses did not state in evidence what particular part the two appellants played in the occurrence. The third witness who come on the scene on hearing the alarm could only have had a still more fleeting glimpse. [572 F-G; 573 D-E; 577 C- D] The statements of the three witnesses were also otherwise unimpressive and coupled with the fact that there was a possibility of their having seen at least one of the accused (appellant B) outside jail gates a week before the identification parades were held, the test identification parades could not be considered to provide safe and trustworthy evidence on which the appellants' conviction could be sustained. [577 E] (2) The entire case depended on identification of the appellants and the identification was founded solely on test identification parades. The 5 66 High Court did not correctly appreciate the evidentiary value of the parades and proceeded on the erroneous assumption that it is substantive, evidence and that on the basis of that evidence alone the conviction could be sustained. The High Court also ignored. important evidence on the record in regard to the manner in which test identification parades were held and the connected circumstances suggesting that they were held more or less in a mechanical way without the necessary precautions being taken to eliminate unfairness. This is an erroneous way of dealing with test identification parades and since it has caused failure of justice, this Court is justified in interfering under Art. 136 [577 H; 580 C-G]
