 Although there can be no rigid and inexorable convention that a wage structure once fixed can never be changed to the prejudice of the workmen, there are well-recognised principles on which such revision must be founded, one important principle, to which there can be no exception, is that the wages of workmen cannot be allowed to fall below the bare subsistence level. It follows, therefore, that no industry can have the right to exist if it cannot be maintained except by bringing the wages below that level.
 The Constitution of India seeks to create a democratic welfare state and secure social and economic justice to the citizens. Growth of industries and the advent of collective bargaining between organised labour and capital with consequent industrial legislation have made absolute freedom of contract and the doctrine of laissez faire things of the past and they have now to yield place to principles of social welfare and common good.
 Industrial adjudication has, thus, to keep in view the ideal of a democratic welfare state and its immediate objective in constituting a wage structure must be to secure the genuine and wholehearted co-operation between labour and capital in the task of production by a just adjustment of their conflicting interests by 83 652 the application of several principles such as for instance the principles of comparable wages, the productivity of the trade or industry, cost of living and ability of the industry to pay.
 In a case where the wage structure is of a higher category, it is open to the employer to claim its revision provided he can satisfy the Tribunal that such revision is reasonable on the merits and fair and just to the parties.
 Where, however, the employer's financial difficulties are sought to be made a ground for such revision, the Tribunal has to decide whether such difficulties could or could not be adequately met by such retrenchment in personnel as has already been effected by the employer and sanctioned by the Tribunal.
 Consequently, in case where the Industrial Tribunal fixed the wage structure and the dearness allowance but gave the employer liberty to abolish the two hours' concessions, facility bonus and the food concession, holding them to be in the nature of bounty gratuitously paid to the workmen by the employer, and the Labour Appellate Tribunal took the view that these concessions, which had been enjoyed by the workmen for a pretty long time as of right and as part of their basic wages and dearness allowance, had become a term of the conditions of their service and revised the wage structure in respect of existing workmen by incorporating the concessions into their basic wages and dearness allowance and in doing so relied not merely on the convention that the existing emoluments of workmen should not be reduced to their prejudice but also on other considerations which were neither invalid nor unwarranted by the evidence, its decision was valid in law.
 Held further, that this court would be normally reluctant to entertain an objection that any consideration on which the Appellate Tribunal bad relied was either invalid or unwarranted by the evidence on record. Where it finds that certain payments were in fact not gratuitous but were in substance part of the wages and dearness allowance, its decision is not liable to be set aside.
