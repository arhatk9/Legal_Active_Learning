 During the pendency of two connected suits for recovery of money filed by the appellant in the Hyderabad Court one of the respondents died and his sons, daughters and grand daughters were joined in the suits as his legal representatives as holding different pieces of his property under a deed of settlement and a registered will executed by him. The suits were decreed by the said court but as the decretal money could not be realised in full the appellant filed the present suit for the balance in the Madras High Court on the basis of the judgments of the Hyderabad Court At the time of filing, the previous suits were competent and within the jurisdiction of the Hyderabad Court as the deceased respondent was a resident of Hyderabad but after his death at the relevant time his legal representatives were not residents of Hyderabad. The respondents contended inter alia that they did not submit to the jurisdiction of the Hyderabad Court as it had no jurisdiction over them and the foreign judgments of that Court were not binding on them. the high Court held that under the rule of private international law all personal actions must be filed in the courts of the country where the defendant resided and as the legal representatives were non-residents of Hyderabad the decrees passed against them were invalid.
 Held, that the rule of private international law could not be applied to a case where the suit as initially filed was competent and the court before which it was filed was competent to 392 try-it. If during the pendency of the suit the defendant died and his nonresident legal representatives were brought on the record to defend the suit on his behalf to the extent of the assets of the deceased held by them, the jurisdiction of the court continued unaffected and the competence of the suit as originally filed remained unimpaired.
