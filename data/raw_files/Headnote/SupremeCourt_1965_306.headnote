 The appellant's lands were acquired under the provisions of the West Bengal Land (Requisition and ACquisition) Act, 1948. The Land Acquisition Officer made an award on 5th February 1951. The appellant accepted the compensation amount on 21st March 1951, under protest, and on 2nd February 1953, filed an application under s. 8 of the Act that a reference should be made to the Court regarding his, claim for a larger amount of compensation. The Land Acquisition Officer rejected the application on the ground that it was barred by time. The High Court, 'in its revisional jurisdiction, remanded the case to the Land Acquisition Officer for disposal according to law, with the observation, that, though no limitation-had been prescribed for making an application for reference, such an application should nevertheless be made Within a reasonable time and Chat whether the appellant moved within a reasonable time or not should be determined. The Land Acquisition Officer held that the appellant did not move Within reasonable time and rejected the application, and the High Court refused to interfere with- the order' In appeal to this Court.
 HELD: Section 8(2) of the West Bengal Act, read with s.
 18(2) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, specifically prescribes the period of limitation for making such applications, and having regard to these provisions, the by time It was therefore not necessary to consider the appellant's plea that the application was made within a reasonable time.[148 B-C] The fact that s. 8(1) of the West Bengal Act imposes an obligation on the Collector to refer the matter to the decision of the Court does not preclude the application of a provision for limitation prescribed in regard to the making of an application for reference. Section 8(2) of the West Bengal Act' makes the provisions of the Central Act applicable mutatis mutandis in respect of any reference made to the court under sub-s. (1). In the context, the clause "in respect of any reference made to the Court" does not mean that the provisions of the Central Act have to apply only after a reference is made, but it includes all cases where reference is intended, or proposed, or asked, to be made, and that means that if a party wants to make an application for reference, he is no doubt entitled to require the Collector to make such a reference, but his application in that behalf must be made within the period of limitation prescribed by s. 18(2) of the Central Act.
 Further, the amended s. 8(2) of the West Bengal Act, which makes s. 18(2) of the Central Act expressly applicable, also uses the same clause "in respect of any reference made to the Court and that also lends support to this view. [144 G;
