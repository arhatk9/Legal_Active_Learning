 In a partition of the properties of a joint Hindu Undivided Family a coparcener took as his share less than what he was entitled to and allotted greater share to the other members of the coparcenery. On the question whether the coparcener could be held to have made a "gift" of a portion of his share of the property to the other members and was liable to tax under the Gift Tax Act, 1958.
 
HELD:(i) A coparcener in a Hindu Undivided Family has no definite share in the family property. His share gets determined only when there is a division of status or a division by metes and bounds. It is not necessary that in every case of partition in a Hindu Undivided Family there should first be a division in status and thereafter a division by metes and bounds. In the present case there is no material to show that there was any division of status before the properties were actually divided. Therefore, it is not necessary to consider what would be the position in law if there was just a division of status and the same was followed by a division by metes and bounds. [738 H-739E] (ii)The partition of the joint Hindu Family property is not a transfer Commissioner of Income-tax, Gujarat v. Keshavlal Lallubhai Patel, 55 I.T.R. 637, followed.
 (iii)A partition is not a "disposition" "conveyance" "assignment" "settlement" "delivery" "payment" "or other alienation of property" within the meaning of those words s.
 2(xxiv) of the Act. These words are used as some of the modes of transfer of property and have to be understood in the setting in which those terms are used and the purpose they are intended to serve. [742-G] It cannot be considered a "transaction entered into by any person with intent thereby to diminish directly or indirectly the value of his own property and to increase the value of the property of any other person" within the meaning of cl. (d) of s. 2(xxiv), because, a member of a Hindu Undivided Family who has no definite share in the family property before division cannot be said to diminish directly or indirectly the value of his own property and to increase the value of the property of another person.
 Further, the transaction referred to in cl. (d) of s.
 2(xxiv) takes its colour from the main clause i.e., it must be transfer of property in some way. [742 H-743 C]
