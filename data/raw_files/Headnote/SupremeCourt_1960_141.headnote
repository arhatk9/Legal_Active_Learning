 The landlord granted a theka to the company for 10 years ending with 1356 F which was renewed up to 1355 F (June 1948). On the company's refusal to vacate on the expiry of the theka the landlord filed a suit for ejectment under the U. P. Tenancy Act, 1939. The suit was resisted by the company on the ground that it has become a hereditary tenant under S. 29 of that Act. The suit was decreed on November 3,- 1948, and an appeal and a second appeal against the decree also failed, but the company remained in possession of the land on account of stay orders granted by the appellate courts. In execution the landlord obtained formal possession on October 13, 1950, but the company resisted actual ejectment., on July 1, 1953, the company instituted proceedings to recover actual possession of the land under S. 232 of the U. P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950, claiming to have become an Adhivasi under S. 20 thereof. Section 20 provided that every person who was recorded as occupant of any land in the Khasra or Khatauni of 1356 F shall be called an adhivasi of the land and shall be 565 entitled to take or retain possession thereof. The company was recorded in 1356 F in possession of the land in dispute as thekedar. The landlord contended that the company had not acquired the rights of an adhivasi : (i) as it being in possession in 1366 F under the stay orders of the courts it Was in occupation not on its own behalf but on behalf of the court, and (ii) as it was A recorded as a thekedar in 1356 F its possession was not on its own behalf but on behalf of the landlords, whose thekedar it was.
 Held, (per Sinha C. J., Gajendragadkar, Wanchoo and Shah, JJ.), that the company had acquired adhivasi rights in the land and was entitled to the possession thereof. Simply because there were stay orders which enabled the company to remain in possession, the possession was not on behalf of the court. It remained in possession in the same right in which. it was in possession before the decree was passed on November 3, 1948. Though the company was recorded in possession as a thekedar it was an occupant in its own right and not on behalf of the landlord. It was open to the court to look beyond the entry of the company as a thekedar in the Khasra.

 DAs GUPTA, J.-The company did not acquire the rights of an adhivasi. The word " occupant " means a person in posses- sion in his own right and not on behalf of someone else.
 The benefit under the section is available only to those " recorded as " occupants ". It is not permissible to look beyond the record to ascertain whether the claimant has been "recorded as occupant ". The record in the khasra of the possession " as thekedar " amounts to record of " possession on behalf of thekedar's lessor ".
