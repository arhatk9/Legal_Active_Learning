 Twenty five persons were charged with offences under various sections of I,P.C. on the basis of first information report No. Ex. P 2 filed by PWs. 1 and 2. PWs. 1, 2 and 3, the eye witnesses, were members of Police Party specially posted at the place of incident due to the strained relations between the party of the accused and the party of the deceased. The F.I.R. was drawn up and filed by them as the party of the deceased refused to make a report. The first information report stated, (a) that the party of the deceased went upto the terrace of the house of Subbi Reddy and challenged the party of the accused to a fight, whereupon the party of the accused came to the terrace of the house of. one Somi Reddy which was at some distance from the house of Subbi Reddy, (b) that A2, A4, A6 and A9 were armed with guns and as a result of their firing at the party of the deceased several persons received gun-shot injuries of whom Ramakrishna Reddy succumbed to his injury and (c) that the policemen tried to apprehend the accused but they ran away. The Additional Sessions Judge, Cuddapah, who did not find it possible to place reliance on the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, acquitted the accused by his judgment dt. April 21, 1971.
 An appeal was filed against the acquittal. Al and A2 died during the appeal. The High Court relied on the testimony of PWs. 1 to 3 set "id, the judgment in respect of the acquittal of A 3 to A 9, A 11, A 12, A 13 and A 19 'but confirmed the acquittal of the rest. Hence this appeal. It was contended that in view of the contrary statements made by PWs. 1 to 3 in the departmental enquiry against them for dereliction of duty, they falsely claimed to be the eye witnesses and therefore the conviction could not be sustained.
 Dismissing the appeals of A 4, A 6, A 9 and allowing the appeals of the rest the court, 
HELD : 1. The High Court rightly took the view that all the three policemen were present at the time of the incident and witnessed it, and that the statements given by them in the departmental inquiry against them for dereliction of duty were for the purpose of avoiding an adverse finding in the, inquiry. One tell-tale fact which was taken into consideration was the injury received by PW 3 when both sides were throwing stones at each other. [78E-F] 
2. The High Court did not misread the evidence inasmuch as it has taken note of the fact that PW 1 was a local constable who was stationed in village Kasanur not only for the occasion which led to the present incident, but also on earlier occasions including service of summonses, and therefore had opportunity of knowing the names of the accused. It was therefore rightly held that A 2, A 4, A 6 and A 9 had fired their guns resulting in the death of Ramakrishna Reddy and injuries to several prosecution witnesses. [78D, E, H] 
3. Section 149 I.P.C. provides that if an offence is committed by any member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object of that assembly or such as the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of that object, every person who, at the time of the committing of 'that offence, is a member of the same assembly, is guilty of that offence.
 76 "Unlawful assembly" has been definded in section 141 I.P.C., while s. 142 states. who can be said to be its member. An unlawful assembly is thus an assembly of five or more, persons if the common object of the persons composing it is of the nature specified in items first to fifth of the section. It cannot be urged that any item other than that part of the third item which relates to "other offence" could possibly be attracted to the present case. [79B-D] (b) An offence will fall within the purview of s. 149 I.P.C. even if the members of the assembly knew that it was "likely to be committed" in prosecution of their common object or if the offence was such as the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of that object. 'Mere is nothing in the statements of the three police witnesses to prove that this was so. Section 149 I.P.C. will not therefore fasten criminal liability on the other accused. [80G-H] (c) From the evidence of PWs. 1 to 3 it is not possible to reach the conclusion that the other accused (other than A 2, A 4, A 6, A 9) were armed with spears or that they went up the terrace with the common object of committing any offence. On the other hand the statements of PWs. 4 and 6 showed that the party of the accused did not go to their terrace of their own accord for committing any offence. A 2, A 4, A 6 and A 9 were armed with guns and fired them some time thereafter, but there was nothing in the evidence of PWs. 1 to 3 to show that they did so in pursuance of the common object of the other persons who were on the terrace at that time. Under the explanation to S. 141 an assembly which was not unlawful when assembled may subsequently become an unlawful assembly, but there, was nothing in the evidence of the three police witnesses to show that this was so or that the other accused exhorted those who fired the guns or knew that the gun would be, fired. There was also nothing to show that the other accused knew that the guns were likely to be fired in prosecution of their common object. [80A, E-F] 
4. Section 151 would be attracted only if there was evidence to show that the assembly had been "lawfully commanded to dispense". There is nothing in the statement of the three police witnesses to show that they gave any such command. They have merely stated that they warned the two factions who were pelting stones, and none of them has stated that any command for dispersal was en by any of them. The High Court therefore erred in invoking sec. 151 I.P.C. for the purpose of convicting the other accused with the aid of section 149 I.P.C. [81A-B]
