 A perpetual endowment of properties for the purpose of samadhi kainkaryam, i.e., worship of and at the samadhi (tomb) of a person, is not valid under Hindu law.
 To the extent that any purpose is claimed to be a valid one for perpetual dedication on the ground of religious merit though lacking in public benefit, it must be shown to have a Shastraic basis so far as Hindus are concerned. The heads of religious purposes determined by belief in acquisition of religious merit cannot be allowed to be widely enlarged consistently with public policy and needs of modern society.
