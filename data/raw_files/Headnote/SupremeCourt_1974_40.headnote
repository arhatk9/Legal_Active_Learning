 The appellant was charged with an offence under s. 16(7) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 for adulterating foreign starches with haldi. He was acquitted by the Magistrate on the ground that the sample was not taken by the Food Inspector in the presence, of independent witnesses. leading to non-compliance with the mandatory provisions of s. 10(7) of the Act. The High Court set aside the order of acquittal and held that the provisions of s. 10(7) of the Act were directory and not mandatory.
 Section 10(7) of the Act provides that :where the Food Inspector takes any' action under any of the clauses mentioned therein he shall call one or more persons to be present at the time when such action is taker. and take his or their signatures. By the amendment of 1964 the words "as far as possible" which were in the unamended section were deleted.
 It was contended that s. 10(7) was mandatory and since the Food Inspector did not take a sample in the presence of independent persons as required by the section its contravention would vitiate the conviction.
 On appeal to this Court, confirming the conviction imposed by the High Court, 
HELD : There ran be no doubt that "one or more persons" must mean one or more independent persons. In view of the legislative history of s. 10(7) while taking action under any of the provisions mentioned in the sub-section, the Food Inspector must call one or more independent persons to be present at the time when such action is taken. It is not, however, correct to say that regardless of all circumstances non-presence of one or more independent persons at the relevant time would vitiate the trial or conviction. The obligation which s. 10(7) casts on the Food Inspector is to "call" one or more persons to be present when he takes action. [472 D-F] In the instant case the Food Inspector did. call the neighbouring shopkeepers to witness the taking of the sample. None was willing to cooperate. He could not certainly compel their presence. In such circumstances the prosecution was relieved of its obligation to cite independent witnesses. The Food Inspector was unable to secure the presence of independent persons and was, therefore driven to take a sample in the presence of the members of this staff only. It is easy enough to understand that shopkeepers might feel bound by fraternal ties but no court can countenance a conspiracy to keep out , independent witnesses in a bid to defeat the working of laws.
