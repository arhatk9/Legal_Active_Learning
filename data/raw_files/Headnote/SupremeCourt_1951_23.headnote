 Article 374 (2) of the Constitution of India provides that all suits, appeals and proceedings pending in the Federal Court at the commencement of this Constitution shall stand removed to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the same.
 Article 363 (1) provides that notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, neither the Supreme Court nor any other Court shall have jurisdiction in any dispute arising out of any provision of a treaty, agreement or similar instrument entered into or executed before the commencement of this Constitution by any Ruler of an Indian State.
 Certain States had acceded to the Dominion of India under Instruments of Accession in August 1947. They were treated as having merged in the Province of Bihar and were administered as a part of that Province under Orders issued under the Extra Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947, and s.
 290-A of the Government of India Act, 1935 (as amended by the Constituent Assembly Act of 1949). The States insti- tuted suits in the Federal Court of India before the 26th January, 1950, for a declaration that the various Orders under which the States came to be administered as a part of Bihar and the laws under which those Orders were made were ultra vires and void and the Province of Bihar had accord- ingly no authority to carry on the administration of the States. The suits stood transferred to the Supreme Court of India under Art. 374 (2) of the new Constitution:
 Held, per KANIA C.J., PATANJALI SASTRI J. and BOSE J.
 (MAHAJAN J. dissenting).--That even though the suits were instituted before the new Constitution came into force and under Art. 374 (2) they stood removed to the Supreme Court, nevertheless the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Art. 874 (2) was controlled by Art. 363 (1) of the Constitu- tion in view of the opening words of the latter namely, "notwithstanding anything in this Constitution". As the suits were really to enforce the plaintiff's rights under their Instruments of Accession and the dispute between the parties really arose out of those instruments, under Art.
 363 (1) the Supreme Court bad no jurisdiction to hear the suits. This view (lid not involve giving any retrospective effect to Art. 361 (3). MAHAJAN J. (contra.)--Art. 363.
 takes away the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court on the subjects mentioned therein if suits about them were insti- tuted after the 26th January, 1950, or disputes concerning them arise alter that date, while Art. 874 (12) empowers the Supreme Court to hear and determine suits which were pending in the Federal Court on the 26th January, 1950, and which that court was competent to hear and determine. There is no conflict between 476 these articles, and the Supreme Court had jurisdiction to hear the suit.
 DAS J.--As the plaintiff States, by virtue of the States Merger (Governor's Provinces) Order, 1949, were immediately before the commencement of the new Constitution being admin- istered as if they formed part of the Provinces of Bihar or Orissa. the territories of Bihar and Orissa included the territories of the plaintiff States under Art. 1 of the Constitution read with the third paragraph of Part A of the First Schedule. These States consequently ceased to be States so far as the new Constitution is concerned, they had no legal existence as acceding States, and could not there- fore be recognised as such States by Courts, as Courts are bound by the Constitution and cannot question the validity of any of its provisions. The suits must therefore be regarded as having abated.
