 On the issuance of a Notification under Section 4 of the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950, all rights and interests of the intermediary (landlord) including the forests in village Dhalani and Sorna, vested in the State of U.P. with effect from the date of vesting i.e. July 1, 1952. A draft compensation Roll under Section 40 of the Act, was prepared by the Compensation Officer in respect of the intermediary's interests in the said villages and served upon the Latter, who whereupon filed objections against the Roll. The intermediary claimed Rs. 64,971-9-7 more than the one shown as due to him in the draft roll.
 Purporting to act under Section 39(1)(e)(i) of the Act, the Compensation Officer held that the sale proceeds of the forests in the area of village Sorna during 35 years immediately preceding the date of vesting, aggregated to Rs.
 6,13,334-8-3. He divided this figure by 35 and took the resultant figure, i.e Rs. 17,524/- as the annual income from the forests in village Sorna. But as Rs. 1775-14-6 had already been included in the gross assets, he deducted this amount and thus fixed the annual income from the forests in the village, at Rs. 15,748-1-6. From this figure, he further deducted 15% for management cost and held that the intermediary was entitled to a further sum of Rs. 13,471-11- 6 over and above the one shown as due to him in the draft Compensation Roll.
 The intermediary filed an appeal in the High Court against the said findings which amounted to a decree under the Act, and the State filed its cross objections. The High Court held that the Compensation Officer in preparing the Compensation Roll had committed two errors : Firstly, he completely excluded from consideration the provisions of sub-clause (ii) of clause (e) of Section 39(1) and did not either appraise the annual yield of the forests or take the same into consideration. Secondly, he did not give any reason for taking the period of 35 years under Sub-Clause (i) of Section 39(1)(e) as the measure for calculating the annual average income from the forests. After appraising the evidence on record, the High Court held that it was just and proper that the number of years to be adopted in calculating the average annual income under sub-clause (i) of Section 39(1)(e) should be 20 years. On this basis, the High Court divided the sum of Rs. 6,13,334-8-3 that bad been worked out by the Compensation Officer in respect of the income from sales of forests in Village Sorna, by 20, and arrived at the figure Rs. 30,666-11-3. The High Court further held on an interpretation of clause (e) of Section 39(1), that the Compensation Officer was bound to apperaise the annual vield of the forests on the date of vesting, under sub-clause (ii) of Section 39(1)(e) and take such vield- also into consideration. Relying mainly on the evidence of Shri D. D. Chopra (a retired Divisional Forest Officer examined by the intermediary), the High Court found that the yield of the forest, Apprased Linder clause (ii) of Section 39(1) (e) of the Act, would be Rs. 47,128/- The High Court further appears to have added the 596 figures worked out by it under sub-clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 39(1)(e) and then divided the same by two. By this process, considering all the circumstances of the case, the High Court found that the fair amount to be fixed as the average annual income from the forests in Village Sorna, would be Rs. 40,000/-. It further held that no amount could be legally deducted under Section 44 from this figure by way of management expenses or for any other purpose. The Compensation Officer was directed to prepare finally the Compensation Roll on the basis of Rs. 40,000/- being the annual income from the forests, after adding to it the average income from Sayar. Thus, the intermediary's appeal was partly allowed. The cross-objections of the respondent- State were dismissed.
 Dismissing the appeals by certificate, the Court HELD:
 1. (a) Clause (1)(i) of Section 39(1)(e) of the U.P.
 Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 gives a discretion to the Compensation Officer to take any figure from 20 to 40 agricultural years for the purpose of calculating the average annual income from the forests. The words "considered reasonable" in sub-clause (i) enjoin a duty on the Compensation officer to exercise this discretion reasonably and not arbitrarily. Rule 34, gives guidelines for determining the period for which average income shall be taken under the aforesaid sub-clause (i). For determining such period , the Compensation Officer has to take into consideration several factors, namely, the class of the forest, the periodical fellings made therein during the 40 years preceding the vesting, the income received year after year during the 40 years preceding the vesting the species of the trees in the forest and their age and class, the condition of forest etc. [603 G-H, 604 A] (b) In the instant case, for fixing the number of years at 35 under Sub-Clause (i) of Section 39(1)(e), the Compensation Officer had not given any reason m;liatever related to the criteria in Rule 34(1). On the other hand, the High Court took due note of the factors, in clauses (i), (ii), (iv) and (v) of Rule 34(1), in determining the period of 20 years for calculating the average annual income. In determining the period at 20 years, the High Court rightly gave weight to the fact that its exploitation bad been scientific and prudent, and it had started yielding income from sale of trees only during 10 or 11 years preceding the date of vesting and even on the date of vesting its condition was good. Since the first fellings were within 20 years of the vesting, it was reasonable to determine the period at 20, the same being the minimum fixed in the statute. Thus, the determination of such period as 20 years by the High Court. in the facts of the case, comports best with the guid elines indicated in Rule 34(1). [604 F-H] 
2. A plain reading of clause (e) of Section 39(1) shows that its sub-clauses (i) and (ii) do not provide for two alternative methods of calculating the average annual income of the forest. The conjunction "and" at the end of sub- clause (i) cannot be read as "or". It conjoins the two sub- clauses, and in effect, read in the context of "shall" in the opening part of clause (e), mandates the Compensation Officer to take both the factors into consideration in assessing the average annual income from the forest. The reason why the Legislature has made compliance with the requirement of this Sub-Clause (ii), also, obligatory, appears to be to ensure that the compensation assessed has a reasonable nexus and proportion to the actual and potential value of the forest as on the date of vesting. If a forest has been repeatedly, wholly and indiscriminately exploited within forty years or less immediately before the vesting, its actual and potential value as a forest on the date of the vesting might be far less than the one calculated on the basis of its average annual income of the preceding 20 to 40 years as the case may be. In such a case, average annual income calculated merely on the basis of the income for a period of 20 to 40 years preceding the vesting, may cause fortuitous inflation in the assessment of compensation.
 Conversely, if a forest has been very little exploited in the preceding forty years and is well-preserved and well- developed 597 on the date of vesting, then calculation of its average annual income on the basis of sub-clause (i) alone, without taking into account its potential yield oil the date of the vesting, will make the compensation assessed wholly illusory, having no relation whatever to the value of the forest as at the date of vesting. Entry of the appraised annual yield of the forest on the date of vesting, into computation under clause (e), operates as a counterpoise against fortuitous inflation or deflation in the assessment.
 [605 A-E] 
3. (a) There is no warrant for reading "and" in clause (c) of Section 44 as "or". The Legislature appears to have advisedly used the expression "cost of management" in conjunction with the expression "Irrecoverable arrears of rent". The former takes its color from the latter in association with which it occurs. From the context, it appears that the expression "cost of management" is confined to the cost of management in the collection of rents. The Scheme of Section 44 also supports this construction. Under that scheme a particular deduction is authorised with reference to income from a particular source. A comparative study of Sections 39(1) and 44 would show that there is no clause in the latter Section which specifically authorises deduction of 15% from the income referable to clause (e) of the former. [606 D-F] (b) The High Court was, therefore, right in holding that 15% towards the cost of management could not be deducted by the Compensation Officer in respect of the income from forest calculated under clause (c) of Sec. 39(1).
