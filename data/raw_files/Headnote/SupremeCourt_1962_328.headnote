 Between January 26, 1950, and September 30, 1951, the appellant had sold from Calcutta various goods to parties in Bihar. These sales had been made in the course of inter- State trade and were of species mentioned in the explanation to cl. (1) of Art. 286 of the Constitution on which, in view of the provisions of cl. (2) of that Article as it stood then and as interpreted by this Court in Bengal Immunity Co.
 Ltd. v. State of Bihar, no tax could be imposed by a State law. The respondent State had however before the decision by this Court in the Bengal Immunity Co. case imposed tax on these sales under the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1947, relying on other decisions since overruled which interpreted the explanations to Art. 286 (1) in a different manner. The appellant objected to this imposition.
 On the question being referred to the High Court the respondent sought to justify the tax on other grounds. It contended that the sales made between January 26, 1950, and March 31, 1951, could be legally taxed under the Act because of cl. (2) of the Sales Tax Continuance Order, 1950, made under the proviso to Art. 286 (2) of the Constitution and the sales made between April 1, 1951, and September 30,1931, could be so taxed because of the provisions of the Sales Tax Validation Act, 1956. The High Court accepted the respondents' contention. On appeal to this Court the decision of the High Court regarding the sales between April 1, 1951, and September 30, 1951, was not challenged.
 353 Held, the Sales Tax Continuance Order of 1950 only authorised the continuation after the commencement of the of the Constitution and up to March 31, 1951, of "any tax on the sale or purchase of goods which was being lawfully levied by the Government of any State immediately before the commencement of the Constitution" notwithstanding the bar imposed against such imposition by Art. 286 (2) of the Constitution. The tax on the sales made by the appellant between January 26, 1950, and March 31, 1951, were not of the variety which was immediately before the commencement of the Constitution being lawfully levied by any law of the State of Bihar. The contention of the respondent that the sale defined in the Act included these sales and were therefore being taxed under it from before January 26, 1950, was not tenable.
 Section 33 of the Act read with the decision of this Court in M. P. V. Sundararamier & Co. v. The State of Andhra Pradesh might on the ban under Art. 236 being lifted be construed as authorising the imposition of a tax on these sales does not affect the question in the present case for this section was introduced into the Act by the adaptation of Laws (Third Amendment) Order, 1951, and came into force from January 26, 1950, and could not therefore be a law levying a tax immediately before the commencement of the Constitution.
 M.P. V. Sundararamier & Co v. The State of Andhra Pradesh, [1958] INSC 19; [1958] S. C. R. 1422 considered.
