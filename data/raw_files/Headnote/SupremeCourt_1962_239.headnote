 The appellant, a temporary Government servant, was served with a charge sheet alleging misconduct. An enquiry was held on the charges by the Settlement Officer and the appellant was found guilty. The Deputy Commissioner accepting the findings of the Settlement Officer and without giving a reasonable opportunity to the appellant of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him terminated his services after giving him one month's pay in lieu of one month's notice. The appellant changed the termination of his service by way of a writ petition before the Punjab High Court. The Single judge granted the writ quashing the order. The Division Bench reversed the Single Judge's order.
 Held, that the termination of the appellant's service which was preceded by an enquiry into his alleged misconduct and based on the finding of misconduct, amounted to casting a stigma affecting his future career, and, then being non- compliance with Art. 311(2) of the Constitution of India in that the appellant was not afforded the opportunity to show cause against the proposed punishment, the order contravened Art. 311(2) of the Constitution.
