 The point for determination in the appeal was whether the Registrar of Co-operative Societies under the Bihar and Orissa Co-operative Societies Act, 1935, as amended by Act 16 of 1948, had the jurisdiction under s. 48(1) of the Act to hear and decide a reference made by a registered society against a non-member. The appellant company, incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, with its registered office at Calcutta, manufactured sugar in Bihar. The second res- pondent the Union of Co-operative Societies, registered under the Co-operative Societies Act, made a reference under s. 48 of the Act, against the appellant claiming the sum of Rs. 1,20,809/- odd as commission and interest for supplying sugarcane in 1959-60. The first respondent, the Assistant Registrar of Go-operative Societies registered the reference and issued notice to the appellant. The appellant took the preliminary objection that the Assistant Registrar had no jurisdiction under the Act to entertain the reference. That objection was overruled by the Assistant Registrar relying, on a decision of the High Court and the High Court upheld that order by dismissing in limine the appellant's petition under Arts.226 and 227 of the Constitution.
 Held, that the High Court had taken a wrong view of the law.
 Although under s. 48 of the Act the claim by a financing bank against a nonmember to whom it had made in advance either in cash or kind, with the sanction of the Registrar under s. 16(1), could be entertained by the Registrar, that did not mean that a claim not of the kind referred to in s.16(1), read 805 with s. 2(c), made by a registered society against a non- member, who was not an agriculturist, was within the purview of s. 48(1), read with the Explanation 1. The addition of the word `non-member' by the amending Act of 1948 to the Explanation I, did not enlarge the scope of the main section so as to make all kinds of dispute between a registered society and a non-member cognizable by the Registrar.
 Since in the present case, the second respondent was not a financing bank nor was the appellant an agriculturist, 48(1) (e) and, the Explanation 1 could have no application.Union of India v. Registrar, Co-operative Societies, Patna, (1961) I.L.R. 40 Pat. 7, overruled.
