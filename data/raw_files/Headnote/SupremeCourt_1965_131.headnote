 The predecessors-in-interest of the appellants executed in 1930 a registered mortgage deed (Ex.A-1) in favour of the respondent family for Rs. 31,000. It was a usufructuary mortgage redeemable after 60 years. The mortgagors filed a petition under s. 9A and s. 19A of the Madras Agriculturists Relief Act for scaling down the mortgage debt thereunder.
 The mortgagees raised a plea, inter alia, that the mortgage interest had been transferred to a charity for valuable consideration and therefore s. 9A(10)(ii)(b) of the Act was not attracted and hence the mortgage debt was not liable to be scaled down under the Act. The plea was based on documents Ex.B-1, Ex.B-2 and Ex.B-3. The learned Subordinate Judge, held that the transferee-the charity--not being a transferee for valuable consideration s. 9A(10) (ii) (b) did not apply, and on this finding he scaled down the mortgage debt. An appeal was filed by the mortgagees wherein the High, Court held that the transfer was for valuable consideration and therefore the debt could not be scaled down. The mortgagors appealed to the Supreme Court with certificate.
 
HELD : (i) The agreement Ex.B-1 executed between members of the mortgagee family showed that on August 22, 1934, the family created a trust in respect of a sum of Rs. 36,988-9-8 for a charitable purposes. On September 3, 1939, by EX.B-2, the usufructuary mortgagee right of the family in Ex.A-1 was given to the charity in discharge of the obligation under Ex.B-1. The dedication of the said property was affirmed by the regular partition deed Ex.B-3. In short under the said documents the family transferred to the charity their interest in the usufructuary mortgage Ex.A- 1 in discharge of the obligation to pay the trust a sum of Rs. 36,988-9-8. [174 E-G] (ii) It is implied in the definition of the word 'consideration' in s. 2(d) of the Contract Act that the consideration should be 'something which not only parties regard but the law can regard as having some value'. It is apparent from the definition that consideration may be negative or positive. [177 A-B] (iii) In the present case the family was under an obligation to pay to the charity the amount set apart to it under Ex.B-1. The mortgage interest was transferred in discharge of that obligation. That is to say the charity agreed as a consideration for the transfer of the mortgage interest not to enforce its right to recover that amount from the family. The charity gave up that right in consideration of the mortgage interest acquired by it.
 Therefore it is clear that the family transferred the mortgage interest in trust to the charity for valuable consideration with the meaning of s. 9A(10)(ii)(b) of the Act. [177 B-D] 169 It allowed that the mortgage, Ex.A-1, was rightly held by the High Court not liable to be scaled down under the provisions of the Act. [177D]
