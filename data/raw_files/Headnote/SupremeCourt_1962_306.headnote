 The appellant, a Head Constable, was charged with an offence under s. 218 of the Indian Penal Code. The prosecution case was that on February 23, 1954, on receipt of information that some persons were attempting to smuggle Ganja, the appellant caught N with a bundle containing 15 packets of Ganja and seized them, that he then prepared a Panchnama in which he incorrectly showed the seizure of 9 packets of Ganja only, and that on the next day he, however, prepared a new report in which it was falsely recited that the person with the bundle ran away on seeing the police after throwing away the bundle containing 9 packets of Ganja only. The allegation against the appellant was that he prepared a false report with 7 the dishonest intention of saving N who had actually been caught with Ganja from legal punishment. The Trial Court accepted the prosecution case and convicted the appellant.
 The appellant challenged the legality of the conviction on the ground, inter alia, that the alleged offence had been committed "by an act done under colour of dutv" within the meaning of s. 161 (I) of the Bombay Police Act , 1951, and that, therefore, the prosecution was barred under that section inasmuch as it was instituted admittedly more than six months after the date of the act complained of.
 Held, that under s. 161 (1) of the Bombay Police Act, 1951, the, words "under colour of duty" have been used to include acts done under the cloak of duty, even though not by virtue of the duty ; that when the appellant prepared a false report he was using the existence of his legal duty as a cloak for his corrupt action and that, therefore, the act thus done in dereliction of his duty must be held to have been done "under colour of the duty." Madhav Ganpat Prasad v.Maihidkhan, (1917) I.L.R. 41 Bom.737 and NarayanHari v. Yeshwant Raoji, A.I.R. 1928 Bom. 352, approved.
 Observations in Parbat Gopal Walekar v. Dinkar S. Shinde, (1960) 63 Bom. L.R. 189; that "if the alleged act is found to have been done in gross violation of the duty, then it ceased to be an act done under colour of duty", disapproved.
 Held, further, that the word "offences" in s. 161 (1) of the Act refers to offences under any law, and is not restricted to offences under the Act only.
