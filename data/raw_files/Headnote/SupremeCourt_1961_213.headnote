 The respondent instituted a suit on the Original Side of the Bombay High Court against the appellant for the recovery of his commission in respect of certain share transactions at Agra. The plaint was filed after obtaining leave of the Bombay High Court under cl. 12 of the Letters Patent. One of the defences of the appellant, taken in his written statement, was that the suit filed was outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Bombay High Court Original Side, in as much as the entire cause of action, if any, had arisen at Agra. The suit was eventually referred to arbitration. The arbitrator gave his award in favour of the respondent which was upheld on appeal by the High Court.
 The respondent took out execution proceedings wherein the appellant took objection inter alia that the Bombay High Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit and to make the award a decree of the court, as no part of the cause of' action ever arose within the territorial jurisdiction of that court, and that therefore all the proceedings following thereupon were wholly without jurisdiction.
 Held, that where a party to a suit had agreed to refer the matter to arbitration through court lie would be deemed to have waived his objection to the territorial jurisdiction of the court raised by him in his written statement.
 Held, further, that the question of the correctness of the procedure or the order granting leave under cl. 12 of the Letters Patent or the waiver of any objection must be raised in the proceedings before the High Court and could not be agitated in execution proceedings. The validity of the decree could be challenged in execution Proceedings only on the ground that the court which had passed the decree was lacking in inherent jurisdiction in respect of the subject matter of the suit or over the parties to it.
 748 in the present case the appellant was estopped from challenging the jurisdiction of the Bombay High Court to entertain the suit and to make the reference to the arbitrator; and he was equally estopped from challenging the authority of the arbitrator to render the award.
