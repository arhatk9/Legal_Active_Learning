 Byelaw No.2 of the byelaws of a municipal board, which came into force on the 1st January, 1950, provided that "no person shall establish any new market or place for wholesale transactions without obtaining the previous permission of the board, and no person shall sell or expose for sale any vegetable, fruit, etc. at any place other than that fixed by the board for the purpose "; and bye-law No. 4 permitted the grant of a monopoly to a contractor to deal in wholesale transactions at the place fixed as a market. In anticipation of these byelaws the monopoly right to do wholesale business in vegetable for three years was auctioned by the municipal board and granted to the high- est bidder And A place was also fixed as the market where such business could be carried on. The petitioner who had been carrying on wholesale business in vegetables at a rented shop within the municipality for two years before the byelaws came into force applied for a license to carry on his business at his shop but this was rejected on the ground that there was no provision in the byelaws authorising the grant of any such license, and he was prosecuted for contra- vention of the byelaws. He applied under Art. 32 of the Constitution for the enforcements of his fundamental right as a citizen to carry on his business which was guaranteed by Art. 19 (1) of the Constitution.
 Held (i) that the prohibition in byelaw No.2 became absolute in the absence of provision authorising the issue of a license, and, inasmuch as the municipal board had, further, put it out of its power to grant a license to the petitioner by granting a monopoly, the restrictions imposed were not reasonable within 567 the meaning of Art. 19 (6) of the Constitution, and the byelaws were accordingly void and the prosecution of the petitioner illegal, (ii) that the fact that the Constitution came into force only after the byelaws had come into force did not affect the petitioners's right to carry on his business.
 Held also, that an appeal under section 318 of the U. P.
 Municipalities Act was not in the circumstances an adequate legal remedy the existence of which would disentitle the petitioner from maintaining this application.
