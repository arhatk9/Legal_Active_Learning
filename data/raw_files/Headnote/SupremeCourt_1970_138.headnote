 The appellant hypothecated certain agricultural lands to the Travancore State Government against loans received by him.
 On his failure to repay the loans the plots in question were notified for sale after notice to the appellant. In the proclamation of sale the number of plot no. 545/32A-1 was wrongly mentioned as 545/32-11/1 and the number of Plot of plot no. 537/3 was wrongly mentioned as 532/3. Certain other plots held by the appellant although not hypothecated to the Government were also sold. The appellant presented a petition to the Division Peshkar challenging the aforesaid revenue sale without success. The appellant then filed a suit for setting aside the sale and redemption of the mortgage. The trial court partly decreed the suit holding that the sale was a nullity. The High Court, however, reversed the judgment and dismissed the suit. With certificate appeal was filed in this Court. The appellant contended : (i) that the revenue sale was a nullity because in effect and substance no proclamation of sale was issued in as much as wrong revenue numbers were mentioned therein.
 (ii) that on account of wrong numbers being mentioned property worth. Rs.1.00,000 had been sold for a meagre sum of Rs.4,510; (iii) that under the Travancore Recovery Regulation the property in question could not be brought to sale and (iv) that the Government had no authority to attach and sell plots which were never hypothecated -and thereby the whole sale was vitiated.
 
HELD : (i) The ;ale of the survey numbers which were hypothecated to the Government was not vitiated by the mere fact that the survey numbers relating thereto were wrongly mentioned. It was only a case of misdescription and their identity was never in doubt. [634 C-E] Sheodhvan Sineh v. Muhammat Kuer [1961] INSC 212; [1962] 2 S.C.R. 753 and Thakur Barhma v. Jiban Ram Marwarl (1913) L.R. 41 I.A. 38, applied.
 (ii) There was no material to show that the property was ever valued at more than Rs.30,000. Considering the fact that the plots in question were mortgaged the price for which they were sold was not low. [634 H] (iii) The point that the dues under the bond could not be recovered as arrears of land revenue was not raised at any earlier stage. The court could not set aside the sale on this ground because it it had been raised earlier the Government may well have relied on the power of sale Riven under the bond. The fact that the sale took place under the machinery provided by the Revenue Recovery Regulation and not under any ad hoc machinery set up by the Government could not vitiate, the, sale. [635 G] 630 (iv) However, the appeal had to be allowed and sale set aside on the ground that the bonds did not give power to the Government to sell the properties other than those mentioned in the bonds. All the properties-those hypothecated and those not hypothecated--were sold in one lot. This vitiated the sale and the Court had no option but to declare the sale of all the properties void.
