 The appellant was arrested by the police and immediately produced before the Presidency Magistrate, Madras on a charge under s. 4(1) (A) of the Madras Prohibition Act on the allegation that he was in possession of a certain amount of Ganja concealed in a wooden box in his premises without any permit. The appellant pleaded guilty and upon that plea, he was convicted by the Magistrate. The appellant preferred an appeal to the High Court alleging, inter alia, that he was an illiterate person, not acquainted with English or Tamil or with any other South Indian language and he only knew Hindi as it was spoken in Uttar Pradesh, that the proceedings were rushed through with undue haste, that he did not really plead guilty to the charge and he had never understood the implications of the offence or proceedings before the Magistrate. The High Court called for a report from the Presidency Magistrate who submitted that the particulars of the offence and the plea of guilty by the appellant were explained to the appellant by an interpreter-the Bench Clerk who had passed examinations in Hindi, and the appellant's allegations were false.
 Thereafter the High Court dismissed the appeal. In appeal by certificate, the appelant, inter alia, contended that the Magistrate did not comply with the mandatory provisions of s. 243 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, that the appellant had been deprived of the substance of a fair trial, that the conviction of the appellant was legally invalid.
 
HELD : The requirements of s. 243 of the Criminal Procedure Code are mandatory in character and a violation of these provisions vitiates the trial and renders the conviction legally invalid. The requirement of the section is not a mere empty formality but is a matter of substance intended to secure proper administration of justice. It is important that the terms of the section are strictly complied with because the right of appeal of the accused depends upon the circumstance whether he pleaded guilty or not and it is for this reason that the legislature requires that the exact words used by the accused in his plea of guilty should, as nearly as possible, be recorded in his own language in order to prevent any mistake or misapprehension. [233 D-F] Section 243 of the Code is a provision of a special character and according to well established rule of interpretation that special provision will take precedence and override the general provision of s. 362(2)(A) of the Code. [234 A-B] The violation of the procedure in s. 243 of the Code was sufficiently serious to invalid the the conviction of the accused. it was manifest from the record that the admission of the appellant had not been recorded "as nearly as possible in the words used by him", as required by s. 243 of the Code.
