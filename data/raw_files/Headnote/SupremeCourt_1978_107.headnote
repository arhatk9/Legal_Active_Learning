 By lease deed dated July 20, 1945 for a period of ten years beginning from the year 1353 fasli to the end of the year 1362 fasli, registered in his favour, the original appellant Sher Singh obtained possession of ten plots of land admeasuring 6.63 acres situate in Mahal Safed, Mouza Mahendri, Sikandarpur, Pargana Amroha, District Moradabad, U.P. and was mutated in the Revenue Record as a "hereditary tenant". Later, on September 6, 1945 a sale deed in respect of the proprietary right and interest in the said lands were executed by the Zamindars in favour of Kaley Singh, Harbans Singh and Nihal Singh, brothers of Sher Singh and one Chajju Singh. Asserting their right of preemption in respect of the aforementioned sale on the ground of they being co- sharers in the Mahal in which the said plots were situate, Jai Kumar Singh and Roop Chand Singh, respondents 2 and 3 herein brought four suits in the Court of Munsif, Moradabad against the aforesaid vendors and vendees and the original appellant Sher Singh for possession of the land as also for cancellation of the lease in favour of Sher Singh on the ground that it was fictitious and fraudulent and was executed with a view to defeat their right of pre-emption.
 The suits were decreed as prayed for and on further appeal confirmed by the Civil Judge, Moradabad. Although the vendees did not carry an appeal, the original appellant preferred a further appeal to the High Court. The High Court allowed the appeal, holding that the revenue court alone had jurisdiction to entertain the suits seeking relief of ejectment of the lessee and the civil court had no jurisdiction, set aside the decree passed against him.
 Meanwhile the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms.
 Act, 1950 (U.P. Act 1 of 1951) came into force with effect from the commencement of the 1360 fasli in July 1, 1952.
 Pursuant to the observations of the High Court, Respondents 2 & 3 filed ejectment suits against Sher Singh under section 209 of Act 1 of 1951, which were dismissed. First appeals preferred against them also proved abortive. In second appeals the High Court stayed the orders of the Courts below on account of the commencement of the consolidation operations in the village.. Thereafter Respondents 2 and 3 filed objections under section 9(2) of the U.P. Consoli- dation of Holdings Act, 1953 disputing the correctness of the entries in the record showing Sher Singh as "Bhumidar" and praying that the latter's name be expunged from the records and in his place their names be substituted as Bhumidars, but the same was rejected by the Consolidation Officer IV at Kanth. The Settlement Officer in first appeal and the Deputy Director, Consolidation, Lucknow in second appeal confirmed it. In the revision application under s.
 48 of the 1953 Act, the Joint Director of Consolidation allowed it, holding that the lease in favour of Sher Singh was fictitious with intention to defraud the pre-emptors and that the claim of respondents 2 and 3 was covered by Section 18 of the Act. The Director, therefore, ordered the substitution of their names in the revenue record as holders of the land as "Khudkhast" (self-cultivating possession).
 The appellant challenged the said order by way of a writ petition which was dismissed.
 Allowing the appeal by special leave, the Court 
HELD : (1) Section 48 of the U.P. Consolidation of Hollings Act, as it stood on the relevant date, before its amendment by Act No. VIII of 1963 is pari materia with S. 115 of the Civil Procedure Code. The revisional jurisdiction of the High Court is confined to cases of illegal or irregular exercise or non exercise or illegal assumption of the jurisdiction by the subordinate courts.
 983 If a subordinate court is found to possess the jurisdiction to decide a matter, it cannot be said to exercise it illegally or with' material irregularity even it it decides the matter wrongly. In other words, it is not open to the High Court while exercising its jurisdiction under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure to correct errors of fact howsoever gross or even errors of law unless the errors have relation to the jurisdiction of the Court to try the ;dispute itself. [987 F-H] Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure empowers the High Court to satisfy itself on three matters : (a) that the order of the subordinate court is within its jurisdiction;
 (b) that the case is one in which the Court ought to have exercised jurisdiction and failed to do so; and (c) that in exercising jurisdiction the Court has not acted illegally, that is, in breach of some provisions of law, or with material irregularity by committing some error of procedure in the course of the trial which is material in that it may have affected the ultimate decision. And if the High Court is satisfied that there is no error in regard to any of these three matters, it has no power to interfere merely because it differs from the conclusions of the subordinate court on questions of fact or law. A distinction must be drawn between the errors committed by subordinate courts in deciding questions of law which have relation to, or are concerned with, questions of jurisdiction of the said Courts, and errors of law which have no such relation or connection. An erroneous decision on a question of fact or of law reached by the subordinate court which has no relation to question of jurisdiction of that court, cannot be corrected by the High Court under Section 115. [989 F-G, 990 A-B] Applying the tests to the facts of the instant, case, it must be held that the Joint Director of Consolidation ignored the limitation that existed on his power under S. 48 of the 1953 'Act as it stood on the relevant date and illegally assumed jurisdiction which he did not possess.

 (2)(a) The Joint Director of Consolidation was not competent to interfere, with the decisions of the subordinate consolidation authorities who have not acted illegally in exercising their jurisdiction. It is not and cannot be disputed that the consolidation authorities subordinate to the Joint Director possessed plenary jurisdiction and competence to go into the question of the correctness or otherwise of the entries in the revenue records. Relating to Sher Singh's possession over the plots of land in question and they arrived at. a concurrent finding of fact that Sher Singh was in actual possession of the land on his own behalf on the relevant date on the basis of the aforesaid valid lease deed and that neither the vendees had even held the land in question as khukhasht holders nor could they be deemed to be so. [990 C-D, 991 E-D] (b) Mere relationship of Sher Singh with three out of four vendees on which the Joint Director of Consolidation has relied was not enough to warrant the finding that the aforesaid lease grated in his favour was fictitious. Even the subsequent transfer of the land in question in favour of his nephew to which reference has been made in a casual and laconic manner by the Joint Director of Consolidation cannot lead to the conclusion that the lease was fictitious. No evidence which may indicate as to when the said transfer was made nor has any material been placed before the Court to show that the nephew in whose favour the land was transferred was the son of any one of Sher Singh's three brothers who were povendees with Chajju Singh. The 984 nature and character of the so called transfer by Sher Singh in favour of his nephew is also shrouded in mystery. In the circumstances, the finding of the Joint Director of Consolidation that the aforesaid lease in favour of Sher Singh was fictitious cannot be sustained. [991 D-F] (3)The 1953 Act was designed by the State Legislature principally to do away with the zamindary system which involved intermediaries between the tiller of the soil and the State in Uttar Pradesh, to provide for the acquisition of their rights, title and interest and to reform the law relating to land tenure consequent upon the aforesaid abolition and acquisition. To attain this object, the legislature empowered the State Government to declare by means of a notification that as from a specified date, all estates situate in Uttar Pradesh or in specified area or areas thereof shall vest in the State and as from the beginning of that date (which would be called the date of vesting), all such estates shall stand transferred to and vest except as provided in the Act, in the State free from all encumbrances. [991 G-H, 992 A] A close scrutiny of the facts and circumstances of the case in the light of the provisions of Section 3(28) read with S.
 3(9) of and Sections 6, 7, 18, 19, 20, 131, 134, 135, 136, of the 1953 Act, leaves no room for doubt that Sher rights of a Bhumidar. There is nothing on the record lease deed in favour of Sher Singh was fictitious or that the revenue record on the basis of that deed were not conform to the true factual position and that Sher Singh of the fields in question on his own behalf. Consequently as Sher Singh was holding the said fields as a hereditary tenant on the date immediately preceding the date of vesting, he became entitled to retain possession thereof as a Sirdar under S.
 19 of the Act and on depositing to the credit of the State Government in the manner provided in section 134 and other allied provisions of the Act an amount equal to ten times the land revenue payable or deemed to be payable he became entitled to a declaration that he had acquired the rights of a Bhumidhar mentioned in section 137 of the Act in respect of the said fields and to the grant of a certificate to that effect.
