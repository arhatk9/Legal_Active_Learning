 By letters dated 21st August 1964 and 30th August 1964 the appellant, submitted his resignation from the Indian Administrative Service and requested the State Government in which he was serving to forward his resignation to the Government of India. On 31st October 1964, the Government of India accepted the appellant's resignation and intimated acceptance to the State Government. On 27th November, the appellant wrote letters both to the State Government and Government of India withdrawing his resignation but, on 29th March 1965, the State Government passed an order accepting the appellant's resignation and directing the appellant to hand over charge.
 The appellant filed a writ petition in the' High Court for quashing the orders of the State Government and the Government of India. The petition was dismissed.
 In appeal to this Court, it was contended that : (1) So long as the acceptance of the resignation was not communicated to him, the appellant could withdraw his resignation; and (2) the. orders accepting the resignation amounted to dismissal and were therefore violative of Art. 311 of the Constitution.
 
HELD: (1) When a public servant has invited by his letter of resignation the determination of his employment, his service normally stands terminated from the date on which the letter of resignation is accepted by the appropriate authority and. in the absence of any law or statutory rule governing the conditions of his service, to the contrary, it will not he open to the public servant to withdraw his resignation after it is accepted by the appropriate authority. Undue delay, in intimating to the public servant concerned the action taken on the letter of resignation, may justify an inference that the resignation had not been accepted. [860 F-H] In the present case, on the plain terms of the resignation letters of the appellant the resignation became effective- as soon as it was accepted by the appropriate authority. No rule has been framed under Art. 309 of the Constitution, nor is there any other rule having statutory force which requires, that for an order accepting the resignation to be effective it must be communicated to the person submitting his resignation. The circular relied upon by the appellant, according to which resignation becomes effective when it is accepted and the officer is relieved of his duties, merely contains instructions to be followed and has no statutory force. The resignation was accepted within a short time of its receipt by the Government of India and the delay of the State Government in implementing the order was not inordinate. [860 A-D, H] State of Punjab v. Amar Singh Harika, A.T.R, 1966 S.C, 1313, held inapplicable.
 858 (2) The orders were neither orders of dismissal nor of termination of service for any misconduct. [861 B-C]
