 By virtue of the award in Adjudication case No. 33 of 1952 given by the State Tribunal Allahabad, respondents were entitled to fifteen days' sick leave on full wages as a condition of their service. The appellant adopted the Employees State Insurance Act in 1957. The appellant, therefore, paid to the workmen full wages for two day's sick leave out of 15 days' sick leave for the reason that the workmen did not get cash benefit for the first two days of the waiting period of sickness on account of the provisions of section 49 of the E.S.I. Act. For the balance of the thirteen days only half the wages' were paid. In the industrial dispute referred for adjudication to the Industrial Tribunal under section 4(k) of the U.P.
 Industrial Disputes Act, the award went in favour of the workmen.
 Dismissing the appeal by special leave, the Court, ^ 
 HELD : 1. The general purpose and effect of section 72 is to deny to the employers the right or power to reduce or discontinue the benefit payable to the workmen under their conditions of service on the ground that the benefits available under the conditions of service and under the E.S.I. Act being similar the workmen would not be entitled to a double benefit. [240 A-B] Section 72 provides in terms that the mere circumstance that an employer is liable to make a contribution under the E.S.I. Act will not entitle him, directly or indirectly, to reduce the wages of an employee or, in so far as the Regulation permits, discontinue or reduce the benefits payable to him under the conditions of his service even if those benefits are similar to the benefits conferred by the E.S.I. Act. The purpose of Section 72 is evidently to discourage employers from using the benefits provided under the E.S.I. Act as an excuse or justification for reducing or discontinuing the benefits available to the workmen under their conditions of service on the ground of similarity between the two types of benefits. The case of the appellant before the Industrial Tribunal was that it was making a contribution to the E.S.I. Corporation for the benefit of its employees and if any individual employee chose not to avail of the benefits due to him from the Corporation on account of the sickness benefit, it is he who ought to suffer and there would be no justification for obliging the employer to spend for his sickness benefit twice over. It is precisely this type of argument and attitude that the legislature anticipated and guarded against by incorporating the particular provision in section 72. [240 B-E] 237 
 2. The contention that it is enough for justifying the deduction from wages due to the workmen for sick leave that the employee is covered by the E.S.I. Act is not correct. In the first place, section 46 of the E.S.I. Act would show that employees who are covered by the E.S.I. Act are entitled to certain benefit subject to the provisions of the E.S.I. Act. It is, therefore, not as if the workmen are entitled to the benefits absolutely and without compliance with the conditions laid down by the Act or the Regulation.
 Secondly, the proviso to Regulation 97 says that the employer shall be entitled to deduct from the leave salary of the employee, "the amount of benefit" to which he may be entitled under the E.S.I. Act for the corresponding period of his sickness. A workman does not become entitled to the "amount" payable to him by way of sickness benefit unless, in the first instance, he chooses to avail himself of the sickness benefit. That benefit cannot be forced on him. This would show that the employer's right to make a deduction from the employee's sick leave wages can only be exercised in respect of those days of sickness leave for which the workmen has actually availed of the sickness benefit. [240 F, H, 231 A-C] 
 3. Benefits which are available under the E.S.I. Act are not intended as substitutes for benefits to which the workmen are entitled under the conditions of their service.
 A workman becomes entitled to sickness benefit only if he is qualified for it and he gets a cash benefit only if he avails himself of the sickness benefit. Thus it is only when a workman, in fact obtains or receives a cash benefit that the employer can exercise his right to make a deduction from wages due to him by way of leave salary. In providing for periodical payments to an insured worker in case of sickness, the legislature did not intend to substitute any of those benefits for the workmen's right to get leave on full pay on the ground of sickness.
