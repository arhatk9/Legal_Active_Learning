 A passenger bus belonging to the appellant met with an accident, as a result of which two persons B and N died on the spot. The legal representatives of the deceased persons applied for compensation before the tribunal appointed under the Motor Vehicles Act. Their claim was opposed by the appellant as well as by the insurance company. The tribunal found that the accident was due to the negligence of the driver and therefore the claimants were entitled to compensation. The tribunal computed the compensation due to the legal representatives of B at Rs. 18000. Out of that sum determined the compensation due to the widow at Rs.
 8000; the compensation due to one of his daughters was fixed at Rs. 4000 and to the other at Rs. 6000. But as the daughters had not made their claims during the prescribed time, the Tribunal disallowed the compensation due to them and granted a decree in favour only of B's widow. In the case of N the tribunal computed the total compensation payable at Rs. 18000 and granted that sum to his legal representatives. It directed that the entire sum payable by the appellant should be paid by the insurance company. The insurance company as well as the legal representatives of the deceased persons appealed to the High Court. The High Court enhanced the compensation payable to the legal representatives of both B and N from Rs. 18000 to Rs. 36000.
 It condoned the delay in making the claim by the daughters of B and made the entire sum payable to his legal representatives. It also allowed the appeal of the insurance company and limited the amount payable by the insurance company to Rs. 2000 in the case of each of the deceased persons in accordance with s. 95(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act. By special leave appeals were filed in this Court. The appellant challenged (i) the amount of compensation as granted by the High Court, (ii) the condonation of delay in the case of B's daughters and (iii) the limiting of the amount payable by the insurance company to Rs. 2000.
 
HELD: (i) Under s. 110B of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 the tribunal is required to fix such compensation as appears to it to be just. The power given to the tribunal is wide.
 The pecuniary loss to the aggrieved party would depend on data which cannot be ascertained accurately but must necessarily be an estimate or even partly a conjecture. The general principle is that the pecuniary loss can be ascertained only by balancing on the one hand the loss to the claimants of the future pecuniary benefit, and on the other any pecuniary advantage which from whatever sources comes to them by reasons of the death, that is, the balance of loss and gain to a dependent by the death must be ascertained. [25B-D] Gobald Motor Service Ltd. v. R. M. K. Veluswami & Ors., [1961] INSC 159; [1962] 1 S.C.R. 929, relied on.
 The determination of the question of compensation depends on several imponderable. In the assessment of those imponderables there is likely to be a margin of error. If the assessment made by the High Court cannot 21 be considered to be unreasonable-and in the present case it could not be said to be unreasonable-it will not be proper for this court to interfere with the same. Taking an overall assessment of the facts and circumstances of the present case it could not be held that the compensation awarded to the legal representatives of the deceased persons by the High Court was excessive. [24E] (ii) By the time B's daughters were impleadedthe time for filing applications for compensation by them had elapsed.It was conceded that Tribunal had jurisdiction to condone the delay in making the claim. The Tribunal had not chosen to condone the delay. But the High Court has in its discretion condoned the delay. The wife of B was an illiterate lady ; she was helpless and without assistance.
 In the circumstances this Court would not be justified in interfering with the discretion exercised by the High Court in condoning the delay in question. [23C-D] (iii)Reading together the provisions in ss. 95(1) (b), 95(2) and 96 of the. Motor Vehicles Act it is clear that the statutory liability of the insurer to indemnify the insured is as prescribed in s. 95(2). Under that section the maximum liability on an insurer in the case of a vehicle carrying more than six passengers is Rs. 2000 per passenger and the maximum total liability is Rs. 20000. In the, present case the vehicle was one in which more than six passengers were allowed to be carried. The limit of liabi- lity of the insurer prescribed under s. 95(2) (b) can be enhanced by a contract to the contrary. No clause of the policy issued to the appellant in the present cast provided for the payment of any amount higher than that fixed by s.
 95(2) (b). The High Court was therefore right in its conclusion that the liability of the insurer in the present case only extended up to Rs. 2000. [24G, 25D, 26B, D]
