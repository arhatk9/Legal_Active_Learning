 Rule 56 of the Fundamental Rules originally provided that the age of compulsory retirement for Central Government Servants other than ministerial servants shall be 55 years.
 On November 30, 1962 the Government, of India, Ministry of Home Affairs issued an Office Memorandum whereby the age of compulsory retirement was raised to 58 years. However by paragraph 6 of the Memorandum the appointing authority could retire a Government servant at the age of 55 years without giving any reason after three months' notice. On July 21, 1965 Fundamental Rule 56 was amended by the Sixth Amendment so as to incorporate, with, modifications, the provisions of the aforesaid Office Memorandum. Rule 56(a) of the Fundamental (Sixth Amendment) Rules 1965 laid down that except as otherwise provided in the Rule, every Government servant shall retire at the age of 58 years. Certain, exceptions were provided to the Rule and that in sub-rule (j) said that the appropriate authority in the public interest had the absolute right to retire a Government servant at the age of 55 years after giving him notice.
 Born on July 15, 1910 the appellant attained the age of 55 on the corresponding date in 1965. OF July 22, 1965 while he was holding the post of Assistant Commissioner of Income- tax, he received a notice dated July 15, 1965 compulsorily retiring him from service with effect from October 21, 1965.
 He filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging that notice but failed. By certificate he appealed to this Court.
 
HELD : (i) The proviso to Art. 309 empowers the President to make rules regulating the retirement and conditions of servants appointed to Union services and posts until provision in that behalf is made under an Act of the appropriate legislature. The rules so made by the President are effective subject to the provisions of any such Act.
 Paragraph 2 of the Office Memorandum in terms recites 'that the President is pleased to direct that age of compulsory retirement of Central Government servants should be 58 years; subject to certain exceptions paragraph 8 of the Memorandum merely restates with particularity the true legal position which obtains under the proviso to Article 309., Nothing stated in that paragraph is capable of the 217 construction that the Office Memorandum was not to be effective until Fundamental Rules were consequently amended.
 In. fact by Paragraph 7 the provisions of the Memorandum were given express effect from December 1, 1962. [219 FG] (ii) It is true the notice of compulsory retirement was served on the appellant on July 22, 1965 while the Fundamental (Sixth Amendment) Rules came into force a day prior thereto viz. on July 21, 1965. But the crucial date is the date on which the notice was issued, namely July 15, 1965 for, a right which is validly determined, cannot without more-, stand revived by a later amendment enlarging the scope of that right. [220-A B] The appellant continued in service beyond the age of 55 years which he attained on July 14, 1965 by reason of paragraph 2. of the memorandum. Having obtained the benefit of that provision he could not repudiate the exception thereto, in paragraph 6 of the memorandum. [220 G] Punjab v. Amar Singh Harika, A.I.R. 1966 S.C. 1313, distin- guished.
 (iii) Under the Office Memorandum the Government was entitled to retire the appellant compulsorily without assigning any reason. The concept of public interest was introduced by sub-rule (j) of Rule 56(a) of the Fundamental (Sixth Amendment) Rules 1965. The appellant's service having been validly determined by a notice which was issued prior to the date when the amended rules came into force it was not necessary for the authority to satisfy itself that it was in public interest to retire the appellant compulsorily.
