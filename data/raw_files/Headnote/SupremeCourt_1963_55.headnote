 Section 19 of the M. P. General Sales Tax Act, 1938 empowers the Commissioner, if he is satisfied that any sale or purchase of goods has escaped assessment, to reassess the tax payable and to levy a penalty. Section 30 empowers the Commissioner to "delegate any of his powers and duties under this Act." The Commissioner delegated to Assistant Commissioners his "powers and duties" to make an assessment or reassessment of tax or penalty and to exercise all other powers under ss. 18, 19 and 20, The Assistant Commissioner gave a notice to the appellant that he was satisfied that sales from 1.4.1957 to 31.3.1958 had escaped assessment and assessed him to an additional tax and penalty. The appellant contented that the Commissioner had delegated only his power under s. 19 and not the duties and accordingly the Assistant Commissioner could validly re-assess the appellant 287 only after the Commissioner had been satisfied personally that sales had escaped assessment.
 Held, that the order of re-assessment and penalty made by the Assistant Commissioner was valid. The requirement of his satisfaction before exercising the power to re-assess under s. 19 did not impose any duty on the Commissioner ; it was really a condition or limitation of the exercise of that power. Even if this requirement as to satisfaction be considered as a duty, it was an adjunct to the exercise of the power to re-assess and it passed necessarily with the delegation of the power. It would make no difference even if the conditions precedent to the exercise of the power were more than one as they had no independent existence and were merely attached to the power.
