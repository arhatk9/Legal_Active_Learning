 The appellant was a prosperous public company whose principal undertaking was the manufacture and sale of iron pipes and poles. In August, 1965 its workmen demanded bonus at a rate higher than what they were receiving and the Assistant Labour Commissioner started correspondence with the management and the secretary of the workers' union. On 1st October, 1967, about 150 workmen assembled, after 2 p.m., at the gates of the administrative building in which about 40 members of the staff were present. The members of the staff were not allowed to leave the building and no ingress or egress was allowed even of refreshments. At 5 a.m. next day, the police arrived and warned the workmen that force will be used unless they left, and rescued the staff. The secretary of the workers' union was present during all that time but never made any effort to persuade the assembled workmen to leave the premises. The factory remained closed on 2nd October on account of public holiday and on the 3rd October, 1967, the management issued a notice declaring a closure of the factory, and sent a copy of it to the Chief Inspector of Factories. A notice was given to the workers that they should hand over vacant possession of the quarters which had been allotted to them. A letter was written to the Chief Minister of the State that the manage- ment had no other alternative but to close down the factory.
 Information was similarly given to the Superintendent of Police in which a request was made for posting a platoon of police force in the factory premises at the appellant's cost. Employees in the branch offices in other States were discharged and members of the staff at the principal office were notified that their services would be terminated within a period of three months from the date of closure 3rd October, 1967. The management offered to pay the workmen wages for one month in lieu of notice, and compensation under the proviso to s. 25FFF(t) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, on the ground that the closure was on account of unavoidable circumstances beyond the control of the employer.
 On the question whether the appellant had declared a lockout or whether it was a bona fide closure, the Industrial Tribunal, to which the question was referred by the State Government, held that the 'suspending of the work in the factory amounted to a lockout, that it was illegal and gave consequential directions.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD :(1) The notice of 3rd October,1967 amounted to a closure of the business itself and not a lockout.
 Ordinarily, this Court does not interfere with the findings of fact of the Industrial Tribunal, but the question whether the undertaking was closed down or not by means of the 288 notice was not considered in a proper manner by the Tribunal and its approach was erroneous and suffered from infirmities. [300 D-E] (a)The Tribunal erred in holding that there can be a closure of an undertaking only when there are financial difficulties and the undertaking becomes a losing concern. There is no such principle of industrial law. On the other hand, the entire set of circumstances and facts have to be taken into account while endeavouring to find out if, in fact, there has been a closure. In one case, the management may decide to close down an undertaking because of financial or purely business reasons; in another, it may decide in, favour of closure when faced with a situation in which it is considered either dangerous or hazardous from the Point of view of the safety of the administrative staff or of the members of the management or even of the, employees themselves in carrying on the business. The essence of the matter is the factum of closure by whatever reasons moti- vated, and not a mere presence of closure. [295 D-E; 297 G- H] In the present case, if the workers' demand was purely in respect of bonus there was no justification for keeping about 40 members of the administrative staff confined inside the building for about 15 hours and making them pass through an anxious time. On account of the gherao, The magnitude of which was not inconsequential, the management was entitled to close down the undertaking. The fact that the decision to close clown was a quick decision and the appellant was a profitable and going concern could not give rise to any suspicion regarding the action when considered in the background and circumstances of the case.

 (b)There is no evidence that the action taken was not ratified or not accepted by the Board of Directors or other officer competent to accord approval. On the contrary, a large number of employee both at the principal office and the branch offices in other States had been discharged from service or notices of termination had been served on them, compensation was offered to the workmen and accepted by many under ,he proviso to s. 25FFF(1) of the Act on the basis of closure, and, after closing the factory no orders were obtained or executed in the matter of sales. Therefore, no adverse inference against the appellant could, be drawn because, of the non-production of a resolution passed by its Board ,of Directors or of other formal decision taken by the management, especially when the respondent-workmen had not asked for such production. [299 E-H] (c)The statement in the notice that 'the factory would be closed' could not be conclusive on the question whether the appellant merely closed down the place of business, or closed down the business itself as a final and irrevocable closure. The conclusion should be reached on the totality of the facts and circumstances of the case. [300 B-D] Express.v Newspapers Ltd. case, [1962] 2 L.L.J. 227, referred to.
 (d)The respondents' contention that the company must be wound lip or that there should have been a transfer of the machinery or the factory before it could be said that the undertaking had been closed down was not correct. [299 H] 289 Workers of the Pudukottah Textile Mills case, C.A., 1005 of 1963, followed.
 (2)The closure of the undertaking was, however, not due to unavoidable circumstances beyond the control of the appellant. Therefore, the appellant was liable to pay compensation not under the proviso to s. 25FFF (1) but under the sub-section itself. [303 F] intention of the Legislature is to be very stringent and strict about the nature of the circumstances which would bring them within the proviso; and the burden of proof is on the employer to show that the car. comes within the provison, that is, that it was not possible to carry on the business in a business--like way or without unusual exertion. It is not expected that, when difficulties arise, the employer should sit idly and not make an effort like a prudent business man to tide over the difficulties and save his business. L303 D-E] In the present case, there was the gherao and the apprehension as, to, personal safety expressed by the members of the staff in their letters to the management.
 But in those letters it was stated that the staff would not be able to attend office unless arrangements were made for their protection and safety. There was nothing to indicate that the police had refused to give protection even to the individual members of the staff or that the expenditure or cost of securing such protection for them would have been so exorbitant that the appellant could not have afforded it.
