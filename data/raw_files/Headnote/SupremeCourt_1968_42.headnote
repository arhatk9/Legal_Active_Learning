 For widening a street, the respondent-municipality requested the State Government to acquire the lands within the "line of the street" prescribed by the Municipality. After the State Government issued notification under s. 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, the owners of the lands put up temporary structures upon the lands with the permission of the Municipality on giving an undertaking that they would not claim compensation for those structures in the land acquisition proceedings. The structures were let out to the appellants. Notifications were issued under s. 6 and compensation payable determined. When attempts were made to take possession of the land acquired, the tenants- appellants, moved writ petitions in the High Court The High Court rejected the petitions. Dismissing the appeals, this Court, 
HELD : By the compulsory acquisition for a public purpose, subject to payment of compensation, no fundamental rights guaranteed under Arts. 19 and 31(2) of the Constitution were infringed. The lands were properly notified for acquisition. The compensation payable in respect of the lands was determined. If there was any grievance which the appellants were entitled to raise in respect of the compensation determined as payable, their remedy lay in approaching the Courts competent to determine that quest- ion. [210 D-E] For the purpose of widening the street, the Municipality had the power Linder s. 114 of the Bombay Municipal Boroughs Act 1925 to purchase land and under s. 52 of the Act the Municipality could request the local Government to take action for compulsory acquisition of the land and for vesting the same in the Municipality. The power of the appropriate Government under s. 4 of the Land Acquisition Act to notify land needed or likely to be needed for a public purpose is not 'subject to the restriction, that when the public purpose is of a municipality the municipality has attempted to purchase the land by private treaty and has failed in that attempt. [211 G, 212 B-C] The appellants as lessees of the structures had no right in the land on which the structures stood. The structures belonged to the owners of the land. and were allowed to be put up after the date of the notification under s. 4 of the Land Acquisition Act was issued on the undertaking that no, compensation shall be claimed 'in respect of the structures.
 The appellants were not on the lands at the date, of the notification under s. 4, and being tenants of the structures they acquired, prima facie, no interest in the lands. Even assuming that they had acquired, by virtue of their res- pective tenancies, an interest in the lands, their remedy was to approach 208 the Land Acquisition Authorities for claiming apportionment of compensation.
