 The assessee was a Bank in liquidation. The official liquidator submitted a return for the assessment year 1948- 49 and claimed as deductions : (i) under s. 10(2)(xi) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, debts due to the Bank which had become irrecoverable, and (ii) under s. 10(2)(xv), certain amounts embezzled by one of its officers and which the bank had to pay to its constituents. The income-tax authorities and the Appellate Tribunal rejected the claim for allowance of bad debts on the ground that the bad debts had not been written off in the books of account of the bank. They also rejected the claim for allowance of the embezzled amounts on the grounds that those amounts did not relate to the business of the bank and that, in any event, the loss, not having been ascertained in the year of account was not suffered in that year. When the matters were referred to the High Court, the Court asked for a report from the Tribunal as to : (i) whether any debts had actually become irrecoverable, and (ii) the year in which loss was suffered by the bank in consequence of the embezzlements. The Tribunal reported that debts aggregating to Rs. 15,00,000 at least, had become irrecoverable in the year of account, and that the defalcations by the bank's officer became known to the liquidator only after the ending of the year of account.
 After the receipt of the report, the High Court decided against the assessee holding that (i) the bad debts were not admissible deductions because they were never written off, and (ii) the loss to the bank on account of the defalcations occurred later than the year of account. The assesses appealed to the Supreme Court.
 
HELD : (i) The bank was entitled to claim Rs. 15,00,000 as bad debts in the year of account. [802 F-G] Section 10(2) (xi) does not say that the income-tax officer cannot allow a bad or doubtful debt unless it is written off in the books of account; it merely states that he shall not allow any amount in excess of the amount actually written off as irrecoverable. If there is a reasonable explanation for the absence of an entry writing off the amount of a debt, such absence by itself is not a ground for denying to the officer, jurisdiction to estimate the amounts of debts which have become irrecoverable and to allow them as proper deductions in the computation of profits. The officer's power is restricted only in one direction, namely, that, when the assessee has posted an entry or entries in his books of account, the amount to be estimated as irrecoverable is not to exceed the amount actually written off by the assessee. That does not mean that an assessee who chooses not to post an entry is in a better position than one who has actually posted entries, because, he always runs the risk of the income-tax officer coming to the conclusion that the fact that he had hot chosen to post an entry is consistent with the finding that no part of the debt due to him has become irrecoverable.

 789 (ii) The bank was not entitled to claim as a business loss or deduction the amount embezzled by the officer. L802 G] Loss had been suffered by the bank as a result of the defalcations by its officer, but the withdrawal and misapplication of the funds came to the liquidator's knowledge only after the accounting year, and so, the amount would not be a Permissible deduction under s. 10 (2)(xv) of the Act. Though the embezzlements took place in 1946, they were then unknown to the bank; and even after they became known to the liquidator, a trading loss could not be deemed to have resulted. A trading loss does not occur to a bank as soon as embezzlement takes place of its funds, whether or not the bank was aware of it. So long as there was a reasonable prospect of recovering the amounts, trading loss, in a commercial sense, would not be deemed to have resulted.
