 The respondents alleged before the High Court that certain provisions of the Rajasthan Public Trusts Act, 1959 contravened their fundamental rights guaranteed under Arts.
 25 and 26 of the Constitution. In the first set of appeals (C.A. Nos. 1083 and 1092 of 1967) the respondents, in their writ petition, claimed that the temple of Shri Rikhabdevji (also known as Keshariyanathji temple) was a Swetamber Jain temple which was under the ownership and management of Jain Sashan and had been recognised as such in official documents as well as in the firmans issued by the erstwhile State of Mewar and that the State usurped the management and applied the provisions of Rajasthan Public Trusts Act and thereby contravened their fundamental rights. In the second set of appeals (C.As. Nos. 1119 and 1087 of 1967) the Chairman of the Trust Committee of Shri Nakodaji Parasnath Tirath alleged that the administration and management of the temple was being carried on by the Trust Committee on behalf of Swetamber Jain temple and that interference in the management of the temple and other religious institutions envisaged by the Act was against the usages and customs, principles and tenets of the Jain religion.
 The High Court struck down s. 17(3) of the Act on the ground that under the rules made under the Act the sum charged as registration fee goes to the consolidated fund and was thus not a fee but a tax which the State Legislature was not competent to levy. Section 52(1)(d) and (e) were struck down as invalid as B. 53 had not provided for proper safeguards of leaving the administration of the property in the hands of the denomination. But since the management of the temple had vested in the State prior to the constitution, the case of Rikhabdevji was held to have been covered by s. 52(1) (a) or (c) of the Act. Section 53 was struck down on the ground that since Art. 26 contemplates not only a denomination but a section of the denomination, the trustees of a public trust representing the same religion may not necessarily be members of that section of the denomination managing the property even if such public trust has the same object as that of the public trust, the management of which is being transferred to the Committee of Management.
 In the first set of appeals the High Court held that the temple was a Swetamber Jain temple which was being managed by the State. It directed the State to constitute a Committee for its management as provided in the Act.
 Section 17(3) provides that an application to be presented under sub-S.(1) of that section "shall be accompanied by such fee. if any, not exceeding five rupees, and to be utilised for such purposes, as may be- prescribed". Rule 18 of the Rules specifies the rates of fee payable on different values of the trust property enumerated the-rein, and further provides that the fee shall be credited to the Consolidated Fund of the State. Section 52(1) of the Act enacts that the provisions contained in Chapter X shall apply to every public trust which vests in the State Government (cl. a) or which is managed directly by the State Government (cl. c); or which is under the superintendence of the Court of Wards (cl. d); & Aid of which the gross annual income is ten thousand rupees or more (cl. e). Section 53 provides that the management of a public trust shall vest in a Committee of Management to be constituted by the State Government. Sub-section (5) provides that the Chairman and Members of the Committee of Management shall be appointed from amongst (a) trustees of public trusts representing the same religion or persuasion and having the same objects and (b) persons interested in such public trusts or in the endowments thereof or belonging to the denomination 742 for the purpose of which or for the benefit of whom the trust was founded in accordance with the general wishes of the persons so interested so far as such wishes can be ascertained in the prescribed manner.
 Allowing the appeals, 
HELD : Section 17(3) cannot be held to be invalid and ultra vires the Dower ,of the State Legislature. The mere fact that the amount was paid into the consolidated fund is by itself not sufficient to hold that the levy under s. 17(3) of the Act is a tax. It was held in the Commissioner of H.
 R. E. Madras v. Sri Lakshmindra Tirtha Swamiar of Shri Shirur Mutt that the essence of taxation is compulsion and imposition made for public purpose without reference to any special benefit to be conferred on the payer of the tax, that is to say, that the levy of tax is for the purposes of general revenue which, when collected, forms part of the public revenues of the State. A fee on the other hand is payment for a special benefit or privilege which the individual receives. It is regarded as a sort of return or consideration for services rendered and should be correlated to the expenses incurred by Government in rendering the services. In the Secretary, Government of Madras, Home Department v. Zenith Lamp & Electrical Ltd., it was reiterated that the fact that the collections went to the Consolidated Fund was not in itself conclusive though not much stress could be laid on this point because Art. 266 requires that all revenues raised by the State shall form part of the Consolidated Fund, [765D-H; 76.6A] In the instant case the expenditure on Devasthan Department was much more than the income from registration. The mere fact that the amount was paid into the Consolidated Fund is by itself not sufficient to hold that the levy was a tax.
 Section 52 (1) (d) has no application in this case because it deals with a public trust which is under the superintendence of the Court of Wards and this part of the judgment of the High Court was clearly wrong. [761 D] It is for the State Government, if it intends to apply the provisions of Chapter X of the Act, if it is satisfied that the gross annual income exceeds ten thousand rupees to include it in the list of public trusts Published under sub- section (2) of s. 52 in the official gazette., Section 53 postulates the application of Chapter X before the management of the temple can be said to vest in a Committee of Management to be constituted by the State Government in the manner provided in that section. Until the notification is published under sub-s. (2) of 8. 52 the respondents could not claim that their rights were affected. [761E-G) The hypothesis on which the High Court has based its conclusions is not warranted by the provisions of sub-s.(5) of s. 53 of the Act. In the first category, apart from the Committee being constituted from amongst the trustees of public trusts representing the same religion the Committee can also be constituted from amongst the trustees of the same persuasion. The significance of the word "persuasion" and what it connotes does not seem to have been considered by the ELI Court. The word persuasion is a synonym of faith, creed, denomination, religion etc. In the first category also a Committee can be appointed from persons of the denomination to which the trust belongs as in the second category with this difference that in the first category if the State Government chooses, it can appoint it from the trustees representing that denomination or persuasion while in the second category from amongst the persons who belong to tire said denomination who may not be trustees as such.
 Even where the Persons interested satisfy the requirements of s. 2(9) the additional requirement of cl. (b) of sub-s.
 (5) of s. 53 is that such persons must be also persons for whose benefit the trust was founded. A reading of cl.(a) of sub-s. (5) clearly indicates that the trustees Must represent the concerned religion or persuasion, which includes a denomination. it could not have been the intention to appoint a Committee of management comprising trustees of a public trust of a particular religion or persuasion who do not to that religion or persuasion or denomination. Nor does cl. (b) or subs-s (5) ,of s. 53 empower persons who do not belong to a denomination to be appointed to a public trust of that denomination. Again, the word "denomination" is wide enough to include sections thereof, and it cannot therefore be said. as the High Court seems to assume, that a section of the denomination managing the property may not be the same as trustees of public trusts representing the same religion even management of which is being transferred to the Committee. If s. 53(5)(a) is read in the manner suggested the difficulties pointed out by the High Court would not arise at all. [763D-H, 764A-C] 743 On a consideration of all the documents admitted, which the State had not, and could not challenge, there was no doubt that Shri Rikhabdevji temple was a Jain temple and the State of Rajasthan had produced no evidence to the contrary to show that it was a Hindu temple where Jains of all sects as well as Hindus of all sects were allowed to worship. [749F] There was no doubt that the management of the temple of Rikhabdevji with its properties had validly vested in the Ruler of Udaipur, and thereafter in the successor State before the Constitution of India came into force. There can be no doubt that any right which the Jams or anyone of the two Jain denominations, namely, the Swetambars or Digambars or both, might have had in the temple or in its management was lost in the pre-Constitution period and is now vested in the State of Rajasthan. [753A] Director of Endowments, Govt. of Hyderabad & Ors. v. Akram Ali, A.I.R. 1956 S.C. 60 and Sarwartal & Ors. v. The State of Hyderabad [1960] 3 S.C.R. .311, referred to.
 The constitution under which the properties and management of the templ had vested in the Ruler and thereafter in the State continued to be law by virtue of Art. 372 of the Constitution till it was repealed by the impugned Act.
 Since the respondents lost the right to manage and administer the temple and its properties prior to the Constitution by a valid law, they cannot now regain that right on the plea that law contravened the right guaranteed under Art. 26(d) of the Constitution. [753C] Durgah Committee Ajmer v. Syed Hussain Ali, [1962] 1 S.C.R.
 383, followed.
 Tilakayat Shri Govindlalji Maharaj v. The State of Rajasthan 
 Religious Endowments, Madras, v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt. [1954] INSC 46; [1954] S.C.R. 1005, and Sri Venkataramana Devaru v. The State of Mysore, [1958] S.C.R.
 895, referred to.
 The High Court was in error in giving the impugned directions in view of the fact that the right of management of Rikhabdevji temple was lost as it was vested in the State and the respondents could not complain of any infringement of their fundamental rights to manage and administer its affairs.
