 The Uttar Pradesh Imposition of Ceiling of Land Holding Act 1960 was amended by the Amending Act 1972. Section 5(6) proviso (b) of the Act States :
 "(6) In determining the Ceiling area applicable to a tenure-holders, any transfer of land made after the twenty-fourth day of January, 1971, which but for the transfer would have been declared surplus land under this act, shall be ignored and not taken into account :
 Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall apply to- (a) ...........................
 (b) a transfer proved to the satisfaction of the prescribed authority to be in good faith and for adequate consideration and under an irrevocable instrument not being a benami transaction or for immediate or deferred benefit of the tenure-holder of other members of his family.
 The appellant sold 25 acres of land for consideration by registered deeds dated 2nd January and 9th August, 1971. The Prescribed Authority under the U.P. Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings Act, 1960 issued notice to the appellant to show cause why 25.96 acres land from his holding be not declared surplus. The appellant filed objections stating that (i) the entire land was unirrigated; (ii) there was no source of irrigation in the fields and he had made two sales of 25 acres for acquiring a site and constructing a residential house. The Prescribed Authority rejected the objections of the appellant and declared the said land as surplus.
 Aggrieved by the said order the appellant went in appeal before the Appellate Authority, who, partly allowed the appeal. The appellant filed a writ petition in the High Court, which was dismissed in limine. By special leave petition, the point for consideration was whether a sale made by a tenure-holder on a date between January 24, 1971 and June 8, 1973 for adequate consideration and under an irrevocable instrument not being a benami transaction or for immediate or deferred benefit of the tenure holder or other members of his family, can be held to be not in `good faith' within the contemplation of proviso (b) to sub-section (6) of section 5 of the Ceiling Act, merely because the tenure- holder had failed to prove the satisfaction of the Prescribed Authority or the Appellate Authority that the purpose for 288 which the sale was made, did not constitute an impelling necessity for the sale.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD : It is clear that the crucial date on or from which no tenure-holder is entitled to hold land in excess of the ceiling area is June 8, 1973. It is a cardinal canon of construction that an expression which has no uniform precisely fixed meaning, takes its colour, light and content from the context. [293E-F, H] The benefit of clause (b) of the proviso to sub-section (6) is available to a transfer made in good faith, that is, to a bona fide transfer whereby the tenure-holder genuinely and irrevocably transfers all right, title and interest in the land in favour of the transferee, in the ordinary course of management of his affairs and which is not a collusive arrangement, or device or subterfuge to enable the tenure- holder to continue to hold the surplus land or any reserved interest in presenti or in futuro therein, (or merely to convert it into cash), and thus circumvent the ban under section 5(1) of the Ceiling Act. In order to be entitled to the benefit of proviso (b) of Sec. 5(6), a transfer made in good faith, must satisfy the further conditions, (ii) to (iv), enumerated in the proviso (b). [294C-F] Once it is established by the transferring tenure holder that the transfer in question effected in the course of ordinary management of his affairs, was made for adequate consideration and he had genuinely, absolutely and irrevocably divested himself of all right, title and interest (including cultivatory possession) in the land in favour of the transferee, the onus under Explanation II, in the absence of any circumstances suggestive of collusion, or an intention or design to defraud or circumvent the Ceiling Act, on the tenure holder to show that the transfer was effected in good faith will stand discharged. It will not be necessary for the tenure to prove further that the transfer was made for an impelling need or to raise money for meeting a pressing legal necessity. [294G-H, 295A] The other conditions of Proviso (b) to Sec. 5(6) being satisfied, the Appellate Authority was not justified in holding that the sales were not in `good faith' merely on the ground that the construction of a residential house in New Delhi did not in his opinion constitute a compelling necessity for the sales. Moreover, in the instant case, the tenure-holder at the material time was serving in the army in the rank of Brigadier which implies that he was nearing the age of retirement from army service. It is not shown that he had any other house where he could live. He had, in fact, borrowed part of the cost of construction from the Government. There was therefore nothing sinister in his intention if he arranged to sell his lands to other cultivators to raise funds to acquire a site and build a residential house in New Delhi where he would live in reasonable comfort after retirement from army service.
