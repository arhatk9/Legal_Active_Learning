 The appellant With some others robbed Dulla and two others and during the robbery the appellant shot at and killed Dulla with a pistol. After a chase the appellant was apprehended and the pistol and some cartridges were recovered from him. The pistol and cartridges were not sent for examination to the ballistic expert. A number of eye witnesses were produced at the trial. The Sessions judge acquitted the appellant but on appeal the High Court convicted him under ss. 302 and 394 Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to death. The appellant contended that the circumstances of the case showed that the eye witnesses could not be relied upon and that the failure to get the pistol and cartridges examined by a ballistic expert was a good ground for rejecting the evidence of the eye witnesses.
 Held, that though the prosecution would have done well to send the pistol and cartridges to the ballistic expert for his opinion, the omission to do so did not furnish any reason to doubt or reject the evidence of the eye witnesses.
 There was no reason to think that the injuries of which Dulla died could not have been caused by the pistol, on the contrary the nature of the injuries was wholly consistent with the prosecution story that a pistol was used.
 335 Mohinder Singh v. The State, [1950] INSC 26; [1950] S.C.R. 821, distingished.
 Held, further that even if there was no apparent reason in a case to explain why witnesses were telling a lie against an accused person circumstances brought out by the evidence may show that in fact their evidence could not be safely relied upon. But in the present case there was no circumstance that justified any doubt about the truth of the prosecution case against the appellant.
