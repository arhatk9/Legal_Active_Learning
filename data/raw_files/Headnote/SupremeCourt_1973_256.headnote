 Clause (b) of s. 8(2) of the Central Sales-tax Act, 1956 enacts that in the case of goods other than declared goods sold to persons other than registered dealers or government, sales-tax shall be calculated at the rate of 10 per cent or at the rate applicable to the sale or purchase of such goods inside the appropriate State, whichever is higher. Art. 301 provides that, subject to the other provisions of Part XIII, trade, commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of India shall be free. Article 302 provides that Parliament may, by law, impose such restrictions on the freedom of trade, commerce or intercourse between one State and another or within any part of the territory of India as may be required in the public interest. Art. 303 (1) provides that notwithstanding anything in art. 302 neither Parliament nor the Legislature of a State shall have power to make any law giving or authorizing the giving of any preference to one State over another or making or authorizing the making of, any discrimination between one State and another by virtue of any entry relating to trade and commerce in any of the Lists in the Seventh Schedule.
 The respondents claimed (i) that they were not liable to be taxed at the higher rate prescribed in s. 8 (2)(b) of the Central Sales-tax Act, 1956 on the turnover of their sales in the course of interstate trade to government on the ground that s.8(2)(b) is violative of arts. 301 and 303(1) of the Constitution and, therefore void ; (ii) that there will be varying rates of tax on interstate sales in different States depending upon their rates of sales-tax for intrastate sales and that that will lead to the imposition of dissimilar tax on the sale of the same or similar commodities and so the section is violative of art. 303(1).
 The High Court allowed the writ petitions.
 Allowing the appeals to this Court by the State, 
HELD : (1) (a) There is no reason to hold that s. 8(2)(b) is bad for the reason that it violates art. 301. If prevention of evasion of tax is a measure in the public interest them can be no doubt that Parliament is competent to make a provision for that purpose under art. 302 even if the provision would impose restrictions on the interstate trade or commerce. [7 A, D] (b) It cannot be presumed that because the rate of tax was 10 per cent at the material time on this class of transactions or the rate fixed by the appropriate State in respect of intrastate sales, whichever is higher, the imposition of this rate was not in the public interest. [7 C] Therefore, in any view of the matter, Parliament was competent to enact s. 8(2)(b) of the Act.
 (2) . There is no merit in the contention that s.8(2)(b) of the Act offends tile provisions of art. 303(1). In N. K.
 Nataraja Mudaliar's case the court held that the existence of different rates of tax on the sale of the same or similar commodity in different States by itself would not be discriminatory as the flow of trade does not necessarily depend upon the rates of sales-tax ; it depends upon a variety of factor such as the source of supply, place of consumption, existence of trade channels, the rate of freight, trade facilities, availability of efficient transport and other facilities for carrying on the trade.
