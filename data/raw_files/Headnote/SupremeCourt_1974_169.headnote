 Section 68C of the Motor Vehicles Act 1939 says that where ally State Transport Undertaking is of opinion that it is necessary in the public interest that road transport services in general should be run and operated by the Road Transport Undertaking it may prepare a scheme giving particulars of the area or route proposed to be covered and shall cause every such scheme to be published in the official gazette. Section 2(1) says that unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context in relation to any provision of the Act. area means such area as the State Government may, having regard to that provision, specify by notification in the official gazette. The State Government established the Road Transport Corporation under s. 3 of the Road Transport Corporation Act 1950. The Corporation prepared a scheme proposing to operate stage carriage services in the entire State and on all routes and portions thereof falling within the said area to the complete exclusion of all other persons. The scheme approved by the State Government was published in the gazette. The appellants who were transport operators in the State challenged the validity of the scheme. The High Court dismissed the writ petitions.
 On appeal to this Court it was contended that it was necessary for the State Government to have specified the area by notification because wherever the word 'area' Occurs in the Act the meaning to be given to that word is the one given in s. 2(1) unless there is something repugnant in the context or the subject matter in s. 68C.
 Dismissing the appeals, 
HELD : (a) In the context of s. 68C the word 'area' does not mean an area specified by the State Government in a notification in the gazette in accordance with the substantive part of the definition clause 2(1). The context in which the word occurs makes the application of the substantive part of the definition repugnant. [13F] (b) The word 'area' concurring in s. 68C does not have the same meaning as the word 'route' in the section. A route postulates an area; but for that reason it cannot be said that the legislature made no distinction between the two.
 'Area' is defined in S.2(1) and that definition does not speak of any route. Route is defined in S.2(28) of the Act.
 In fact "area" and "route" are distinct. Otherwise the legislature would not have found it necessary to provide a separate definition clause for route. [14D; G] (e) If in respect of a scheme in relation to a route or routes, it is not necessary that the State Government should make a notification specifying the route or routes, there is no reason why the State Government should specify the area by a notification in the gazette for framing a scheme in relation to an area. It is impossible to understand the rationale behind the distinction why when a scheme is framed in relation to an area a notification in the gazette specifying its extent is necessary and why when it is framed in relation to a route or routes a notification specifying the route or routes is not required.
