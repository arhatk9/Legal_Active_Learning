 An ex-parte decree was passed against R in a money suit and in cxecution thereof his house was sold. It was purchased by the appellant's father. Formal possession was given to the purchaser but R continued to reside in the house till his death in 1945. As he died without heirs the Maharaja of Jaipur whose subject he was took possession of the house.
 The appellant's father then filed a suit for the possession of the house. The suit was contested on the ground that R was a lunatic and since the earlier suit had been instituted against him without appointment of a guardian-ad-litem, the decree in that suit was a nullity and the execution sale void. This defence was accepted by the trial court, the first appellate court, and the High Court. By special leave the appellant came to this Court.
 
HELD : It is a well-settled principle that if a decree is passed against a minor without appointment of a guardian, the decree is a nullity and is void and not merely voidable.
 This principle becomes applicable to the case of a lunatic in view of r. 15 of 0.32 of the Code of Civil Procedure, so that the decree obtained against R was a decree which had to treated as without jurisdiction and void. [574 A-B] A sale is void ab initio if it is held in execution of a decree which 'is a nullity and, consequently, to be treated as non-existent. In the present case therefore no rights could be acquired by the purchaser when he purported to purchase the house in execution of the decree against R.
 [576 B] R having died without leaving any heir, the property naturally passed by escheat to the Maharaja of Jaipur. That principle is clearly recognised in Hindu law. [576 C] Janak Rai v.
