 Allowing the appeal, the Court ^ 
 HELD : 1 : 1. The Central Reserve Police Force squarely falls within the expression "Armed Forces of the Union" as used in sub-section (2) of section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. [794 F] 1 : 2. The expression must be given its ordinary meaning which would certainly not be limited to the inclusion of only the military, naval and air-forces of the Union as defined in clause (a) of sub-section (3) of section 132 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. [793 F-G] 1 : 3. Entry 2 in List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution clearly envisages armed forces other than the three well known forces of the State, namely, the naval, military and air-forces. [793 H, 794 A-B] 1 : 4. Sub-section (1) of section 3 of the Central Reserve Police Force Act itself declares in no uncertain terms that the Central Reserve Police Force is an armed force of the Central Government which is the same thing as saying that it is a part of the "Armed Forces of the Union".
 [794D] 1 : 5. Just because the Central Reserve Police Force is a reserve force it does not follow that it is not a regularly operating force. [794 E-F] 
 2. The question whether the offences alleged to have been committed by the appellant in the instant case, are or are not such as may be said to have been committed while he was acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty is to be left over. [794 G] Pancham Lal v. Dadan Singh, [1979] Criminal Law Journal 1018; S. B. Saha v. M. S. Kochar, [1980] 1 SCR 111-1979 Criminal Law Journal 1367, approved and followed.
