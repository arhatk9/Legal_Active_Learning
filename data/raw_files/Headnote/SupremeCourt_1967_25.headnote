 The appellant entered into a contract with the President of India for the supply of railway sleepers. The consignees, to whom the sleepers were to be despatched 'according to the instructions given to the appellant under cl. 11(a) of the conditions of contract, were outside the State of Madhya Pradesh. The sleepers were booked by rail to the consignees from Dhamtari railway station in Madhya Pradesh. In the third column in the Schedule to the contract, Dhamtari was shown as the place of delivery. On the question whether the sales came under the Explanation to Art. 286(1) (a) of the Constitution prior to its amendment by the Constitution (Sixth Amendment) Act, 1956 and were therefore exempt from sales-tax under the C.P. and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947, the High Court held : (1) that 'the property in the goods passed to the purchaser at Dhamtari, (2) that the sleepers were actually delivered to the purchasers at that place, and (3)that the sales were completed at Dhamtari and were therefore liable to tax.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The sales were covered by the Explanation and as such were not taxable by the State of Madhya Pradesh. [557 A-B] (1) The question is not when and where, under the general law, the title to the goods passed under the contract, but whether actual delivery of the goods took place, for consumption outside the State of Madhya Pradesh so as to be within the deeming provision of the Explanation. [556 B-C] (2) In the fifth column in the Schedule to the contract, relating to rate, the expression "F.O.R was used only in connection with the price of the goods. Therefore, it only meant that the rate was to be inclusive of all charges of putting the goods on rail and had nothing to do With the place of delivery. Further, the expression "actually delivered" in the Explanation means physical delivery of the goods or such other action as puts the goods 1 in the possession of the purchaser but does not include symbolical or notional delivery such as entrustment to the railway as a common carrier, [550 C; 553 F-G; 555 D] Singareni Collieries Co. Ltd. v. State of Andhra Pradesh & Ors.,[1966] 2 S.C.R. 190 followed.
 Sup. Cl/67-6 548 (3) All the clauses of the contract have to be read as a whole to find out the intention of the parties as to where the actual delivery was to take place. So read, cis. 3, 11.
 12 and 14 of the contract are not merely conditions super- imposed after the actual delivery of the goods. They show that, while the major part of the operations of the appellant with regard to delivery were to be performed at Dhamtari, he was not relieved of all liability as to delivery until the goods were finally accepted at the destination the consignee, and that actual physical delivery was not to be taken as complete before the goods were accepted by the consignee at the destination. Clause 3(a) links delivery with final acceptance, which, according to cl. 11(g), could only "be after the goods had reached the destination and were acknowledged as accepted by the consignee. Clause 11(g) also shows that notwithstanding the fact that the goods had been passed by the Sleeper Passing Officer at Dhamtari, they had been put on rail within the period, of contract at the said station, the Sleeper Passing Officer had given the appellant a passing certificate in terms of cl. 10 and the Station Master at Dhamtari had issued a tally receipt for the number of sleepers loaded the consignee still had the right to inspect the goods at the destination and reject any which were not in terms of the contract; and such rejected goods were to be treated as non- delivered. The place of actual delivery, in the light of all the circumstances., could only be the destination and the goods could only be said to be fully delivered and finally accepted after they were acknowledged at the destination, and since consumption took place only in the State to which the goods were despatched, the gales came within the purview of the explanation, [554 H; 55-5 A-D; 556 B-D] Birendranath Guha & Co. v.
