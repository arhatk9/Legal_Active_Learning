 The respondent formed a partnership firm with his two major sons, and his two minor sons were admitted to the benefits of the partnership to the extent of their shares. In the relevant assessment years the income of the minors was added to the total income of the respondent under s. 16(3)(a) (ii) of the Income-tax Act and he was granted "earned income relief" only to the extent of his own individual share of the profits. He claimed earned income relief under s.
 2(6AA) of the Income-tax Act on the share of the profits of the minor sons which was included in his total income.
 Held, that the general intention of s. 2 (6AA) of the Income-tax Act is to give relief in cases where the income of a minor is included in the total income of the father who has to pay income tax on the consolidated amount of profits and the section means that in the case of a firm the father being the partner who is actively engaged in the conduct of the business of the firm while the minor is not, earned income relief should be given to the father to the extent of the minors' share of the profits also.
