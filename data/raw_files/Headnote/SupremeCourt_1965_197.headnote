 The petitioner firm had obtained from the proprietor of an Estate in Madhya Pradesh the right to pluck and carry tendu leaves from trees in certain villages. The right was to endure for a period of twenty-five years from 1948 to 1973.
 In 1950, the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Rights (Estates, Mahals and Alienated Lands) Act was passed which vested in the State all rights, title and interest vesting in the proprietor or any person having interest in such proprietary right in areas to which the Act was extended.
 When the petitioner and others were obstructed in plucking tendu leaves, they had approached this Court under Art. 32 of the Constitution to enforce what they claimed as their "fundamental right to property". A Division Bench of this Court in Chhotabhai Jethabhai v. State of Madhya Pradesh [1953] 3 S.C.R. 476., issued a writ prohibiting the State form interfering with those rights on the ground that contracts and agreements such as the one held by the petitioner-firm in essence and effect licences and that there was nothing in the Abolition Act to affect their validity or to extinguish such rights. Subsequent to ibis decision,. in 1964, the Madhya Pradesh Tendu Patta (Vyapar Viniyaman Adhiniyam was passed, the object of which was to create a State monopoly in the trade of tendu leaves restricting its purchase or transport. When the petitioner firm was informed that the right to collect tendu leaves was abrogated by the State Government under the Adhiniyam, it approached this Court under Art. 32 of the Constitution. In support of the Petition, it was contended that (i) the petitioner was seeking to enforce the same "fundamental case and as such this decision had a binding effect as res judicata, and (ii) the Adhiniyam did not touch the rights of the petitioner as recognised and enforced by this Court in Chhotabhai Jethibhai's case and that it did not attempt to nullify that decision expressly or even indirectly.
 HELD: The petition must fail.
 (i) Chhotabhai's case does not operate as res judicata even if it might have been assumed in that case that a right to property was involved. Subsequent decisions of this Court have- laid down that the decision in Chhotabhai's case which treated the agreements as bare licences and yet considered that a fundamental right-to property as conferred by them was apparently, given per incurious and could not therefore be followed." A right to contract is not a right to property and Chhotabhai's case cannot be understood to have treated it as such. It was possible that the Divisional Bench.
 which decided that case thought in terms of property in leaves etc., on their being severed from earth as existing.
 even before these were severed. This was not the true position in law because the agreements then considered betokened a licence coupled with a grant. The attention 41 of the Divisional Bench was not directed lo this difference.
 [47 C; 48 B-C; 49 F-G] The plea of res judicata must also fail because the two causes of action are not alike. In Chhotabhai the cause of action was based on the invasion of rights under the authority of the Abolition Act. Now, the invasion is and under the authority of the Adhiniyam. [48 G-H; 49 E] If a statute creates new circumstances which render the earlier decision. inapplicable, the effect must be to avoid -the earlier decision of the Court. [50 B-C] (ii) It cannot be said either by reason of any rule of res judicata or on analogy that the petitioner is entitled to invoke Art. 32 when it possesses no right of property in the leaves. Since there is no right to property before the leaves are plucked no such right can be said to be invaded by the Adhiniyam. The petitioner had only a contract in its favour and that is not a right of property. [52 C-D] Case law referred to.
