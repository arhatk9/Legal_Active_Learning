 The appellant company-assessee-at a general meeting on December 30, 1954 passed a resolution to the effect that a portion of the accumulated undivided profits "be capitalised and distributed amongst the holders of the ordinary shares in the company on the footing that they became entitled thereto a-, capital and the capital was to be divided into, bonus shares and allotted to the ordinary shareholders on the basis of their share holdings and by clause (b) of the resolution the directors of the company Were directed to "issue allot and distribute" the new shares, credited as fully paid up amongst the persons whose names are registered as such in the books of the company on 1st, January 1955.
 The shareholders were entitled to get dividends on those shares only as from 1st January 1955. For the assessment year 1956-57 the relevant accounting period ending on December 31. 1955, the Income-tax Officer determined the total income of the company and in computing the Corporation tax due in respect of the income reduced the rebate to which the appellant company was entitled on two counts; first under sub-cl. (a) and secondly under sub-cl. (b) of cl. (1) to the second proviso to paragraph D of Part 11 of the Finance Act 1956. As a result of proceedings before authorities under the Act, the following questions were referred to the High Court (i)Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the bonus shares of the face value of Rs. 50,07,500 should be included in the paid up capital of the assessee within the meaning- of that term in pursuance of sub-section (1) of the explanation and paragraph D of Part 11 of the Finance Act 1956 for the relevant year and;
 (ii) Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the bonus ,hares in question can be said to have been issued within the meaning of the second proviso to paragraph D of Part 11 of the Finance Act 1956, to the shareholders by the assessee during the accounting year ended 31st December 1955 relevant for the assessment year 1956-57.
 The High Court answered both the questions in favour of the department. In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (i) The company bad 'full powers to convert its accumulated undivided profits into bonus ,hares and it was not open to the ordinary shareholders to refuse to accept those shares when allotted. Under The resolution a portion of the accumulated undivided profits were converted 324 into capital: that capital was divided into fully paid up bonus shares and allotted to the ordinary shareholders on the basis of their share-holdings. The shares so allotted became the properly of the shareholders as from the date of the resolution, namely, December 30, 1954 subject to the qualification that they were entitled to get, dividends on those shares only from 1st January 1955. The expression "be capitalised and distributed" in the resolution only means "is hereby captalised and distributed". The authorities under the Act and the High Court have placed undue emphasis on those clauses of the resolution which lay down the procedure to be adopted in the matter of carrying into effect the decision of the general meeting. They do not in any manner cut down the ambit of that resolution. The High Court as well as the Tribunal were under the erroneous impression that a share cannot be said to have been issued to a person until a share certificate is given to him.
 Merely because in cl. (b) of the resolution the Directors of the Company were directed to issue bonus shares it cannot be said that the bonus sharers had not passed to the share- holders on December 30, 1954. The meaning of the words "allot" and "distribute" should be gathered from the context in which they were used. "Allotment" means the appropriation out of the previously unappropriated capital of a company of a certain number of shares to a person. The word '-distribute- found in cl. (b) of the resolution in the context means 'to record the distribution of the shares in the books of the company. [330 H-. 331 A-F; 332 G-H; 333 G] There was therefore no justification in reducing the rebate firstly under sub-cl. (a) of cl. (1) of the second proviso of paragraph D of Part II and secondly under sub-cl. (b) of cl. (1) of the first proviso to paragraph D of Part 11, of the Finance Act.
