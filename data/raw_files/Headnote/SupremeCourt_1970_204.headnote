 The appellant instituted a proceeding in ejectment under s.
 14A of the Punjab Security of Land Tenures Act, 1953 but before orders were passed on the application, the tenant initiated a proceeding under s. 18 exercising his right to purchase the land. The two proceedings ended in orders dismissing the ejection application and declaring the tenant entitled to purchase the land. On the question whether the tenant's application could be granted.
 
HELD : Under s. 18 of the Act if a tenant had remained in continuous occupation of the land for a minimum period of six years he is entitled to purchase the land on payment of the compensation determined. Under s. 14A, the landowner may obtain possession of the land on the ground of non- payment of rent by a proceeding filed before the Assistant Collector. If the tenant, after notice, fails to pay the rent or give proof of payment. the Assistant Collector shall after a summary inquiry, eject the tenant and put the landowner in possession. But so long as the Assistant Collector has not passed the ejectment order, the tenant's right is not extinguished; he continues to be a tenant and being a tenant is entitled to exercise his right of purchase. [501 C-G] In the present case, before the Assistant Collector passed an order in ejectment, the tenant exercised his right to purchase the land, and that right would not be defeated merely because, on a subsequent date, an order of ejectment was passed against him. He is entitled to purchase the land on payment of the amount of compensation together with the amount of rent due by him. [501 G-H; 502 E] Har Sarup v. Financial Commissioner, Revenue, Punjab, (1965) 44 Lah. L.T. 157, approved.
