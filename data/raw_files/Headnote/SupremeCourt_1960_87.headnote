 In 1954 certain amendments were made in the Court Fees Act, 1870, as applied to Bombay by the Court Fees (Bombay Amendment) Act, 1954, by which the system of charging court fees in the Bombay High Court on the original Side was altered and instead of a fixed fee payable on the plaint, etc., ad valorem fees became leviable. The amendments came into force on April 1, 1954, but there was no provision, express or by necessary intendment, for giving them retrospective effect. In respect of appeals filed after that date against decrees passed in suits instituted before that date, the question arose as to whether the court fees payable on the memoranda of appeal were according to the law in force at the date of the filing of the suits or according to the law in force at the date of the filing of appeals:
 Held, that the court fees payable on the memoranda of appeal were according to the law as it stood at the date of the filing of the suits.
 An impairment of the right of appeal by putting a new restriction thereon or imposing a more onerous condition is not a matter of procedure only ; it impairs or imperils a substantive right and an enactment which does so is not retrospective unless it says so expressly or by necessary intendment.
