 The assessee was a Hindu undivided family with its head office in a Part B State with several sources of income including managing agency commission and shares in companies and firms. Till the assessment year 1947-48 the previous year adopted by the assessee was the appropriate Diwali year. During the Diwali year 1948-49 it derived dividend income from a company registered in a Part B State. A part of the income, however, was attributable to the profits that accrued to the company in a Part A State. For the assessment year 1950-51 the assessee claimed that in respect of its income by way of commission from the managing and selling agency of the company, its' 'previous year' was the one ending on March 31, 1950 and that in respect of the dividend income received from the company the provisions of Part B States (Taxation Concessions) Order, 1950. were applicable to it.
