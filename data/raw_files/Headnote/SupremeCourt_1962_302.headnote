 In 1958 the police filed a report before the 'Chief Presidency Magistrate charging, the appellant and others of offenses under ss. 120-B/409 and 477 Indian Penal Code. On June 1,1959, the State Government in de an order under s. 4 (2) W. B. Criminal Law Amendment (Special Courts) Act, 1949, assigning the case to a Special Court. Section 5 (1) of the Act provided that a Special Court may take cognizance of offenses without the accused being committed to it for trial. On a petition made by the Investigating Officer, the Special Court took cognizance of the case and issued process to the accused. The appellant contended that the Special Court could take cognizance only according to the procedure prescribed by s. 190 (1) Code of Criminal Procedure and not merely upon the allotment of the case to it or upon the 'complaint' of the Police Officer.
 Held, that the Special Court could take cognizance of the case as soon as it received orders of allotment of the case and it became vested with jurisdiction to apply its mind and to issue process to the accused as soon it received, the records of the case. The provisions of 190 (1) of the Code were upon its own terms inapplicable to a Special Court.
 Though a Special Court was "deemed" to be a court of session, s. 5 (1') of the Act specifically provided that an order of commitment was not necessary for it to take cognizance and so s. 193 (1) of the Code was not applicable.
