 T filed a suit against M and obtained an order for attachment before judgment of certain bills due for payment to M.. The bills, were released from attachment upon M furnishing sureties including the appellant. Under the surety bond the appellant bound herself that M "'shall produce and place at the disposal of the court when required", the bills or the value of the same and "in' default of his so doing" to pay a sum of Rs. 12,000, to the Court. After the passing of the decree, T, without taking any steps against, M, applied for execution of the decree by enforcement of the surety bonds. The sureties filed objections. In the meantime, M applied to the Dehradun Tribunal under s. 5 of the Displaced persons (Debt Adjustment) Act, 1951, for adjustment of his debts and the appellant applied to the executing Court under s.
 15 of the Act for staying the proceedings. The Court refused to stay holding that the Dehradun Tribunal had no jurisdiction to entertain the application and rejected the objections to the enforcement of the surety bonds.
 Subsequently; the Tribunal also held that it had no territorial jurisdiction to entertain the application and returned the same for presentation to the proper` Tribunal.
 M preferred an appeal against this order. The appellant contended that the executing Court was bound to stay the execution proceedings and that the surety bond was not enforceable as the conditions necessary for its enforcement had not been fulfilled.
 Held, that the executing Court was right in refusing to stay the proceedings. Under s. 15 of the Act, all proceedings pending in a Civil Court have to be stayed provided two con- ditions are satisfied, i. e. (i) that the Tribunal before which the application under s. 5 is filed has territorial jurisdiction to 153 entertain it and (ii) that the proceedings arc in respect of a debt owed by the displaced person. The Tribunal had returned the application for want of territorial jurisdiction and the mere filing of the appeal did not suspend the order of the Tribunal. The effect was that there was no application under s. 5 pending.
 Juscurn Boid v. Kirthichand Lal, (1918) L. R. 46 I. A. 52, referred to.
 Held, further, that the surety bond was not enforceable, A surety bond had to be strictly construed; it was permissible to look at the surrounding circumstances only when the language used was ambiguous. In the present case the langu- age was clear. A strict construction of the bond led to the only conclusion that a demand by the Court to M to produce the bills or their value and a default made by him were necessary conditions for the enforcement of the bond against the surety. These conditions were not fulfilled.
