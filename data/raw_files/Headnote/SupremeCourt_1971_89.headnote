 Sevreal complaints were made to the District Magistrate by the respondent about the, appellant while he was functioning as a sarpanch. As no action was taken on those complaints the respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court praying for a maridamus directing inquiries to be made. The writ petition was allowed and an inquiry was directed to be held. The inquiry was held by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate and it was held that there were only irregularities committed by the appellant, that be did not abuse his position in any way, and that no action need be taken against him. In those proceedings the appellant filed an affidavit that he had not acted as Sarpanch during the relevant period but only looked after the work of the Sarpanch. The respondent presented an application under s.
 476, Cr. P. C., in the Court of the District Magistrate praying for the appellant's prosecution under ss. 193, 181 and 182 I.P.C., for having deliberately filed a false affidavit. The matter was inquired into by District Magistrate and after going through the entire material he held that the case of swearing of a false affidavit was not made out against the appellant. An appeal to the Sessions Court and a revision to the High Court by the respondent were dismissed.
 In the course of the writ proceedings in the High Court several affidavits were filed and the appellant asserted in those affidavits also that he had not acted as a Sarpanch during the relevant period. The respondent again moved the High Court by filing an application under s. 476, Cr. P.
 C., for the appellant's prosecution for making a false statement in his affidavit. A single Judge of the High Court ordered that a complaint be made against the appellant. The matter was taken on appeal to a Division Bench by the appellant and it was contended that in view of s. 479-A Cr. P. C., the appellant could not be prosecuted under s. 476 Cr. P. C., but the contention was repelled and it was held that a person filing an affidavit could not be considered to have appeared as a witness before the Court as contemplated by s. 479-A.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD:In s. 479 A(6) it is expressly provided that no proceedings shall be taken under ss. 476 to 479 for the prosecution of a person for giving or fabricating false evidence if in respect of such a person proceedings could be taken under s. 479-A. But under s. 479-A it is only a wit- ness who has appeared before the court that can be proceeded against.
 In the present case, the appellant filed a sworn affidavit but it was not possible to hold that by doing so he appeared as a witness. Since he did not appear as a witness before the High Court s. 479-A was inapplicable and did not operate as a bar to the proceedings under s. 476 Cr. P. C. [177A-E] 173 (2)But there is nothing to show that the explanation given by the appellant that he did not act as Sarpanch at the relevant time but only did his who as a panch, was false. [179B] A prosecution for perjury should be sanctioned by courts only in those cases Where' perjury appears to be deliberate and Conscious and a conviction is reasonable probabe, and when it is considered expedient in the interest of justice to punish the delinquent and not merely because there is some inaccuracy in the statement which may be innocent or immaterial. There must be a prima facie case of deliberate falsehood on a matter substance and the court should be satisfied that there is reasonable foundation for the charge. The giving of false evidence and the filling of false affidavits is no doubt an evil which must be effectively curbed but to start prosecution for prejudgment to readily and too frequently and without care and caution defeats its very purpose.[179E-G] In the present case, the material on record Was not sufficiently adequate to justify the conclusion that it is expedient in the interests of justice to file a complaint. The High Court did not give due weight to the following facts: (a) The appellant was a Panch and was 'authorised to act as Such and his explanation was not implausible.(b) In the order of the Disconsidered inexpedient to initiate prosecution on substantially the same charge(c) There was a long lapse of time of more than 10 year's since the filing of the affidavit and during this time, the appellant must have suffered both mentally and financially. (d) In view of the nature of the alleged prejury such a long delay also militates against the expediency of prosecution. [179G-H; 180A-C]
