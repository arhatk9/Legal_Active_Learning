 The petitioner was a wholesale dealer in Kerosene oil in Kerala State. The State Government detained him under r.
 30(1) (b) of the Defence of India Rules, 1962 on the alleged ground that he was likely to act in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community. By writ petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution he challenged his detention as being mala fide, making certain specific allegations against respondent No. 2, a police official. In particular, it was urged on his behalf that after the coming into operation of the Kerala Kerosene Control Order, 1965 which permitted kerosene trade to be carried only under a licence, there was no justification for ha detention. On :behalf of the State an affidavit was filed by the Home Secretary generally denying the petitioner's allegations. The affidavit stated, inter alia, that even after the passing of the Kerala Kerosene Control Order it was possible for the petitioner to obtain a licence and carry on the trade in a prejudicial manner.
 HEID : (i) The Proclamation of Emergency and the notification ,subsequently issued by the President constitute a bar against judicial scrutiny in respect of the alleged violation of the fundamental rights of a detenu.
 Nevertheless a detenu can urge in his support such statutory safeguards as are permissible under the Rules, and when this Court is satisfied that the impugned orders suffer from serious infirmities on grounds which it is permissible for the detenu to urge, the said orders would be set aside. [595 D, E] (ii) The detention of a citizen under the Defence of India Rules is the result of the subjective satisfaction of the appropriate authority; and so if a prima facie cam is made Out by the petitioner that his detention Is either mala fide, or is the result of a. casual approach adopted by the appropriate authority, the appropriate authority should place before the court sufficient material in the form of prcper affidavit made by a duly authorised to show that the allegations made by the petitioner about the character of the decision or its mala fides, are not well-founded. [598F] In the present case no such material had been placed before the court. Respondent No. 2, though impleaded, had not come forward to deny the specific allegations made against him.
 The Home Secretary had taken it upon himself to deny the allegations against respondent No. 2, but his denials were, at best based on hearsay evidence. The Home Secretary's affidavit suffered from the formal defect that it did not distinguish between datements based on personal knowledge and those made on the basis of information received. it moreover gave no sufficient justification for the 591 continuance of the petitioner's detention after' the passing of the Kerala Kerosene Control Order. [596 E, F] Under the circumstances there was no escape from the conclusion that the impugned order was clearly and plainly mala fide.
 (iii) It is the paramount requirement of the Constitution that even during Emergency, the freedom of Indian citizens cannot be taken away without the existence of the justifying necessity specified in the Rulesa themselves. The tendency to treat these matters in a somewhat and cavalier manner which may conceivably result from the continuous use of such unfettered powers, may ultimately pose a serious threat to the basic values on which the democratic way of life in this country is founded.
 Cases of this kind may be rare; but even the presence of such rare cases constitutes a warning deserving the attention of the authorities. [599 B, C]
