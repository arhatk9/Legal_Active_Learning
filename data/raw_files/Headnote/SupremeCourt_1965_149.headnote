 After the 2nd World War broke out the industrial employees at Ahmedabad, who had organised themselves as the Textile Labour Association (Respondent herein) raisd a demand for payment of dearness allowance to meet the cost of living which had shot up as a result of the War, and the demand became the subject-matter of arbitration and an ,award by the Industrial Court at Bombay. As a result of petitions filed by the Parties and references made to it, the Industrial Court had been giving directions, from time to time, regarding the payment of dearness allowance awarded, on the basis of cost of living index number, with 1926-27 as the base year. In the Second Five Year Plan, the Planning Commission recommended that the series of cost of living indices should be revised, and accordingly, the labour Bureau and the Central Statistical Organisation of the Government of India undertook family living surveys in 1958- 
59. One of the centers chosen was Ahmedabad and the Govern- ment of India began to publish consumer price index number for the city -of Ahmedabad from 1960 with 1960 as the base year. The Government of India also advised the State Government to remove various anomalies in the State series of the price index number and publish a new series linking the State series with that of Government of India, with 2.98 as the linking factor. The Government of Gujarat set up an expert Committee to advise it on the question and that Committee made recommendations for the removal of anomalies and also suggested 3.17 instead of 2.98 as the linking factor. In November 1963, the Government accepted the re- commendations for removing the a normalies and adjusted the consumer price index number, and the appellants paid the dearness allowance according to the adjusted consumer price index number under protest. In February 1964, the Government of Gujarat announced its decision to adopt the linking factor at 3.17. The appellants were not willing to pay dearness allowance according to the converted price index number in spite of a representation by the employees, and so, the dispute was referred to the Industrial Court under s. 73 of Bombay Industrial Relations Act, 1946. The industrial Court decided that the appellants should pay dearness allowance to their employees for the month of March 1964 and for subsequent months on the consumer price index numbers for Ahmedabad published by the State Government since February 1964 by using the index numbers in the series for Ahmedabad compiled by the Labour Bureau at Simla, and the linking factor of 3.17 adopted for linking that series to the State series with the old base. and gave directions as to the manner of paying the dearness allowance.
 In their appeal to this Court, the appellants contended that (i) the reference was invalid because, before making the reference to requirements of s. 42, which prescribes the procedure which has to be followed by the employer or the employee if either of them wants a change 383 to be effected in the terms of the existing award, had not been complied with; (ii) the Industrial Court erred in overruling their contention that the new survey sufferred from two major infirmities, (a) inadequacy of the sample size, and (b) impropriety of the method of interview adopted by the investigators; (iii) the linking factor of 3.17 was improper; and (iv) the Industrial Court was not right in coming to. the conclusion that the additional burden which its award would impose upon the appellants. would not be beyond their financial capacity.
 
 HELD: (i) The dispute must be treated as an industrial dispute, notwithstanding the fact that s. 42 had not been complied with, and Industrial Court was right in coming to the conclusion that the objection raised by the appellant against the competence of the reference was mis-conceived.
 [398 F; 399 E] The Act is a comprehensive piece of legislation and makes elaborate' provision for the regulation of relations between employers and employees and for the settlement of disputes between them. Section 73 deals with the powers of the State Government to make a reference and as such, it could not have been intended that those powers are to be controlled by s. 42. Section 42 provides that, if an employer or employee intends to effect any change in respect of certain industrial matters, he will have to give notice of such intention to the representative of the employees or tie employer respectively. The section can have no application to cases where the State Government itself wants to make a reference. The meaning of the non-obstante clause with which s. 73 opens also unambiguously indicates that the power of the State Government to make a reference is controlled by any other provision in the Act. The definition of "industrial dispute" in s. 3(17) is so wide and comprehensive, that, even If an, award is subsisting between the parties, if a difference arises between them, the said difference would amount to an industrial dispute for the purpose of s. 73 and a notice of change need not be given, either by the employer or by the employee. It is true that the power conferred on the State Government to make a reference is. not absolute or unqualified, but could be exercised only if one or the other of the conditions specified in sub-ss. (1), (2) or (3) of s. 73 is satisfied.
 But once the State Government is satisfied, its power to make a reference is not limited to cases where notice of change has been given by the parties under s. 42, On principle also, the conferment of power on the State, Government is fully justified, because, if as a result of a dispute between the employer and his employees, a serious outbreak of disorder, or a breach of public peace is likely to occur, or a serious or prolonged hardship to a large section of the community is likely to be caused, or the industry concerned is likely to be affected adversely, it would be idle to require that even in the face of such serious danger, the procedure prescribed by s. 42 must be followed before reference can be made under s. 73.

 397 E-H; 398 C-E, G; 399 C-B] (ii) (a): The appellants were not justified in contending that the inadequacy of the size of the sample in relation to the universe of the working class families vitiated the enquiry. [414 H] From the Report of Family Living Survey among Industrial workers at Ahmedabad, 1958-59, it appears that the survey and field work was the result of the cooperation of several expert institutions, official as well as non-official. and was based on accepted principles and method is. The size of the sample was determined in the light of the permissible margin of error and was selected by the application of scientific sampling techniques and according to the principle that it is the quality of survey that is more important, not so much the size of the sample. If the quality of investigation has improved, and the method of working out the sample' 384 survey has made very great progress, then, it would not be correct to say that because the size of the sample in the survey was smaller as compared to the size of the sample taken in 1926-27, the inadequacy of the size on the subsequent occasion introduces an infirmity in the investigation itself. [409 H; 410 G; 412 D, E, G; 413 D-E] (b) 'the Industrial Court was right in rejecting the appellants' contention that the impugned survey ,rut the index constructed as a result it, suffered from the infirmity that the investigation was conducted in the survey by 1he interview method, [416 D] Having regard to the fact that a majority of working class population in India is illiterate the method of interview is the only method which can be adopted. Besides according to expert opinion, the interview methods, if properly adopted gives better results than the alternative method of supplying account books and written questionnaire. [416 A-C] (iii) As the appellants had not placed before the Industrial Court any material to justify their contention that for determining the linking factor. the behaviour of prices for two or three years should have been studied, it could not be said that the Industrial Court committed an error in upholding the decision of the Government of Gujarat that the linking factor should be 317. [419 F-G; 420] The Industrial Court had to choose between two courses.
 One was to work out an entirely new scale of basic wages rounded not on the pre'war level of 1939 but on the cost of living of 1960 as the base year and .to award dearness allowance thereafter. The Industrial Court thought that to adopt that course might conceivably create a large number of new problems, disturbing industrial peace and would be outside its terms of reference. Therefore, it approved the other course of linking the State series with the new series to maintain continuity, which was the method adopted by the Government of Maharashtra also. [418 E, G; 419 (iv) The appellants had failed to substantiate the contention that the -additional burden would be beyond their capacity to pay. [429 E] The claim of the employees for a fair and higher wage is undoubtedly, based on the concept of social justice, and if employees are paid better wages which would enable them to live in comfort and discharge their obligations to the members of their families in a reasonable way, their work would show an appreciable increase in efficiency. On the ether hand. industrial adjudication must take into account the problem of the additional burden which such wage structure would impose upon the employer and consider whether the employer can reasonably be called upon to bear such burden. The task of constructing a wage structure must be tackled on the basis that such wage structure should not be changed from time to time. It is a long-range plan and in dealing with the problem, which is difficult and delicate the financial position of the employer and the future prospects of the industry and the additional burden which may be imposed on the consumer must be carefully examined. A broad and overall view of the financial position of the employer must be taken into account and attempt should always be made to reconcile the natural and just claims of the employees for a fair and higher wage with the capacity of the employer to pay it, and in determining such. capacity, allowance must be made for a legitimate desire of the employer to make a reasonable profit.. Unusual profit or loss should not be allowed to play a major role.
 It is true that normally, once a wage structure is fixed employees are reluctant to face a reduction in the content of the wage packet; but like all other problems associated with industrial adjudication, the decision of the problem must also be based on the major consideration that the conflicting 385 claims of labour and capital must be harmonised on a reasonable basis; and so, if it appears that the employer cannot really bear the burden of the increasing wage bill, industrial adjudication cannot refuse to examine his case and should not hesitate to give him relief if it is satisfied that if such relief is not Even, the employer may have to close down his business. The last principle, however does not apply to cases where the wages paid to the employees are no better than the basic minimum wage. If what the employer pays to his employees is just the basic subsistence wage and if he cannot afford to pay it, he would not be justified in carrying on his industry. Since the wages paid to the textile employees at ,Ahmedabad cannot be regarded as subsistence wages or bare minimum , it would not be open to the respondent to contend that the appellants must pay the wages whether the employers can afford to pay them or not. If it is shown that the appellants cannot bear the burden and that the implementation of the award would inevitably have extremely prejudicial effect upon the continued existence of the industry itself, there would be justification for revising the scale of dearness allowance.
 In considering the financial position of the appellants it would not be appropriate to rely unduly on the profitability ratio which has been adopted by the Bulletin issued by the Reserve Bank of India dealing with the cotton textile industry, or other single-purpose statements produced by the parties. Industrial adjudication should not lean too heavily on such statements whilst attempting the task of deciding the financial capacity of the employer in the context of the wage problem. Taking a broad view which emerged from a consideration of all the relevant facts, there is little doubt that the productivity of the industry is increasing and that the demand for textile products will never decrease in future. It is true that the textile industry at Ahmedabad has been leaning very heavily on borrowing% but that is a peculiar feature of the textile industry at Ahmedabad. It helps the development of the industry and so the extent of borrowings, cannot be pressed into service for the purpose of showing that the financial position of the industry is unsatisfactory. On the contrary, the harmonious relations which have consistently subsisted between the employer and the. employees, would help the textile industry in Ahmedabad in its prospects towards speedy economic growth.
