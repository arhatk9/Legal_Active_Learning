 The petitioner a resident of Daman a former Portuguese territory in India, became a citizen of India on the acquisition of that territory by the Government of India on the 20th December 1961, by conquest. He had obtained licences between 9th October and 4th December 1961,.for the import of various goods. They were valid for a period of 180 days and could be renewed for a further period. On 30th December, 1961 the Military Governor of the conquered territory, issued a Proclamation with respect to arrangements for trade, recognising only certain types of imports. The imports of the petitioner under his licences were not among those recognized, and so he tried to obtain extension of the period covered by the licences. Having failed to do so he filed a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution, contending inter alia that : (i) under the Goa, Daman and Diu (Administration) Ordinance, 1961 promul- gated on 5th March 1962 and the Goa, Daman and Diu (Administration) Act, 1962, which replaced ,he Ordinance, the previous laws in those territories were to continue as from 5th March 1962 and therefore it amounted to recognition by the Government of India of all rights flowing from the previous laws including the petitioner's right under the licences-, (ii) s. 4(2) of the Goa, Daman and Diu (Laws) Regulation, 1962, which came into force on November 22, 1962, preserved any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under the repealed law, and therefore the petitioners right under the licence,% which were issued under the former laws as to export and import which were repealed, were preserved; and (iii) the petitioner was discriminated against in violation of Art. 14 of the Constitution.
 
HELD : (i) The petitioner could not rely on the mere fact that the old laws were continued, because, there was never any recognition of the right of the petitioner, under the licences which he held, by the Government of India which was a new sovereign. The petitioner was therefore not entitled to ask the Court to compel the respondent to honour the licences. [365 H; 366 A-B] In cases of acquisition of territory by conquest, the residents of' the territory did not carry with them the rights which they possessed as, subject of the ex-sovereign, and that as subjects of the new sovereign they had only such rights as are granted or recognised by the new sovereign. In the face of the proclamation of the Military Governor it would be impossible to infer from the mere fact that the old laws were continued that there was recognition of other liabilities arising therefrom by the new sovereign. [360 D; 364 B-C] Besides, the old laws were not in force from 20th December 1961 to 5th March 1962. Section 7(1) of the Ordinance and s. 8(1) of the, 358 Act, show that as between ,he subjects and the new sovereign, the old laws did not continue in that interregnums and that was why it Was provided that things done and action taken by various authorities were validated.
 Therefore, the proclamation of 30th December which showed what kind of import licences would be recognised, was in accordance with law, which moans that the petitioner's imports were not recognised. [364 H; 365 A, B] State o' of Rajasthan v. Shyamlal, [1964] INSC 73; [1964] 7 S.C.R., 174, explained.
 (ii) As the petitioner's licences were of a date even anterior to the acquisition of the former Portuguese territories, s. 4(2) of the Regulation would not help him.
 That section would have helped him if his licences had been granted on or after 5th March 1962, because the Regulation repeals laws which were in force only from that date and the section saves rights acquired under them.[366 B-C] (iii) The petitioner failed to establish that there was any discrimination.
