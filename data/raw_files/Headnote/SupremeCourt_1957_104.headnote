 Section 29(a) of the U. P. Tenancy Act, 1939, provides that every person who was at the commencement of the Act a tenant of land shall be entitled to all the rights of hereditary tenants under the Act. Some classes of tenants are excepted from the operation of this provision, and one of them is tenants of Sir lands.
 The lands in question were originally held in Sir but in pursuance of a deed of usufructuary mortgage dated July 8, 1930, they were entered as Khudkasht in the names of the mortgagees. Subsequently the respondents took possession of the lands from the mortgagees under a Kabuliat dated May 26, 1936. After redemption of the mortgage the appellants, the representatives of the mortgagors, filed a suit for possession under s. 180 of the U.P. Tenancy Act, 1939, against the respondents on the footing that they were trespassers. The respondents contended, inter alia, that they were legally in possession of the lands because (1) the lease on the basis of which the Kabuliat of May 26, 1936, was executed, was binding on the appellants, and (2) in any case, as the respondents were in possession of the lands as tenants on the date of the commencement of the Act, they were entitled to all the rights of hereditary tenants under s. 29(a) of the Act. It was found that the action of the mortgagees in leasing the lands to the tenants on the terms set out in the Kabuliat was neither prudent nor bonafide:
 Held: (1) that under S. 76(a) of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, an agricultural lease created by a mortgagee would be binding on the mortgagor even though the mortgage has been redeemed, provided it is of such a character that a prudent owner of property would enter into it in the usual course of management;
 (2) that a person who claims rights as a hereditary tenant under S. 29(a) of the U.P. Tenancy Act, 1939, must show that on the date of the commencement of the Act he was lawfully a tenant.
 Accordingly, as the lease in question could not be upheld under S. 76(a) of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, there was no admission of tenant by any person having authority to do so, and 987 the transaction could not form the foundation on which any rights under s. 29(a) of the U. P. Tenancy Act, 1939, could be based.
