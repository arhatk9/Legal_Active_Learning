 The appellant, a scientist, was appointed to the staff of the respondent institute on probation. He had executed a bond to serve the Kerala University but this fact was never disclosed by him. He adopted an attitude questioning the Rules and Regulations of the Institute as well as every order made by the superior authorities, he even threatened legal proceedings at every stage. He had barely been in the service of the Institute for a short time when he wanted to take up service elsewhere. When the question of his confirmation came up before the Board of Governors it was recorded that the Board had come to know for the first time that while the appellant had executed a bond to serve the Kerala University he did not disclose that fact when he applied to the Institute. 'Ibis, in the opinion of the Board was "serious transgression of well known convention and etiquette". The Board, after considering all the aspects and perusing the confidential reports came to the conclusion that it would not be desirable in the interest of the Institute to retain the services of the appellant. It was therefore resolved that his services be terminated with a month's notice in terms of the order of appointment. The appellant filed a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution challenging the order of termination. He relied on cl. 9 of Statute 13 framed under s. 27 of the Institutes of Technology Act, 1961 which provided that no order imposing any penalty shall be passed without giving a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken ill regard to a member of the staff.
 The High Court held that although the Board of Governors took note of the fact that the appellant had committed a breach of a Covenant with the Kerala Government and that he had insisted on certain benefits which he was not entitled to it could not be said that his services had been terminated by way of punishment. Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD: A probationer or a temporary servant can be discharged if it is found that he is not suitable for the post which he is holding. Suitability does not depend merely on the excellence or proficiency in work. A particular attitude or tendency displayed by an employee can well influence the decision of the confirming authority while judging his suitability or fitness for confirmation.
 In the present case, if the Institute thought that a person of the appellant's type would not be suitable for being confirmed as a member of the staff of the Institute the order dispensing with his services could not be regarded as penal action taken with the object of inflicting punishment.
