 Election to the Board of Directors of the appellant Bank, a specified co-operative Society under the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960, were to be held as provided under Section 73 (G) of the Act read with Maharashtra Specified Co-operative Societies (Elections to Committees) Rules, 1971. By the Maharashtra Act No. XLV of 1983 the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act was amended and a proviso was added to sub-section (3) of Section 27.
 This amendment was challenged and the High Court declared the proviso to sub-section (3) of Section 27 as void and inoperative. Thereafter respondent. No. 1 and 2 filed a writ petition in the High Court which was allowed by directing that all steps taken on the basis of proviso to section 27(3) were null and void. The parties aggrieved against the aforesaid decision filed appeals before this Court. During the pendency of the appeals Section 73 of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act was amended and sub- section (2) was added to it. Further by Act No. X of 1988 Ist proviso to Section 27(3) was deleted. After the aforesaid changes in the 1960 Act, this Court, by its order dated March 13, 1989, disposed of the appeals directing that elections to the Co-operative Societies may be held in accordance with the amended law. Thereafter the Collector declared the election programme of the appellant bank under which last date for filing nominations was 23.10.1991 last date for scrutiny was 25.10.1991, last date for withdrawal was 11.11.1991 and the date of polling was fixed on 27.11.1991. By a notification dated 27th December, 297 1991 the State of Maharashtra postponed elections upto 15th April, 1992.
 Respondents No. 1 and 2 filed a writ petition in the Bombay High Court challenging the election programme. By its judgment dated November 19, 1991 the High Court allowed the petition holding that (i) in view of the mandatory provision of section 73(2) it was incumbent on the Registrar of Co-operative Societies to prescribe the maximum number of members on the Committee of the appellant bank by publishing an order in the official gazette; (ii) since no such order was published, the election process fixed by the Collector was illegal and invalid; and (iii) the election process was in violation of this Court's order dated March 15, 1989.
 Against the decision of the High Court the Co-operative Bank filed an appeal in this Court.
 On behalf of the appellant bank it was contended that (i) with the deletion of proviso to section 27(3), section 73(2) has become redundant; (ii) that the word `may' in section 73(2) clearly meant that it was an enabling provision and the said sub-section does not cast any duty on the Registrar to exercise the power of prescribing maximum number in every case but only confers upon him the discretion to make such an order if the circumstances enumerated in the said provision necessitated the exercise of such power; and (iii) since bye-law No.28 of the Bank already prescribed the maximum number of members in the Committee to 21 members and as such there was no question of passing any order under section 73(2).
 For the respondents it was contended that unless the Registrar applied his mind in the light of Section 73(2) no elections could have been declared by the Collector. It was necessary for the Registrar to apply his mind as to whether the maximum number prescribed in the bye-laws of a society was justified or not and thereafter issue an order and to publish the same in the official gazette.
 Allowing the appeal, this Court, 
 HELD: 1. The main purpose of introducing proviso to sub-section (3) of Section 27 was to widen and make the scope of voters as broad based while electing members to the Committees of a federal society. It was laid down that all the members elected as well as co-opted shall have the right to vote on behalf of such society while electing the members to the Committee of a federal society. The provision was declared invalid by the High 298 Court and thereafter it was also deleted by a Legislative fiat by Maharashtra Act No. (X) of 1988. The position as now stands is that in case of an election to the members of the Committee of a federal society, any member of such society shall not have more than one vote. [305 C-E] The purpose of inserting sub-section (2) of Section 73 of the Act was that there was a necessity to control the large number, if any, of the elected and co-opted members getting a right of vote allowed under the proviso to sub- section (3) of section 27 of the Act. However, when the proviso to sub-section (3) of Section 27 was struck down by the High Court and also deleted by the legislature itself, the purpose of introducing sub-section(2) in Section 73, lost its thrust and relevance and even if it continued in the Statute, it would be considered as directory and not mandatory. [305 E-F] 
 1.1 It is no doubt that sub-section (2) of Section 73 of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act starts with a non obstante clause overriding anything contained in any bye laws of a society, but at the same time the discretion has been left to the Registrar to prescribe the maximum number of members of Committee of the society or class of societies. This provision does not compel the Registrar nor makes it obligatory to prescribe maximum number even when the Registrar may be satisfied with the maximum number already prescribed in the bye-laws of such society.
 [305 F-G] 
 2. The order dated 27th December 1991 issued by the Government postponing the elections upto 15th April, 1992 would not apply to such co-operative societies in whose case the election process from the stage of 1991. In view of this, the notification dated 27th December, 1991 cannot apply in the case of the appellant Beed District Central Co- operative Bank as the election process of filing nominations was fixed for 23.10.1991 and even the date of polling was 27.11.1991 i.e. much before 26th December, 1991. [306 B-C] 
 3. The Collector District Beed shall complete the left out stage for election to the Board of Directors of the appellant Bank. [306-D]
