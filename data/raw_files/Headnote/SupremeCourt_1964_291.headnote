 In the years 1947 and 1948 there was rice scarcity in certain districts in Madras and Government took action under the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946, and passed various Orders for procurement and distribution. The appellants were appointed procuring agents under that system. Their duty was to procure rice from specified areas at prices specified by the Government and to deliver it to the Government, or to persons nominated or to other licensed purchasers. The procurement price was lower than the selling price and the appellants were entitled to the difference between the two prices, under a contract entered into between the appellants and the Government. In July and December 1947 and in November 1948, the Government passed orders increasing the prices of sale. On the dates on which those orders came into force, the appellants had with them stocks of rice procured by them earlier and which they could sell at the higher sale price. Government thought that the appellants were not entitled to the increased profit derived on the sale of such stocks at the increased sale price, because the enhancement in the appellants' profit was entirely due to Government action; and Government insisted that the excess sums which they described as "surcharges" should be paid over to the Government by the appellants.
 The Government employed three methods for realising the excess amounts. They were (i) threat of cancellation of the licences, (ii) deduction of the amounts from moneys payable by the Government to the appellants and (iii) in the case of the increase in November 1948, by requisition of the stock of rice lying with the appellants on the day immediately preceding the coming into force of the increased price, at the rate then obtaining, and releasing the stocks to the appellants upon their paying the surcharge or executing an agreement to pay it.
 Having paid the amounts under protest, the appellants filed suits for their recovery. Some of the suits were decreed and others dismissed. On appeal to the High Court by the aggrieved parties, the High Court decided all the appeals in favour of the State. In appeal to the Supreme Court, the appellants contended that the amounts collected by the respondent State, were in the nature of an unlawful tax imposed by the executive. The respondent sought to support the judgment of the High Court, contending that, (i) the appellants were agents of the Government and liable to account for the profits; (ii) the appellants, if not agents, stood in a fiduciary capacity to the Government with the obligation to account; (iii) The Government was authorised to issue the direction to pay the surcharges,to it; (iv) in those cases where the amounts were realised by re- 578 quisitioning and release, the appellants could not recover because, (a) the Government had the power to requisition the stock and direct the sale. and (b) by reason of the agreements to pay, the payments were voluntary; and (v) some of the suits and claims were barred by limitation.
 
HELD (Per Ayyangar and Bachawat, JJ) : (i) The appellants were not the agents of the Government and were therefore, not liable to account to the Government for the profits which they derived over and above those fixed for them by the relevant notifications of the Government. [604-EF] The purchases were made by the appellants out of their own funds; stored at their own cost, any deterioration, driage or shortfall fell on them, and they were the full owners of the paddy procured. The basis of the agreement to sell the rice which was with them, at the controlled price, was that they were the full owners of paddy. Sales-tax was payable by them on the sales, which would not have been the case if they were merely holding the foodgrains as commission agents on behalf of the Government. Further, the licence granted to them referred to the foodgrains in their possession as their stocks. All that the Government desired and impple- mented by its several orders was mere regulation and control of the trade in foodgrains by rendering every activity connected with it in the ordinary trade channels, subject to licensing and to directions to be issued. [601 B-F; 602 D] (ii) In the circumstances there is no basis for the suggestion of a fiduciary obligation de hors a principal and agent relationship. [605 F] (iii) The direction to pay the amounts was not a direction contemplated by the Procurement Scheme, nor was it a direction as regards the &Me, and so, the direction to pay "surcharges" was illegal. [606 H; 607B] (iv) If the theory that the appellants were the agents of the Government be discarded as untenable, there would be no legal basis at all for the "surcharge". It would be then in effect a tax imposed by an executive flat without any legislative sanction. They were imposed compulsorily by the executive and sought to be collected inter alia by coercive statutory powers. It could hardly be contended that the payments were voluntary in the sense understood, and the fact that agreements were taken would be no defence to the claim for refund.

Wills United Dairies, 127 L.T. 822 and Lower Mainland Dairy Products Sales Adjustment Committee v. Crystal Dairy, Limited, [1933] A.C. 168, referred to.
 (v) The period of limitation for a suit for making a claim for recovery of a tax illegally collected is governed by Art. 62 of the Limitation Act, 1908, and as the period of limitation is three years from the date of the receipt of the money by the respondent, the claims would not be barred in those cases where the suits in respect of them were filed within the time specified. [619 B; 621 B, D] It is not necessary in order to attract Art. 62, that at the moment of the receipt, the defendant should have actually intended to receive it for the use of the plaintiff and it is sufficient if the receipt was in such circumstances that the law would impute to him an obligation to retain it for the use of the plaintiff and refund to him when demanded.

 Per Sarkar, J : (i) No relationship of principal and or of a fiduciary character had ever come into existence betweenthe appellants and the Government. Even if the appellants were the Government's agents the appellants would under the contract be entitled to keep the larger difference caused by the selling price having been increased after the procurement. [582 E-F, H] (ii)The question of limitation with respect to the claims where the moneys were collected by Government by methods other than by requisition and release, has to be decided under Art. 62 of the Limitation Act only. [583 A] Mahamed Wahib v. Mahomed Ameer. (1905) I.L.R. 32 Cal. 527, approved.
 (iii)(Dissenting) : Where, as a result of the requisition and release, Government had obtained moneys from the appellants, the realisation was legal and did not amount to unauthorised levy of tax, and the appellants were not entitled to recover the amounts from the Government. In respect of such requisitions and release, where the appellants had not paid the moneys but entered into engagements to pay, those engagements would be legal and enforceable. [584 G-H] Government could requisition the stock of rice in possession of a procuring agent at the price previously prevailing and have done so, it could sell the rice so requisitioned back to the same procuring agent at the price subsequently fixed.
 The Government's acts would be perfectly within its statutory powers and legal, as the appellants were free not to pay and to obtain or not to obtain the release. [584 B-D] Attorney General v.
