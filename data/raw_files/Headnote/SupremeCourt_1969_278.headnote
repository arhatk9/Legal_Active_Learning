 The appellant, a displaced person from West Pakistan, submitted his claim under the Displaced Persons (Claims) Act of 1950 in respect of the property left by him there The Claims Officer verified the claim for Rs. 8 lacs. The Claims Commissioner, in revision, raised the value of the verified claim to Rs. 10 lacs. The Settlement Commissioner, exercising the revisional powers of the Chief Settlement Commissioner under the Displaced Persons (Claims) Supplementary Act, 1954, reduced the claim of Rs. 10 lacs to Rs. 15,000. In a writ petition filed by the appellant a single Judge of the High Court quashed the order of the Settlement Commissioner holding that there were clear errors of law on the fact of the record. It was left open to the department to reconsider the matter as to evaluation and come to a proper conclusion on evidence. A Letters Patent Bench reversed the order of the single Judge and dismissed the: writ petition. In appeal to this Court it was contended that : (i) the order of the Settlement Commissioner was vitiated by errors of law on the face of the record; (ii) the Settlement Commissioner exercising the power of the Chief Settlement Commissioner under the Supplementary Act had no jurisdiction to revise the order made by the Claims Commissioner exercising revisional power under the Act of 1950; (iii) the power of revision conferred on the Chief Settlement Commissioner by section 5(1)(b) of the Supplementary Act was restricted to the verification of the claim and its valuation was outside its purview and (iv) the power was circumscribed within the four-corners of rule 18 of the Displaced Persons (Verification of Claims) Supplementary Rules, 1954. Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) The learned single Judge was right in his conclusions. The order and the material on record show that the Settlement Commissioner had, at more places than one, based his conclusions on pure conjectures and surmises without there being any legal evidence on the record to support them.
 (ii) The language used in Section 5(1)(b) of the Supplementary Act is unambiguous and it clearly empowers the Chief Settlement Commissioner, subject to any rules that may be made, to revise any verified claim and make such orders in relation thereto as he thinks fit. On a plain reading of the section in the light of the definition of the expression "verified claim" and the statutory scheme, the Chief Settlement Commissioner's special power of revision would extend' to suo motu revision of the verified claims which had become final under the Act of 1950 Is a result of orders made by the Claims Commissioner on revision. The use of the words "revised any verified claim"' seem prima facie to extend the power of revision also to verified claims bearing the stamp of scrutiny by 'the Chief Settlement Commissioner.
 There being no doubt as to the mean- 733 ing of s. 5(1)(b) the preamble cannot be used to control or qualify its unambiguous language. [737 A-F] (iii) The definition of verified claim in s. 2(f) of the Supplementary Act speaks of the final order and it includes valuation. The Claims Officer under the Act has also to value the claim and the final order embraces, both verification of title and valuation. [738 G-H] (iv) The categories contained in clauses (i) to (iii) of rule 18 do not form a genus or a class with the result that the expression "other sufficient reason" occurring in cl.
 (iv) of this rule would not attract the ejusdem generis rule for its construction. But assuming that the first three clauses constitute a class or kind of objects or genus, the grounds given by the Settlement Commissioner are analogous to cl. (iii) which speaks of gross and material irregularity and disparity in the evaluation of the claim. [741 H] [The case was remitted to the Chief Settlement Commissioner for a fresh decision in accordance with law.]
