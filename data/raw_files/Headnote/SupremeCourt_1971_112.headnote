 The appellant was a sub-Inspector of Central Excise. A departmental inquiry was held against him in respect of a charge of misappropriation of Government money. The Inquiry Officer exonerated him. The Collector Central Excise, ordered another Inquiry Officer to make a report after taking further evidence. The second Inquiry Officer at first exonerated the appellant but later, after taking some more evidence as directed by the Collector, reported that although the charge against the appellant was not proved his conduct may not be above board. Dissatisfied with the report the Collector ordered a fresh inquiry to be held by a third officer. This time a verdict of guilty was given and the appellant was dismissed. The appellant's writ petition in the Court of the Judicial Commissioner Tripura having failed he appealed to this Court by special leave. The question for consideration was whether the multiple inquiries held against the appellant were in accordance with r. 15 of the Classification and Control Rules. Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : Rule, 15 on the face of it really provides for one inquiry but it may be possible if in a particular case there has been no proper inquiry because some serious defect has crept into the inquiry or some important witnesses were not available at the time of the inquiry or were not examined for some other reason, the Disciplinary Authority may ask the Inquiry Officer to record further evidence. But there is no provision in r. 15 for completely setting aside previous inquiries on the ground that the report of the Inquiring Officer or Officers does not appeal to the Disciplinary Authority. The Disciplinary Authority has enough powers to reconsider the evidence itself and come to its own conclusion under r. 9. [379 H] The rules do not contemplate an action such as taken by the Collector in appointing a third Inquiry Officer. It seems that the Collector instead of taking responsibility himself was determined to get some officer to report against the appellant. The procedure adopted was not only against the rules but also harassing to the appellant. [380 B] In the result it must be held that no proper inquiry has been conducted in the case and, therefore, there has been a breach of Art. 311(2) of the Constitution. [380 E]
