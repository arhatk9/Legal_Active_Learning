 The appellant firm was the tenant and the respondent landlord of a flat in Bombay. The parties were governed by the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates (Control-) Act, 1947. Rule 8 under the Act made the procedure in 0. 37 of the Civil Procedure Code applicable to suits for Possession by the landlord against the tenant. The respondent filed a suit for the ejectment of the appellant from the suit premises under the procedure prescribed in r.
 2 of 0. 37, as amended by the Bombay High Court. Under that procedure the trial court gave leave to the appellant to defend the suit on condition that he paid the arrears of rent in fixed insalments. On the failure of the appellant to pay these the trial court passed a decree against him without giving him leave to defend. His application under r. 4 of 0. 37 for setting aside the decree was rejected, for the special circumstances required by that rule were he held not to exist. In appeal, a bench of the Court of Small Causes set aside the decree holding that the trial court should have considered the use of its inherent powers under s. 151 of the Code. On appeal by the respondent-landlord the High Court held that s. 151 was not applicable to the case. The appellant came to the Supreme Court by special leave.
 Apart from the applicability of s. 151 of the Code, the contention of the appellant was that r. 8 which made 0. 37 applicable to suits under the Rents Act was ultra vires the reason being that under the provisions of the Rent Act the court had to consider the position of the tenant and had a discretion to pass or not to pass a decree, whereas under r.
 2 of 0.37 once the tenant defaulted the Court had no course open except to pass a decree against him.
 
HELD : (i) Inherent powers are to be exercised by the Court in very exceptional circumstances for which the Code lays down no special procedure. Rule 4 of 0. 37 expressly gives power to a court to set aside a decree under the provisions of that Order. Hence if a case does not come within the provisions of that rule there is no scope for resort to s.
 151 for setting aside such a decree. [189 B-C] (ii)The appeal was against the order passed on an application made by the appellant under r. 4 of 0. 37. If the contention of the appellant that 0. 37 was not applicable were to be accepted then the result would not be to set aside the decree; it would only cause the dismissal of his application as being incompetent. No relief based on this contention could therefore be granted in the appeal.
 [190 F-G] (iii)It is not correct to say that when leave to defend has been refused to a defendant, the court is bound to pass a decree. What subrule 2 of r. 2 of 0. 37 contemplates is that the court will accept the 187 statements in the plaint as correct and on those statements pass such decree as the plaintiff may in law be entitled to.
 If the plaint discloses no cause of action, the court cannot pass any decree in favour of the plaintiff. If the law requires the court to exercise a discretion on the facts deemed to be admitted, it will have to do so. [191 B-D] (iv) in the procedure laid down under 0. 37 the defendant may not be allowed to place his side of the case for assisting the court in the exercise of its discretion, but that does not create any conflict with the Rents Act. Rules of procedure may be framed for the exercise of rights and such rules are not ultra vires only because the right has to be exercised in accordance with them. Therefore r. 8 is not ultra vires.
