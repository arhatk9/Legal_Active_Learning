 The assessee, a dealer in cotton, claimed deduction of Sales-tax on the ground that cotton worth that value were in stock on the last day of the assessing year. The Commercial Tax Officer disallowed the claim holding that as subsequent disposal had not been proved, it was liable to be taxed as a last purchase. The Assistant Commissioner upheld the order, but the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal accepted the assessee's claim. The Department's revision to the High Court was dismissed. In to this Court, 
HELD : The assessee was not liable till the purchase of declared goods acquired the character of a last purchase within the Second Schedule of the Act. It is true that Ss.
 3 and 4 of the Madras General Sales Tax Act, speak of "a year", i.e., the financial year, and it is only the turnover during that year that is liable to taxation in the hands of the assessee, but s. 4 has to be read with the Second Schedule, and reading s. 4 with the Second Schedule, it is clear that a dealer is not liable to pay a tax on the purchases until the Purchases acquire ,the quality of being last purchases inside the State. In, other words, when he files a return and declares the stock in hand, the stock in hand cannot be said to have been acquired by last purchase because he may still during the next assessment year, sell it or he may consume it himself or the goods may be destroyed, etc. He would be entitled to claim before the assessing authorities that the character of acquisition of the stock in hand was undetermined; in the light of subsequent events it may or may not become the last purchase inside the State. This construction is in consonance with s. 15 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956. [625E-G] Abdulsalan Rowther v. State of Kerala, 12 S.T.C. 98, and Hornusji Hirjiblioy v. Commercial Tax Of 113 S.T.C. 773, referred to.
