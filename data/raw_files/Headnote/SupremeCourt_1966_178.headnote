 The appellant was convicted by the trial court, inter alia, of an offence under s. 436 read with S. 109 of the Indian Penal Code for having instigated one of his co-accused to burn a hut. The High Court acquitted the said co-accused of the offence under s. 436 but maintained the conViction of the appellant for that offence read with s. 109. In appeal by special leave before this Court it was urged that after the acquittal of the main offender the appellant's conviction for abetting the offence under s. 436 was illegal.
 
HELD:(i) It cannot be held in law that a person cannot be convicted of abetting a certain offence when the person alleged to have committed that offence-in consequence of the abetment has been acquitted.The question of the abettor's guilt depends on the nature of the act abetted and the manner in which the abetment was made. Under s. 107 I.P.C. a person abets the doing of an act in either of three ways which can be instigating any person to do an act; or engaging with one or more person in any conspiracy for the doing of that act; or intentionally aiding the doing of that act. If a person instigates another or engages with another in a conspiracy for the doing of an act which is an offence., he abets such an offence and would be guilty of abetment under s. 115 or s. 116 I.P.C., even if the offence abetted is not committed in consequence of the abetment. It is only in the case of a person abetting an offence by intentionally aiding another to commit that offence that the charge of abetment against him would be expected to fail when the person alleged to have committed the offence is acquitted of that offence. [472 A-C; 473 A] Barendra Kumar Ghosh v. The King Emperor L.R. 52 I.A. 40 and Faguna Kanta Nath v. The State of Assam, [1959] Supp. 2 S.C.R. 1, relied on.
 Gallu Sah v. The State of Bihar,. [1958] INSC 59; [1959] S.C.R. 861, held inapplicable.
 (ii) In the present case the person charged with the main offence under s. 436 had been acquitted and there was no finding of the courts below that the fire was set by any person who was participating in the incident along with the appellant and at his instigation. The appellant could not therefore be held guilty under s.436 read with s.109.[474 B] It had been held by the High Court that the appellant had instigated his co-accused to commit the offence, under s.
 436 I.P.C. He must therefore be held guilty under s. 436 read with s. 115 I.P.C. [474 E] Conviction and sentence altered accordingly.
