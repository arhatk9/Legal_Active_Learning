 One Mani Ram, a wrestler, owned certain properties including a groveland. In the groveland he maintained an Akhara or wrestling ground. He spent the income from the groveland as well as his other income for the promotion of wrestling. On the archgate of the Akhara was installed an idol of mahabirji and over a small room nearby a Shiv Lingam was installed. In order to attract Muslim wrestlers a tasweer of Hazrat Ali was also placed in the Akhara. In 1830 Mani Ram partitioned his properties. He took a one eighth share including the said groveland for himself and wife. In the partition deed the said groveland was described as a wakf.
 After Mani Ram's death his wife entered into possession of his property and continued to maintain the A khara out of the income of the groveland. In 1862 she made a will wherein she described the groveland having the Asthan of Mahabirji and Mahadeoji as having been dedicated by her husband. She enjoined her son Mangli Prasad to continue to maintain the Akhara 'as heretofore,' and empowered him to appoint his successors in management from among the descendants of Mani Ram. Mangli Prasad was succeeded in management by his widow. After the later's death there was litigation between her legate and Mangli Prasad's daughter Sheodei Kaur. The Court declared the said groveland and Akhara to be endowed property and held that Sheodei Kaur was entitled to the possession thereof as manager. The property came into the possession of Ishwar Narain, the son of Sheodei Kaur, in 1906. He built a cinema house on a part of the said groveland in 1914-15. In 1937 the Improvement Trust of Kanpur acquired the groveland, the structures on it, as well as the surrounding property. In reference proceedings regarding compensation a compromise was arrived at whereby the Improvement Trust agreed to sell to ishwar Narain the portion of the acquired property corresponding to the endowed property along with the structures thereon for Rs. 25,000 which amount was adjusted against the total compensation payable to him for the acquired property. On Ishwar Narain's death in 1948 the property which was described in his will as his personal property passed to his sister's sons who were enjoined to maintain the Akhara and the Asthan. The respondents through their next friend instituted a suit in which they challenged the bequest on the ground that the Akhara and the groveland constituted trust property. The trial court held that the possession of the property in question by Mani Ram and his successors was that of managers or trustees, it further held that the dedication was in favour of the Manager or trustee for the maintenance of the Akhara. The High Court held that the dedication was in favour of the idols of Mahabir and Mahadeoji. In appeal to this Court by certificate the main question for consideration was whether there was 810 a valid trust under Hindu law in favour of the respondents.
 The appellant also urged that what was dedicated was not the groveland but the grove, and that after the purchase by Ishwarlal of the groveland and the structures thereon from the Improvement Trust that property could no longer be treated as a trust.
 
HELD : (i) (a) The documents on record as also the evidence as to the conduct of Mani Ram and those who held the property after him clearly showed that Mani Ram dedicated the groveland and not merely the trees standing thereon.
 [816 C] (b) The purchase of part of the said property after its acquisition was from out of the compensation received by Ishwar Narain and not out of his personal funds so that if the trust was in law a valid one, the property purchased by him out of the trust funds would he stamped with the trust and he would in that event be holding that property as a trustee or manager and no as an owner. [816 D] (ii) However the trust could not in the present case be held to a valid one under Hindu law. [822 B-C] A dedication of property for a religious, or a charitable purpose can, according to Hindu law, be validly made orally and no Writing is necessary to create an endowment extent when it is created by a will. An appropriation of property for specific religious or charitable purposes is all that is necessary for a valid dedication. Hindu piety found expression in gifts to idols to religious institutions and for all purposes considered meritorious in the Hindu social and religious system. There is no line of demarcation in the Hindu system between religion and chairity : gifts both (or religious and charitable purposes are impaled by the desire to acquire religious merit. They may take the form of Istha (sacrifices and sacrificial gifts) or Purta (charities such as maintenance of temples, tanks, wells etc.). But the terms Istha and Purta themselves are elastic and admit of no rigid definition. As times advanced more and more categories of acts considered to be beneficial to the public would be recognize depending on the needs and beliefs of the time. [819 C-G, 820 B-C] But there is nothing- to show that the promotion of a particular game either for entertainment of the public or as encouragement to those who take part in it has ever been reconised as a charitable trust according It) Hindu law.
 Neither Pandit Prannath Saraswati, nor mukherjea, nor Maynt suggests in his treatise that a dedication for the promotion of particular game or sport is a charitable trust under Hindu law. [820 F-G] The English law of trusts as found in the Statute of Elizabeth or the law relating to Superstitious Uses is not applicable to India. But even in English cases dedication for promotion of games, except as a part of education, his not been treated as a charitable trust. [820 H; 821 E] As held by this Court in Saraswathi Ammal's case, in determining the validity of a trust under Hindu law it is the dominant purpose of the turst which is relevant. In the present case the purpose of installing the two idols and the tasweer clearly was to enable the wrestlers to pay their homage and salutations to the patron deities of the game before entering into the wrestling arena. On the facts it must be held that the dominant object of the dedication was the Akhara and the said idols and the tasweer were installed only to attract persons of both the communities to the Akhara and to provide for them there the facility for invoking the divine benediction before they participated in wrestling [818 E-G] 811 That being the position it was impossible, in the absence of any authority textual or by way of a president, to hold that the dedication in question was for either a religious or charitable purpose recognised by, Hindu law. [822 B-C] The appeal must accordingly be allowed.
