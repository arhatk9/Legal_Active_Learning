 Dismissing the special leave petition, the Court ^ 
 HELD: (1) Special family pension sanctioned to the widow of an officer of the Indian Air Force by the President of India under rule 74 of the Rules could not be subject- matter of testamentary disposition. Special family pension is payable to the widow on the death of the officer. It is not payable in his life time. What is not payable during life time of the deceased over which he has no power of disposition cannot form part of his estate. It is the event of his death that provides the eligibility, qualification for claiming special family pension. Such qualifying event which can only occur on the death of the deceased and which event confers some monetary benefit on someone other than the deceased albeit related to the deceased, cannot form part of the estate of the deceased which he can dispose of by testamentary disposition. [934B, 933H-934A] (2) Where a certain benefit is admissible on account of status and a status that is acquired on the happening of certain event, namely, on becoming a widow on the death of the husband, such pension by no stretch of imagination could ever form part of the estate of the deceased. If it did not form part of the estate of the deceased it can never be the subject-matter of the testamentary disposition. [933B-C] Special family pension under rule 74 is admissible amongst others to widow of an officer. It is not that the deceased gets pension or earns special family pension. It is the untimely death of the deceased, the process of death having been hastened or accelerated by the hazards of service that the widow who is rendered destitute is granted special family pension. Whether the widow qualifies for special family pension is to be determined by the sanctioning authority, the President in this case. The special family pension is admissible on account of the status of a widow and not on account of the fact that there was some estate of the deceased which devolved on his death to the widow. [932H; 933A-B] (3) Whether a widow has qualified for a special family pension, gratuity or ordinary family pension is a matter to be determined by the President. If the President is satisfied that the widow is eligible for pension, she cannot be denied the benefit by some dependents of the deceased claiming that 930 instead of the widow he or she should have been held eligible for special family pension. Therefore, it is irrelevant whether the deceased had shown his wife as his dependent or not if the President is satisfied that she as the widow of the deceased officer was eligible for special family pension.
