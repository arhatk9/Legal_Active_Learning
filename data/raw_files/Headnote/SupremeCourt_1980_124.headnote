 In furtherance of the Directive Principles enshrined in Article 39(b), agrarian reform was undertaken in the State of West Bengal in two stages. The first was the stage of abolition of the zamindari system. The West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act, 1953 (Act I of 1954) which received the assent of the President on February 12, 1954 has been placed in the Ninth Schedule as item No. 59, was an Act to provide for the acquisition of estates of rights of intermediaries therein and of certain rights of raiyats and under-raiyats.
 By virtue of notification under s. 4 issued on April 14, 1955 declaring April 15, 1955 to be the date of vesting the estates and the rights of intermediaries therein, vested in the State free from all encumbrances from that date. After the extinction of the feudal system of zamindari, the big landlords became intermediaries, but by virtue of s.
 6(1)(a), (c), (d), (e) and (f), they were entitled to retain land comprised in homesteads, non-agricultural land in their khas possession not exceeding 15 acres, agricultural lands in their khas possession not exceeding 25 acres, tank fisheries and land comprised in tea gardens or orchards or land used for the purpose of livestock breeding, poultry farming or dairy. Under s. 6(2) they became tenants of the State. The stage was thus set for the imposition of the ceiling on agricultural holdings.
 The West Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1955 (Act X of 1956) came into force on March 31, 1956. The object and purpose of the Act as reflected in the preamble was to reform the law relating to land tenure consequent on the vesting of all estates and of certain rights therein in the State. This was followed by notification issued by the State Government under s. 49 of the West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act, 1953 on April 9, 1956. As a result of the notification under s.
 49 the petitioners, who were raiyats, were deemed to be intermediaries and the lands owned and possessed by them as estates and all the lands and the petitioner's rights in such lands vested in the State with effect from April 10, 1956. But the petitioner as intermediaries were permitted to retain the lands as provided for in s. 6(1).
 This state of affairs continued till February 12, 1971 when the West Bengal Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1971 (President's Act III of 1971) came into force. This was replaced in due course, by the West Bengal Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1972 (Act XII of 1972) with retrospective effect from February 12, 1971. These Acts brought about a drastic change by introducing Chapter IIB for the imposition of a ceiling an agricultural holdings. As a necessary consequence the Acts deleted s. 4(3) as well as s. 6. As a 1210 result of the deletion of s. 4(3), the right of retention of raiyats of agricultural lands to the extent of 25 acres was taken away and the deletion of s. 6(2) relieved the State of the obligation to pay market value for acquisition of the surplus land.
 West Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1955 (Act X of 1956) and the West Bengal Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1972 (Act XII of 1972), which introduced Chapter IIB therein with retrospective effect from February 12, 1971, have both been placed in the Ninth Schedule by the Constitution (Thirtyfourth Amendment) Act, 1974 being items 60 and 81 thereof. They have thus the immunity of Article 31B besides being fully protected under Articles 31A and 31C.
 The petitioners being aggrieved by these agrarian reform challenged in these writ petitions the validity of definition of the term 'family' contained in s. 14K(c), the fixation of ceiling limits of a raiyat under s. 14M(1), the provision for lands held by the members of a family being clubbed under s. 14M(2) the avoidance of transfers by s.
 14P, the fixation of a ceiling limit on orchards under s.
 14O(2), the vesting of surplus land in the State under s.
 14S(1), the penal consequences for failure to file a return provided for in s. 14T(4), the imposition of a restriction on transfers under s. 14U and the absence of a provision for payment of compensation for acquisition of homestead under s. 14V.
 Dismissing the petitions, the Court ^ 
 HELD: (1) Both Articles 31A and 31B were introduced by the Constitution (First Amendment Act) 1957 with retrospective effect with a view to validate zamindari abolition Acts and conferred immunity from challenge in Courts. Article 31A was designed to facilitate agrarian reform as well as social control of the means of production.
 Article 31A reflects the intention of the Government to immunise state legislations relating to imposition of ceiling on agricultural holdings from the usual compensation required or other requirements of the fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III which are most likely to be invoked-Articles 14, 19 and 31. [1242 B-1223 C-D, F-H] The West Bengal Land Reforms Act is a piece of social legislation for agrarian reform. The object of the legislation is to break up the concentration of ownership and control of the material resources of the community and to so distribute the same as best to sub-serve the common good, as enjoined by Article 39(b) of the Constitution.
 Having regard to the quantity of land available in the State of West Bengal, which has the next highest per capita density in the whole of the country, the ceiling limits, is reasonable and fair. For equitable distribution of the natural resources it was essential to design the Act as it is so that the surplus land is available for distribution to the landless peasantry. The Act makes available to each person of the community living below the poverty line, to some extent the minimum means of subsistence. In order, therefore, to reconcile the fundamental rights of the community as a whole with the individual rights of the more fortunate section of the community, it was fundamentally necessary to make the impugned legislation to secure to a certain extent the rights of that part of the community which is denied its legitimate share in the means of livelihood. [1224 F-H, 1225 A] 1211 (2) The broad objectivity of any legislation relating to agrarian reform are materially four, namely, (i) to maximise the agricultural output and productivity, (ii) a fair and equitable distribution of agricultural income, (iii) increase in employment opportunities and (iv) a social or ethical order. Though the abolition of zamindari system in the State of West Bengal was an important step forward the feudal structure remained so far as the peasants were concerned. These objectives have been achieved through progressive legislation. [1225 B-C] (3) The ceiling on agricultural holdings once fixed cannot be static unalterable for all times. The expression "any law for the time being in force", obviously refers to the law imposing a ceiling. Here, it is the West Bengal Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1971 (President's Act III of 1971) and now the West Bengal Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1971 (Act XII of 1972) which introduced Chapter IIB imposing a new ceiling on agricultural holdings of raiyats. That is the law for the time being in force, and no land is being acquired by the State under s. 14L within the ceiling limits prescribed therein. [1226 A-C] Further the second proviso to Art. 31A(1) to the "ceiling limit applicable to him", which evidently refers to the law in question and not the earlier law, that is s. 6(1) of the West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act, 1953. Both s.
 4(3) and s. 6(2) of the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1955 stood deleted by the West Bengal Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1971 (President's Act III of 1971) and thereafter by the West Bengal Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1972 with retrospective effect from February 12, 1971. [1226 C-D] The ceiling limit introduced by s. 14M of the impugned Act which came into force on February 15, 1971, is the ceiling limit "under the law for the time being in force" within the meaning of the second proviso to Art. 31A(1).
 That being so, the provisions of Chapter IIB have the constitutional immunity of Art. 31A and cannot be challenged on the ground that they are inconsistent with, take away or abridge the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 14, 19(1)(f) or 31(2). Even if it were not so, they would be under the protective umbrella of Art. 31B. Indubitably, the provisions of Chapter IIB are a law related to agrarian reform and thus protected. The challenge to the validity of the Constitution (Twentyninth Amendment) Act was allowed to be raised as an additional ground in Kesavananda Bharti v.
 State of Kerala and the court by majority of 7 : 6 upheld the validity of the twentyninth amendment. [1227 E-G, 1228 F-G] Kunjukutty v. State of Kerala, [1972] INSC 121; [1973] 1 S.C.R. 326 & 341, Malankara Rubber and Products Co. v. State of Kerala, [1972] INSC 127; [1973] 1 SCR 399 followed.
 Kesavananda Bharti v. State of Kerala, [1973] Supp. SCR 1 referred to.
 (4) When Art. 31B was introduced in the Constitution by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, it validated retrospectively 13 Acts specified in the Ninth Schedule, which, but for this provision, were liable to be impugned under Art. 13(2), Article 31B conferred constitutional immunity to such laws (all being enactments of State Legislatures) and Parliament alone could have done so by inserting the said Article in the Constitution in exercise of its constituent power under Art. 368. In substance and reality it was constitu- 1212 tional device employed to protect State laws from becoming void under Art.13(2). The language in Art. 31B is virtually lifted from Arts. 13(1) and (2) while article 13(2) invalidates legislation, which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by Part III, Art. 31B extends "protective umbrella" to such legislation if it is included in Ninth Schedule and, therefore, the Court will have no power to go into the constitutionality of the enactments as included in the Ninth Schedule except on the ground of want of legislative competence. [1229 C-F] (5) The definition of 'family' as contained in s.
 14K(c) of the Act is more realistic than the definitions of this term in similar laws for imposition of ceiling on agricultural holdings enacted in other States. The definition is much wider, and far more generous and humane because it takes into consideration the existence of a widowed and divorced daughter, which is absent in other Acts. The meaning given by Explanation I to an adult unmarried person is an inclusive one and it includes a daughter who has been divorced. This necessarily also includes a widowed daughter. By the proviso added to Explanation I, where such widowed daughter is the guardian of any minor son or unmarried daughter, or both, she, together with such minor son or unmarried daughter, or both, shall be deemed to be a separate family. She, therefore, is treated to be a raiyat in her own right in relation to her family and her holding is not clubbed with that of her father under s. 14M(2). The benefit provided to a divorced daughter would, obviously, also extend to a widowed daughter. Explanation II deals with the spouse as in relation to a raiyat who is a woman, reference in Clause (c) to wife's son or daughter shall be construed as reference to the husband's son or daughter, respectively of such woman.
 The Legislature on a correct perspective has enlarged the definition of a family to the maximum possible extent, and provides for as many as nine members. [1230 H, 1231 A-C] The marginal cases wherein normally in the family of a raiyat he has his parents to maintain would be very few.
 Normally, the father of a raiyat would have his separate holding and would be entitled to a separate ceiling area of his own determined under s. 14M. The Legislature had to draw a line somewhere. By s. 14M(2)(b) it provided for augmenting of the holding of a raiyat to the extent of 7.0 standard hectares by taking into account five plus four, that is, nine members. [1231 C-E] (6) The creation of an artificial concept of family and making provision for the clubbing together of land holding of each member of the family are not violative of the second proviso to Art. 31A(1), and even if they were, protected by Art. 31B. This had necessarily to be done for achieving the purpose and object of the legislation, that is, imposition of a ceiling on agricultural holding. The provisions of Chapter IIB in the Act are a law for imposition of ceiling on agricultural holdings of raiyats and are not a law for enlargement of such holdings, that is, these put a limit on the maximum limit of a holding of a raiyat. The Act adopts the individual as the unit and not the family and allows for augmentation of his holding depending upon the normal concept of a family. [1231 E-G] (7) There is no question of conferral of any new rights of minor son or unmarried daughter, as they would be included in the father's family, who 1213 would get a much larger ceiling of 5 to 7 standard hectares, depending upon the number of children that he has. Nothing prevents a minor son or the unmarried daughter of a raiyat, like his parents, from acquiring property of their own subsequently by inheritance or transfer. It is difficult to envisage a family consisting of 18 members in present times.
 Nor can the Legislature be expected to provide for all contingencies because according to s. 14M(b) the raiyat would be entitled to retain no more than 7 standard hectares, that is, 5 standard hectares for his family up to 5 members and 5.50 standard hectares per head for four other members. The extent of the holdings on which ceiling is fixed varies depending upon whether it is an irrigated area or any other area. There is no arbitrariness and indeed there is no substantial decrease in the limit. One standard hectare is equivalent to 2.47 acres. The ceiling limits, therefore, work out to 6.18 acres in the case of an individual and 12.35 to 17.29 acres of irrigated land, in the case of a family, which, in the Gangetic plains of West Bengal, is not small by any standard. In other areas, the ceiling limit varies from 8.64 to 24.2 acres. According to agro-economists, an economic holding is of 5 to 7 acres.
 [1232 A-C, E-F, 1233 G-H, 1234 A-B] It is not possible to lay down a ceiling standard or prescribe one limit in terms of fixed acreage for general application throughout the country. The productivity of land is not the same in all areas, due allowance has to be made for varying local conditions. As per the suggestions made by the four Five Year Plans and the Congress Agrarian Reforms Committee, the ceiling limits were mainly prescribed. Some States put a ceiling limit on the holding of an individual owner while the others imposed a ceiling on family holding.
 In the States where a ceiling was imposed on individual holding there was greater scope for mala fide transfers than where the ceiling was imposed on the aggregate area held by all the members of the family. In the latter case there was no inducement to effect transfers between the members of the family as their share had already been given due recognition. [1234 B-E] (8). The fixation of a back date is a usual legislative device to prevent avoidance of change brought about by law.
 The date mentioned in s. 14 does bear a reasonable nexus with the object or purpose of the legislation. The West Bengal Land Reforms (Amendment) Act. 1971 while inserting Chapter II B enacted s. 14P providing that in determining the ceiling area of a raiyat any transfer effected by sale, gift or otherwise or by a partition by him after August 7, 1969 and before February 8, 1971, i.e., the date of publication of the Act in the official Gazette shall not be taken into account and the land shall be deemed to form part of the holding of the raiyat. By a legal fiction, such transfers were presumed to be mala fide as they were calculated to defeat the ceiling law. [1235 D-F] The West Bengal Land Reforms (Second Amendment) Bill, 1969 was published in the official Gazette on that date.
 Though the amendment primarily related to re-assessment of revenue, the concept of "family" was first sought to be introduced in the West Bengal Land Reforms Act by that amendment. The land-holders, therefore, had a fore-warning that the concept of family may come into play in the determination of ceiling area of land. Prior to the said amendment, the proposed legislation ceiling adopted individual as a unit and not the family. Unless a date-line is fixed in the matter of ceiling or similar agrarian reforms, the very purpose of the legislation would be frustrated. The scope and 1214 effect of s. 14P are that all agriculture lands transferred after August 7, 1969 shall be taken into account in computing the ceiling of the raiyat. The effect was that the ceiling virtually imposed treating the family as the unit in s. 14M (2) was given a retrospective effect by s. 14P with effect from August 7, 1969. [1235 G-H, 1236 A-B] (9) Section 14U provides that except where he is permitted, in writing, by the Revenue Officer so to do, a raiyat owning land in excess of the ceiling area applicable to him under s. 14M, shall not, after the publication of the Act in the official Gazette, i.e., February 8, 1971, transfer, by sale, gift or otherwise or make any partition of any land owned by him or any part thereof until the excess land which is to vest in the State under s. 14S, has been determined and taken possession of by or on behalf of the State. Such provisions are to be found in all the Acts passed by different States relating to imposition of ceiling on agricultural land and indeed they are essential for implementing the scheme of the Act. [1236 B-D] In acutal implementation, the provision of these Acts were circumvented to a large extent by the making of fraudulent transfers. Transfers of rights in land could be effected by one of several ways such as sale, mortgage, gift and exchange. The Act by s. 14P provides that transfers effected before the date of publication of the Act and after August 7, 1969 shall not be taken into consideration. The legislature fixed August 7, 1969 as the date from which all such transfers or partitions shall be deemed to have been effected with the intention of defeating the law. Such transfers were presumed to be mala fide as they had taken place in anticipation of the enactment and, therefore, liable to be ignored. As the ceiling was fixed for each individual raiyat and not the family, as a unit, there was practically no limit to the amount of land that could be held by a family in this way, and therefore, the legislature had to insert s. 14M(2) for their shares to be clubbed together. There were plenty of reasons to believe that splitting of big holdings between members of the family had taken place on considerable scale in anticipation of the legislation. [1236 D-G] (10) There is no absolute bar under section 14U against transfers till the determination of the ceiling area under s. 14M. As regards s. 14U the fundamental right to acquire, hold and dispose of property guaranteed under Art. 19(1)(f) was subject to the right of the State to impose reasonable restrictions under Art. 19(6). The legislature was fully competent to lay down the maximum limit on an agricultural holding and make ancillary provisions to make the law effective by avoidance of transfers. These provisions contained in s. 14P and s. 14U are without which the whole object of enacting Chapter II for the imposition of a ceiling on agricultural holdings would have been completely frustrated. [1236 G-H, 1237 A-B] (11) The expression "agricultural land" is wide enough to include an orchard. Therefore an orchard as defined in s.
 14O(2) does not come within the definition of land in s.
 2(7). Any contrary construction would imply that there would be no ceiling on agricultural holdings in large tracts of land in the district of Malda which is famous for its mango orchards. The legislature by enacting s. 14O(2) treats the land comprised in orchards as falling within the purview of s. 14M, but having regard to the fact that there is a sufficient cluster of fruit-bearing trees in an orchard, which precludes the utilisation of the land comprised therein or substantial portion thereof for effective cultivation 1215 allows an additional area of 2 standard hectares for each raiyat. There is nothing wrong in the provision contained in s. 14O(2). On the contrary, it is a very reasonable provision. [1237 G-H, 1238 A-C] (12) Section 14V provides that compensation for vesting of any land in the State under the provisions of Chapter IIB shall be determined on the principles and in the manner as specified in Chapter III of the West Bengal Estate Acquisition Act, 1953. The absence of a provision for payment of compensation in respect of orchards in Chapter III of the West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act, 1953 does not mean that no compensation is to be determined or is not payable under s. 14V. In such a case, the general provisions relating to payment of compensation in respect of acquisition of land will apply. The principle on which, and the manner in which, compensation is to be determined and given are set out in ss. 16 and 17. Section 16 provides for computation the net annual income of land. Section 17 provides that the amount of compensation shall be a multiple of the net annual income, the multiple depending upon the extent of income. The multiple ranges from two to twenty times. The compensation has to be calculated according to the graded scale in the table given in s. 17. [1238 E, H, 1239 A-B] Where the legislature has laid down the principles for computation, the amount of compensation is not justiciable after the Fourth Amendment. It cannot be asserted that compensation payable for acquisition of land comprised in orchards in excess of the ceiling limit in s. 14O(2), according to the provisions of s. 14V is illusory. Where the law provides for payment of compensation as much as twenty times the annual income, it is virtually the capitalised value. The petitioners who own orchards would, therefore, get much more as the income derived by them would be greater than the raiyats holding land in excess of the ceiling limit in s. 14M(2). [1239 B-D] (13) The definition of 'land' as contained in s. 2(7) is an inclusive one and it means agricultural land other than land comprised in a tea-garden and includes homestead but does not include tank. Therefore, the provisions of Chapter IIB shall apply where the homestead is included in the record of rights as forming part of an agricultural holding. Agricultural holding or a raiyat includes his homestead and the raiyat can retain land including homestead under s. 14M(1) up to 7 standard hectares in irrigated area and 8.9 standard hectares in unirrigated areas. A raiyat would be entitled to get compensation under s. 14B according to the principles specified in Chapter III of the West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act, 1953. [1239 D-F] (14) Raiyats are entitled to retain the homestead, Normally raiyats would not be affected as they would be allowed to retain their homesteads as falling within the ceiling limits allowed under s. 14M. [1239 G-H] Provisions have been made in s. 16(1)(a) of the Estates Acquisition Act and also in Rule 15(b) and (d) of the West Bengal Estates Acquisition Rules, 1954 to provide the procedure for arriving at the compensation for any homestead if such homestead falls within the category of agricultural land, i.e., where it is so entered in the record of rights as part of agricultural holding of a raiyat. If a homestead is entered in the record of rights as non-agricultural land or as a part of a non-agricultural holding, it does not come within the purview of the Act, and, therefore, the question of vesting of such homestead does not arise. A raiyat is within his rights to retain land upto the ceiling limit applicable to 1216 him in accordance with s. 14M and s. 14T. Thus a raiyat is at liberty to retain his homestead and not to allow it to be vested in or acquired by the State under the Act. It is expected that normally raiyats would retain their homesteads and, therefore, the question of ousting them from their homesteads does not arise at all. In other cases, where raiyats willingly give up their homestead to be vested in the State, i.e., to be acquired by the State, without desiring to retain the same within the ceiling area applicable to him, the question of payment of compensation will rise and in such cases, compensation would be computed in accordance with s. 16(1)(a) (ii) of the Estates Acquisition Act read with Rule 15(b) and (d) of the Estates Acquisition Rules. [1240 A, D, E, F-H] (15) The power of eminent domain which is inherent in every sovereign State, must be capable of being exercised against every property held by any person in the State.
 Being a fundamental attribute of sovereignty of State one Cannot imagine that the framers of the Constitution intended to divest the State of that attribute by implication in the case of property owned by a private trust. Just as the property of a private trust is held subject to law imposing a tax upon it, so also is that property subject to the eminent domain of the State. [1241 C-D] All that s. 14M(5) provides is that land owned by a trust of endowment other than of a public nature shall be deemed to be land owned by the beneficiary of the trust or endowment, and each such beneficiary shall be deemed to be a raiyat under the Act to the extent of the share of his beneficial interest in the said trust or endowment. What is of essence is the capacity in which the land is held. If a raiyat is a beneficiary of a private trust his beneficial interest consists in the offerings or income. The provision in effect prescribes that the land should be clubbed for the computation of the ceiling area under s. 14M(1). The imposition of such a ceiling would no doubt reduce the holding of the trust but the Government has the power under s. 14O(3) to increase the ceiling area in certain cases.
 Where the Government is satisfied that a corporation or institution established exclusively for a charitable or religious purpose or both, for which a ceiling limit is prescribed under s. 14O(1) or a person holding any land in trust or in pursuance of any other endowment, creating a legal obligation exclusively for a purpose which charitable or religious, or both, requires land, as distinct from the income of such land, for the due performance of its obligation, it may having regard to all the circumstances of the case, increase the ceiling area for such corporation or institution or person to such extent as it may deem fit. The legislature has, therefore, provided adequate safeguards under s. 14O(3) to soften the rigour of the Act in relation to religious and charitable trusts. [1241 E-H, 1242 A]
