 It is not possible for courts to attempt to explore the murky depths of a warped and twisted mind so as to discover whether an offender is capable of reformation or redemption, and, if so, in what way. This is a subject on which only experts in that line after a thorough study of an individual's case history, could hazard an opinion with any degree of confidence. Judicial psychotherapy has its obvious and inherent limitations. The mere possession of a warped or twisted mind which many a criminal has, could not either absolve him from criminal liability or mitigate his crime. Courts are generally concerned only with the nature and extent of punishment once the accused's guilt is established. In considering the question of appropriate sentence to be awarded, while the common fragilities and failings of ordinary human beings. to which the offender gives vent, may, without affecting the criminality of the acts punished, be enough to show that a lesser sentence will meet the ends of justice, abnormal twists of the mind or indications of an obdurate and unrelenting viciousness of mind and conduct of the offender may show the need for a severer sentence. [491D-F] The murdered man had attacked the brother of the appellant in Crl. A. 133 of 1973. Later he had attacked the brother- in-law of the appellant. who was so badly injured that he had to remain in hospital for some days. On the day following the day of attack of his brother-in-law, the appellant had attacked the murdered man in broad daylight.
 Several witnesses spoke of the determined manner in which the appellant had told them that he had made up his mind to kill the deceased. The appellant hid himself in a compound waiting for the deceased and when the deceased was going on his bicycle, the appellant chased him and attacked and killed him with a chopper.
 The High Court convicted and sentenced him to death.
 The appellant in, Cr. A. 46 of 1974 was tried jointly for three murders committed at different times and places close to each other. in all the three cases the victims were beguiled by the appellant on one pretext or another to accompany him on a journey and the victims did not return after that. The appellant was convicted and sentenced to death.
 On the question of sentence, 
HELD : (1) The provocation contemplated by law must be grave as well as sudden so as to deprive the individual of the power of self-control before the first exception to section 300 could apply. In deciding whether the case merits a less severe of the two penalties prescribed for murder the history of relations between the parties concerned, the background, the context or the factual setting of the crime.
 and the strength and nature of the motives operating on the mind of the offender are relevant considerations. The state of feelings and mind produced by these, while insufficient to bring in the exception. may suffice to make the less severe sentence more appropriate. [489D-E] In the instant case the motives of the appellant, who in his obviously frenzied state of mind, decided to do away with someone who appeared to him to be a standing menace to the lives and limbs of his near and dear ones could not be said to be reprehensible. Nor could his inflamed feelings be less worthy of consideration in pronouncing upon the question of sentence. [489F-G] It is not enough for deciding such a question to find that facts of the case indicated deliberation or premeditation before the offence, although this is quite 486 important. Even the period of time which had elapsed between the two incidents was not so lengthy as to enable the court to say that the effect of provocation given by the previous night's occurrence, in the background of another similar occurrence, and the feelings of fear or alarm which must have engendered, so as to disturb the mind of a person in the position of the appellant, must have evaporated before the murder was committed. These may have become even intensified by brooding over or talking and thinking about the incidents. Although the previous incidents could not constitute sufficient provocation to reduce the crime of murder to one of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, yet, the context of the crime justified the imposition of a lesser penalty than that given in this case. [489G; 490A-C] Jagmohan Singh v. State of U.P. [1972] INSC 241; [1973] 1 S.C.C. 20 referred to.
 Ediga Anama v. State of Andhra Pradesh', [1974] INSC 27; [1974] 3 S.C.R. 329 followed.
 (2) In the case of the appellant in Cr. A. 46 of 1974 no fact was proved as could so disturb or unhinge the mind of an average individual as to impel him towards murder. It is apparent, from the way in which the appellant committed gruesome murders, the relationships of those he murdered, the absence of any intelligible reasons for which he could have murdered them, and the casual manner in which he used to dispose of the bodies that he had no respect whatsoever for the sanctity of human life. He apparently murdered for the sheer pleasure which killing those he disliked for some reason seemed to give him. Furthermore there is no evidence Lo Suggest that the appellant suffered from insanity or mental ill-health of a kind which incapacitated him from understanding the nature of the acts committed by him or that they were wrong. Evidence in the case indicates that he knew very well what he was doing and that this was wrong.
 [490H; 491A-C] If, however, proved facts disclose that something even falling short of either legal insanity, satisfying the tests laid down in M'naghten rules, which is receiving increasing jurisprudential recognition for absolving its victim from criminal 'liability, or grave and sudden provocation. which Will reduce a culpable homicide from murder to one which is not murder. is present in the case so as to only disturb the normal balance of an individual's mind what is proved may be sufficient to avert death penalty. While mitigating circumstances were shown to exist in the first case the circumstances revealed in the second were of an aggravating kind. There is a vast difference between the two cases-the difference between the case of a scared human being, with a weak control over his feelings, carried away by what was too strong and long-lasting a gust of passion against another who had given him genuine cause for anger, and that of a person whose conduct in carrying out cold blooded and calculated murders of several relatives disclose nothing short of a fiendish callousness and cruelty.
