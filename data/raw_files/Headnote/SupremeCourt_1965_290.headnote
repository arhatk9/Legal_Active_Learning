 The U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act was passed on 26th January 1951 but the right of the Zamindars vested in the State only with effect from 1st July 1952. Also both the Abolition Act and the U.P. Agriculturists' Relief Act 1934 continued on the Statute Book till 12th July 1953. In May 1952, the respondent, who was the successor in-interest of the original mortgagor, filed an application under s. 12 of the Agriculturists' Relief Act in the Munsif's Court, alleging that the mortgage had been paid off from the usufruct of the land and that he was entitled to redeem it.
 On 12th July 1953 the Abolition Act was amended by Act 16 of 1953 by which the Agriculturists' Relief Act was repealed.
 By s. 1(2) of the Amending Act, the Amending Act itself was deemed to have come into force on 1st July 1952, that is, smultaneously with the Abolition Act. In November 1953, the respondent's application was decreed. In appeal, it was urged on behalf of the appellant, the successor-in-interest of the original mortgagees that as the Agriculturists' Relief Act was repealed the application under s. 12 of that Act was incompetent and that the respondent could not eject the appellant except in accordance with the provisions of the Abolition Act. This contention was not accepted by the appellate court, and a revision application by the appellant to the High Court was also dismissed.
 In appeal to this Court, on the question whether the proceeding before the Munsif was competent, 
HELD: 'Me proceedings were with jurisdiction, because, they were not affected by the passing of the Abolition Act, or the Amending Act of 1953, regard being had to the provisions of s 6 of the U.P. General Clauses Act in the first instance. and more so, in view of the provisions of s.
 23 of the Amending Act 18 of 1956, which came into force before the proceedings between the parties had finally terminated. [23 A-B] There was nothing in the Abolition Act which took away the right in respect of a pending action. Under the Amending Act 16 of 1953, the Agriculturists' Relief Act was repealed retrospectively from 1st July 1952 only, and it is not possible to give the repeal further retrospectivity so as to affect a proceeding pending before that date. The jurisdiction of the Assistant Collector under the Abolition Act was itself created from 1st July 1952. but there was no Provision in the Abolition Act, that pending proceedings were to stand transferred to the Assistant Collector for disposal. Therefore as a result of s. 6 of the U.P General Clauses Act, the proceeding could continue before the Munsif since a different intention does not appear either in the Abolition Act or Amending Act 16 of 1953. Further, s. 23 of Amending Act 18 of 1956, shows that by the conferral of the jurisdiction upon the Assistant Col- 16 authorities when the Abolition Act came into force. Since the proceeding was pending before the Appellate Court in 1956, when the 1956 amendment was passed, it follows that the provisions of the Abolition Act could not be applied, because the Legislature had in 1956 said expressly in s. 23, what was implicit before, namely, that pending actions would be governed by the old law as if the new law had not been passed.
