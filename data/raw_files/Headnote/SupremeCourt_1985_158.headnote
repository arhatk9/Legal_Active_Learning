 After considering the advice of the Committee, appointed under ss. 5(1)(a) and 9 of the Minimum Wages Act 1948, the Government of India by a Notification issued under the Act fixed the minimum rates of wages payable to certain categories of employees in the scheduled employment in certain mines. The mine-owners challenged the notification under Article 226 of the Constitution and the same was quashed by the High Court on the ground that the Committee on whose advice the Notification was based was improperly constituted for two reasons: (1) that the Chief Labour Commissioner (Central) New Delhi and Director, Labour Bureau, Simla, were Government employees in the Labour Department and were, therefore, not truly 'independent' so as to be eligible to be appointed to the Committee constituted under ss.5 and 9 of the Act and (2) that the so- called representatives of the employers on the Committee were not representatives of the named mining industries and were, therefore, ineligible to be appointed to the Committee to represent the employers of the particular scheduled employments.

 HELD: 1. The Government employees, who are entrusted with the task of implementing the provisions of the Minimum Wages Act 1948, cannot, for that reason, be dubbed as interested and not independent persons. In a case where the Government itself is not an employer there is no justification for holding that Government employees become 'interested persons' contemplated by 303 s. 9 of the Act are persons who belong neither to the category of employers nor to the category of employees and there is no reason to think that Government employees are excluded. The term 'independent persons', is used in the section in contradistinction to the words 'persons representing employers and employees in the scheduled employments'. [305 F-H, 306 A-B] Narottamdas v.

 2. The persons appointed to the Committee to represent the employers were eligible to be appointed to the committee. The scheduled employments in the instant case are employment in Gypsum, Barytes, Bauxite and Manganese mines.
 For the purpose of appointing a Committee to represent the employers in the scheduled employment, it was not necessary that the persons appointed should be engaged for profit in the particular employment. It is enough if a nexus exists between the persons so appointed to represent the employers in the particular employment and the particular employment concerned. There was no material before the High Court nor was the High Court in a position to say that the persons appointed to the Committee to represent the employers were entirely unconnected with or ignorant of the particular employment. It is not understood how by merely looking at their names and the position occupied by them, the High Court was able to say that they were incompetent to represent the employers in the particular employments. The representatives of the employers consisted of Controller of the Indian Bureau of Mines, Secretary General of the Federation of the Indian Mining Industries, President of Mysore State Mine Owners Association, etc. etc. All these persons are intimately connected with the mining industry and it has not been shown that they were unconnected with or ignorant of the particular scheduled employments in mines.
 It is impossible to uphold the view of the High Court. [306 D-H, 306 A-E] Champak Lal H. Thakkar v. State of Gujarat [1980] (4) SCC 329 not applicable.

 3. Notifications fixing minimum ages should not be lightly interfered with under Article 226 of the Constitution except on the most substantial grounds. [307 G]
