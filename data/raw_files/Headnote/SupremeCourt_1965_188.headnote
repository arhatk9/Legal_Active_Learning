 Consequent on the discovery of an abnormal waste of electrical energy, investigations were started and it was found that the meter of the appellant, who was an industrial power consumer, had been tampered with. The seal on the meter cover was broken, a sealing nut was loosened imposing a stud hole, and it was thus possible to retard the rotation of the inside disc. The appellant was charged with offences under ss. 39 and 44 of the Electricity Act, 1910 and r. 138 of the Electricity Rules, 1956 and was convicted by the High Court.
 In appeal to the Supreme Court, 
HELD:(i) In the absence of proof that he used all reasonable meansto ensure that the seal should not be broken, the liability of the appellant was absolute under r.
 138, and so, he was rightly convicted. [886 H] (ii) The exposure of the stud hole was an artificial means for preventing the meter from duly registering the energy supplied, and since the appellant, having custody or control of the meter did not rebut the pre-resumption under s. 44 that he wilfully and knowingly prevented the meter from duly registering he was rightly convicted under that section. 887 C-E] (iii) But the High Court was in error in holding that the exposure of a stud hole on the meter cover without more,, was an artificial means of abstraction and was prima facie evidence of dishonest abstraction by the appellant, under s.
 39.
 The effect of the last part of s. 39 is that the existence of the unauthorised means for abstraction is prima facie evidence of dishonest abstraction. By tampering with the meter and causing it to record less than the units actually passing through it, a consumer may take unre corded energy without paying for it and such unauthorised taking would be abstraction. A meter with an exposed stud hole, without more, is not a perfected instrument for unauthorised taking of energy and cannot be regarded as an artificial means for its abstraction. 'Me existence of artificial means for preventing the meter from duly registering, gives rise to the presumption, that the meter was prevented from duly registering, only for purposes of s. 44, but that presumption cannot, be imported into s. 39.
