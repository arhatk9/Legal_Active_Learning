 The petitioners, who were convicted and sentenced to death by a special tribunal in the Hyderabad State, preferred appeals to the High Court of Hyderabad which were dismissed, and the applied to the High Court on the 21st Jan., 1950, for leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee of Hyderabad against the judgments of the High Court. On the 96th Jan., 1950, the Constitution of India came into force and under the Constitution, Hyderabad became a part of India, the Judicial Committee of Hyderabad ceased exist, and all appealls and other proceedings pending before that 941 Committee stood transferred to the Supreme Court of India.
 The applications of the petitioners were amended so as to make them applications under Art. 134 of the Ccnstitution, but they were dismissed on the ground that no such petitions lay under Art.134 and also on the merits. The petitioners thereupon made an application to the Supreme Court of India under Art. 136 of the Constitution for special leave to appeal:
 Held that, inasmuch as Art. 136 confers power on the Supreme Court to grant special leave to appeal only from any judgment, decree, sentence or order passed or made by "any court or tribunal in the territory of India," and the Hyd- erabad High Court was not a Court in the territory of India when the judgments in question were pronounced the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction to grant special leave.
 Art. 136 cannot be so construed as to apply to judgments or orders pronounced be[ore Hyderabad became part of India and to confer a right of appeal inferentially, merely be- cause the petitioners had a right to appeal to the Judicial Committee of Hyderabad when the Constitution came into force and they had been deprivecd of this right by the abolition of that Committee without making a provision enabling them to appeal to the Supreme Court.
