 An industrial dispute arising out of the demands made by the employees against 13 Hotel and Restaurant institutions in Delhi was -referred for adjudication to the Industrial Tribunal and they were heard together with another reference made to it concerning the disputes in the case of two other hotels. The award given by the Tribunal in these two references gave rise to the present four appeals by special leave, two of which had been filed by the employees and the other two by the employers.
 The main contentions in the appeals were the following: it was contended on behalf of the employers that the Tribunal was in error in dealing with the two hotels and eleven restau. rants together inasmuch as they were not similar in character. Their next contention was that the Tribunal committed another error in treating the wine shops as part of the restaurant esta. blishment. Thirdly it was contended that in constructing the wage structure the Tribunal did not consider properly the financial position of the employers.
 The next contention was that the Tribunal erred in reducing the amount of remuneration claimed by the employers for the different partners who took active part in the management of their respective,establishments. It was further contended on their behalf that since each one of the workers got Rs.
 50/-to 60/- by way of tips no 863 D.A. should have been awarded to the waiters. Another con.
 tention was that in view of the fact that Employees Provident Fund Scheme had already been introduced in these establishments the introduction by the award of a gratuity scheme was not justified. It was the case of the employers that even if such a scheme was justified on principle the scheme as contained in the present award is bad on merits.
 It was further contended that the directions of the Tribunal regarding the decisions of the service charges in the future was outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, because this was not a matter referred to it for adjudication. They lastly contended that the Tribunal had no power to give retrospective operation to the award.
 The employees contended, among other things, that the bonus awarded was inadequate on the ground that the calculation made by the Tribunal in respect of income-tax claimed by the employees as a prior charge are obviously inconsistent with the decisions of this Court in recent case of Tulsi Das Khimji v. Their Workmen, [1963] 1 S.C.R. 675.
 Held, that though the nature of the service rendered in Hotels is in some particulars different from that of the Restaurants, both the establishments are constituents of the catering trade. Taking into consideration that they are situated in similar localities and carry on the same business it is desirable that terms and conditions of service of the employees working in them should as far as possible be uniform; such uniformity is conducive to industrial peace and harmony and to better, efficient and satisfactory management.
 The question whether there is functional intregrality between two units has to be decided according to the facts of each case. Absence of functional integrality and the fact that the two units can exist one without the other do not necessarily show that where they exist they are necessarily separate units and do not constitute one establishment.

 Wine shops and Restaurants form part of the same establishment because there is unity of ownership, unity of 864 finance, unity of management and unity of labour and they are not separately registered.
 Where a wage structure is constructed and it provides for increments the financial position of the employer has to be considered. The hypothetical consideration that total prohibition may be introduced in the near future, cannot play any part in the decision of the wage problem in the present case. It would be open to the employers to raise a dispute for the reduction in the wage structure in case they are able to show that as a result of the introduction of total prohibition their financial position is weakened to such an extent that they cannot bear the burden of the wage structure directed by the award.
 When this court entertain appeals in industrial matters under Art. 136 of the Constitution it does not act as a court of appeal on facts. It is only where general 'questions of law are raised that this Court feels called upon to pronounce its decision on them.
 A firm is not a legal person within the meaning of the Industrial Disputes Act. It is the partners of the firm who are the employers.
 Tulsidas Khimji v. Their Workmen, [19631 1 S.C.R. 675, referred to.
 It would not be right to treat the tips received by the waiters as being wholly irrelevant to the decision of the question about the matter of D.A. But it would not be right to make a calculation about the tip; received and treat the said amount as a substitute either whole or partial for the D.A. itself. What can be done is to bear in mind the fact that tips are received and make some suitable adjustment in that behalf.

 The object intended to be achieved by the Provident Fund Scheme is not the same as the object of the gratuity scheme and in any case where the financial position of the employer justi. fies the introduction of both benefits, there is no reason why the employers should not get the benefits of both the schemes.
 865 Bharatkhand Textile Mfg. Co. Ltd. v. Textile Labour Association, Ahmedabad, (1960) 2 L.L.J. 21 and Garment Cleaning Works v. Its Workmen, [1962] 1 S.C.R. 71, followed.
 For the termination of service caused by the employer the minimum period of service for payment of gratuity should be five years and if the employee resigns he would be entitled to get gratuity only if he has completed ten years service or more. If the termination is the result of misconduct which has caused financial loss to the employer that loss should be first compen. sated from the gratuity payable to the employee.
 Since the direction of the Tribunal for the decision of the service charges in future is not covered by the terms of reference that direction is invalid.
 Under s. 17A (4) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, it is open to the industrial Tribunal to name the date from which it should come into operation.
