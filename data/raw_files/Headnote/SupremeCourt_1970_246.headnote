 The appellants were hereditary trustees of religious and charitable institutions and endowments. They claimed the right to manage and administer the secular estate of the institution or endowment of which they were hereditary trustees but never claimed proprietary or beneficial interest either in the corpus or in the usufruct of the estate. They challenged the validity of s. 15 read with ss.
 17, 27, 36 and. 97 of the Andhra Pradesh Charitable and Hindu Religious Institutions and Endowments Act, 1966, on the ground that they are violative of Art. 19 of the Con- stitution. The High Court held that the office of hereditary trustee was property but that the restrictions imposed by the various provisions of the Act are reasonable and are in the interests of the public.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) The position of a hereditary trustee who claims a bare right to manage and administer the secular estate, is the same as that of a Dharmakarta or a mere manager or custodian of an institution except that the hereditary trustee succeeds to the office as of right and in accordance with the rules governing succession. He cannot be equated to a shebait, methadhipathi or a mahant in whose case, the ingredients of both office and property, of duties and personal interest and rights are blended together. Hence the office of such a hereditary trustee is not property within the meaning of Art. 19. The observation in Sambuda- murthi Mudaliar v. State of Madras, [1969] INSC 240; [1970] 2 S.C.R. 424 that the office of a hereditary trustee is in the nature of property is obiter. The pronouncement of the Privy Council in Gnanasambanda Pandara Sannadhi v. Velu Patrdaram, 27 I.A.
 69, Ganesh Chander Dhur v. Lal Behary Dhur, (1936) 71 M.L.J.
 740 (P.C.) and Bhaba Tarini Debi v. Asha Lata Debi, I.L.R.
 [1943] 2 Cal. 137 (P.C.) that the rule in the Tagore case, (1872) 9 B.L.R. 377 applies to succession of hereditary trustees does not afford any assistance in deciding whether an office holder. who has a bare right of management, can claim to have a right or interest in the nature of property within the meaning of Art. 19(1)(f).
 [886 B-D; 887 F-H] Tilkayat Shri Govindlalji Maharaj v. State of Rajasthan [1964] 1 S.C.R. 561 and Raja Birakishore V. Orissa, [1964] INSC 56; [1964] 7 S.C.R. 32, followed.
 (2)Even if the right constituted property the restrictions which have been imposed by the provisions of the Act on the hereditary trustees are reasonable and are in the interest of the general public. [888B] 879 The statute has been enacted because, a high powered body, namely the Hindu Religious Endowment Commission, had reported that there was mismanagement invariably of the endowment property by the trustees. The power to appoint non-hereditary trustees or executive officers under ss. 15 and 27, even where there is already a hereditary trustee or trustees, notwithstanding that there is no mismanagement, is only for the purpose of ensuring better and efficient administration and management of the institution or endowment. Under s. 17, the hereditary trustee is not removed but is to be the chairman of the Board of Trustees, and if there are more than one hereditary trustee, one of them is to be chairman by rotation. Instead of managing the institution alone he has to administer it in collaboration with other trustees who are non-hereditary; but it is only the secular aspect-and not matters of religion-that is touched. [883 D; 888 B-G] [Questions whether some of the institutions were private or were religious denominations within Art. 26, left open for determination by the appropriate forum.] [889 D]
