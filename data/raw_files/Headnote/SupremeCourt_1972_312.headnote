 The appellant was tried for an offence under s.302 I.P.C.
 The prosecution sought to put on record two documents to show that the appellant was punishable with death under s.
 303 1. P.C. in view of the fact that he had earlier been convicted of another murder and was in that connection undergoing a sentence of life imprisonment though he had been released on probation. The trial judge held that the documents were not relevant because in his view the conditions which would make them relevant were not satisfied. He convicted the appellant under s. 302 I.P.C.
 as charged and sentenced him to imprisonment for life. The State did not file any appeal but two revision petitions were filed in the High Court by the brother of the deceased against the orders of the Sessions Judge refusing to summon the aforesaid documents and refusing to frame a charge under s. 303 I.P.C. The appellant sent an appeal against his conviction to the High Court of Allahabad in the form of a' letter. The High Court sent the matter to the Sessions Judge for determination of the question whether the appellant and the person alleged to have been convicted of murder in the earlier case were the same persons. The Sessions Judge recorded a finding that the appellant was the person who had been convicted of the earlier murder and was undergoing imprisonment of life in that connection. On this report the High Court convicted the appellant under s. 303 I.P.C. and sentenced him to death. It however granted him a certificate to appeal to this Court. The questions that fell for consideration were : (1) whether the appellant was liable to be sentenced under s. 303 I.P.C. for the enhanced punishment of death; (ii) whether it was necessary in the present case to follow the procedure laid down in s. 310 of the Criminal Procedure Code; (iii) whether the High Court would impose the enhanced punishment of death when there was no appeal by the State merely on the basis of revision petitions filed by a private party.
 Dismissing the appeal, HELD:Per Alagiriswami and Vaidialingam JJ. (Dua J.
 dissenting) (i)It was established that the accused was under 'a sentence of imprisonment for life when he committed the present murder. He would therefore be liable to be convicted under Section 303 of the Indian Penal Code. [142- D] (ii)Under s. 3 10 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as under s. 75 of the Indian Penal Code, it is enough if the person concerned has been earlier convicted. It is not necessary that the sentence should be 137 in force. But under s. 303 I.P.C. the person's sentence must be in force if the person is to be dealt with for a subsequent offence of murder under that section. Bearing in mind that section 75 I.P.C. and section 310 of the Code of Criminal Procedure deal with persons with previous conviction the previous sentence need not necessarily be in force when the subsequent offence is committed-it would be clear that the latter section is intended to be applicable only to cases to which section 75 of the Indian Penal Code applies. [144A-B] Section 303 is like a proviso to a. 302 and a court trying a person for murder could apply the provisions of s. 303 if it is brought to its notice that the person being tried is under a sentence of life imprisonment. The punishment for an offence under r. 302 is either death or life imprisonment and s. 303 removes the alternative punishment and makes a sentence of death compulsory. There is no need therefore to for ' me a further charge under section 303 according to the provisions of section 3 1 0 Cr. P. C. It must therefore be held that there was no illegality committed by the High Court in sentencing the appellant to death without farming a charge as required under section 310 of the Code of Criminal Procedure or without sending back the case for fresh trial by the Sessions Judge after framing a charge under section 303 I.P.C. [1440-H] (iii)Under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the High Court has ample powers and as a notice had been given to the appellant to show cause why his sentence should not be enhanced, there 'was no illegality in the sentence of death imposed on the appellant. The power under s.439 Cr.
 P.C. is one which the High Court can exercise suo motu and all that a person filing a revision petition under that section does is to draw the court's attention to an illegal, improper or incorrect finding, sentence or order of a subordinate court. The fact that in this case the brother of the deceased filed the revision petitions and the Government did not do so did not affect the powers of the High Court under that Section. In addition reference may also be made to s. 423 (IA) of the Cr., P.C. [145B-D] Per Dua J.-In this case the High Court was not at all justified in interfering with the discretion of the trial court in decling to take the two documents on the record when the prosecution had not in good time summoned the evidence for proving the previous conviction of the appellant and the fact that he was under a life sentence and had also not asked, for adjournment of the appellant's trial on the charge under s. 302 I.P.C. The appellant could by no means be considered to have notice of a charge under s. 303 
1. P.C. or of the facts which form the essential ingredients of the offence, when there was absolutely no such indication in the charge actually framed against him and on which he was tried. [155E-G] The High Court did not also scrutinise the proceedings of the Sessions Judge for ascertaining if the appellant had been afforded adequate legal assistance and also as to why the thumb impressions and the handwritings, if any of the accused in the two cases were not got compared. The High Court should have done so in order to satisfy itself if the appellant had been afforded adequate and effective opportunity to defend himself before the Sessions Judge because those proceedings were just as serious as a trial for an offence prescribing death as the only penalty. 1156C- D] Bashira v. State of U.P. [1968] INSC 112; A.I.R. 1968, S.C. 1313, referred to.
 138 The High Court erred in enhancing the appellant's sentence on the facts and circumstances of this case. Justice had quite clearly failed here as a result of the interference by the High Court on revision at the instance of the private complainant. The death sentence passed by the High Court against the appellant must accordingly be quashed and the sentence of life imprisonment passed by the trial Court must be restored. [156-F]
