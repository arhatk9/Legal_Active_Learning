 In a suit for possession and mesne profits the High Court gave a direction in the preliminary decree that the trial court should make an enquiry into the mesne profits payable by the appellant (judgment debtor), from the date of the institution of the suit, and pass a final decree for payment of the amount found due up to the date of delivery of possession of the properties to the respondent (decree holder). The trial court appointed a Commissioner for making the enquiry, and after considering his report, passed a final decree for a certain amount. No objection was taken by the appellant, either before the Commissioner or the trial court that accounts could be taken under O. XX r. 12 Civil Procedure Code, only for 3 year from the date of the preliminary decree and not till the later date when possession was delivered to the respondent. In his appeal to the High Court also, the appellant did not raise the ground in the memorandum of appeal, but when the appeal was argued he sought to raise the contention. The High Court did not allow him to do so and dismissed the appeal. Along with the appeal the High Court dealt with the cross objections preferred by the respondent in which he claimed enhancement of the amount of mesne profits and partially allowed the cross objections. In the appeal to the Supreme Court it was contended that (i) the High Court was in error in not allowing the appellant to raise the objection based on O.XX, r. 12 of the Code, (ii) the respondent was not entitled to be granted mesne profits for a period beyond three years from the date of the preliminary decree and (iii) the High Court was in error in enhancing the amount of mesne profits.
 
HELD (Per Raghubar Dayal and Sikri, JJ.) : (i) The High Court was in error in not allowing the appellant to urge the additional ground before it. [669 B-C] It was a pure question of law not dependent on the determination of any question of the fact and such questions are allowed to be raised for the first time even at later stages. Even though the High Court has discretion to allow or refuse an application for raising an additional ground, the order refusing permission could be interfered with by the Supreme Court, because, it was not in conformity with the principle that a question of pure law can be urged at any stage of a litigation. [664 H; 666D-F-G] There was no question of the appellant conceding before the Commissioner or electing before the trial court that mesne profits could be calculated till the date of delivery of possession when no dispute about the matter had arisen between the parties. [666 H] Further, the respondent could not have been prejudiced by the appellant raising the new ground at the hearing of the appeal and not earlier, 662 for, even if the appellant had raised it before the Commissioner the respondent could not have sued for mesne profits beyond three years, as, by that time, the period of limitation for such a suit had expired. [669 A-B] (ii) A decree under O.X.X., r. 12 of the Code, directing enquiry into mesne profits, however expressed, must be construed to be a decree directing the -enquiry in conformity with the requirements of r. 12(1) (c), and so the respondent would not be entitled to mesne profits beyond a period of three years from the date of the preliminary decree. [676 A-B] It is open to the court to construe the direction in accordance with the provisions of the rule when such direction is not fully expressed so as to cover all the alternatives mentioned therein. [673 F] The direction in the preliminary decree could not have been appealed against because, the question about the proper period for which mesne profits was to be decreed really comes up for decision at the time of passing the final decree, by which time, the parties would be in a position to know the exact period for which future mesne profits could be decreed-. and so, the appeal could be filed only after a final decree is passed and s. 97 of the Code would be inapplicable. Nor would the direction in the preliminary decree operate as res judicata either under s. 11 of the Code or on general principles, because there was no controversy between the parties. [674 A; E-H] Instead of insisting that the court should repeat in the judgment the various alternatives mentioned in the rule, it would be preferable to construe the judgment in accordance with those provisions, and so construed, there is no possibility of a decree holder gaining by his own default.
 [675DE, G.] Case law reviewed.
 Per Mudholkar, J. (Dissenting) : (i) The High Court was right in refusing leave to the appellant to raise a new ground at the hearing since not only had be not raised it in the memorandum of appeal but he had also allowed an enquiry into mesne profits by the Commissioner for a period longer than 3 years from the date of the decree and participated therein. [683 G] Further, the grant or refusal of permission was within the discretion of the High Court and the High Court had given very good and cogent reasons for refusing permission. [684 D-E] When a party omits to raise an objection to a direction given by a lower court in its judgment, he must be deemed to have waived his right and cannot, for the first time at the hearing of an appeal from that decision challenge the courts' power to give the direction. The proper function of an appellate court is to, correct an error in the judgment or proceedings of the court below and not to adjudicate upon a different kind of dispute a dispute that had been never taken before the court below. It is only in exceptional cases that the appellate court may, in its discretion allow a new point to be raised before it, provided there are good grounds for allowing it to be raised and no prejudice is caused to the opponent. [686G; 688 E-G] Case law considered.
 (ii) On the merits of the contention, even assuming that the direction in the preliminary decree was wrong, that decision has to be given -effect to as it was not challenged in appeal and therefore had become final under s. 97 of the Code. Unless it is corrected in the manner provided in the Code, it will operate as res judicata between the parties in all subse-quent stages of the lis. [689 D-E; 692 B] 663 It may be that where the meaning of a term is not clear or is ambiguous, the question of construing it may arise and the court would be doing the right thing in placing upon it a construction conformable to law. But the direction in the instant case did not suffer from vagueness, ambiguity or such incompleteness as well make its enforcement impossible.
 [691 B-C] (iii) (By Full Court) : The High Court had raised the rates of mesne profits without expressing its reasons for holding that the Subordinate Judge was wrong in his findings. The case should therefore be remanded to the High Court and the quantum of mesne profits determined afresh, but, oniy up to three years from the date of the preliminary decree according to the majority judgment.
