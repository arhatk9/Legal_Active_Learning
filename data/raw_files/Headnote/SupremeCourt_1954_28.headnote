 Unless it is shown that execeptional and special circumstances exist that substantial and grave injustice has been done and the case in question presents features of sufficient gravity to warrant a review of the decision appealed against, the Supreme Court does not exercise its overriding powers under art. 136(1) of the Constitution and the circumstance that the appeal has been admitted by special leave does not entitle the appellant to open out the whole case and contest all the findings of fact and raise every point which could be raised in the High Court. Even at the final hearing only those points can be urged which are fit to be urged at the preliminary stage when the leave to. appeal is asked for.
 The contention that confession cannot be corroborated by the use of materials already in the possession of the police is devoid of force. A confession made and recorded even during a trial can be corroborated by the evidence already recorded. It may be made and recorded in the court of committing magistrate,and material already in the possession of the police may be used for purpose of corroboration.
