 The Industrial Disputes (Amendment) Act 1971 inter alia introduced s. 11A into the parent Act of 1947. The new section provided that if in the course of the adjudication of an Industrial dispute relating to the discharge or dismissal of a workman a Labour Court, Tribunal, or National Tribunal is satisfied that the order of discharge or dismissal was not justified, it may, by its award, set aside the order of discharge or dismissal and direct reinstatement of the workmen or reduce punishment etc. The proviso to the section laid down that in any proceeding under the section the Court or Tribunal in question shall rely only on the materials on record and shall not take any fresh evidence in relation to the matter. The section came into force with effect from December 15, 1971. In the present appeals by special leave the two questions that arose for consideration were : (i) whether s. 11 A had made any changes in the existing legal situation as laid down by this Court and if so, to what extent-, (ii) whether the section was applicable to industrial disputes which had been already referred for adjudication and were pending as on December 15, 1972.
 
HELD : (i) The statement of objects and reasons cannot be taken into account for the purpose of interpreting the plain words of the section. But it gives an indication as to what the Legislative wanted to achieve. [608 A-B] (ii)The Act is a beneficial piece of legislation enacted in the interest of employees. it is well settled that in construing the provisions of a welfare legislation, courts should adopt, what is described as a beneficent rule of construction. If two constructions are reasonably possible to be placed on the section, it follows that the construction which furthers the policy and object of the Act and is more, beneficial to the employees has to be preferred. The interpretation must be liberal enough to achieve the legislative purpose. It must still be in accordance with the plain words, of the statute or the section and must not do violence to the language used by the legislature. it will further have to be found from the words of the section whether it has altered the entire law as laid down in the existing decisions and, if so, whether there is a clear expression of that intention in the language of the section. [608 G-H; 609 A-C] (iii)Both in respect of cases where a domestic enquiry has been held as also in cases when the Tribunal considers the matter on the evidence adduced before it for the first time, the satisfaction under s. 11A, about the guilt or otherwise of the workmen concerned is that of the Tribunal. It has to consider the evidence and come to a conclusion one way or other. Even in cases where an enquiry has been held by an employer and a finding of misconduct arrived at, the Tribunal can now differ from that finding in a proper case and hold that no misconduct is proved.
 [611 A-C] The contention that the stage for interference under section 11A by the Tribunal is reached only when it has to consider the punishment after 588 having accepted the finding of guilt recorded by the employee, could not be accepted., The Tribunal under s. 11A can consider the question of guilt as well as of punishment.
 It can also alter the punishment imposed by an employer.
 [611 C-H; 612 A-B] It was specifically contended before the Court in Workmen of Motipur Sugar Factories (Private) Limited, that when an employer had held no enquiry as required by the Standing Orders, it was not open to him to adduce evidence before the Tribunal for the first time and justify the order of discharge. This contention was rejected by this Court and it was held that if the enquiry was defective or no inquiry had been held, as required by the Standing Orders, the entire case would be open before the Tribunal and the, employer would have to justify, on evidence as well that its order of dismissal or discharge was proper. There is no provision either in the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act 1948 or in the Industrial Disputes Act which states that an order of dismissal or discharge is illegal if it is not recorded by a proper and valid domestic enquiry.
 Therefore, the contention that such 'an enquiry being illegal, the Tribunal has now under s. 11A no alternative but to order reinstatement could not be accepted. Moreover the Industrial Disputes Act cannot be differently applied to employees who are governed by the Stand Orders Act and those who are not governed by it. [612 H; 613 A-G] The expression 'materials on record' occurring in the proviso to s. 11A cannot be confined only to the materials which were available at the domestic enquiry. On the other hand the 'materials on record' in the proviso must be held to refer to materials on record before the Tribunal. They take in (1) the evidence taken by the management at the enquiry and the proceedings of the enquiry, or (2) the above evidence and in addition any further evidence led before the Tribunal, or (3) evidence placed before the Tribunal for the first time in support of the action taken by the employer as well as the evidence adduced by the workmen contra. The expression 'fresh evidence' has to be read in the context in which it appears, namely, as distinguished from the expression 'materials on record'. The Tribunal, for the purpose of determining the question of misconduct or punishment or relief to be granted to workmen, has to act only on the basis of the , materials on record' before it and. cannot call for fresh evidence as an appellate authority can normally do.
 [613H; 614 A-H; 615A-D] (iv)The words "in a proceeding under this section" in the proviso. to s. 11A are very significant. There cannot be a "proceeding under this section" before the section has come into force. A proceeding under that section can only be on or after 15-12-1971. T at also gives an indication that section 11A applies only to disputes which are referred for adjudication after the section has come into force. There are no express words in s. 11A which would make it applicable even to disputes referred before it came into force nor could such an inference be gathered by necessary intendment, The section therefore does not apply to proceed- ings before 15-12-1971.
