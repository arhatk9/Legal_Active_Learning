 The appellant was holding and had been confirmed in the post of Inspector General of Registration (I.G.R.), Madras, when, on November- 11, 1963, the post of I.G.R. was included in the cadre of the Indian Administrative Service (I.A.S.). On January 25, 1964, a Government order was issued posting a member of the I.A.S. who was holding the post of a 'Deputy Secretary, as I.G.R., Madras, vice the appellant. On January 30, 1964 by another order, the appellant was posted to act temporarily as Accommodation Controller. Madras and the person whom he replaced was posted as Director of Fisheries, Madras. The appellant's appointment was made on the same grade pay which be was then drawing plus certain special allowances. The appellant moved a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution challenging the two orders of January 25 and January 30, 1964.
 While the petition before the High Court was pending, by another order dated June 6, 1964 the temporary post of Accommodation Controller which earlier existed in the cadre of Deputy Secretary (Non I.A.S.), was kept in abeyance with effect from February 6, 1964 and a new temporary post of Accommodation Controller, Madras, was sanctioned in the same grade as that of the appellant and it was directed that the appellant he deemed to have acted in that post from February 6, 1964 to April 14, 1964. The appellant then moved another writ petition challenging this order. A single Bench of the High Court dismissed the two petitions. While the appeals were pending before a Division Bench, the Court was informed through a letter from the Government to its counsel that when the post of I.G.R. was included in the I.A.S. service cadre, the Government had decided that in order to protect the 'rights of the appellant, a supernumerary. post of I.G.R. should be created with effect from November 11, 1963.
 Taking notice of this letter the High Court dismissed the appeals holding that all the rights of the appellants in respect of pension and gratuity had been protected and there had been no removal from service or reduction in rank in the case of the appellant. By orders dated October 6, 1966,and February 10, 1967, the supernumerary post of I.G.I. was sanctioned up to such :time as the appellant was confirmed in another post.
 In the appeal before this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant (i) that by transferring him and posting him as Accommodation Controller he had been reduced in rank without complying with the provisions of Art. 311 of the Constitution; the I.G.R. was declared head of 3 Department while the Accommodation Controller was not head of a department; the post of Accommodation Controller was held by an officer who, on relief by the appellant, was promoted to the post created in. the grade of a Deputy Secretary and from this it must be inferred that 628 the post of Accommodation Controller was lower in rank than the post of a Deputy Secretary, whereas the post of I.G.R.
 was a rank higher than that of a Deputy Secretary; (ii) that while the appellant was holding the post of I.G.R. he had a lien on a permanent post, but, when he was sent to the post of Accommodation Controller, the appellant was left without a lion on any permanent post and that would necessarily deprive him of his rights. to pension and gratuity which would amount to his removal from service as a punishment;
 and (iii) that the post of I.G.R. had been placed in the cadre of I.A.S. in the State of Madras only and in no other State and, as a consequence, the appellant lost his appoint- ment to that post due to the unequal treatment.
 HELD: Dismissing the appeal :
 (i) The mere fact that the post of Accommodation Controller to which the appellant had been transferred was not designated the post of a head of department did not necessarily involve any 'reduction in rank. It is well known that a Government service, there may be senior posts, the holders of which are not declared heads of department while persons holding comparatively junior posts may be declared as such. Furthermore, there was no reduction in rank of the appellant for it was clear, on the facts, that the Post of I.G.R. was not higher in rank but lower than that of a Deputy Secretary. In fact the post was equated with that of an Assistant Secretary. [631H-632B, G] (ii) The mere transfer of the appellant to the post of Accommodation Controller did not have the effect of his removal from his service; although it was true that when the order of his transfer was initially passed on January 30, 1964 no provision was made for his retaining a lien on any permanent post, this position was eventually corrected when a supernumerary post of I.G.R. was created from November 11, 1963 and it was laid down that it would exist until such time as the appellant was confirmed in another post. It could not be said that this supernumery post was a temporary post within the meaning of Rule 9(30); it was a permanent post within Rule 9(22) of the Fundamental Rules of the Madras Government for it had been created for an indefinite period and was to continue in existence as long as the appellant held it and was not confirmed in any other post.
 [633B-C; 634F-F] (iii) Under Rule 4(1) of the Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954, framed under the All India Service Act 61 of 1951, the strength and composition of the cadre of the I.A.S. constituted for a State are to be determined by Regulations made by the Central Government in consultation with the State Governments. Depending on the conditions in each State, the Government may consider it desirable that a particular post should be placed on the Cadre of the I.A.S. in one State but not in another. The order of the Central Government cannot therefore be held to be void on the ground of discrimination. [634G-H: 635B-C]
