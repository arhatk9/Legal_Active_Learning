 The appellant, a member of the joint Hindu family, in her individual capacity and with the aid of her personal assets entered into a partnership with her father-in-law in the name and style of "Gur Narain Jagat Narain & Co." Her minor son, Ravi Narain Khanna was admitted to the benefits of that partnership. The partnership firm owned two cinema houses- Nishat Talkies, Kanpur and Novelty Talkies, Lucknow. On August 31, 1961, a sum of Rs. 67,284.57 stood to the credit of the appellant in the books of Nishat Talkies being her individual share of the income from that Talkies. On September 1, 1961, the appellant made a sworn declaration stating that she was the sole and absolute owner of the amounts standing to her credit in the books of Nishat Talkies and of her share in that business and declaring unequivocally her intention to treat both the capital and her share in the business of Nishat Talkies as the joint family property of the Hindu undivided family of which she Was a member. By clause (6) of the declaration, the appellant stated that she had abandoned for ever her separate interest and ownership over the capital investment of Rs. 67,284.57, her one-third share in the net profits and 1/3rd share in the net losses in the business of Nishat Talkies in favour of the joint Hindu family to be solely and exclusively enjoyed by it. As such, in her tax return for the assessment year 1963764 for which the previous accounting year ended on August 31, 1962, she omitted a sum of Rs. 20,865/- being 1/3rd share of the income from the business of Nishat Talkies for the year in question on the ground that the said sum was credited to the account of the joint Hindu family in the books of the firm as per the declaration dated September 1, 1961 and the Hindu undivided family has also paid advance tax on the said amount. The Income Tax Officer in his assessment order held that the individual share of the income is exigible to tax since throwing the capital amount into the family stock was of no avail as the sine qua non of the matter was that "the Karta should become partner in consequence of investment' " On appeal, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner affirmed the order of the I.T.O. and held (i) the appellant, not being a copartner, it was not open to her to impress her personal property with a character of joint family property; and (ii) as the joint family did not possess any joint family property there was no joint family stock in which the appellant could throw her separate property. But, in further appeal, the Appellate Tribunal accepted the appellant's contention and held that there was no justification for discriminating against a Hindu female on the ground of sex and that there was no reason why a Hindu female who was a member of an undivided family could not by an unequivocal expression of intention impress her separate property with the character of joint family property, so long as she was not trying to enlarge her rights under the Hindu law or to improve her status under that law by abandoning her exclusive right in the self-acquired property. On a reference, the Delhi High Court disagreed with the Tribunal and answered the question in favour of the Revenue on the ground that the right of blending could be exercised only by a coparcener and since the appellant, though a member of the joint family was not a coparcener she could not throw her separate property into joint family stock. 'The High Court, however, rejected the contention of the Revenue that since the joint family did not possess any property no member thereof could blend hi-, separate property with joint family property. In appeal by certificate granted by the High Court under s. 261 of the Income Tax Act. 1961, by a judgment dated September 24, 1976, this Court directed the Tribunal to send a supplementary statement in the case on the question "Whether there was a gift of the appellant's capital investment and her share in the business of Nishat 330 Talkies in favour of the Hindu undivided family?" Pursuant to the directions of this Court, the Tribunal further found by its order dated 31st January 1977 that there was a gift by the appellant in favour of joint family and that the latter had accepted that gift.
 Allowing the appeal partly, the Court, 
HELD : (1) The true rule of blending is that the right to blend is limited to coparceners only. It is the coparcener who alone can blend his separate property with joint family property and the said right is not available to a female who though a member of joint family is not a coparcener.
 Whether that separate property is the female's absolute property or whether she has a limited state in that property would make no difference to that position. 1335A, E-F] Mallesappa Bandappa Desai and Ors. v. Desai Mallappa & Ors., [1961] INSC 39; 1961 (3) SCR 779. applied.

 (2) The theory of blending under the Hindu Law involves the process of a wider sharing of one's own properties by permitting the members of one's joint family the privilege of common ownership and common enjoyment of such properties.
 But, while introducing. new sharers in one's exclusive property one does not by the process of blending efface oneself by renouncing one's own interest in favour of others. To blend is to share along with others and not to surrender one's interest in favour of others to the exclusion of oneself. If a Hindu female who is a member of an undivided family impresses her absolute exclusive property with the character of joint family property, she creates new the exclusion of herself because not being a to demand a share in the joint family She has no right for survivorship and is of the joint family property. Her right to property is contingent, inter alia, on a husband and his sons. Under s. 3 (2) and claimants to her property to coparcener she has no right property by asking for a partition. entitled only to be maintained out demand a share in the joint family partition taking place between her (3) of the Hindu Women's Right to Property Act, 1937, her right to demand a partition in the joint family property of the Mitakshara joint family accrued on the death of her husband.
 Thus, the expression 'blending' is inapposite in the case of a Hindu female who puts her separate property, be it her absolute property or limited estate, in the joint family stock.
 (3) In the instant case :
 (i) the income of Rs. 21,544/- from Nishat Talkies was not assessable in the hands of a Hindu undivided family on the basis that the appellant had blended it with the joint family property;
 (ii) the appellant must be deemed to have made a gift of the items mentioned in her declaration dt. September 1, 1961 to the undivided family of which she was a member.
 The income of the property gifted to the Hindu undivided family will be liable to be brought to tax in accordance with law.
 (iii) The High Court is not quite correct in the unqualified statement it has made in its order granting certificate to the appellant to appeal to this Court that this question is res integra. [333F, 337A-D, F-G]
