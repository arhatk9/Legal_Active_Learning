 On August 6, 1980 the car in which the detenu was travelling was intercepted by Customs Officers and on a search of the car, wrist watches of foreign origin and semi- precious stones valued at Rs.2.95 lakhs were found ingeniously concealed in the panelling of the front doors and the cavity between the petrol tank and the steel plate covering the petrol tank. The goods were seized by the Customs Officers alongwith the Car. On 7.8.1980 the detenu was interrogated and a statement was recorded which incriminated himself and others. He was taken before the Magistrate on 8.8. 1980 and was remanded to custody. On 12.8.1980 he was granted bail. On 14.8.80 the detenu was stated to have sent a communication addressed to the Assistant Collector of Customs, in which, according to him, he retracted from the statement made by him on 7.8.80 and claimed that the statement had been obtained by torturing him.
 On 31.10.80. the first respondent made an order of preventive detention against the detenu under Section 3(1) of the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of smuggling Activities Act 1974. The order of detention and the grounds of detention were served on 2.2.81, as the detenu was avoiding service and arrest. The detenu made a representation on 4.2.81, which was rejected by the detaining authority, the first respondent on 19.2.1981.
 648 In the writ petition to this Court it was contended on behalf of detenu : (1) that as material documents viz.
 record of investigation revealing the trunk telephone calls and the record of investigation relating to the petrol which was put into the jeep owned by the brother of the detenu, upon which reliance was placed in the order of detention were not supplied to the detenu along with the grounds of detention, the detenu was thereby prevented from making an effective representation and denied the Fundamental Right guaranteed under Article 22(5). (2) The detaining authority was under obligation to supply alongwith the grounds, copies of all documents to which reference was made in the grounds irrespective of whether such documents were not relied upon in making the order of detention. (3). Although the detenu had retracted from his alleged original statement dated 7.8.80 long before the order of detention was made, the fact of such retraction was not considered by the detaining authority (4). There was considerable delay in the disposal of the representation by the detaining authority and this was sufficient to vitiate the detention, (5). The detaining authority did not apply his mind to the representation which made an express reference to the retraction, (6). The detaining authority had failed to consider the question whether a prosecution under the ordinary criminal law would not suffice to prevent the detenu from indulging in the alleged activities and whether preventive detention was necessary in the circumstances of the case.
 Dismissing the petition the Court, ^ 
 HELD : 1. (i) A perusal of the grounds of detention reveal that neither the record of Trunk Calls nor the record of investigation relating to the petrol put into the jeep were in any manner relied upon by the detaining authority in making the order of detention. [652 C] (ii) The reference to the record of trunk calls was made for the purpose of verifying the trunk call which was received in the premises when the customs officers were there. The reference to the record of investigation relating to the petrol put into the jeep was to refute the statement of the detenu's brother that the jeep was not used during the previous year and was in the garage. [651 G, 651 E, 653 D] 
 2. (i) The Constitutional requirement of Article 22(5) is insistence that basic facts and particulars which influenced the detaining authority in arriving at the requisite satisfaction must be communicated to the detenu so that the detenu may have an opportunity of making an effective representation against the order of detention.
 Every failure to furnish copy of a document to which reference is made in the grounds of detention is not an infringement of Art. 22 (5), fatal to the order of detention. It is only a failure to furnish copies of such documents as were relied upon by the detaining authority making it difficult for the detenu to make an effective representation that amounts to violation of the fundamental right guaranteed by Article 22(5). [652 H-653 B] 
 2. (ii) It is unnecessary to furnish copies of documents to which casual or passing reference may be made in the course of narration of facts and which are not relied upon by the detaining authority in making the order of detention.

The State of West Bengal, [1974] INSC 251; [1975] 2 SCR 832 @ 848, 849, referred to.
 In the instant case the two documents cannot be said to be documents which were relied upon by the detaining authority in making the order of detention. Therefore, the detenu could not properly complain that he was prevented from making an effective representation. There was no violation of the right guaranteed by Art. 22 of the Constitution. [653 D] 3(i). If the detenu was serious in his request that his retraction should be considered by the detaining authority while considering his representation one would expect him to send a copy of the letter of retraction alongwith his representation instead of a copy of the certificate of posting. [654 A] (ii) The Certificate of posting might lead to a presumption that a letter addressed to the Assistant Collector of Customs was posted on 14.8.1980 and in due course reached the addressee. But, that is only a permissible and not an inevitable presumption. [654 E] (iii) Neither Section 16 nor section 114 of the Evidence Act compels the Court to draw a presumption that a letter proved to be posted has reached the addressee. The presumption may or may not be drawn. On the facts and circumstances of a case, the Court may refuse to draw the presumption. [654 F] In the instant case, the alleged letter of retraction was only a myth. No such letter of retraction was posted as claimed by the detenu. [654 E, G] 
 4. The representation made by the detenu has to be considered by the detaining authority with utmost expedition but the time imperative can never be absolute or obsessive.
 The occasional observations made by this Court that each day's delay in the dealing with the representation must be adequately explained are meant to emphasise the expedition with which the representation must be considered and not that it is a magical formula, the slightest breach of which must result in the release of the detenu. Law deals with the facts of life. In law, as in life, there are no invariable absolutes. Neither life nor law can be reduced to mere but despotic formulae. [655 B-C] Pritam Nath Hoon v.

 In the instant case the representation was despatched on 5.2.1981 and was received in the office of the detaining authority on 13.2.1981. It was put up before the detaining authority on 19.2.81 and disposed of that very day. The detaining authority was not available from 13th to 16th as he had gone abroad. He returned on 16th and considered the matter on 19th. There has not been any unaccountable or unreasonable delay in the disposal of the representation by the detaining authority. [655 D-G] 650 
 5. The note file shows that the detaining authority also considered the question whether the alleged letter of retraction was posted. [656 B] 
 6. A reading of the entire counter-affidavit makes it clear that in the opinion of the detaining authority prosecution or no prosecution, the only effective way of preventing the detenu from engaging himself in objectionable activities was to detain him. [656 G-H]
