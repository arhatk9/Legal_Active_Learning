 The U. P. Civil Laws (Reforms and Amendment) Act, 1954, amended s. 21 (1) (c) of the Bengal, Agra and Assam Civil Courts Act, 1887, so as to enable the District Courts to hear first appeals valued up to Rupees ten thousand and by s. 3 (1) provided that any proceeding instituted or commenced in "any court prior to the commencement of this Act, shall, not withstanding any amendment herein made continue to be heard and decided by such Court." The appellant brought a suit in the Civil judges court for possession of certain properties.That suit was dismissed on November 27, 1951. He preferred a first appeal to the High Court on February 8,1952. That appeal; was transferred under s. 24 (1) (a) of the Code of Civil Procedure by the Chief Justice in Chambers and without notice to the parties, to the District judge of Allahabad for hearing. The appellant appeared before that Court and raised a preli- minary objection as to the jurisdiction of that court to hear the appeal. The objection was overruled. The appellant moved the High Court under Art. 226. Single judge who heard the petition dismissed it in limine relying on a decision of the Division Bench. Appeal against the decision was summarily dismissed by the Division Bench.
 Held, that under s. 3 (1) of the Act, the High Court alone was Competent to hear the appeal pending before it; and by transferring the same to the District Court it had failed to give effect to the concluding words of the section.
 Section 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure postulates that the Court to which an appeal is transferred must be competent 363 to dispose of it. In the face of s. 3 (1) of the Act, the District Court was not competent to hear the appeal.
 Although the object of the Act was to give relief to the High Court, it was clear that the Legislature did not grant that relief in respect of pending first appeals.
 Held, further, that no costs can ordinarily be granted against a court and the High Court was in error in doing so.
 Sarjudei v. Rampati Kunwari, 1962 All. L. J. 544 and Cyril Spencer v. M. H. Spencer, 1955 All. L. J. 307, considered.
