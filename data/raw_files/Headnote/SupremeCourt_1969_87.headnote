 The appellant was the tenant of the respondent Wakf. The respondent obtained a decree for arrears of rent against the appellant but failed to execute it by attachment of crops as they had already been removed by the appellant. The respondent then made an application under s. 168 of the U.P.
 Tenancy Act, 1939 praying that the amount of the decree be got paid under that section or, in default of payment, the appellant may be dispossessed. Objections were raised by the appellant to this application but they were, ultimately rejected by the Assistant Collector. The District Judge allowed the appeal against the Assistant Collector's order.
 In further appeal by the respondent, the High Court held that proceedings under s. 168 were proceedings in the original suit and not in execution and therefore no appeal lay to the District Judge under s. 271(2) of the Act.
 Against the High Court's decision; the appellant, by special leave, came to this Court.
 
HELD : An examination of the scheme of s. 168 shows that an application under that section is a step in the execution, discharge, or satisfaction of the decree. The fact that the application is to the court which passed the decree does not necessarily show that the order passed on the application is not one relating to the execution, discharge or satisfaction of the decree, for under s. 38 of the Civil Procedure Code a decree may be executed either by the Court which passed it, or by the court to which it is sent for execution. [50A-D] While s. 168 deals with a decree for arrears of rent against an ex-proprietary, an occupancy or hereditary tenant, s. 170 of the Act deals with a decree passed for arrears of rent against a non-occupancy tenant. A similar application is provided for in s. 170 and the legislature clearly con- templates that this is a mode of execution for it uses the words "the landholder may, in addition to, any other mode of execution, apply to the court which passed the decree for issue of a notice." A mode similar to the mode or proceeding under s. 168 is thus treated as a mode of execution. [50D-E] The High Court therefore erred in holding that the appeal to the District Judge was incompetent on the ground that the order under s. 168 was not one relating to the execution, discharge or satisfaction of the decree.
