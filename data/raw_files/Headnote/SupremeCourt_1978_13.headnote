HELD : 1. Unless there is some substantial error in the judgment of the High Court, Supreme Court would not interfere in special leave on the findings ,of fact which has been arrived at by the, High Court on the relevant material. [613 A-B] 2.All the decisions of this Court u/s 540 Crl. P.C., 1898 indicate that the main test is to determine whether the evidence is necessary "for the just decision of the case".
 [613 F] In the instant case:- (a)The evidence of PW Dhannu and PW Zinat was not material and would not help, in proving the case, especially when even in their affidavits both did not allege that they were not examined by the Police or that the statements taken down by the Police were wrongly recorded or that they made no statement before the police supporting the case. On the contrary, their statements were recorded by the Police on 1- 8-67. Even if these witnesses were allowed to be examined by the High Court and had deposed in favour of the accused, ,they would have been confronted with the previous statement made before the police which would have rendered their testimony wholly contradictory and discrepant. Their examination in the High Court would have amounted to an ,exercise in futility. [613 A, C, D] (b)It would have been better if Ramagopal the constable would have been examined before the Sessions Court, but his non-examination does not Put the prosecution case out of Court and his evidence was not necessary for the just decision of the case and [613 G] (c)there is no error of law in the judgment of the High Court so as to justify any interference. [613 G]
