 The State Government of Bihar followed the procedure prescribed by the Bihar Agricultural Produce Markets Act, 1960, and the Bihar Agricultural Produce Market Rules, 1962, before issuing the necessary notifications for regulating the purchase and sale of certain items of agricultural produce and for establishing a market for them in the Gaya area of the :State. Under s. 18(ii) of the Act no person can do business as a trader -or other operator in the notified agricultural produce in a market except under a licence granted by the market committee on payment of the prescribed licence fees,.
 The validity of the notifications declaring the market area and -establishing the market for the notified agricultural produce and the legality of the levy of market fees and licence fees were questioned on the following grounds. (1) the area declared to be the market area was too wide; (2) the market committee had not established any market within a well-defined site with market equipment and facilities; (3) the fees levied by the market committee were in the nature of taxes as the committee did not render any services to the users of the market and therefore the levy was illegal; (4) the setting up of a market in Gaya was discriminatory .and violative of Art. 14 as the Act and Rules had not been implemented in all parts of Bihar.
 
HELD : (1) The power of the State Government under s. 4(1) of declaring an area or part of it to be a market area in respect of a notified agricultural produce, after considering any objections and suggestions received by it, should no doubt be exercised reasonably; But, there is nothing to show that the Government acted unreasonably or that the market was so wide that the sale and purchase of agricultural produce within it could not be effectively controlled by the market committee or that the growers within the area could not conveniently bring their produce to the market yards. [539 D-E] (2) For establishing a market it is sufficient to issue a notification ,under s. 5(2) fixing the boundaries of the 'market proper' and the 'market -yards' on the recommendation of the market committee made under r. 59(2).
 The definition of 'market' does not require a well-defined site with market equipment and facilities. Under s. 18(1), the market committee must provide such facilities as the State Government may direct, but it was not shown that the market committee refused to carry out any -such direction.
 Under ss. 28(2) and 30(i) the market committee may acquire and own lands and buildings for the market, but it is not obliged to do so. [539 F-H] 535 (3) The fees collected by the market committee were not excessive and formed part of the market committee fund which was set apart and ear-marked for the purposes of the Act such as elimination of unhealthy market practices, ensuring correct weighment and grading, quick settlement of disputes, dissemination of information regarding prices of agri- cultural produce etc. There is therefore, sufficient quid pro quo for the levies add they satisfy the test of 'fees'.

 (4)The State Government is not bound to implement the Act and the Rules in all parts of Bihar at the same time. It may establish markets regulating the sale and purchase of agricultural produce in different parts of Bihar gradually and from time to time. [540 F-G]
