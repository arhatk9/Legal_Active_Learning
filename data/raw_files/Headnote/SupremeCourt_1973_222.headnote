 In the trial u/s 302 read with s. 34 I. P. C., one Sopan was convicted on the evidence of one Sudam, the only eye- witness. Sudam admitted in his cross-examination that neither before the Executive Magistrate nor before the Committing Magistrate, he stated that Sopan had beaten the deceased with Rumana and that he bad stated the fact for the first time before the trial Magistrate. Sudam also admitted that Sopan did nothing and was simply standing there. Sudam also stated that he could watch the incident for a very short time as he himself was threatened by the accused and, therefore, ran away. The F.I.R. and dying declarations also did not mention the part played by Sopan in the incident.
 The trial Court acquitted all the accused but the High Court convicted them. As regards the omissions in Sudam's evidence, the High Court held, following Tahsildar's case, that the omissions do not amount to contradictions and cannot be proved to show that the witness was. making improvements. The High Court, therefore, ignored the omissions.
 Allowing Sopan's appeal (but not of the other two accused), 
HELD . (i) We do not think that s. 145 of the Evidence Act, on the very reasoning of Tahsildar Singh's case, cited by the High Court, was intended to exclude from, evidence what is relevant and admitted, and, therefore, a proved omission from having its due effect in the assessment of probabilities. S. 145 of Evidence Act applies only to 'contradictions.' If there are omissions in Previous statements which do not amount to contradictions but throw some doubt on the veracity of what was omitted, the uncertainty or doubt may be capable of removal by questions in reexamination. There were no such questions put to Sudam. Neither proof nor use of such omissions, which do not amount to contradictions is barred by s. 145 of the Evidence Act. The error the High Court had committed was that it entirely excluded very important, relevant and material omissions, from duly proved previous statements of the witness Sudam from consideration altogether as though they were quite irrelevant and in-consequential. [51 OF] It is not possible to lay down a general rule as to what effect a particular omission from previous statement should have on the probative value of what was so omitted by a witness. The effect will depend upon the totality of proved facts and circumstances in which the omission might have taken place. It will often be determined by the importance of what was omitted. The Law of Evidence contains nothing more than s. 3 and s. 114 of the Evidence Act to indicate and illustrate the standards and methods employed in assessing the evidence. [510H] (ii)The High Court ought to have examined the evidence of Sudam, the only eye-witness, in the light of the material omissions and found out how much Sudam actually saw with his own eyes and how much of what he said could be attributed to his conjecture, surmise or imagination. Sopan is entitled to benefit of the doubt, which emerges on an examination of the whole evidence in the case about the precise acts of participation by him. 1513D]
