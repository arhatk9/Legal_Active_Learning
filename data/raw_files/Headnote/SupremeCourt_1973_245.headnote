 Section 20(3) (b) of the Act lays down that the Government may, by notification, exempt from the payment of tax any factory which in the opinion of the Government, has substantially expanded to the extent of such expansion for a period not exceeding two years from the date of completion of the expansion. The Andhra Pradesh Government took a policy decision to grant exemption from payment of purchase tax to new and expanded sugar factories in the cooperative sector only due to present financial position of the Government. In pursuance of the said policy, the exemption was granted for one year from the payment of tax to the cooperative societies of growers of sugarcane. The benefit of the exemption was refused to the appellant and other joint stock companies running the sugar factories. On behalf of the appellant it was contended that the Government could not by laying down a policy to exempt only cooperative sugar factories fetter their hands from examining the merits of each individual case. It was also contended that the policy behind sec. 21(3) being to encourage new sugar facto- ries or expanded factories the Government could not refuse to consider all except one class, that is, the cooperative sugar factories, for the purpose of granting exemption. It was further urged that new sugar factories aid expanded sugar factories all fall into one class and there is nothing particular or special about cooperative sugar factories justifying their treatment as a special class deserving a special treatment. The State of Andhra Pradesh contended that it had full discretion to decide the policy in granting the exemption and that cooperative sugar factories consisting of cane growers is a distinct category justifying their treatment as a class separate from other sugar factories. On facts it was asserted by the State that the exemption was granted only to new cooperative sugar factories and that too only for one year. It was also asserted that the case of the appellants was individually considered and rejected on merits.
 Dismissing the appeal and writ petitions, the majority of the Court, HELD:Per A. N. Ray, C.J., H. R. Khanna and A.
 Alagiriswami, JJ (1) The purpose of the Act is to encourage new sugar factories and expanded sugar factories. But how that power is to be exercised will have to be decided by taking into consideration all the relevant factors relating to the sugar industry. It is well known that there is a difference in the sycrose content in the cane produced in different areas. At one period the industry may be in a very prosperous condition and might not need the exemption.
 It may also be that factories in a particular area are in need of this concession but not factories in another area.
 We are therefore of opinion that it would be open to the State Government to grant exemption to new factories only but not the expanded factories, to grant the exemption for one year instead of three years or two years as contemplated under the Section, to grant the exemption to factories in one area but not to factories in another area, to grant the exemption during a particular period but not during another period. [791 H-792 C] (II)The cooperative sugar factories consisting of sugarcane growers fall under a distinct category different from other categories and the Government is justified in treating the cooperative sugar factories as a distinct class for the pur- poses of the protection and concessions, considering their contribution to the sizable sugar industry now built up in this country. [792 C-D] 788 (III)There is no reason to reject the statement on behalf of the State of Andhra Pradesh that they had considered the request of the appellant as well as of the petitioners on their merits and that the exemption had been granted only to new cooperative factories for the short period of one year only.

 Per minority (Mathew and Bhagwati, JJ.) :,Picking out cooperative societies of sugarcane growers for favoured treatment to the exclusion of other new or substantially expanded industries is wholly unrelated to the object of the exempting provision and the policy or rule adopted by the State Government is legally not relevant to the exercise of the power of granting exemption. Considering the object of sub-section (b) of Sec. 21 (3), there is no distinction between a factory established by a cooperative society consisting of sugarcane growers or a company or a firm whose share holders and partners are sugarcane growers. The classification made by the policy or rule must not be arbitrary but must have a rational relation to the object of the exempting provision. The Government, by making the policy decision, had shut its ears to the merits of the individual applications, That the exemption is granted to few cooperative factories and for a short time are not relevant considerations.
