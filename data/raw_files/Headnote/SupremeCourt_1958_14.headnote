 Section 24(1) of the Bombay Rents Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947, provides: " No landlord either himself or through any person acting or purporting to act on his behalf shall without just or sufficient cause cut off or withhold any essential supply or service enjoyed by the tenant in respect of the premises let to him." By Explanation 11 : " For the purposes of this section, withholding any essential supply or service shall include acts or omissions attributable to the landlord on account of which the essential supply or service is cut off by the local authority or any other competent authority." The appellant was prosecuted under S. 24 of the Bombay Rents Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947, on a complaint by the tenant, the first respondent, on June 14, 1954, for having refused or neglected to have water connection made for the premises. The water supply to the premises was cut off by the Municipality in 1947 due to the default in payment of the municipal taxes by the predecessor-in-title of the appellant, but the tenants, including the first respondent, continued in occupation of the premises without having the use of municipal water supply. It was contended for the appellant that his conviction was invalid because (1) he was not liable for the default made by his predecessor-in-title, and (2) in any case, s. 24 was not applicable inasmuch as the supply of municipal water was not enjoyed by the first respondent when the Act came into force:
 1395 Held: (1) that though the appellant might not have been directly responsible for the cutting off of the supply of municipal water, it was within his power to get the supply restored by the Municipality on payment of the prescribed fee and in so far as he omitted to do so, such an omission was attributable to him within Explanation 11 of s. 24 of the Act, and therefore he was withholding an essential supply within the meaning of S. 24(1) Of the Act;
 (2) that under S. 24 Of the Act the essential supply should have been available for the use of the tenant at some time when the Act was in force, and as, in the instant case, the first respondent was not in enjoyment of the supply of municipal water at any time after the coming into effect of Act, the appellant could not be convicted under that section.
