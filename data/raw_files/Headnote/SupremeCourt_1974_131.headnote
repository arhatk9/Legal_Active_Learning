 The appellant's predecessor, who was one of the intermediaries of certain villages filed a suit for partition and a preliminary decree was passed therein. In 1950, the Bihar Land Reforms Act came into force and all these villages vested in the State. The parties entered into a compromise but the State was not a party to it. A final decree was passed by the trial court in terms of the compromise. In appeal, the High Court set aside the final decree on the ground that the suit had become infructuous as the plaintiff had no right in law to the properties, including the mines, which were the subject matter of the suit, as they had all vested in the State; and that, from the date of vesting, the original title of the proprietor completely vanished and a new title had come into existence.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) The judgment of the High Court should be modified to the extent that there will be a final decree in favour of the appellant in respect of bakhast and zirat lands subject to laws regarding ceiling on lands in force in the State.
 [596 A-D] Bhubaneshwar v. Sideshwar [1971] 3 S. C. R. 639, followed.
 (2)The High Court was in error in holding that the benefit of s. 9 of the Bihar Land Reforms Act is not available to persons jointly interested in the mines before the date of vesting and that it is restricted only to the intermediary directly working the mines. Even though under s. 9 all mines which were in operation at the commencement of the Act and were being worked directly by the intermediary shall be deemed to have been leased by the State to the intermediary, the appellant, as a co-sharer, would be entitled to a share in such mines on the principle of Bhubaneshwar's case. It would not, however, be possible to give effect to the consent decree passed by the trial court in respect of the mines. Nor would it be possible to pass a final decree in respect of bakhast and zirat lands in favour of the plaintiff and then leave the preliminary decree in respect of mines untouched leaving the plaintiff to put in a fresh application for final decree in respect of mines, as the subject is too complicated to be dealt with in the final decree proceedings. Hence, though the High Court was in error in holding that the appellant was not entitled to any share in the mines unless he was himself directly working them, the appellant will have to work out the remedies in respect of Mines by It separate suit. [594 C-595H] (a)The appellant would be entitled to take possession of a share in such mines only as a lessee from the State Government. But the terms and conditions of the lease would have to be agreed upon between the State Government and the intermediary or have to be settled by the Mines Tribunal.
 [595 A-B] (b)Further, if an intermediary had opened mines in a corner of a large area and was working it on the date of vesting it would not mean that he would be entitled to a mining lease in respect of the entire area. Therefore, the area to be covered by the lease will have to be decided under s. 12 in the light of the provisions of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957. [595 B-C] (c)Moreover, under s. 10 of the Bihar Land Reforms Act, where there is a subsisting lease of mines and minerals comprised in the estate the whole or that part of the estate comprised in such lease, shall be deemed to have been leased by the State Government to the holder of the subsisting lease for the remainder of the term of that lease,, and the appellant would not have any, right in such mines. [595 C-E] (d)But there is no material on record as to what mines were in operation who among the co-sharers of the appellant were working the mines, and if so to what extent, on the date of the vesting in the State.
