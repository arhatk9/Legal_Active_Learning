 The joint Hindu family comprising of the appellants and some others, carried on business in groceries at Harunabad, now in Pakistan. The respondent-Bank had advanced loans to the business. On the setting up of the Dominion& of India and Pakistan, riots broke out in Harunabad, and the business was closed and the members of the family residing at Harunabad migrated to India. The Bank filed a suit against all the members of the family for the amount due. The members then applied to the Tribunal set up under the Displaced Persons (Debts Adjustment) Act, 1951 and the Bank's suit was 'also transferred to the Tribunal. The Tribunal held that all members of the family were displaced debtors and on appeal, the High Court held that the appellants were not displaced debtors.
 
HELD,: One of the appellants had established his status as a displaced debtor.
 For a person to be a displaced debtor under the Act it is not necessary that he must have before migration to India a place of residence only in the territory which later was included in Pakistan, and had no place of residence in the territory which is now in India. The words of the defi- nition in s. 2(10) read with s. 2(6) are sufficiently wide to include the law of a person who had a place of residence in India as a place of residence in an area now forming part of Pakistan, provided that -such a person was displaced from the latter residence because of the setting up of two dominions or on account of civil disturbances or fear of such disturbances. [321 F, G] The expression 'Place of residence' connotes a place where a person has his dwelling house which need not necessarily be permanent or exclusive. [321 A] The 'displacement' contemplated by the Act is the displacements the person and not of the business. [323 E]
