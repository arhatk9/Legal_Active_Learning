 On February 27, 1968, a worker in the appellant's factory sustained an injury and a report of the accident was sent to the Inspector of Factories on February 28. The report indicated that the accident took place when the worker was cleaning a dangerous part of machinery and that, that part of the machinery was moved by mechanical power. But the report did not state that the dangerous parts of the machinery were not in such position or of such construction as to be safe to every person employed in the factory as they would be if they were securely fenced, nor was it stated that dangerous parts of the machinery were not securely fenced by safeguards of substantial construction or that they were not kept in position while the parts of the machinery they were fencing, were in motion or in use. The Inspector inquired into the accident on July 30, 1968 and filed a complaint for an offence under s. 21 (iv) (c) of the Factories Act, 1948. The appellant contended that the prosecution was barred by time under s. 106 of the Act, which provides that no Court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under the Act unless the complaint thereof is made within 3 months of the date on which the alleged commission of the offence came to the knowledge of the Inspector. The Magistrate dismissed the complaint, but the High Court set aside the order, on the ground that the Inspector got knowledge of the commission of Pin offence only on the date of the enquiry and not from the report.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) It would be difficult for any. one reading the report of the accident to come to the conclusion that an offence under s. 21 (i) (iv) (c) had been committed, as it did not reveal the necessary elements that constitute the offence. Knowledge of the accident is not knowledge of an offence, and the Inspector gained knowledge of the commission of the offence only on July 30, 1968 when he made the enquiry. [717C-E] (2)In interpreting a provision in a statute prescribing a period of limitation for instituting a proceeding, questions of equity and hardship are out of place. As s. 106 makes the date of knowledge of the commission of the offence the starting point of the period of limitation, it is difficult to read the section so as to make the date on which the Inspector would or ought to have acquired knowledge of the commission of the offence, bad he been diligent, the starting point of limitation especially when the statute does not provide for an inquiry into the accident or the period within which the inquiry has to be made.
