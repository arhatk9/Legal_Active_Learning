 The appellant, entered into an agreement with the first respondent on December 11, 1986 for construction of sewer line. On June 27, 1988 he requested the Chairman to refer the dispute to arbitration as per the preliminary specification of the A.P. Standard specifications. As the first respondent refused to settle the claims, the appellant sent a claim petition dated October 3, 1988 to the named arbitrator. He sent a reminder but the named arbitrator did not enter the reference. The appellant gave further notice dated January 5, 1989 calling upon the first respondent to concur for the appointment of an arbitrator to adjudicate the disputes and differences arising between the parties.
 On January 18, 1989 the first respondent informed the appellant that there was no arbitration clause in the agreement between the parties, so the question of entertaining the request to appoint an arbitrator did not arise. The appellant then riled an application in the Civil Court praying 629 630 for removal of the named arbitrator in the agreement and appointment of the sole arbitrator in his place.
 The respondent contested the application contending that the appellant completed only a part of the work within the stipulated time though the site was handed over to him. But the accounts were settled before the completion of work and the final bill of the appellant was paid, while the balance of work was got completed through other agencies. The respondent also contended that the original agreement signed between the parties did not provide for any arbitration clause and such fact was known to the appellant.
 The Civil Court found that the agreement did not contain any arbitration clause. However, it held that the agreement was silent about the mode of settlement of the disputes, if any, while every agreement of civil contract contains an arbitration clause. However, since there was clause 3 in the copy of the agreement supplied to the appellant sub- sequently under a covering letter with the seal and signature of the second respondent, which provided for reference to arbitration in accordance with standard specification and since the copy of agreement was not fabricated by the appellant, the respondents were bound by the arbitration clause.
 The respondents had neglected to refer the matter to arbitration despite the agreement, so the civil court appointed the sole arbitrator.
 The respondents assailed the order of the civil court in Civil Revision before the High Court. The High Court also found that the original agreement did not contain any arbitration agreement at all. Since there was no arbitration clause in the original agreement, it was not necessary to consider other material or circumstances. The High Court rejected the contention that the existence of such a clause should be assumed because the government contractors were governed by the standard specification.
 Therefore the High Court set aside the order appointing the arbitrator.
 This Court granted special leave to appeal to the appellant and on consideration of respective contentions of the parties, this Court dismissing the appeal.
 
HELD:Only an arbitration agreement in writing is- recognised under 631 the Arbitration Act, 1940. [635-G] Law is well settled that arbitration clause may be incorporated by reference to a specific document which is in existence and whose terms are easily ascertainable.
 However, the question whether or not the arbitration clause contained in another document has been incorporated in the contract, is always a question of construction.[636 C-D] The arbitration clause is quite distinct from the other clauses of the contract. While other clauses of agreement impose obligation which the parties undertake towards each other, arbitration clause does not impose on any of the parties any obligation in favour of the other party. Such arbitration agreement embodies an agreement between the parties that in case of dispute, such dispute shall be settled by arbitrator or umpire of their own constitution or by an arbitrator to be appointed by the court in appropriate cases. [636-E] There is a material difference in an arbitration agreement inasmuch as in an ordinary contract the obligations of the parties to each other cannot be specifically enforced and breach of such terms of contract results only in damages, but the arbitration clause can be specifically enforced by the machinery of the Arbitration. Act. While the courts have discretionary power of dispensation of a valid arbitration agreement, there is no such power of dispensation of other terms of contract. An arbitration agreement in no way classifies the right of the parties under the contract but it relates wholly to the mode of determining the rights. [636 F-H, 637 A] In the instant case, it is the specific finding of the High Court and civil court that there is no arbitration clause In the original agreement signed by both the parties.
 Therefore it Is not necessary to make any effort for the purpose of finding out as to what were the terms agreed between the parties. In the absence of clear intention of both the parties, agreement for arbitration cannot and should not be inferred, more so when the specific case of the respondent is that by mistake the clause relating to arbitration crept in the copy of agreement. [637 C-D, 638 D] The High Court was justified in holding on facts that only the original agreement and not the copy, was binding between the parties and no reference to arbitration could thus be made. In the aforesaid circumstances, no interference in called for. [638 H, 639 A] 632
