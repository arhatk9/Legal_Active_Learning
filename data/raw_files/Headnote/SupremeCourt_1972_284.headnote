 The petitioner was found guilty by the Court Martial (acting under the Army Act) under section 392 IPC of committing robberies of a bank property and the private property of the Manager and peons of the Batik during the period of the liberation of Bangladesh, in Bangla Desh. The Court Martial sentenced the petitioner 'to be cashiered'. When the matter went to the Officer Commanding under whom the petitioner was working as an Officer, for confirmation of the sentence u/s 153 of the Act, he returned the same to the Court Martial for re-considering whether the upward revision of sentence was necessary in the light of the observations made by the Confirming Officer. The Confirming Officer had pointed out in his report that the robberies were committed during the liberation of Bangladesh where the Indian Forces had gone as liberators and as guardians and custodians of the life and property of the people of Bangladesh. Considering the nature aid gravity and maintenance of high standard of discipline in the Armed Forces, the sentence awarded was not commensurate. The Confirming Officer further directed that the delinquent officer should be given opportunity to address the Court, if he so de-sired, if the Court decides to enhance the sentence. In the fresh proceedings before the Court Martial, the Officer did not present himself. The Court Martial revoked the earlier sentence and sentenced him to be cashiered and to suffer rigorous imprisonment for two years. The said sentence was duly confirmed by the Chief of the Army Staff. in the petition challenging the legality of the order under Art., 32 of the Constitution, the petitioner contended that the impugned order was bad for the violation of the principle of natural justice inasmuch as that the Court Martial while re-considering the sentence did not act as a free agent, that no opportunity of being heard was given to the Officer at the time of remand and at the time of the final confirmation by the Army Chief of the Staff and that the revision was recommended by an officer subordinate in rank to the officer who convened the Court Martial.
 In dismissing the petition, 
HELD : (i) Sec. 158 of the Army Act describes the procedure regarding the re-consideration of the sentence by the Court Martial. In considering a petition filed under Art. 32 of the Constitution, the only relevant Article is Art. 21, and the procedure established by law has been corn- 1026 pletely followed in this case. The circumstances requiring the reconsideration pointed out by the Officer Commanding were unexceptionable and there was no violation of the principle of natural justice. The petitioner failed to appear before the Court Martial in the fresh bearing. [1031 C-D] A. K. Kraipak & Ors. Etc. v. Union of India and Ors.

 (ii) No opportunity to be heard was necessary before the Confirming Officer formed the opinion to send the case back to the Court Martial for re-consideration of sentence. [1032 C] (ii) The words 'authority' and 'Officer' in Sec. 112 of the Army Act have one and the same meaning. The Officer recommending the reconsideration of the sentence was also an Officer commanding the Division though he was only officiating and was a Brigadier. The actual confirmation of the enhanced sentence was made by the Chief of Army Staff who was higher in rank than the convening Officer. [1033 C] (iv) In the face of the very clear indication in the Constitution, the provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure cannot be adopted in respect of Court Martial. It ",as open to the petitioner to make a petition to the Chief of the Army Staff under section 164 of the Army Act which he did not do. [1O33 H]
