 At the time of making an application to the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal under s. 66(1) of the Income-tax Act, 1922, to refer certain questions of law to the High Court, the assessee filed certain documents as annexures to his application and the Tribunal attached these documents to the Statement of Case. There was no mention of any of the documents either in the Appellate order of the Tribunal or in the body of the Statement of Case. The High Court decided the questions referred to it in favour of the assessee.
 On an appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (i) The case must be remanded to the High Court as the relevant facts were not clear, nor agreed upon by the parties.
 (ii)It is not consistent with the advisory jurisdiction of a High Court under the Act that the Appellate Tribunal should attach to the Statement of Case documents. other than the proceedings of the Income-tax authorities, which are not mentioned or discussed either in its own appellate order or in the Statement of Case. If the High Court were to decide any dispute concerning the interpretation of any such document, it would be deciding questions not decided by the Tribunal and which the High Court is incompetent to decide under the Act.
