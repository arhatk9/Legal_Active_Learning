After enquiry, an order was made compulsorily retiring the appellant from service. He filed a writ petition before the High Court but it, was dismissed.
 He appellant contended that the order of compulsory retirement was illegal and that the High Court had jurisdiction to quash the same.
 Held, that the charge against the appellant was not a charge, under, r. 3 and accordingly the order of compulsory retirement was illegal. The rule contemplated compulsory retirement was illegal. The rule contemplated compulsory 405 retirement in cases where the Public servant was engaged or suspected to be engaged in subversive activities, or was associated with others in subversive activities. The appellant was Only alleged to have, been associated with others who were engaged in subversive activities, but it was not alleged that he had taken any part in subversive activities by himself or along with others. Taking interest in political activities of the communist party did not amount to taking part in subversive activities so long as the communist party was reorganised-political party and was not banned.
 Held, further, that the impugned order. could be quashed on a petition under Art. 226. The premature termination of the service of the appellant, which was not justifiable under r.
 3 amounted to removal from service by way of penalty and attracted the application of Art. 311.
