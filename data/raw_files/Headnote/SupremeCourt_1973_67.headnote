 The respondent was engaged in the supply of foreign cotton to textile mills in South India on the basis of import licences issued to the mills authorising: import of foreign cotton by them. The, firm supplied cotton to the mills on the basis of specific written contracts. One of the conditions in the contract is that the goods imported should not under any circumstances, be diverted from its determined destination, i.e. the mills. Secondly, the relative shipping documents were issued by the foreign seller in the names of the respective mills and not in the name of the assessee-firm. Again, the import licences issued to the mill& authorise the mills to import the goods; and on the reverse of these licences is stated that the goods for the import of which the licences were granted should be the property of the licensees at the time of clearance through the customs. Still further, the letters of authorisation issued by the Government authorising the assessee-firm to import the cotton show that the assessee had to do it purely as an agent of the licensees both at the time of the clearance through the customs and' subsequent thereto. The firm entered into a contract with M/s. Mahalaxmi Cotton Mills on 20-3-1964. According to the respondent, by the contract entered into with the mills, the quantity of cotton agreed to be supplied to the mills was specified as also its quality and places from where it has to be imported. The price was fixed on C.I.F. Cochin term. Payment was to be made by the mills to the firm against the document. The other conditions governing the contract were laid down on the reverse of the contract form, the most important clauses in the contract were that the contract was C.I.F. in nature notwithstanding anything to the contrary mentioned in the contract. The price was subject to variation depending upon the import duty, freight rate,. insurance premium and exchange rate. It was further provided by the Mills that the contract was irrevocable and that any differences between the parties had to be resolved through arbitration etc. The question was, whether the sales made to the mills affected in this country occasioned the import. The Sales Tax Officer, as well as the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, held that the sales in question were intrastate sales and therefore, the assessee was liable to tax.
 On appeal, the Sales Tax Tribunal held that the assessee's case fell within s. 5(2) of the Central Sales Tax Act, read with Art. 286 of the Constitution and the High Court on revision, affirmed the decision of the Tribunal. Before this Court it was contended by the appellant that the sales were intrastate sales and as such, the assessee was liable to tax. Dismissing the appeals,
