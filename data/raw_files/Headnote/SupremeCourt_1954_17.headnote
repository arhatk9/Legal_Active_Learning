 The word "resides" in s. 33(1)(a) of the Indian Registration Act, 1908, is not defined in the statute. It contemplates not only permanent residence but also temporary residence.
 Residence only connotes that a person eats, drinks and sleeps at that place and it is-not necessary that he should own it.
 For purposes of s. 32(c) of the Act, a power-of-attorney needs, in view of the provisions of s. 33 of the Act, no registration but is only required to be executed before and authenticated by the Registrar. Hance an endorsement mistakenly made on such power-of-attorney that it was presented for registration must be ignored and does not affect the validity of subsequent authentication by the Registrar which was an independent act complete initself and valid under s. 33.
 A decision of the Registrar under s. 33(1) proviso (1) of the Indian Registration Act that an applicant is suffering from bodily infirmity and is unable to attend the Registration Office or court without risk or serious inconvenience relates to a matter of more procedure and even if erroneous does not affect his jurisdiction. The finding is on a matter which is within his exclusive jurisdiction, and cannot be questioned in a court of law.
