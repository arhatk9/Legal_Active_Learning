 By an election petition, the appellant challenged the validity of the first respondent's election to the Rajya Sabha from Bihar held in March, 1968. The grounds of challenge included allegations of corrupt practice by the first respondent. The High Court found that there were serious discrepancies between the original petition filed in the Court and the copy supplied to the first respondent. It dismissed the petition on the ground, inter alia, that there was non-compliance with the provisions of ss. 81, 82 and 117 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.
 On appeal to this Court, 
HELD : Dismissing the appeal, On a reference to only one of the discrepancies found by the High Court which related to allegations of corrupt practice it was clear that this discrepancy was bound to mislead the contesting respondents and prejudice their defence.
 Pleadings in a case have great importance and that is more so in election petitions particularly when the returned candidate is charged with corrupt practice. He must know what the charge against him is so that he may prepare his defence. If replying on the allegations in the copy of the petition served on him, the first respondent had collected evidence to show that allegation was false then the entire basis of him is so that he may prepare his defence. If relying on the allegations to meet a totally different case.
 The law requires that a true copy of the election petition should be served on the respondents. That requirement had not been either fully or substantially complied with.
 Therefore the election petition was liable to be dismissed under s. 86 of the Act.[825 A-C] Murarka Radhey Shyam Ram Kumar v.
