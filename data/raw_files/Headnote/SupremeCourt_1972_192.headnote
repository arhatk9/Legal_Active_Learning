 Respondent 1, the Karta, carried on the family business in the name and style of "Ram Nath Ram Prasad". The Income-Tax assessments for the assessment year 1944-45 and the exces profits tax assessment for the corresponding chargeable accounting period ending on October 28, 1943 were act aside by the income-Tax Appellate Tribunal with the direction that fresh orders of assessment be made in accordance with the directions given by the Tribunal.
 On September 25, 1951, under a scheme for voluntary disclosure, the Am respondent disclosed by means of an application, a sum of Rs. 2,08,450/- and offered the same for taxation.
 On October 1, 1951, the Hindu undivided family was disrupted and there was a complete partition. Thereafter, fresh assessments to Income Tax were made for the, assessment years 1944-45 to 1947-48 taking into consideration the disclosure made by the 1st respondent. Subsequently, were issued under s. 13(1) of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940 for certain chargeable accounting periods in the name of the first Respondent. He Wed writ petitions challenging the validity of the notices issued.
 The learned single Judge allowed the petitions holding that the appellant was not competent to take proceedings under the Act in respect of a Hindu undivided family which had been divided. On appeal, the Division Bench also upheld the decision of the learned single Judge. The appellant contended that (1) in the case of Excess Profits Tax Act, the tax is levied on the business and not on any individual and therefore, what is relevant is the continuation of the business and not the continuity of the identity of the assessee; (2) that under Section 44 of the Indian Income Tax Act 1922, a firm, or association of person, is jointly and severally liable to assessment and for the amount of tax payable.
 Dismissing the appeals, (1) Under s. 14 sub-section (3) of the Excess Profits Tax Act, if a business is carried on jointly during a chargeable accounting period, the assessment should be made upon the persons jointly and in the case of a partnership, it should be in the name of the partnership. Under Sub-section (4), if a person could be assessed either solely or jointly with other person or persons, in case of his death, the assessment may be. made on his legal representative either solely, or jointly with the other person or persons. The provisions of Section 14 place the matter beyond doubt that the assessment of the tax is on the person in the same manner as under the Income-tax Act. No doubt, under the Income-tax Act, the computation of tax is on the basis of the income derived by a person from various sources, while under the Excess Profits Tax Act, it is on the profits of "a business of the person". Therefore, the change of the person who carries on business is very material so far as the Excess Profits Tax is concerned. [1048D] 1044 Commissioner of Excess Profits Tax, Madras v. Jivaraj Topun and Sons, Madras, 20 I.T.R. 143, referred to.
 (ii) Section 44 of the Indian Income Tax Act 1922, applies only to firms and associations of persons. Hindu undivided family is neither a firm, nor an association of persons. It is a separate entity by itself. That is made clear by s. 3 of the Indian Income Tax Act 1922. Therefore, s. 44 of the Act has no application to the 'facts and circumstances of the case and the impugned notices are invalid. [1049E]
