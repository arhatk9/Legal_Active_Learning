 The respondents were convicted by the Sessions Judge for the offence under s. 302/34, I.P.C. for committing the murder of one Rati Ram and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for life. They were also convicted under s.
 307/34 I.P.C. for causing grievous injury to Raja Ram (PW 2) with intent to commit his murder and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 10 years. They were, however, given the benefit of doubt and acquitted of the murder of Nainsuk is other-in-law of Rati Ram. The convictions were based in the dying declaration as the seven- incise wounds on Rati Ram and 26 incised wounds on Raja Ram and also on the evidence of Raja Ram (PW 2) and Dwarika (PW 3) who identified the respondents as the assailants. The offence took place in the early hours of 24th December 1971 (About 3.30 A.M.) and it was the admitted case that it was a dark night.
 During the pendency of the appeal by the respondents, the learned Judges of the High Court acting- under s. 539B, Cr.P.C., went with the Government advocate and the respondents' counsel on 11-1-1974 to a place where there was no artificial light at about 7.30 p.m. for the purpose of appreciating the veracity of the evidence of Raja Ram (PW 2) and Dwarika (PW 3) tendered at the trial in identifying the respondents in darkness. Finding that under the circumstances noticed by them, it was difficult to recognise a person, the High Court disbelieved the evidence of PW2 and PW3 and acquitted the respondents.
 Allowing the appeal by special leave, and remitting the case for rehearing, the Court, ^ 
 HELD :(1) Section 539B of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, contemplates the local inspection of the topography of the place in which the offence was alleged to have been. committed or its local peculiarities for the purpose of appreciating the evidence which was already on the record. [322F] (2) In the instant case, the procedure adopted by the Judges in visiting quit a different place, on a time unconnected with tho time of the alleged incident, for the purposes of deciding whether the witnesses could identify the assailants in the darkness was quite illegal and it was not permissible for them to dispose of the case OD the.
 basis of their own findings without regard to the evidence which was already on record. [324A-B]
