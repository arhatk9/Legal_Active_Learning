 The appellant had supplied some steel to the respondent plaintiff Company for manufacturing gas plants at Rampur.
 Only a part of the steel so supplied was utilized for the intended purpose and with regard to the rest, the Regional Deputy Iron & Steel Controller, U.P. Circle, Kanpur directed the respondents through a letter dated 8th /10th of November, 1944 to deliver the same to the U.P. Registered Stock Holders Associations and to send to the Kanpur office, the bill of costs of the material, handling charges etc.
 made in the name of Iron & Steel Controller, Calcutta. Since the order contained in that letter could not be implemented on account of lack of transport facilities, the Kanpur Con- troller, directed the respondent company to deliver the surplus steel to M/s G. Brothers Ltd., Rampur and to this extent the order dated 8th/10th November 1944 stood modified.
 Though the surplus material was delivered to Govan Brothers between 11th April 1945 and 30th of April, 1945, the price therefor to the tune of Rs. 43,728-6-6 remained unpaid inspite of repeated demands made by the respondent.
 Ultimately, the Iron & Steel Controller informed the respondent to take up the matter with Govan Brothers.
 As the price of the steel remained unpaid by the Union of India as well as G. Brothers the plaintiff company filed its suit for Rs. 46,652-14-6 which was inclusive of interest on the principal price calculated at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from April, 1945, upto the date of the institution of the suit, after serving the defendant with the requisite notice under section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
 The trial Court decreed the claim of the plaintiff company in full and also directed that it would be entitled to the costs of the suit as also interest at the rate of 3 per cent per annum from the date of the institution of the suit to the date of payment. The trial Court held that the Kanpur Controller had undertaken the liability to pay the price of the goods to the plaintiff Company even in respect of the delivery to G. Brothers and that the defendant could not escape liability by reason of the contents of section 65 of the Indian Contract Act even though the provisions of section 175(3) of the Government of India Act, 1935, had not been complied with. The contention raised by the defendant to the effect that section 17(2) of the Defence of India Act was a bar to the suit was negatived.
 In appeal, the High Court agreed that Section 17(2) of the Defence of India Act would be a complete bar to the suit if it was one for damages or 894 compensation but held that the suit was not of that nature and, on the other hand, it was for recovery of the price of the goods supplied to G. Brothers as was also found by the trial Court. It further held that even though the provisions of section 175(3) of the Government of India Act were not complied with the agreement resulting from the correspondence which took place between the plaintiff company and the officers of the defendant was good. Relying on Section 70 of the Indian Contract Act and on the basis thereof, it held the plaintiff company to be entitled to recover the price of the goods from the defendant even if it was assumed that the provisions of section 175(3) were a bar to the recognition of the contract envisaged by the correspondence between the parties. The High Court dismissed the appeal, but granted a certificate under Article 133(1)(a) of the Constitution to the appellant.
 Dismissing the appeal, the Court ^ 
 HELD: 1. The suit is not one for compensation or damages etc. as contemplated by Section 17(2) of the Defence of India Act and hence is not barred by nat section [898 A].
 
 2. The legality of the matter under which the respondent company transferred its stock to G. Brothers cannot be allowed to be questioned at the appellate stage.
 The question whether the requirements of clause (5) of the Indian Iron and Steel Control order, 1941 which postulates only a written direction for disposal of surplus stocks were satisfied or not is a mixed question of fact and law which was never raised in the Courts below. Further the plea taken in paragraph (4) of the written statements filed by the appellant was categorically to the effect that "the fresh instructions issued to the plaintiff are contained in the letter in the possession of the plaintiff" runs counter to the factual part of the argument. Besides another question would arise whether the word "written" in clause (5) aforesaid is directory or mandatory. [898 C-D] 
 3. Three conditions must be satisfied before Section 70 of the Indian Contract Act can be invoked: first, a person should lawfully do something for another person or deliver something to him; second, in doing the said thing or delivering the said thing he must not intend to act gratuitously; and third, the other person for whom something is done or to whom something is delivered must enjoy the benefit thereof. [898 H, 899 A] In the instant case, the appellant had enjoyed the full benefit of the delivery of the goods to G. Bros. and not merely an indirect benefit thereof. [901 B] State of West Bengal v.
