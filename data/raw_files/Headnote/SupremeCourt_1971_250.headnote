 The appellant was registered as a public limited company in or about 1956 and commenced production in or about 1958. It employed approximately 170 persons of whom 156 were daily rated workers-the latter being respondents in the present appeal. In respect of certain demands raised by the workmen in 1962 there were conciliation proceedings in the course of which the parties arrived at an amicable settlement on April 5, 1963. Thereby they settled inter alia Demand No. 1 relating to wage scales and Demand No. 2 relating to Dearness Allowance. The parties also agreed to discuss, the existing production bonus scheme and to finalise the same by the end of June 1963. The settlement was signed on behalf of the parties and by the Conciliation Officer. However subsequently there were again disputes between the workmen and the employers and these were referred by the State Government to the Industrial Tribunal on December 27, 1965 under s. 10(A)(d) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.
 Both the parties being dissatisfied with the Award of the Tribunal filed appeals by special leave in this Court. The questions that fell for consideration were : (i) whether in view of the absence of a notice of termination as contemplated in s. 19(2) of the Act the settlement dated August 5, 1963 continued to subsist and consequently whether the reference of the dispute to the Tribunal was incompetent, (ii) whether the tribunal was wrong in fixing consolidated wages without linking dearness allowance with cost of living or granting adjustments in the wage scale;
 (iii) whether in the matter of determining available surplus the Tribunal was justified in taking the figures of depreciation allowance and development rebate from the balance sheet and not from the income-tax assessment orders in which the figures were higher; (iv) whether for the purpose of determining the return on reserves the figures it the end of the year or the beginning of the year had to be taken; (v) whether the Tribunal was right in its conclusion that the financial position of the company justified the framing of a scheme of gratuity; (vi) whether in View of the fact that the Tribunal had prescribed a consolidated wage without indicating what portion of the wage was the basic wage and what portion the dearness allowance, the payment of gratuity based on an average of the basic wages of an employee exclusive of dearness allowance was impossible to implement; (vii) whether the gratuity scheme was incongruous because those who retired were given larger benefits than those who were retrenched.

HELD : (i) Reading s. 19 with the definition of 'settlement' in s. 2(p) of the Industrial Disputes Act it would appear that a settlement will ensure for the duration of the period for which it has been agreed to between the parties and if no period is agreed upon, for a period of six months from the date on which the memorandum of settlement of-dispute is signed by the parties and where it is put an end to by a notice in writing it will continue to be operative until the expiry of two months from the date of which the notice is given. It would appear that even where an agreement is for a fixed period it will not continue to be binding for the duration of the period of settlement but thereafter also until it is terminated by a notice in writing and even then it will continue for a period of two months from the date of such notice. While no doubt it is true that a notice must be in writing, such a notice can be inferred from correspondence between the parties. [798 A-C] In the present case the management had in a letter dated 20th March 1965 addressed to the Additional Commissioner of Labour, Bombay, admitted that no settlement or award was in existence, the reference, of the Industrial Disputes was made only after that. It was not a satisfactory explanation of that categorical statement that it was made under a mistake. The said letter must be deemed to be a notice of termination because it made a categorical statement that the settlement had 'been terminated on 31-12-64. The management was therefore estopped from now taking the stand that the settlement was not put an end to or that the reference was invalid.

 (ii)The Tribunal considered the financial status of the company and the era of prosperous business which it could look forward to, as well as the wage structure prevailing in the relevant units of the industry and other wages. There was no justification for interfering with it on the ground that it bad not fixed a separate dearness allowance linked with, increase or decrease in the cost of living index or to link the consolidated wage itself with it.

 However this was a fit case in which wage adjustment should have been made. The Tribunal gave no reason for rejecting the claim altogether. Why some adjustment was not made taking into consideration the length of the service bad not been stated. There was no adjustment in the first wage structure which was the subject of a settlement as such and it would not be fair also not to fix the wages in the wage scales which in fact were those fixed for the first time by the award. From an analysis of the various categories of workers in each of the years it would appear that a larger majority of them had been employed between the years 1963 and 1965. If a direction was given that there should be one increment for every completed 3 years up to the date of reference namely 27-12-65, no 792 injustice would occur, nor will there be strain on the financial resources of the appellant which it could not bear. [Directions given. [805 B-E] (iii)A statement as per Income,-tax Assessment statement 'A' Ex. C-5 was filedby the company on 2-9-66.
 Similarly another statement of profit and lossaccount as per annual account of the company-Statement 'B' Ex. C6 was filed on the same date. In the former statement C-5 accord- ing to item 2, depreciation allowed by the Income-tax Officer for 1964 was shown as Rs. 1,81,054 while according to C-6 depreciation was shown as Rs. 80,190. Similarly development rebates under C-5 was shown as Rs. 5,822 while under C-6 it was shown as Rs. 3,917. There was no challenge to these figures as such, nor did the respondent dispute that these amounts were not as per the assessment orders.
 The Tribunal had accepted statement C-6 but ignored C-5 even though both the statements were prepared by the company in exactly the same circumstances, one from the assessment orders and the other from the balance sheet. There was no justification for the rejection of the company's claim that depreciation and development rebate' be allowed as per income-tax assessment. [806 F-H] (iv)The claim of the Respondent for return on reserves also must be allowed because under s. 6(d) read with item (1) (iii) of the Third Schedule to; the Bonus Act the Tribunal ought to have allowed 6% of the company's reserves shown in its balance-sheet as at the commencement of the accounting year including any profits carried forward from the previous accounting year. The Tribunal was wrong in taking into account the figures of reserves as at the end of the accounting year. [807 B-C] (v)In dealing with the financial capacity of an undertaking to bear the burden of a gratuity scheme it would not be appropriate to approach the question 'from an investors point of view. The overall picture of the soundness of the undertaking and its future prospects must be taken into account. [812 D-E] In the present case the financial position of the company was such that the implementation of the scheme of gratuity was not likely to place an undue or unconscionable burden upon the company.

 (vi)While no doubt the general rule is that gratuity must be related to the basic wage, in cases where the wages are not very high and a consolidated wage has been fixed taking into account the dearness allowance, the scheme of gratuity may be related to the consolidated wage, which will be the basic wage in the subsequent years. At any future date having regard to the price index, the claim of the workmen either for a rise in the wage based on the cost of living index or the grant of separate dearness allowance to neutralise that rise is bound to be considered and adjudicated. No difficulty in implementing the scheme could therefore arise because of the fact that the Tribunal had prescribed a consolidated wage without indicating what position of that wage was the basic wage and what position the dearness allowance.

 The Workmen, [1968] 1 L.L.J. 542, referred to.
 (vii)The criticism that the scheme was unfair and incongruous because those that retire are given larger benefits than those who are retrenched was unwarranted. The difference between the gratuity payable to persons who resign or retire voluntarily and those whose services are terminated is that the latter will receive in addition to the gratuity the retrenchment compensation admissible to them under the Industrial Disputes Act, while in the case of the former he will not be entitled to it. The scheme was not only reasonable but fair. [815 G-816 B]
