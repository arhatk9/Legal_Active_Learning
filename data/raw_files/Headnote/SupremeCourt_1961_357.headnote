 The shrine in suit which was originally founded by Shri Madhavacharya, a Hindu saint was managed for a long time in rotation by the heads of eight Mutts which were also founded by the said saint for eight of his disciples. Large number of pilgrims from all over the country visited this shrine without any restraint, took part in the worship there, made offerings to the deity and received the prasad. The institution was managed with the monetary aid received from the State and contributions raised by the said heads of the eight Mutts from devotees resident in different parts of the country. The question arising for decision was whether the shrine in question was a "temple" within the meaning of s. 2(1) of the Madras Temple Entry Authorization Act, 1947.
 ^ Held, that in the absence of good evidence that a temple was a private one, the mere fact that it was visited by a large number of persons among the Hindu Public without any restraint for a number of years, was good evidence of the fact that the temple had been dedicated to the Hindu Public and was for its benefit.
 Vibhudapriya v. Lakshmindra, (1927) L. R. 54 I. A. 228, referred to.
 Babu Bhagwan Din v. Gir Har Saroop, (1939) L.
 R. 67 I. A. 1, and Sri Venkataramana Devarau v.
 State of Mysore[1957] INSC 99; , [1958] S.C.R. 895, followed.
 In the instant case the finding that the Hindu Public had a right to worship in the temple was sufficient to make the institution a "temple" within the definition of that term in the Act even if the temple be appurtenant to a Mutt.
