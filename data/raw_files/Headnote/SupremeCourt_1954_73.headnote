 An executive authority can be authorised by a statute to modify either existing or future laws but not in any essential feature. Exactly what constitutes an essential feature cannot be enunciated in general terms but it is clear that modification cannot include a change of policy.
 Essential legislative function consists in the determination of the legislative policy and its formulation as a binding rule of conduct. Modifications which are authorised are limited to local adjustments or changes of minor character and do not mean or involve any change of policy or change in the Act.
 Section 3(1)(f) of the Patna Administration Act of 19 15 (Bihar and Orissa Act I of 1915) as amended by Patna Administration (Amendment) Act of 1928 (Bihar and Orissa Act IV of 1928) is intra vires because any section or sections of the Bihar Municipal Act of 1922 can be picked and applied to Patna (whether with or without modification) provided that does not eftct any essential change in the Act or alter its policy and the words "restriction" and " modification" are used in the restricted sense.
 The notification dated 23rd April, 1951, by which the Governor of Bihar picked s. 104 out of the Bihar and Orissa Municipal Act of 1922, modified it and extended it in its modified form to the Patna Administration and Patna Village areas is ultra vires as it effects a radical change in the policy of the Act and thus travels beyond the authority conferred by s. 3(1)(f).
 In re The Delhi Laws Act, 1912, etc. ([1951] S.C.R. 747) applied.
