 The respondent entered into a contract with the appellant for the transport of iron ore from quarry Nos. 1 and 2 being worked out by the appellant, to the railway siding.
 As the instance of the appellant the respondent later transported iron ore from quarry No. 5 situated at a distance of about 2 KM from the other two quarries. Having failed to recover from the appellant the extra cost which was Rs. 68,582 for transport and a sum of Rs. 25,000 for constructing a road between quarry Nos. 1 and 2 and quarry No. 5, the respondent filed in the court of subordinate Judge an application under s. 20 of the Arbitration Act, 1940. The dispute was referred to a sole arbitrator.
 Before the arbitrator the respondent made a claim of Rs.
 68,582, apart from the claim for an identical amount made in the plaint. The arbitrator disallowed the claim for construction of the road but allowed the additional claim of the respondent and gave an award for a sum of Rs. 1,16,570.
 The appellant's application alleging that the arbitrator acted without jurisdiction in allowing the additional claim of Rs. 68,582 was rejected by the Subordinate Judge on the ground that there was no error apparent on the face of the record and that the arbitrator did not exceed his jurisdiction.
 The High Court dismissed the appellant's appeal.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : When an agreement is filed in court and order of reference is made, then. the claim as a result of the order of reference is limited to a particular relief and the arbitrator cannot enlarge the scope of the reference and entertain fresh claims without a further order of reference from the court. [299H] In the instant case the arbitrator has exceeded his jurisdiction in embarking on the extra claim. put forward before him by the respondent. When the claim had been specified in the plaint and when the reference was confined to the claim made in the plaint, the arbitrator would have to restrict his award only to that claim. [299F] The High Court has misconstrued the claim. There was no claim for transport of iron ore between quarry Nos. 1 and 2 and the railway siding; the only claim was for the transport for the extra distance. [299A]
