 The first appellant was convicted under s. 302 of the Indian Penal Code for the murder of a three and a half yea. old boy, T, and sentenced to death, while his father, the second appellant, was convicted under s. 201 for having concealed T's dead body. The prosecution case was that on January 5, 1961, between 3-30 p.m. and 4 p.m. when T was at the house of the appellants and the other inmates of the house were away, the first appellant killed T by stuffing his mouth with a cloth and kept the dead body in the garage in their house; and that on that very night he and his father buried the dead body in the compound after putting it in a gunny bag. The evidence showed that a few days before January 5, 1961, relations between the first appellant and T's father had become strained because the first appellant had talked to T ' Is mother in a way which her husband did not like and the latter asked the first appellant to stop his visits to their house; and T who used to be a frequent visitor to the first appellant stopped his visits for some days, but resume them three or four days before January 5; and that on that day T was last seen alive at about 3-30 p m. in the first appellant' house playing with him. Both the trial court and the High Court found that the prosecution case was fully established by the evidence. It was contended for the appellants that the findings of the lower courts were not justified, and that no reasonable motive for the crime had been proved.
 Held, that the appellants had been rightly convicted; that though the motive for the murder does not appear from the evidence. that can be no reason for doubting the conclusion which flows, clear from the circumstances. The motive behind a crime is a relevant fact of which evidence can be given; absence of motive is also a relevant circumstance.
 That has to be considered along with other circumstances.
 It often happens that only the culprit knows the motive behind his action.
