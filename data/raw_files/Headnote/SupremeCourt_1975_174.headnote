 The appellant manufactures aluminium plates, sheets, circles, strips and foils which are the end products of its composite factory, but, as intermediate products, it also turns out ingots, bars, slabs, billets, pellets and the like which get consumed mostly in the process of manufacture of plates, sheets, and other end products. Aluminium is first converted into items like ingots bars slabs, etc., but when they are used up for finished products like plates and sheets, nearly half of the stuff is thrown back into scrap in which state it is remelted and starts its manufacturing journey over again. Under the Finance Act for the year 1960, Excise Duty was imposed on the aluminium. On the manufacturing of the aluminium, plates, sheets, circles, strips and foils in any form or size, the duty leviable was rupees five hundred per metric tonne. A note appended to Item 27 reads as under:
 "Under the Government of India, Ministry of Finance, (Department of Revenue) Notification No. 29/60 Central Excises, dated the Ist March 1960, the following aluminium manufactures, namely plates, sheets, circles, strips and foils in any form is used, are exempt from so much of the duty leviable thereon as is in excess of Rs. 200.00 per metric tonne." The appellant manufactured certain plates, sheets etc.
 by using partly duty paid aluminium and partly aluminium on which no duty was paid. The authorities under the Act disallowed exemption under note to Item 27 on the ground that the plates, sheets, etc., were not manufactured exclusively out of the duty paid aluminium.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD : (1) The whole scheme of the exemption is that where ingots, bars, blocks, slabs, billets, pellets etc.
 made out of aluminium scrap or scrap obtained from the virgin metal on which excise duty was already paid, are used for making finished items like sheets, reduction pro tanto in the rate of duty leviable on the final product is to be given. [403BC] (2) The marginal mystique in interpretation has arisen from misunderstanding the spirit letters of the notification. [405-D] (3) We feel confident that the State will seriously consider: (a) that good government involves not only diligent collection of taxes, but also ready refunds of excess levies; (b) that simplicity or easy comprehensibility in drafting legislation, including rules and notifications affecting the laity, is an art found absent, although not difficult to accomplish, given a fresh approach to use of statutory language; and (c) that a fair construction-not always one adverse to the assessee-is permissible and proper on the part of government and the taxing officers when enforcing fiscal legislation.
