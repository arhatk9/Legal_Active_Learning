 The defendant-appellant was a tenant under the plaintiff- landlord on a monthly rent of Rs.70. The appellant defaulted In the payment of the rent or the suit-premises- residential-cum-shop premises-with effect from October, 1975 to June, 1976.
 As the appellant did not vacate the premises even after being served with a notice under section 106. Transfer of Property Act, a suit was filed for his eviction from the suit premises,, being a defaulter. The landlord also pleaded his own bona fide requirement of the suit-promises.
 The appellant-tenant submitted that he was originally a tenant under one Smt. Sita Devi, the owner of the suit premises at a monthly rent of Rs.55; that he was paying the rent to Smt. Sita Devi and after the plaintiff landlord purchased the house from her in 1968, he continued its tenant of plaintiff. that the plaintiff illegally increased the rent from Rs.55 to Rs.65 per month (and not Rs. 70 per mouth.) under threat of eviction that town( paid the rent at the rate of km, 6.5 per mouth upto the month commencing from 16.1.1976, when the plaintiff landlord refused to accept the same with effect from 16.2..1976 that defendant-tenant did not default In payment of rent as subsequently rent had been sent by Money Order that the landlord-plaintiff did not have any bona fide necessity for the premises and that the suit was not maintainable.
 The Trial Court hold that the suit was maintainable the plaintiff had cause of action for the suit and tenancy of the defendant was validity terminated. It also held also held that the defendant tenant was a defaulter and was 369 370 liable to be evicted from the primises. It however held that the plaintiff had failed to prove his case regarding bona fide requirement of the suit premises. The Trial Court however held that the plaintiff-landlord could not have enhanced the rent without taking recourse to the provisions of Bihar Building (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act and therefore the Court calculated the arrears of rent at Rs.55 per month.
 The Trial Court decreed the suit partly and directed the defendanttenant to vacate the suit premises and to deliver the vacant possession of the same to the plaintiff-landlord within 90 days from the date of the decree.
 Tenant-appellant filed a First Appeal against the Trial Court's judgment. Plaintiff-landlord also filed cross- objections challenging the finding of the Trial Court regarding determination of the rate of rent and the arrears of rent. The First Appellate Court dismissed the Cross- objections and confirmed the finding of the Trial Court to the effect that the rent lawfully payable was Rs. 55 per month. It held that the defendanttenant was a defaulter with effect from 16.5.1976 onwards and he was liable to be evicted and dismissed the appeal of the tenant.
 The Second Appeal filed by the appellant-tenant was dismissed by the High Court in limine, against which by special leave the present appeal was filed in this Court.
 The appellant contended that since the rent lawfully payable per month was Rs. 55 per month and not Rs. 65 which was paid by the appellant, the excess amount paid should be adjusted, there could be no quotation of holding appellant a defaulter. (This plea of appellant was rejected by the First Appellate Court on the ground that no prayer for adjustment in writing was made by him.) The respondent-landlord submitted that the excess rent paid by the tenant to his landlord in pursuance of a mutually agreed illegal enhancement, could not get automatically adjusted against the subsequent defaults in the payment of monthly rent.
 Dismissing the appeal of the tenant, this Court, 
HELD- 1.01. Section 4 of the Bihar Building (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act creates an absolute prohibiton against illegal increase or enhacement of rent except in the manner provided by the 371 provisions of the Act itself and lays down that it is not even permissible for the parties to contract themselves out of such a prohibition. Thus, on its plain language any increase or claim to increase in the rent by the landlord would be unlawful and any agreement to do so except in accordance with the provisions of the Act would not cure the illegality. [377B-C] 1.02. The Act does not contain any provision for automatic adjustment of excess rent. Neither in reply to the notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act nor in the written statement or through any other writing was the adjustment of excess rent towards the arrears claimed by the tenant from the landlord. There also was no agreement between the parties at any point of time for adjustment of the excess rent illegally paid towards the rent falling due subsequently. [377F] 1.03. The rent payable in the instant case was only Rs.55 per month and the tenant was made to pay Rs.65 per month from 1968 onwards after the property had been purchased by the plaintiff-landlord under threat of eviction, it must be held that the increase in the rent from Rs.55 per month to Rs.65 per month was unlawful and the landlord was not entitled to recover anything more than Rs.55 per month by way of rent. [377C-D] 1.04. The excess rent paid by the tenant in pursuance of mutually agreed illegal enchancement thereof by the parties does not get automatically adjusted against the subsequent defaults in the payment of the monthly rent under the Act and even under the general law such an automatic adjustment is not countenanced. [381B] 1.05. A tenant cannot save himself from the conseqences of eviction under the Act on the ground of default in the payment of rent by claiming automatic adjustment of any excess rent paid consequent upon mutual enhacement of rent, even if illegal unless there is an agreement between the parties for such an adjustment. The tenant may also in a given case seek adjustment of the excess rent in the hands of the landlord against the arrears by specifically asking the landlord for such an adjustment before riling of the suit or in response to the notice to quit and even in the written statement by way of set off within the period of limitation and by following the procedure for claiming such a set off, while resisting the claim for eviction on the ground of default in payment of arrears of rent but, he cannot claim 'automatic adjustment.
