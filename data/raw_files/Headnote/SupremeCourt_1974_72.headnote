 After the State of Bombay was bifurcated the legislature of the State of Gujarat enacted the Bombay Labour Welfare Fund (Gujarat Extension and Amendment) Act, 1961, making various amendments in the Bombay Labour Welfare Fund Act, 1953. The 1953-Act was passed with a view to provide for the constitution of a fund for financing activities for promoting the welfare of labour in the State of Bombay.
 Section 3 as amended, provides that the State Government shall constitute a fund called the Labour Welfare Fund and that the fund shall consist of. among other things, all unpaid accumulations. Sec. 2(10) defines unpaid accumulations as meaning all payments due to the employees but not made to them within a period of three years from the date on which they became due whether before or after the commencement of the Act including wages and gratuity legally payable. Sec. 6A(1) provides that unpaid accumulations shall be deemed to be abandoned property and that the Board, constituted under the Act, shall take them over. As soon as the Board takes over the unpaid accumulations, notice as provided in the section, will have to be published and claims invited. Sub-section 3 to 6 provide for notice and sub-ss. 7 to 11 lay down the machinery for adjudication of claims which might be received in response to the notice.
 It is only if no claim is made for a period of four years from the date of the, publication of the first notice, or if a claim is made but rejected wholly or in part, that the State appropriates the unpaid accumulation, as bona vacantia.
 Section 2(4) of the Act defines 'establishment' and the definition includes factories, tramway or motor omnibus services and any establishment carrying government establishments carrying on business or trade. Demand for the payment ofthe unpaid accumulations having been made the respondents filed petitions inthe High Court challenging various provisions of the Act and the High Court held that s. 3(1), in so far as it relates to unpaid accumulations specified ins. 3 (2) (b), 3 (4) and 6A of the Act, and rules 3 and 4 of the rules made thereunder are unconstitutional and void on the grounds : (i) that the impugned provisions violated the fundamental rights of citizen-employers and employees under Art. 19(1)(f) and therefore were void under Art. 13(2) and hence there was no law and the demands were thus without the authority of law;
 and (2) that discrimination was writ large in the definition of 'establishment'.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1)(a) Unpaid accumulations represent the obligations of the employers to the employees and they are the property of the employees. In other words, what is being treated as abandoned property under 6A is the obligation to the employees owed by the employers and which is property from the standpoint of the employees. [771 A-B] 761 (b) At common law, abandoned personal property could not be the subject of escheat. It could only be appropriated as bona vacantia. Under the Act, though unpaid accumulations are deemed to be abandoned property under s. 6A(1) they are appropriated as bona vacantia only after claims are invited and disposed of. [770 G-771A] (c) If unpaid accumulations are not claimed within a total period of 7 years the inactivity on the part of the employees would furnish adequate basis for the administration by the State of the unasserted claims or demands. It cannot be said that the period of 7 years allowed to the employees for the purpose of claiming unpaid accumulations is an unreasonably short one which will result in the infringement of any constitutional rights of the employees. [771E] (d) There is no reason to think that the State will be. in fact less able or less willing to pay the amounts when it has taken them over. [771E-F] (e) It cannot also be assumed that the mere substitution of the State as the debtor will deprive the employees of their property or impose on them any unconstitutional burden.
 [771F] (f) Since the employers are the debtors of the employees, they can interpose noobjection if the State is lawfully entitled to demand the payment, for in thatcase payment of the debt to the State under the statute releases the employers of their liability to the employees. When the moneys representing the unpaid accumulations are paid to the Board the liability of the employers to make payment to the employees in, respect of their claims against the employers would be discharged to the extent of the amount paid to the Board, and on such liability being transferred to the Board, the debts or claims to that extent cannot thereafter be enforced against the employers. [771D, G] (g) As regards notice, all persons having property located within a state and subject to its dominion must take note of its statutes affecting control and disposition of such property and the procedure prescribed for those purposes.
 The various modes of notice prescribed in s. 6A are sufficient to give reasonable information to the employees to come forward and claim the amount if they really want to do so. [771G-H] In the absence of a showing of injury, actual or threatened, there could be no constitutional argument. therefore, against the taking over of the unpaid accumulations by the State. [771F-G] (2) But assuming that the impugned provisions abridge the fundamental rights of citizen-employers or citizen-employees under Art. 19(1)(f), the respondent, a corporation and hence a non-citizen employer, could not claim (i) that the law was void as against non-citizen employers also under Art. 13(2), and (ii) that since a void law is a nullity, the privation of its property was without the authority of law. [772D] (a) It is settled that a Corporation is not a citizen for the purposes of Art. 19 and has, therefore no fundamental right under that Article. [772E] Tata Engineering and Locomotive Co. Ltd. v. State of Bihar and others[1964] INSC 44; , [1964] 6 S.C.R. 885, R. C. Cooper v. Union of India, [1970] 2 S.C.R. 530 and Bennett Coleman & Co., etc.
 v. Union of India and Others [1972] INSC 266; [1972] 2 S.C.C. 788, followed.
 (b) Courts should not adjudge on the constitutionality of a statute except when they are called upon to do so when legal rights of the litigants are in actual controversy; and as part of this rule, is the principle that one to whom the application of a statute is constitutional will not be heard to attack the statute on the ground that, it must also be taken as applying to other persons to whom or situations in which, its application may be unconstitutional. [771 H-772B] United States v. Rainas, 362 U.S. 17, referred to.
 762 (c) The same scheme permeates both the sub-articles of Art.
 13, namely, to make the law void in Art. 13(1) to the extent of the inconsistency with the fundamental rights, and in Art. 13(2) to the extent of the contravention of those rights. In other words, the voidness is not in rein but to the extent only of inconsistency or contravention as the case may be, of the rights conferred under Part III.
 Therefore, when Art. 13(2) uses the expression 'void, it can only mean void as against persons whose fundamental rights are taken away or abridged by a law. [777G-H] (d) If a pre-constitutional law which takes away or abridges the rights under Art. 19 could remain operative even after the Constitution came into force as regards non-citizens, there is no reason why a post-constitutional law which takes away or abridges them should not be operative as respects noncitizens, if the meaning of the word 'void' in Art. 13(1) is the same as its meaning in Art. 13(2). The reason why a pre-constitutional law remains ,operative as against non- citizens is that it is void only to the extent of its in- consistency with the rights conferred under Art. 19 and that its voidness is, therefore, confined to citizens, as, ex hypothesi the law became inconsistent with their fundamental rights alone. Art. 13(2) is an injunction to the State not to pass any law which takes away or abridges the fundamental rights conferred by Part III and the consequence of the contravention of the injunction is that the, law would be void to the extent of the contravention. The expression 'to the extent of the contravention' in the sub-article can only mean to the extent of the contravention of the rights conferred under that Part. Rights always inhere in some person whether natural or juridical. Just as a pre- constitutional law taking away or abridging the fundamental rights under Art. 19 remains operative after the Constitution came into force as respects of noncitizens as it is not inconsistent that their fundamental rights so also a postconstitutional law, offending Art, 19, remains operative as against non-citizens as it is not in contravention of any of their fundamental rights. The law might be still-born so far as the persons, entities or denominations whose fundamental rights are taken away or abridged; but there is no reason why the law should he void or still-born as against those who have no fundamental rights. 777B-D, E-G, H-778A] (e) It could not be said that the expression 'to the extent of the contravention' mean only that part of the law which contravenes the fundamental right would alone be void and not the other parts which do not so contravene. The expression 'any law' occurring in the latter part of the sub-article must necessarily refer to the same expression, in the former part and, therefore, the Constitution-makers have already made it clear that the law that would be void is only the law which contravenes the fundamental rights conferred by Part III; and, so, the phrase 'to the extent of the contravention' can mean only to the extent of the contravention of the rights conferred. When it is seen that the latter part of the sub-article is concerned with the effect of the violation of the injunction contained in the former part, the words 'to the extent of the contravention' can only refer to the rights conferred under Part III ind denote only the compass of voidness with respect to persons or entities resulting from the contravention of the rights conferred upon them, There is no reason why the Constitution-makers wanted to state that the other sections which did not violate the fundamental rights would not be void. Besides. any such categorical statement would be wrong as the other sections might be void if they are inseparably knitted to the void one. [778A-G] (f) Assuming that this Court has rejected the distinction between legislative incapacity arising from lack of power under the relevant legislative entry and that arising from a check upon legislative power on account of constitutional provisions like fundamental rights, it does not follow that if the law enacted by the legislature having no capacity in the former sense would be void in rem a law passed by a legislature having no legislative capacity in the latter sense should also be void in rem, because : [778G-H] (i) If on a textual reading of Art. 13 the conclusion reached namely, that a law passed by a legislature having no legislative capacity in the latter sense 763 is only void qua those persons whose fundamental rights are taken away or abridged, is the only reasonable one, there is no need to consider whether that. conclusion could not be arrived at except on the basis of such a distinction;, and (ii) Further, there is nothing strange in the notion of a legislature having no inherent legislative capacity or power to take away or abridge by law the: fundamental rights conferred on citizens and yet having legislative power to pass the same law in respect of non-citizens who have no such fundamental rights to be taken away or abridged. In other words, the legislative incapacity subjectwise with reference to Arts. 245 and 246 in this context would be the taking away or abridging by law the fundamental rights under Art. 19 of citizens. [779A-E] M. P. V. Sundararamaier v. State of A.P. [1958] INSC 19; (1958) S.C.R. 1422, referred. to.
 (g) The expression "that State shall not make any law in Art. 13(2) is no doubt a clear mandate of the fundamental law of the land and, therefore, it is case of total incapacity and total want of power. But the mandate is that the State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by Part III. If no rights are conferred under Part III upon a person, or, if rights are conferred, but they are not taken away or abridged by law there could not be incapacity of the legislature to make a law. If a law is otherwise good and does not contravene any of their fundamental rights, noncitizens cannot take advantage of the voidness of the law for the reason, that it contravenes the fundamental rights of citizens and claim that there is no law at ail. Such a proposition would not violate any principle of equality before the law, because, citizens and non-citizens are not similarly situated as citizens have certain fundamental rights which non-citizens have not.

 (h) Therefore, even assuming that under Art. 226 of the Constitution the respondent was entitled to move the High Court and seek a remedy for infringement of its ordinary right to property, the impugned provisions could not be treated as non-est. and the respondent cannot take the plea that his rights to property are being taken away or abridged without the authority of law. [772 H-773 A] (3) The definition of 'establishment' in S. 2(4) does not violate Art. 14 and does not make the impugned provisions void.
 (a) The equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the protection of equal laws. But courts have resolved the contradictory demands of legislative specialisation and constitutional generality by the doctrine of reasonable classification. [782 B-C] (b) A reasonable classification is one which includes all who are similarly situated, and none who are not, with respect to the purpose of the law [782 C-D] (c) A classification is under-inclusive when all who are included in the class are tainted with the mischief, but there are others also tainted whom the, classification does not include. A classification is over-inclusive when it includes not only those who are similarly situated with respect to the purpose but also others who are not so situated. [782 D-F] (d) The Court has recognised the very real difficulties under which legislatures operate difficulties arising out of both the nature of the legislative process and of the society which legislation attempts perennially to reshape and it has refused to strike down indiscriminately all legislation embodying- 764 classificatory inequality like the one here under consideration. The legislature cannot be required to impose upon administrative agencies tasks which cannot be carried out or which must be carried out on a large scale at a single stroke. The piecemeal approach to a general problem permitted by under-inclusive classifications is justified especially when it is considered that legislation dealing with such problems is usually an experimental matter. It is impossible to tell how successful a particular approach may be, what dislocation may occur, what evasions may develop or what new evils might be generated in the attempt. A legislation may take one step at a time addressing itself to the Phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind. Therefore, a legislature might select only one phase of one field for application of a remedy.
 Once an objective is decided to be within the legislative competence the working out of classification should not be impeded by judicial negatives. The courts attitude cannot be that the state either has to regulate all businesses or even all related businesses and in the same way, or not at all. The court must be aware of its own remoteness and lack of familiarity with the local problems. Classification is dependent on the particular needs and specific difficulties of the community which are beyond the easy ken of the court, and which the legislature alone was competent to make.
 Consequently, lacking the capacity to inform itself fully about the peculiarities of a particular local situation, a court should hesitate to dub the legislative classification as irrational.[782 H-783 G;784 A-D; 786 G-H; 787 A] Missouri, K&T. Rly. v. May, [1904] 194 U.S.267, 269, West Coast Hotel Company v. Parrish , [1937] USSC 73; 300 U.S. 379, 400, Two Guys from Harrison-Allentown v. Mc Ginley [1961] USSC 105; 366, U.S. 582, 592, Mutual Loan Co. v. Martell, [1911] USSC 161; 56 L.Ed. 175, 180, Tianer v. Texas [1940] USSC 109; 310 U.S. 141 and Carmichel v. Southern Coal & Coke Co., 201. U.S. 495, referred to.
 (e) The question whether, under Art. 14, a classification is reasonable or unreasonable must, in the ultimate analysis depend upon the judicial approach to the problem. The more complicated society becomes, the greater the diversity of its problems and the more does legislation direct itself to the diversities. In the utilities, tax and economic regulation cases, there are good reasons for judicial self- restraint if not official deference to legislative judgment.
 The Courts have only the power to destroy but not to reconstruct. When to this are added the complexity of economic regulation, the uncertainty, the liability to error, the bewildering conflict of the experts, and the number of times the judges have been overruled by events self limitation can be seen to be the path to judicial wisdom and institutional prestige and stability. [784 F-785 D] (f) Laws regulating economic activity should be viewed differently from laws which touch and concern freedom of speech and religion, voting procreation, rights with respect to criminal procedure etc. Judicial deference to legislature in instances of economic regulation is explained by the argument that rationality of a classification depends upon local conditions about which local legislative or administrative bodies would be better informed than a court.
 [784 D-E; 786 A] (g) In the present case, the purpose of the Act is to get unpaid accumulations for utilising them. for the welfare of labour in general. It is from the factories that the greatest amount of unpaid accumulations could be collected and since the factories are bound to maintain records from which the amount of unpaid accumulations could be easily ascertained the legislature brought all the factories within the definition of 'establishment'. It then addressed itself to other establishments but thought that establishments employing less than 50 persons need not be brought within the purview of the definition as unpaid accumulations in those establishments would be less and might not be sufficient to meet the administrative expenses of collection and as many of them might not be maintaining records from which the amount of unpaid accumulations could be ascertained. Administrative convenience in the collection of unpaid accumulations is a factor to be taken into account in adjudging whether the classification is reasonable. The reason why government establishments other than factories were not included in the definition is that there are hardly any establishments run by the Central or State Government [783 F-G; 785E-H; 786 A-B] (h) The justification for including tramways and motor omnibuses within the purview of the definition is that the legislature of the State of Bombay, when it 765 enacted the Act in 1953, must have had reason to think that unpaid accumulations in these concerns would be large, because, they usually employed a. large amount of labour force' and they were bound to keep records of the wages earned and paid. [786 C-D] (i) Whether a court can remove the unreasonablenss of a classification when it is under-inclusive by extending the ambit of the legislation to cover the class omitted to be included, or by applying the doctrine of severability delete a clause which makes a classification over-inclusive, are matters on which it is not necessary to express any final opinion because the inclusion of tramway or motor omnibus service in the definition of 'establishment' does not make the classification unreasonable having regard to the purpose of the legislation.
