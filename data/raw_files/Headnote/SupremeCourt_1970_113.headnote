 The assessee- a sugar factory, carried on agricultural 'farming on a large scale and had several farms. It engaged on each farm a Manager with necessary technical, clerical and menial staff to assist him. These persons were claimed to have been employed exclusively for the purpose of the farm and were provided with accommodation, medical facilities, and the allowances. On the question whether the-expenses on the management charges of the Establishment rent inspection, repairs of bunglows and offices, expenses on car, travelling, postage periodicals, assessees' con- tribution to Provident Fund, could be allowed as expenses of cultivation under s. 6(2)(b)(iv) of the U.P. Agricultural Income-tax Act, 1948, this Court;
 
HELD : The amount claimed by the assessee as expenses on management and miscellaneous expenses could be allowed under s. 6(2) (b) (iv) if and to the extent. that it was determined that they were incurred for the management, supervision,. organisation, technical knowledge and assis- tance and other allied matters for the purpose of the raising of crops, their marketing and transportation. An apportionment may become necessary if it was determined that the entire expense was not incurred strictly for those purposes. [433 A-C] What has to be essentially determined under s. 6 (2) (b) (iv) is whether the expenses were incurred on or for the purpose of the-entire work. and ,operations involved in raising the crops, making the same fit for marketing and the transportation of the produce to the market. The word "raising the crop" cannot be confined simply to the ploughing of the land, sowing the seed and cutting the harvest. Section 6(2)(b)(iv) is not to be construed in a narrow and pedantic sense and' must be given its full effect in the background of modern large scale farming and the organisation required for it. [432 F-H] It is well known that modern agricultural farming which has become mechanised involve-,, a high degree of organisation, technical skill etc., in the same way as a well run industry. If agricultural production has to be obtained with optimum results it is necessary that there should be a propersupervisory and, other staff as also the employment of such means as would be conducive to maximum production and proper marketing of the produce. It is axiomatic that the staff would require residential accommodation which will have to be kept in a proper state of repair. The staff win also need medical attention and other amenities which are normally afforded to employees now a days. The benefit of provident fund can hardly be denied to them when it has become the accepted and normal feature in all forms of employment . in modern times. If any motor vehicle is being maintained for enabling the supervisory or other staff to took after the farm the expenses incurred thereon cannot be regarded as foreign to farming operations. 'I-he expenditure incurred on postage, telegrams, printing and stationery for the purpose 427 of and in connection with farming would also -be allowable.
 If certain periodicals are being subscribed for obtaining technical knowledge and up-to-date information in the matter of agricultural farming it is difficult to see how that could be disallowed.
