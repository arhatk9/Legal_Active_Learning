 While proceedings for assessment of the income-tax of a Hindu undivided family, of which the respondents were members, were pending, there was a partition in the family and a consequent claim for recognising the partition under s. 25-A(1) of the Income-tax Act (XI of 1922) was made before the Income-tax Officer. The officer however proceeded to assess the tax as if there was no partition and after the order of assessment was made, passed an order recognising the partition. The amount of tax determined by the officer was questioned on appeal and before the Tribunal but without success. As the tax due was in arrear, the officer sought to attach the remuneration earned by the respondents as employees of a firm, by resorting to s. 46(5) of the Act. The respondents challenged the order of the Income-tax Officer under s. 46(5), by a writ petition which was allowed by the High Court on the ground that the Income- tax Officer could not proceed to collect the tax without apportioning the tax liability under 25-A(2). In appeal to the Supreme Court, 
HELD : Though the High Court was in error in holding that an order of assessment which had become final was liable to be reopened under s.25-A(2) by the Income-tax Officer when the order under s. 25-A(1) was passed by him subsequent to the order of assessment, the appeal should be dismissed because, so long as there was an assessment of the Hindu undivided family, the liability for payment of the tax was on the property of the family and there was no personal liability on the members. [97 E-F, H] The scheme of the section is that a Hindu undivided family assessed in respect of its income, would continue to be assessed in that status notwithstanding a partition of the property among its members. If a claim is raised at the time of making an assessment that a partition had been effected, the Income-tax Officer must make an inquiry after notice to all the members of the family and make an order that the family property had been partitioned in definite portions if he is so satisfied. He is however, by law required to make the assessment on the income of the un- divided family, as if no partition had taken place and then to apportion to each member or group of members the tax- liability according to the portion of the family property allotted. In such a case the members of the family stand jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of tax, under the proviso to sub. (2) of section. It no claim for recording partition is made, or if a claim is made and it is disallowed, or the claim is not considered by the officer, the assessment will continue as if there has been no partition, and so long as the assessment is made on the income of the undivided family, the liability to satisfy the tax must be restricted to the estate of the family.
