 Regulation 9 of the Delhi Road Transport Authority Act (Conditions, of Appointment and Service Regulations), 1952 provides for termination of services in two modes. The first is -by its clause (a) by which services. may be terminated without any notice or pay in lieu of notice.
 This can be done among other reasons for misconduct. The second mode is by clause (b) by which the services may be terminated owing to reduction of establishment or in circumstances other than those mentioned in clause (a) which relate to termination without notice. When termination is made under clause (b) one month's notice or pay in lieu thereof is to be given to the employee. Regulation 15 says that a breach of the standing order will amount to misconduct, and one of the penalties imposed for misconduct is dismissal. It also prohibits an order of dismissal, removal or other punishment except censure unless the procedure laid down in clause (c) of Regulation 15 is followed. The standing- order 17 enjoins, that no employee should have recourse to a court of law without first re- sorting to the normal official channels of redress.
 The respondent, an employee of the appellant- Undertaking established under the Delhi Transport Authority Act, was demoted. He challenged the demotion by filing a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution. Thereafter the appellant-undertaking passed an order terminating the respondent's services, stating only that his services were no longer required and that one month's salary in lieu of notice would be paid. The respondent filed a suit claiming that the order was illegal. On the questions, (i) whether the respondent's services could be terminated under Regula- tion 9(b) without complying with the procedure prescribed by Regulation 15 and (it) whether although the order was made in perfectly harmless and innocuous terms and purporting to be within Regulation 9(b) it was a mere camouflage for inflicting punishment for breach of standing order 17, as the respondent had approached the High Court without exhausting the Departmental remedies, this Court, 
 HELD: (i) Even if it be assumed that the law is the same as, would be applicable to a case governed by Art. 311, it was difficult to say that the services of the respondent were not merely terminated in accordance with Regulation 9(b) which governed the conditions of his employment. It may be that the motive for termination of his services was the breach of Standing Order 17 i.e. of filing a writ petition in the High Court against the demotion without exhausting departmental remedies but the question of motive is immaterial. No charge-sheet was preferred under Regula- tion 15 nor was any enquiry held in accordance therewith before the order under Regulation 9(b) was made. It may be that if the respondent had successfully pleaded and proved malafides on the part of the authority 758 terminating his services the impugned order could be legitimately challenged but no foundation was laid in that behalf in the plaint nor was the ,question of malafides investigated by the courts below. [763 E-G] (ii) As regards the punishment having been inflicted for misconduct the order being a mere camouflage no such question could arise in the present case. Regulation 9(b) clearly empowered the authorities to terminate the services after giving one months notice or pay in lieu of notice.
 The order was unequivocally made in terms of that Regulation. Even if the employers of the respondent thought that he was a cantankerous person and it was not desirable to retain him in service it was open to them to terminate his services in terms of Regulation 9(b) and it was not necessary to dismiss him by way of punishment for misconduct. If the employer chooses to terminate the services in accordance with clause (b) of Regulation 9 after giving one month's notice or pay in lieu thereof it cannot amount to termination of service for misconduct within the meaning of clause (a). It is only when some punishment is inflicted of the nature specified in Regulation 15 for misconduct that the procedure laid down therein for an inquiry etc., becomes applicable. [763 H] S. R.
