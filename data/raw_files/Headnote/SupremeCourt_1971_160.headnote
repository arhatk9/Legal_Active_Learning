 The appellant who was a Major in the Military Engineering Service, was in charge, of the expansion work of an air strip and was given possession of the land acquired for that purpose, along with valuable crops standing on the land. He postponed giving delivery of the land to the contractor for the extension work. Instead, he allowed one of the owners of the land to cut the crop and take it away without in an way accounting for it. A charge-sheet was filed against the appellant under s. 5(1) (c) and s. 5 (1)(d) read with s.
 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. He was aquitted of the offence under s. 5(1) (d) but was convicted for the offence under s.5(1)(C)and the conviction was confirmed by the High Court.
 In appeal to this Court, it was contended inter alia (1) that the sanction given by the Government or his prosecution did not cover the trial of the charge under s. 5(1) (c); and (2) the prosecution did not examine all the witnesses necessary to unfold the story of the prosecution.
 
HELD: (1) For a sanction to be valid it must be established that the sanction was given in respect of the facts constituting the offence with which the accused is proposed to be charged. It is desirable that the facts should be referred to in the sanction itself. If they do not appear on the face of it, the prosecution must establish aliunde by evidence that those facts were placed before the sanctioning authority. The sanction must disclose that the sanctioning authority had fully applied its mind to them and the sanction should be correlated to the particular offence or offences with which the amused is charged or convicted.
 [852E-F] In the present case, the facts which the Government considered for the purpose of granting sanction were :(a) that the appellant was a public servant entrusted with crops standing on the land acquired for the extension of an air field, (b) that by abusing his position as a public servant he allowed standing crop to be cut from the said land, (c) that by corrupt or illegal means and by abusing his position as a public servant he obtained pecuniary advantage of about Rs. 2,000 as the value of the crops that were cut from the land and that he dishonestly or fraudulently misappropriated the same by converting it into his own use. Under s. 5(1) (c) of the Act a public servant shall be said to have committed the offence of misconduct-in his duties if he dishonestly allows any other person to convert to his own use property which is entrusted to the said public servant.
 The facts which have been set out in the order granting the sanction are sufficient to indicate that the authorities granting the sanction had the 849 offence under s. 5(1)(c) in their contemplation. In fact, the order specifically mentions that provision while granting sanction. Even if there was an inference or implication that the persons cutting the crops were abetting the appellant in the offence the sanction could not be held to be bad on that account.

The King, A.I.R., [1948] P.C. 82 and Jaswant Singh v. State of Punjab, [1957] INSC 89; [1958] S.C.R. 762, referred to.
 (2)With reference to each one of the person who, according to the appellant, should have been called as witnesses there was already evidence relating to the particular matter about which those persons would have given evidence. In the circumstances the non-examination of other witnesses, without anything more, could not be treated as a defect in the prosecution. [863G]
