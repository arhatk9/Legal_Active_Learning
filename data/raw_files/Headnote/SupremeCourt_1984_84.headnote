 In Harak Chand Ratan Chand Banthia's case [1969] INSC 136; [1970] 1 SCR 479, where the Gold (Control) Act, 1969 and some of its provisions prior to the amendment by Act 26 of 1969 were challenged, the Supreme Court pointed out that even though import of Gold into India had been banned, considerable quantities of contraband gold were finding their way into the country through illegal channels, affecting the national economy and hampering the country's economic stability and progress, that the Customs Department was not in a position to effectively combat the smuggling over the long borders and coast lines, that, therefore, anti-smuggling measures had to be supplemented by a detailed system of control over internal transactions and that the Gold (Control) Act, 1968 was passed for this purpose. In other words, the several restrictions that have been put on the activities of the traders doing business in gold, gold ornaments and articles of gold, will have to be viewed from the aforesaid perspective. The Court further held the enactment to be within the legislative competence of Parliament and out of the several provisions that were challenged only ss.5(2)(b), 27(2)(d), 27(6), 32, 46, 88 and 100 were invalid. As a result of the aforesaid decisions and the observations made by this Court therein the Act of 1968 was suitably amended by Gold Control (Amendment) Act (26) of 1969. These amended provisions, the Gold Control (Identification of Customers) Rules, 1969, the Gold Control (Forms, Fees and Miscellaneous Matters) Rules 1968 are challenged by the Writ Petitioners as being violative of the provisions of Article 14, 19(1)(g), 301, and 302 of the Constitution. Some of the petitioners including the petitioners in S.L.P. Civil 538 of 1973 have also challenged the Government of India's Letter of instructions and the Trade Notices withdrawing the facility of permitting licensed dealers to send ornaments for sale through their travelling salesmen, on the same grounds.
 Dismissing the petitions, the Court 462 ^ 
 HELD:1:1, Section 16(7) of the Gold (Control) Act, 1968 as amended is constitutionally valid. [269E, 471B] 1:2. The counter-affidavit of the Union of India not merely furnishes the intelligible classification made between the licensed dealers and non-dealers and non- refiners, but also shows that the classification has a reasonable nexus with the object of the Act and the reasons for denying exemption limits to licensed dealers or refiners are also valid and referable to the object of the Act, namely "to provide, in the economic and financial interests of the community, for the control of production, manufacture, supply distribution, use and possession of and business in, gold ornaments and articles of gold and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.,' [469F, 470D-E] While ordinary citizens (non-dealers and non-refiners) are not permitted by law to have any primary gold in their possession a dealer or a refiner is permitted under the law to have unlimited quantity of primary gold in his possession and therefore, it is easy for a dealer or a refiner to acquire smuggled gold and with a view to preventing detection of such gold, to convert the same into ornaments and to claim such ornaments as his personal property. This necessitated a provision for a declaration of all ornaments and articles, owned, possessed. Held or controlled by them so that they could not claim any clandestinely manufactured ornaments, when detected to be their personal property and that is why it has been provided in s.16(7) that every licensed dealer or refiner should declare all gold articles and ornaments which belong to him or which are in his custody, possession or control, and that is why it has been further provided that the exemption. limits permissible for general public in relation to the requirement of declaration of articles and ornaments should not be available to the dealers and refiners. [469G-H, 470B-D] 1:3. the provision in section 16(7) could not be regarded as unnecessary or one which casts an unreasonable burden on the licensed dealer or refiner. The reasons for introducing the provision justify its enactments, if the objects of the Act are to be achieved. On the aspect of casting unreasonable burden on the dealer refiner, firstly, the burden on the dealer or refiner is the same as that which has been cast on a non-dealer (individual or family) whenever the latter comes to own, possess, hold or have under his control articles or ornaments of gold in excess of the exempted limit; secondly visits of guests and relations (including married daughters and sisters) on festive occasions and requests proceeding from them to the house- keeper to keep their ornaments in safe custody during their stays with him, which are ordinary incidents in life, are common to licensed dealers or refiners and non-dealers and therefore the requirement of making a declaration under section 16(7) does not cast any additional burden on him;
 and thirdly under section 16(7) it is provided that the licensed dealer or refiner shall make a declaration "in accordance with the provisions of this section" which means he has to do so within 30 days of his acquiring the ownership, possession, custody or control of such gold. With such time limit being provided the burden cast cannot be said to be unreasonable, especially when the provision is found to be necessary to carry out the objectives of the Act, [470E-H, 471A-B] 463 2:1. Section 52 of the Gold (Control) Act, 1968 as amended does not suffer from the vice of excessive delegation of the power and therefore the said provision is constitutional. [472G-H] 2:2. It is true that section 52 does not contain any guide-lines or principles which would regulate the exercise of the power of the Administrator in the matter of grant or refusal of approval to change in the partnership of a firm but in the exercise of the powers conferred by s.114 read with s.27(6) of the Act the Central Government has framed the 'Gold Control (Licensing of Dealers) Rules 1969' and Rule 2 enlists matters to which regard is to be had before issuing a licence and Rule 3 indicates the conditions on the fulfillment of which a licence could be renewed. It is true that these Rules, which deal with licensing of dealers and renewal of their licences, in terms do not cover a case of a change in the partnership of a firm and the approval to be accorded thereto by the Administrator but in a sense a case of a change occurring in the partnership of the firm and the occasion to apply for grant of approval thereto by the Administrator would be a case of seeking renewal of the licence by the firm in which a change has occurred either by death or retirement of a partner or as a result of reconstitution of the firm and therefore to such a case these Licensing Rules, particularly Rule 3, must and will apply and these rules, in so far as they are applicable to the situation, afford the necessary guide-lines on the basis of which approval to the change could be given or refused.
 Obviously, if the change in the firm involves introduction of a new partner into the firm these guide-lines under Rules 2 and 3 will play an important part in the matter of according or refusing to accord the approval but if the change nearly involves alteration in the share-capital or profit sharing basis amongst the self-same partners who continue the firm the approval would be a matter of formality, in view of the Licensing Rules, 1969 which must apply, it cannot be said that any unfettered or unregulated discretion has been conferred upon the Administrator in the matter of grant of refusal of approval to a change in the partnership of a firm. [471H, 472A-E] 2:3. On the aspect of absence of a provision from appeal, a remedy by way of an appeal to correct any erroneous order that may be passed under section 52 has been provided for by Notification dated 26 August, 1983 issued by the Administrator under sec. 4(4) of the Act whereunder the exercise of the power under sec. 52 has been delegated to the Deputy Collector of the Centre Excise with the result that an appeal against his order under s 52 will lie to the Collector of Centre Excise under s.80 of the Act. [472E-G] 
 3. The power to grant extension under section 79 of the gold (Control) Act as amended is not arbitrary and does not suffer from lack of guidelines. Of course two in built safeguards will have to be and must be read into the provision. Since every extension involves civil consequence in that the owner's or the concerned person's right to have the seized gold returned to him is adversely affected by being postponed, before granting any extension he must be given a notice and an opportunity to make representation against the proposed extension. 474H,475A-B] 464 It is true that s.79 does not expressly mention the guidelines on the basis of which the power to grant extension of the initial period of six months is to be exercised but if regard is had to the provisions dealing with Seizure (s.66), Confiscation (s.71), Adjudication (s.78) and Giving of Opportunity (s.79) the Policy of the Legislature becomes quite clear that whereas the power to seize can be exercised by any Gold Control Officer if he has reason to believe" that in respect of any gold any provision of the Act has been or is being or is attempted to be contravened the confiscation of gold can take place only if actual contravention has taken place or is apprehended or is attempted and such confiscation can be adjudged or ordered without limit by a Gold Control Officer not below the rank of a Collector of Central Excise or of Customs and subject to such limits as may be specified in that behalf by such other Gold Control officer not below the rank of a Superintendent of Central Excise as the Central Governments may authorise in that behalf; but the power to grant extension of the initial period of six months has been conferred under the second proviso to s.79 only upon a superior officer, namely the Collector of Central Excise or of customs, Further under the second proviso to s.79 the owner or the person concerned has been given the right to have the seized gold returned to him where no notice proposing confiscation is served upon him within a period of six months from the date of the seizure of the gold which shows that the Legislature clearly intended that ordinarily the investigation in connection with the seized gold is expected to be over within six months; but only in cases where such investigation may not be completed owing to some genuine or bonafide difficulties the Legislature gave under the proviso power to the Collector to extend that time. In other words Collector is expected to pass extension orders neither mechanically nor as a matter of routine but only on being satisfied that facts or circumstances exist which indicate that the investigation could not be completed for bona fide reasons within the initial period of six months.
 Such guidelines would be implicit if the extra-ordinary power to effect seizure and adjudge confiscation conferred by the Act is considered in just apposition with the right conferred upon the owner or the person concerned to have the seized gold returned to him normally at the expiry of the initial period of six months. Presumably, the ramifications of any gold smuggling activity which are usually extensive and complicated must have led the Legislature not to impose a limit or ceiling on the power to grant extension but if the above guidelines are to govern every extension that may be granted then mere absence of a limit or ceiling will not be of any consequence.

 4:1 Section 100 of the Gold Control Act read with Rule 3(1) of the Gold Control (Identification of Customers) Rules, 1968 is constitutionally valid and does not restrict the licensed dealers to carry on their business including their inter-state trade.[478F-G] 4:2. Section 100 of the Act as it originally stood prior to its amendment in 1969 imposed a statutory obligation upon a dealer to take all reasonable steps to satisfy himself about the identity of the person from whom gold was bought but it did not specify the nature of steps which a dealer was supposed to take 465 for such satisfaction and therefore this Court in Harakchand Ratanchand Banthia's case took the view that the obligation cast thereunder was uncertain and incapable of proper compliance and therefore the section was unconstitutional on the ground that it imposed an impossible and unreasonable burden. In the light of this decision, s.100 was appropriately amended and the 'Gold Control (Identification of Customers) Rules, 1969 were framed and particularly Rule 3(1) now prescribed the several steps one or more of which have to be taken by the licensed dealer to satisfy himself as to the identity of the Customer from whom he proposes to accept, buy or otherwise receive any gold, 477E-G] 4:3. From the mere fact that most of the customers who come from villages as also from outside their own State prefer to receive payments in cash in lieu of gold sold and are not prepared to receive payments by crossed cheques for the reason that they do not have any bank account or their apprehension that the said cheques may not be encashed, it cannot be said compliance is either incapable or impossible even from a practical or commercial point of view. Moreover, the provisions contained in sub-rule (2)(a) of Rule 3 is applicable in all cases where gold is accepted bought or otherwise received by the dealer irrespective of whether the customer is personally known to the dealer or not known to him. The purpose served by sub-rule (2)(a) of Rule 3 is entirely different from the purpose served by one or more of the steps that are required to be taken by a dealer under sub-rule (1) of Rule 3 and therefore, it cannot be said that because of the provisions contained in sub-rule 2(a) the steps contemplated under sub-rule (1) are unreasonable.

 5. The amended prescribed forms Nos.G.S.11 and G.S.12 required to be maintained under section 55 of the Gold Control Act read with Rule 11 of the Gold control (Forms Fees, and Miscellaneous Matters) Rules, 1968 brought into force with effect from 31st October, 1975 do not provide, as conceded by the Government, for all the situations under which gold would be received by him in his possession or custody and keeping the account of their gold in accordance with the said Forms would give rise to anomalies and the dealer would not be able to discharge his statutory duty of disclosing a true and complete account of the gold in his possession or custody.[478H, 479G-H] Therefore, the Court directed the Administrator to look into these grievances and remedy the same by taking appropriate action and hope that in the meanwhile no action penal or otherwise would be taken against licensed dealers for failure to maintain accounts in the amended Forms G,S.11 and G.S. 12. [480C-D] 
 6. Section 27(7)(b) of the Gold Control Act, which confines a licensed dealer to carry on business as such dealer to the premises specified in his licence, being regulatory in character does not violate any of his rights under the constitution. The Letter of Instructions or the trade Notices does not prevent or stop inter State trade but were issued with a view to prevent the several malpractices that were indulged in while availing of the facility of hawking ornaments through travelling salesmen.
