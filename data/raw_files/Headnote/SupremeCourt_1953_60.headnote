 The assessee who carried on business in bullion and shares kept accounts in the mercantile system and the method adopted by him for ascertaining his profits was to value stock at the beginning and close of each year at cost price.
 In the accounting year he withdrew some silver bars and shares from the business and settled them in trusts, and in the accounts of the business he valued them at the close of the year at cost price Held, per PATANJALI SASTRI C. J., S. R. DAS, VIVIAN BosE and GHULAM HASAN JJ. (BHAGWATI J. dissenting)-that the assessee was entitled to value them at cost price and was not bound to credit the business with their market price at the close of the year for ascertaining his assessable profits for the year.
 BHAGWATI J. So far as the business was concerned it made no difference whether the stock-in-trade was realised or withdrawn from the business and the business was entitled to be credited with the market value of the assets withdrawn as at the date of the withdrawal, whatever be the method employed by the assessee for the valuation of its stock-in- trade on hand at the close of the year.
