 For the purpose of making it easier to secure permits in respect of non nationalised routes and to simplify the procedure for this purpose s.47 of the Motor Vehicles Act was amended by inserting s.43-A of the Motor Vehicles (U.P.
 Amendment) Act, 1972. The section provides that, in the case of non-nationalised routes. if the State Government is of the opinion that it is in the public interest to grant permits to all eligible applicants it may by notification in the gazette, issue a direction accordingly. A Notification was issued by the State Government. The appellant, questioned the validity of the section as well as of the notification both of which were upheld by the High Court.
 On appeal it was contended (i) that the State Government issued the impugned notification without applying its mind, as such a notification under s.43-A(2) could have been is- sued only in public interest; (ii) that the deletion of s.47(3) would have the effect of removing the limit on the number of permits for intra-region routes but that fact would not prevent the imposition of a limit for the number of permits for inter-region routes; and (3) that the impugned notification is violative of the rights of the appellants under Art. 19)1)(f) and' (g) of the Constitution.
 Dismissing the appeal, HELD : There is no infirmity in the impugned notification.
 Sub-section 2 of s. 43A gives power to the State Government to issue directions in respect of non-nationalised routes and areas by means of notification in case the Government is of the opinion that it is in the public interest to grant permits to all eligible applicants. The impugned notification recites that the State Government is of the opinion that it is in the public interest to grant permits for non-nationalised routes and areas to all eligible applicants. The notification thus ,gives all the particulars which are required by the statute. The notification removed the bar created by the limit on the number of permits for buses which ,could be issued and facilitates the issue of such permits to fresh applicants if they satisfy the requirement of eligibility. Any measure which results in larger number of buses operating on various routes would necessarily eliminate or in any case minimise long hours of waiting at the bus stands. [920 G;
 921 A-B] (2) There is no valid basis for the inference that if there is no limit on the number of permits for intra-region routes, limit on the number of permits for inter-region routes would have to be imposed. The object of the impugned notification is to liberalise the issue of permits and it is difficult to see how such a liberal measure can have the effect of introducing strictness or stringency in the matter of grant of permits for inter-region routes. [921 E] (3) There is no valid basis for holding that the impugned provisions were violative of Art. 19. There is nothing in the notification which prevents the appellants from acquiring, holding and disposing of their property or prevents them from practising any profession or from carrying on any occupation. trade or business. The fact that some others have also been enabled to obtain permit for running buses cannot constitute a violation of the appellants' right founder the above two clauses of Art. 19 of the Constitution.
