 Respondent No.1 - an employee of the State Government was allotted on lease a two-roomed flat. Clause (7) of the agreement of tenancy provided that the premises shall be used exclusively for the purpose of the residence of Respondent No.1 and the members of his family. At that time the family of the Respondent No.1 consisted of himself, his elder brother and three unmarried sisters. In the year 1959, Respondent No.1 got married and alongwith his wife shifted to another flat taken on lease. His elder brother and two unmarried sisters continued to be in occupation of the flat.
 The Prescribed Authority under the West Bengal Government Premises (Tenancy Regulation) Act, 1976 issued a notice to Respondent No.1 calling upon him to quit and deliver possession of the flat on the ground that the tenancy had automatically terminated as provided in s.3(2) of the Act because he had ceased to occupy it and that cl.
 (7) of the agreement of the tenancy had been violated.
 Respondent No. 1 filed a Writ Petition under Article 226 alleging that since Respondent No.2 was his elder brother he was a member of his family and he was entitled to live in the flat even though Respondent No.1 himself was not living therein. The petition was dismissed by a Single Judge.
 In appeal, the Division Bench held that cl. (7) of the agreement of tenancy was not violated even if the tenant had himself ceased to occupy and a member of his family continued to reside in the flat, and allowed the appeal.
 516 Allowing the appeal by the State to this Court, ^ 
 HELD: 1. Respondent No. 1 violated cl.(7) of the agreement of tenancy when he ceased to occupy the premises himself. The judgment of the Division Bench is set aside and that of the Single Judge is restored. [521 A-B] 
 2. What cl.(7) of the agreement of tenancy stipulates is that the premises can be used by respondent No. 1 and the members of his family, that is to say, respondent No.1 could stay himself along with his family members and not by respondent No.1 or the members of his family. As long as respondent No. 1 is residing in the premises he could accommodate along with him any other member of his family in the premises. But when he ceases to reside in the premises and occupies other premises for residence as a separate unit other members constituting a separate unit cannot in their own right as a separate unit continue to get the same without violating cl.(7) of the agreement of tenancy. It is the condition of the lease that the tenant in whose favour the premises are leased should reside in the premises let to him and not in some other premises during the currency of the lease.

 3. To meet the growing demand for Government premises the State Legislature had to amend the Act by the West Bengal Act XLVI of 1980, by introducing cl. (ia) in sub-s.
 (2) of s.3 of the Act which provided that a tenancy in respect of a Government Premises would stand automatically terminated without any notice to quit where the tenant had subsequently built a house or acquired (by purchase, gift, inheritance, lease, exchange or otherwise) a house or an apartment, either in his own name or in the name of any member of his family, within a reasonable distance from such Government premises.
