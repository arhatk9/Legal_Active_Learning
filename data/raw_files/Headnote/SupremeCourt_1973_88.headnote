 The first respondent was declared elected to Tamil Nadu Legislative. Assembly defeating his nearest rival, the petitioner. This appeal arises out of the dismissal of the election petition filed by the appellant for setting aside the result of that election. Many grounds had been urged before the High Court; but only one ground. which the High Court refused to go into was urged before this Court: i.e., that on the date of presenting his nomination paper, the 1st respondent had a subsisting contract with the State Government to widen a road at an estimated cost of Rs. 2 lakhs and that on the eve of presentation of nomination papers, he purported to surrender the contract by submitting an application for cancellation to the Division Engineer.
 whereas the contract was signed by the Superintending Engineer, Madras Circle on behalf of the Government of Tamil Nadu, and this letter of cancellation was not valid and therefore there was no valid cancellation of the contract, and as such, the election of the 1st responder., was void on that ground.
 The High Court, however, refused to go into the 'allegation on the ground that there was no specific averment in the petition that due to alleged improper reception on the 1st respondent's nomination paper, the election result had been materially affected.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) Under s. 83(1)(a), an election petition shall contain a concise statement of material facts on which the petitioner relies. Under s. 100(1) if the High Court is of opinion that on the date of his election, a returned candi- date was not qualified to be chosen to fill the seat or that the result of the election has been materially affected by the improper acceptance of any nomination etc.; the High Court shall declare the election of the returned candidate void. Therefore. what section 100 requires is that the High Court before it declares the election of a returned candidate void, should be of the opinion that the result of the election, in so far as it concerns a returned candidate, has been materially affected by the improper acceptance of any nomination. Under s. 83, all that was necessary was a concise statement of the material facts on which the petitioner relies.
 (ii) In the present case, the appellant had stated that the election is void because of the improper acceptance of the 1st respondents nomination. It was not necessary for him to further allege that the result of the election in so far as it concerns the returned candidate has been materially affected by the improper acceptance of the 1st respondent's nomination. That is the obvious conclusion to be drawn from the circumstances of this case. Further, the question of the election being materially affected does not arise in a case falling under 100(1 ) (a). All that s. 100(1 ) (a) requires is that on the date of this election a returned candidate was not qualified or was disqualified to be chosen to fill the seat under the Constitution or the Act. Under this section in order' to declare his election void it is not necessary that election petition should state that the result of the election was materially affected thereby.
