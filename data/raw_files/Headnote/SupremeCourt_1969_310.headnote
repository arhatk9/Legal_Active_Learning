 One of the terms of the lease relating to a cinema house was that after the expiry of the lease, the lessee shall have the option to renew the; lease with the consent of the lessor At the end of the lease period, the lessor brought a suit for ejectment, but died during its pendency. On December 23, 1958, the suit was compromised between the legal representatives of the lessor and the lessees. By the compromise; the tenancy was continued till December 31, 1962 on the terms and conditions of the original lease, and the lessees were to vacate the premises on January 1, 1963. One of the, legal representatives sold his share in the cinema house to the appellant who sought execution of the compromise, decree on January 4, 1963. The respondents (lessees) contended that the compromise created a fresh lease, that the decree was only a declaratory one and that they were entitled to an extension of the lease on the basis of the renewal clause incorporated into the fresh lease.
 
HELD : (1) The question whether under the terms of a compromise the parties entered into a fresh lease or were only granted an extension of time for de-livery of possession depends upon the intention of parties as expressed in the, compromise and the decree based on it. On the terms of the compromise in the present case, the lessors had granted a fresh lease and the lessees were given the option to renew the lease, which was one of the terms of the original lease, at the end of the term fixed, that is 31st December 1962. Hence, the direction in the compromise decree to vacate at the end of the term would be ineffective and would not amount to an ejectment decree. It is at best a declaration of the right of the lessors to eject the lessees at the end of the lease period if the lessees fail to get a renewal. [118 B-C, G-H; 119 A-B] (2) Merely because the compromise had fixed the period during which the respondents continued as lessess, it did not mean, that the renewal clause in the original lease had not become one of the terms of the agreement. [119 D-E] (3) Nor was the renewal clause meaningless on the ground the lessees were entitled to a renewal only if the lessors consented. The right of the lessors to give consent must be read in the context of the lessees' entitlement to get the renewal. So read, the lessors could withhold their consent either because of the lessees' failure to observe one or other of the material terms of the lease or on some other reasonable ground. The lessor could not unreasonably withhold consent when the lessee exercised the option of renewal. [119 E-G; 120 A-B] 115
