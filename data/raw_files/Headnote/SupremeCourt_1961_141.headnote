 The petitioners were granted certificates of registration as Indian Citizens under s. 5(1)(a) of the Citizenship Act, 955, by the Collector of Nagaur. Later the Collector passed orders canceling the certificates. The power to cancel was based on 773 S. 10 (2)(a) Of the Citizenship Act, 1955, and S. 21 Of the General Clauses Act, 1897.
 Held, that S. 10(2(a) of the Citizenship Act, 1955, had no application for, apart from any other considerations, that section could apply only where the registration was obtained by means of fraud, false representation or concealment of any material fact and no such thing had been proved.
 The Collector had no power under S. 21 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, either to cancel the order of registration as citizens which had been made by him since the orders mentioned in that section are not of the kind contemplated by S. 5 Of the Citizenship Act.
 The orders canceling the registration are set aside.
