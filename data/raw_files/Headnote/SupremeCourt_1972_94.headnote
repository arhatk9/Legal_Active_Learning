 Section 210 of the Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporation Act, 1949 authorises the Municipal Commissioner to prescribe the "regular line of a public street". If a building or a part of building is within the regular line of a public street the Commissioner may under s. 212 require the owner to pull down the building or part thereof, which is within the regular line of the street. On this failure to do so, the Commissioner is entitled to pull down the offending part of the building at the cost of the owner. The land so vacated is to vest in the corporation. Section 216(i) lays down that compensation shall be paid by the Commissioner to the owner "for any loss" which the owner may sustain and for "any expense" incurred by such owner in consequence of the order made by the Commissioner. Proviso (i) to section 216 prescribes that "any increase or decrease in the value of the remainder ,of the property of which the building or land so acquired formed part, likely to accrue from the setback to the regular line of the street shall be taken into consideration and allowed for in determining the amount of such compensation. Under proviso (ii) "if any such increase in value exceeds the amount of loss sustained or expenses incurred by the said owner, the Commissioner may recover from such owner half the amount of such excess as betterment charge.". The Act gives the owner who is aggrieved by the amount of compensation offered to him, the right to appeal to the judge of the Small Causes Court and to the District judge in second appeal.
 Acting under s. 212 the Commissioner issued notices to the respondents to pull down parts of their building lying within the regular line of the street. The respondents filed writ petitions contending that section 212 was unconstitutional in' so far as it violated the provisions of section 299 of the Government of India Act, 1935, and also of article 31 of' the Constitution. It was urged that the Act did not (i) provide for payment of compensation for property acquired and (ii) specify the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation was to be determined. The validity of section 212 and other allied sections was also challenged on the ground that they infringed articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution. The High Court, upholding the challenge under s.299 of the Government of India Act, held that the Act provided for payment of compensation 'out did not specify the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation was to be determined. In view of this finding the High Court did not consider the challenge 'on 2 the other grounds. In this Court it was argued that the two provisos to sub-section (i) of s. 216 if given effect to nullified the direction in subsection (1) for payment of compensation and when reduced in the Contingencies visualized in the provisos the compensation turned out to be illusory.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD: that the order passed by the High Court had to be set asid and the proceedings transmitted to the High Court for disposal in accordance with the law.
 (i) The High Court was right in holding that the Act provided for payment of. compensation for property acquired under s. 212. Section 216 and 389 read together make it clear that full indemnification in terms of money for the loss caused is to be made to the owner of the property or other interest affected by reason of the exercise of the power under s. 212. That the compensation may in some rare contingencies be very much reduced after taking into account the value of the benefit conferred on the owner by reason the widening of the street is no adequate reason to hold that the Act does not provide for payment of compensation.
 Both the provisos come into play only after the compensation for loss is determined under sub-section (i) of section 216 and since that subsection declares that full compensation must be paid for the loss or deprivations suffered by the owner it must be held that the Act provides for the payment of compensation for the property acquired. [9D11 F-G].
 (ii) The Act specifies the principles on which and the manner in which compensation is to be determined.
 Having regard to the fact that in' the course of widening the street the Corporation may have to acquire very irregular, shapeless and small pieces of land for the purpose. of the street,, a host of principles may have to be employed to determine the compensation. This very difficulty in specifying any known rule of compensation is responsible for the wording of section 216 and section 3 $9 of the Act which gets over the difficulty by providing full indemnification for the loss or deprivation suffered by the owner of the building or other interests in the propert y. .,The involvement of civil courts in finally determining compensation imports judicial norms and since full indemnification in accordance with judicial norms is the goal set by the Act,. it is, implicit in such a provision that the rules for determination of compensation shall be appropriate, to the property acquired and such as will achieve the goal of full indemnity against loss. This, by itself, is a specification of a principle for the deter- mination of compensation. [13-A-D] State of Gujarat v. Shri Shantilal Mangaldas & Ors., [1969] INSC 8; [1969] (3) S.C.R. 341 at p. 357, referred to.
 Under s. 390 the Commissioner or such other officer as may be authorised by him shall hold such inquiry as he thinks fit and determine the amount of compensation to be paid.
 Since there is an appeal from such determination to the judge of the small causes court and a second appeal to the District court it is clear that the enquiry must be held on broad judicial lines. There are no limitations placed on the powers of the appellate judges in determining the loss in a just and appropriate manner; therefore, the Commissioner or his authorised officer who holds the enquiry in, the first instance,, will be guided by principles which meet with the approval of the appellate authorities.
