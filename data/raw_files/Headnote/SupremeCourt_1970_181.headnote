 A partnership deed entered into between the appellant and the respondent contained a clause for reference "of all disputes and questions whatsoever which may arise during partnership or afterwards between the partners touching the partnership agreement including division of assets, debts or liabilities", to arbitration. When disputes arose, the respondent claimed that the partners had reached an oral agreement stipulating that the appellant was to retire from the partnership and was to assign and transfer to the respondent his rights, title and interest in the partnership business. The appellant denied the two agreements set Lip by the respondent. Subsequently, the dispute was referred to arbitration. The appellant submitted to arbitration without prejudice to his stand that the arbitrators had no jurisdiction to go into the question of the alleged agreement Set up by the respondent. The arbitrators were unable to make an award within the period prescribed by the Arbitration Act. The appellant then submitted an application to the High Court under s. 33 of the Arbitration Act contending that the agreement set tip by the respondent gave rise to new rights and obligations between the parties and to a dispute relating to these rights and obligations created by the new agreement the arbitration clause of the partnership agreement bad no application. The High Court rejected the contention. Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : The clause "all disputes and questions whatsoever which may arise during the partnership or afterwards between the partners touching the partnership agreement including division of assets, debts and liabilities" clearly covers a dispute whether the parties agreed that the partnership be dissolved. The agreement set up by the respondent while maintaining the covenants of the partnership agreement seeks to dissolve the partnership and to settle the rights and obligations of the partners arising out of the dissolution of the partnership. A dispute whether the partnership was dissolved by mutual agreement was clearly a dispute between the parties touching the partnership agreement. [102 F-G]
