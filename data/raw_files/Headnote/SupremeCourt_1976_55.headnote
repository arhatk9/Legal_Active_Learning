 Under the terms and conditions of sale the respondents, who were the highest bidders at an auction of forest produce, were called upon to pay stamp duty on the agreements to be executed by them as if they were leases of immovable property falling under Art. 31(c) and on the deposits of security as mortgages under art. 35(c) of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 as also sales tax on the bid amounts.
 In a petition under art. 226, the respondents contended that the right to pluck, collect and take away the forest produce was not a right or interest in immovable property within the meaning of art. 31(c) of the Stamp Act, the security deposits were not mortgages nor did the Government carry on any business of sale and, as such, they were not liable to pay the amounts demanded. The High Court allowed the petitions.
 Dismissing the State's appeal, ^ 
 HELD : The acquisition by the respondents not being an interest in the soil but merely a right to cut the fructus naturales, the agreements possessed the characteristics of licences and did not amount to leases so as to attract the applicability of art. 31 (c) of the Stamp Act.

 (1) A study of the definitions of immovable property occurring in the Transfer of Property Act, the Registration Act and the General Clauses Act shows that it is the creation of an interest in immovable property or a right to possess it that distinguishes a lease from a licence. A licence does not create an interest in the property to which it relates while a lease does. In the case of a lease there is transfer of a right to enjoy the property. For the purpose of deciding whether a particular grant amounts to a lease or a licence, it is essential to look to the substance and essence of the agreement and not to its form.

 Mahadeo v. State of Bombay [1959] INSC 20; 1959 S.C.J. 1021: AIR 1959 S.C. 735 distinguished.
 In the instant case the salient features emerging from the agreements are (i) that they were made for a short duration of 9 to 10 months; (ii) they did not create any estate or interest in the land and (iii) the respondents were not granted exclusive possession and control of the land but were merely granted the right to pluck, cut, carry away and appropriate the forest produce, present or future.
 The right to go on the land was only ancillary to the real purpose of the contract. [667C-D] 662 (2) The respondent could not be called upon to pay stamp duty under Art. 35(c) of the Stamp Act. For an instrument to fall within the definition of mortgage deed contained in s. 2(17) of the Stamp Act it is necessary that it should satisfy the essential conditions by creating a right over or in respect of a specified property in favour of another person. [671D; 670G] In the instant case there is nothing in the relevant clause of the sale notice to indicate that any right over or in the security deposits was created in favour of the State Government.

 (3) (a) The respondents were not liable to pay sales tax. It cannot be said that the Government, by holding auction of forest produce, carried on business in the sale of that class of goods, which is an essential condition to make the respondents liable to pay sales tax.

 (b) The consideration of profit motive cannot be regarded as an essential ingredient of the term 'business' in view of the amendment in the definition of 'dealer' in 1966. The auctions were carried on only annually and not at frequent intervals. The important element of frequency being lacking it cannot be held that the Government was carrying on the business of sale of forest produce. [669D-E] P.T.C.C.S. Merchants Union v.
