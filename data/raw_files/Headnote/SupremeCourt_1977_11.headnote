 The appellant agreed to sell certain land to the re- spondents by an agreement for sale entered into between the parties for Rs. 17,000/-. The respondent was put in posses- sion pursuant to the said agreement after Rs. 12,000/were paid. He failed to pay the balance of Rs. 5,000/- in spite of demand by the appellant The appellant filed a suit for possession of the land and, in the alternative, for a decree for Rs. 5,000/- with interest.
 The respondent contended that the agreed price was Rs.
 12,000/- which was already paid and that, therefore, Rs.
 5,000/- were not payable. The respondent contended that if the court came to the conclusion that Rs. 17,000/- was the agreed price .then the Court should take into account cer- tain amount which was already paid by the respondent.
 The Trial Court decreed the appellant's suit for posses- sion and came to the conclusion that the agreed price was Rs. 17,000/-. The High Court in an appeal confirmed the finding of the Trial Court that the agreed price was Rs.
 17.000/-. The High Court, however, granted the decree of Rs. 5,000/with interest but refused the prayer for posses- sion.
 Allowing the appeal, 
 HELD: (1) The respondent was never ready and willing to perform the agreement as alleged by the appellant. One of the ingredients of part performance under s. 53A of the Transfer of. Property Act is that the transferee has taken possession in part performance of the contract. In the present case. there was no performance in part by the respondent of the contract between the parties. The doc- trine of part performance is a defence. It is generally not a sword but a shield. The act of part performance must be such as not only to be referable to a contract such as that alleged but to be referable to no other title Section 53A requires a positive act of readiness and. willingness on the part of the transferee to perform the agreement. [624 A-E] (2) The High Court wrongly found that there was an extension of the performance of the contract by one year.
 There was no issue raised on that point. It is well settled that there should be specific issues on questions of fact. The contention that the appellant could not put an end to the contract if there was failure on the part of the respondent to perform the agreement fallacious. [624 F-G] (3) It was not open to the respondent to challenge the finding of the High Court that the agreement was for Rs.
 17000/-. The respondent can certainly support the judgment on any ground which is open to him under 'the impugned judgment. The respondent did not file any Cross-objection on the finding in the judgment of High Court about the price of the agreement. It is therefore, not open to him to challenge the finding. [623 G-H] 622 (4) The contention of the respondent that certificate was not competent because the value all along had not been over Rs. 20,000/- cannot be allowed to be taken at the late stage. If the respondent had taken this point at the time when the matter was heard in the High Court the appellant could have satisfied the High Court. Such a plea was not' raised even in the statement o! case. [623 D-F] State of Assam and lint. etc. v. Basanta Kumar Dass etc.
