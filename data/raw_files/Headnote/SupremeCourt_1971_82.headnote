 The House of the People was dissolved by the President of India on 27th December 1970. On the question whether the respondent, who was the Prime Minister before the dissolution, ceased to hold office thereafter, 
HELD: There is nothing in the Constitution and in particular in Art. 75(3) which renders the respondent functioning as Prime Minister contrary to the Constitution.
 The Indian Constitution establishes a Parliamentary system of Government with a Cabinet, and not a Presidential form.
 Article 75(3) brings into existence responsible Government, that is, the Council of Ministers must enjoy the confidence of the House of the People. In the context, it can only mean that Art. 75(3) applies when the House of the People does not stand dissolved or prorogued, for, when it is dissolved, the Council of Ministers cannot naturally enjoy the confidence of the House. But such dissolution of the House does not require that the Prime Minister and other ministers must resign, or cease to hold office or must be dismissed by the President, because, Art. 74(1). is mandatory and the President cannot exercise his executive power without the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, with the Prime Minister at the head. [51 B-C, D- H] This view is also in accordance with the conventions followed not only in the United Kingdom but in the countries following a similar system of responsible government. [52 DI
