 The appellants were arrested in the forenoon of July 19, 1985 in connection with a riot which resulted in a toll of human lives and huge destruction of property. They were produced before the Munsiff Magistrate on July 20, 1985 and were remanded to judicial custody till October 18, 1985.
 The police filed a charge-sheet against the appellants on October 17, 1985 that being the 90th day of remand. Even so, the appellants filed a petition before the Magistrate and sought enlargement on bail in terms of proviso (a) to s.
 167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The learned Magistrate, overruling the objection of the State, granted bail to the appellants on the ground that the period of 90 days stipulated in the proviso had to be reckoned from the date of arrest and not from the date of remand and so computed, the charge-sheet had not been filed on the 90th day but on 91st day and hence the accused/appellants were entitled to bail. The respondent-State challenged the order of bail before the High Court by means of a petition under s. 439(2) of the Code. A Single Judge of the High Court allowed the petition holding that the period of 90 days envisaged by the proviso to s. 167(2) has to be computed only from the date of remand and therefore cancelled the bail and directed the magistrate to issue warrants of arrest for the appellants.
 Dismissing the appeal of the appellants-accused.
 ^ 
 HELD: 1. The High Court was right in allowing the petition filed by the State for cancellation of the bail granted to the appellants. As the Munsiff Magistrate has granted bail to the appellants before the expiry of 90 days of remand period allowed under law, the order of the Magistrate 1129 will not tantamount to one passed under the provisions of Chapter XXXIII of the Code and hence there is no scope for contending that re-arrest of the appellants can be ordered only in terms of sub-s.(5) of s.437. After the appellants surrender themselves to custody or are taken into custody by re-arrest, they will not stand precluded from seeking enlargement on bail by filing applications under sub-s.(i) of s. 437 of the Code and satisfying the court that they deserve to be enlarged on bail. [1148 G-H; 1149 A-B] 2.(i) On a reading of the sub-ss.(1) and (2) it may be seen that sub-s.(1) is a mandatory provision governing what a police officer should do when a person is arrested and detained in custody and it appears that the investigation cannot be completed within the period of 24 hours fixed by s.57. Sub-s.(2) on the other hand pertains to the powers of remand available to a Magistrate and the manner in which such powers should be exercised. The terms of sub-s. (1) of s. 167 have to be read in conjunction with s. 57. Section 57 interdicts a police officer from keeping in custody a person without warrant for a longer period than 24 hours without production before a Magistrate, subject to the exception that the time taken for performing journey from the place of arrest to the Magistrate's court can be excluded from the prescribed period of 24 hours. Since sub-s. (1) provides that if the investigation cannot be completed within the period of 24 hours fixed by s. 57 the accused has to be forwarded to the Magistrate alongwith the entries in the Diary, it follows that a police officer is entitled to keep an arrested person in custody for a maximum period of 24 hours for purposes of investigation. The resultant position is that the initial period of custody of an arrested person till he is produced before a Magistrate is neither referable to nor in pursuance of an order of remand passed by a Magistrate. In fact the powers of remand given to a Magistrate become exercisable only after an accused is produced before him in terms of sub-s. (1) of s. 167. [1138 B-G] 2.(ii) Sub-s. (2) of s. 167 empowers the Magistrate before whom an accused is produced for purpose of remand, whether he has jurisdiction or not to try the case, to order the detention of the accused, either in policy custody or in judicial custody, for a term not exceeding 15 days in the 1130 whole. In the first place, if the initial order of remand is to be made with reference to the date of arrest then the order will have retrospective coverage for the period of custody prior to the production of the accused before the Magistrate, i.e. the period of 24 hours' custody which a police officer is entitled to have under s. 57 besides the time taken for the journey. Such a construction will not only be in discord with the terms of s. 57 but will also be at variance with the terms of sub-s. (2) itself. The operative words in sub-s. (2) viz. "authorise the detention of the accused... for a term not exceeding 15 days in the whole" will have to be read differently in so far as the first order of remand is concerned so as to read as "for a term not exceeding 15 days in the whole from the date of arrest". This would necessitate the adding of more words to the section than what the legislature has provided. Another anomaly that would occur is that while sub-s. (2) empowers the Magistrate to order the detention of an accused "in such custody as such Magistrate thinks fit, for a term not exceeding 15 days in the whole" the Magistrate will be disentitled to placing an accused in police custody for a full period of 15 days if the period of custody is to be reckoned from the date of arrest because the period of custody prior to the production of the accused will have to be excluded from the total period of 15 days. [1138 G-H;
 1139 A-F] Apart from these anomalous features, if an accused were to contend that he was taken into custody more than 24 hours before his production before the Magistrate and the police officer refutes the statement, the Magistrate will have to indulge in a fact finding inquiry to determine when exactly the accused was arrested and from what point of time the remand period of 15 days is to be reckoned. Such an exercise by a Magistrate ordering remand is not contemplated or provided for in the Code. It would, therefore, be proper to give the plain meaning of the words occurring in sub-s. (2) and holding that a Magistrate is empowered to authorise the detention of an accused produced before him for a full period of 15 days from the date of production of the accused. [1139 F-H; 1140 A] 
 3. Reference may also be made to another provision in the Code, viz. the first proviso to sub-s. (2) of s. 309 for construing the period of 15 days referred to in sub-s. 2 of s. 167. As sub-s. (2) of s. 167 as well as proviso (1) of sub-s.
 1131 (2) of s. 309 relate to the powers of remand of a Magistrate, though under different situations, the two provisions call for a harmonious reading in so far as the periods of remand are concerned. It would, therefore, follow that the words "15 days in the whole" occurring in sub-s.(2) of s. 167 would be tantamount to a period of "15 days at a time" but subject to the condition that if the accused is to be remanded to police custody the remand should be for such period as is commensurate with the requirements of a case with provisions for further extensions for restricted periods, if need be, but in no case should be total period of remand to police custody exceed 15 days. Where an accused is placed in police custody for the maximum period of 15 days allowed under law either pursuant to a single order of remand or to more than one order, when the remand is restricted on each occassion to a lesser number of days, further detention of the accused, if warranted, has to be necessarily to judicial custody and not otherwise. The Legislature having provided for an accused being placed under police custody under orders of remand for effective investigation of cases has at the same time taken care to see that the interests of the accused are not jeopardised by his being placed under police custody beyond a total period of 15 days, under any circumstances, irrespective of the gravity of the offence or the serious nature of the case.
 Thus, there is no merit or force in the contention of the appellants' counsel that the words "for a term not exceeding 15 days in the whole" occurring in sub-s.(2) of s. 167 should be construed as to include also the period of custody of the accused from the time of arrest till the time of production before the Magistrate. A Magistrate can, therefore, authorise the detention of the accused for a maximum period of 15 days from the date of remand and place the accused either in police custody or in judicial custody during the period of 15 days' remand. [1140 B-H; 1141 A-C] 4.(i) Construing proviso (a) either in conjunction with sub-s.(2) of s. 167 or as an independent paragraph, the total period of 90 days under clause (i) and the total period of 60 days under clause (ii) has to be calculated only from the date of remand and not from the date of arrest.
 4.(ii) The words used in proviso (a) are "no Magistrate shall authorise the detention of the accused person in 1132 custody", "under this paragraph", "for a total period exceeding i.e. 90 days/60 days". Detention can be authorised by the Magistrate only from the time the order of remand is passed. The earlier period when the accused is in the custody of a police officer in exercise of his powers under s. 57 cannot constitute detention pursuant to an authorisation issued by the Magistrate. It, therefore, stands to reason that the total period of 90 days or 60 days can begin to run only from the date of order of remand.
 Moreover, as per sub-s. (2A) of s. 167 a Magistrate is obliged to take into consideration only the period of detention actually undergone by the accused pursuant to the orders of remand passed by the Executive Magistrate. The earlier period of custody till the production of the accused before the Executive Magistrate is not directed to be taken into consideration by sub-s. (2A). Such being the case, there cannot be different modes of computation of the period of remand depending upon whether accused person is forwarded to a Judicial Magistrate or an Executive Magistrate for purposes of remand. [1141 G-H; 1142 A-G] 4.(iii) The change of wording in the proviso has to be given its due significance because the Legislature would not have effected the change without any purpose or objective.
 Significant changes have been made in s. 167 as well as to the proviso by Act 45 of 1978 such as increasing the period for investigation in grave cases from 60 to 90 days, conferring of powers of remand on Executive Magistrates in certain situations etc. Therefore, it can be legitimately contended that the words occurring in proviso (a) should be construed within the frame work of the proviso itself without any reference to s. 167(2). If such a construction is made, it may be seen that the proviso forbids the extension of remands only beyond a total period of 90 days under clause (i) and beyond a total period of 60 days under clause (ii). Thus if proviso (a) is treated as a separate paragraph it necessarily follows that the period of 90 days or 60 days as the case may be, will commence running only from the date of remand and not from any anterior date in spite of the fact that the accused may have been taken into custody earlier by a police officer and deprived of his liberty. [1143 F-H; 1144 A-B] 
 5. The intention of the Legislature can also be gathered by comparing proviso (a) with sub-s. (5) of s. 167.
 The 1133 Legislature has consciously referred to the date of arrest in s. 167(5) but has made no such reference in s. 167 (2) or poviso (a) thereto. If it was the intention of the Legislature that the period of remand of 15 days in the whole envisaged in sub-s. (2) or the total period of 90 days/60 days prescribed in proviso(a) should be calculated from the date of arrest then the Legislature would have expressly said so as it had done under s. 167(5).
