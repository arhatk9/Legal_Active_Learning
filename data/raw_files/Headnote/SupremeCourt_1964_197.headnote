 The assessee was a share-holder in a company carrying on business both in India and Pakistan. It declared dividend out of the profits accruing to it in both the countries.
 For the following year, having declared the dividend similarly, the company also passed a resolution that half the amount of the dividend was payable on or after a certain date and the balance was payable "within two months after remittances from Pakistan became free". On the two questions, namely : (i) whether the assessee, having received the Pakistan portion of the dividend-income, was entitled to any relief under the provisions of the Indo- Pakistan Agreement dated 10th December, 1947, entered into between the two countries to avoid double taxation in pursuance of s. 49AA of the Income-tax Act, 1922, and (ii) whether the entire amount of dividend including the moiety payable later could be included in the total income of the assessee, the High Court answered the first, against, and the second, in favour of, the assessee. Both the assessee and the Commissioner appealed to the Supreme Court.
 HELD: The appeals should be dismissed.
 (i) Articles IV and VI of the Agreement show that each Dominion could make an assessment under its own laws and regardless of the Agreement. The only restrictions imposed were on the liberty to 'retain the tax and the obligation to allow certain abatements, if the conditions mentioned in the Agreement were satisfied. As no certificate of assessment in Pakistan had been produced before the income-tax officer as required by Art. VI(b), the assessee was not entitled to any relief. [313D,G; 314A].
 (ii) As the dividend due to the assessee was not credited to any separate account of the assessee so that he could, if he wished, draw it, it must be held that the Pakistan portion of the dividend had not been credited or paid within the meaning of s. 16(2) of the Act and so, could not be included in the total income of the assessee. [315B-C].
