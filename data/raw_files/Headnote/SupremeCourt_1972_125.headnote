 The petitioner was in possession of an area of approximately 1,27,904 acres, commonly known as the 'Concession Area' lying contiguously in the Kannan Devan Hills village. The concession was first given to the predecessor-in-interest of the appellant company in 1877 by the poonjar Chief for a consideration of Rs. 5,000/. After some years a yearly sum of Rs. 3,000 was to be paid to the rent collector of the Chief. In 1878 the Maharaja of Travancore ratified the Concession on certain conditions. In 1886 the agreement called the Second Pooniat Concession was entered into modifying the previous deed of ratification. A Royal Proclamation was made on September 24, 1899 whereby the Poonjar Chief surrendered the propriety rights which he had exercised over the tract known as Anjanad and Kannan Devan Hills. According to the petitioner it had all times been holding, cultivating, enjoying and dealing with the Conces- sion land as the absolute owner thereof. The petitioner further alleged that it had established 23 tea estates, with factories in each estate for the manufacture of tea, hospitals, quarters, township and shopping centres. The Kannan Devan Hills (Resumption of Lands) Act 1971 (Kerala Act 5 of 1971) the lands agricultural & non-agricultural situated in the Kannan Devan, Hills Village vested in the Government of Kerala.. The petitioner company filed a writ petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution challenging certain provisions of the Act. The questions that fell for consideration were : (i) whether the impugned Act was within the legislative competence of the State of Kerala; (ii) whether the impugned Act was protected from challenge under Art 31A of the Constitution.
 
HELD : (i) The State has legislative competence to legislate on entry 18 List It and entry 42 List III. This power cannot be denied on the ground that it has some effect on an industry controlled under entry 52 List 1. Effect is not the same thing as subject-matter. If a State Act, otherwise valid, has effect on a matter in List I it does not cease to be legislation with respect to an entry in List II or List Ill. The object of ss. 4 and 5 seems to be enable the State to acquire all the lands which do not fall within the categories (a), (b) and (e) of s. 4(i). These provisions are really incidental to the exercise of the power of acquisition. The State cannot be denied a power to ascertain what land should be acquired by it in the public interest. [369 C-D] The fact that the plantation was run as an integrated unit cannot impinge upon and take away the legislative power of the State in respect of List II entry 18. 370 [F-G] Chika Ramji v. State of Uttar Pradesh, [1956] INSC 30; [1956] S.C.R. 393, 420 and Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. Attorney General, [1950] A.C. 122, 123, 140, applied.

Madhavrao Damodar Patilchand, [1968] INSC 96; [1968] 3 S.C.R. 712, referred to, There was no repugnance between the provisions of the impugned Act and the Tea Act. It was said that there is conflict because it is the Tea Board and not the Land Board, which should determine what land is necessary for the efficient working of the plantation-, but Parliament has not chosen even if it could, to say so.

 (ii)On the material placed before the Court it was difficult to resist the conclusion that the lands in dispute fell within the expression 'Janmam right'. It is stated in Travancore Land Revenue Manual Volume IV there are no lands that do not belong to a Janmam and the Sircar becomes a Janmi by escheat, confiscation or otherwise. The effect of the Royal Proclamation of 1899 must be that the Sircar became the Janmi. [376F] Kavalappara Kottarathil Kochuni v. State of Madras, [1960] 3 S.C.R. 887 and Sakanuram Sabbayogam v. State of Karala, A.I.R. 1963 Kerala 101, referred to, (iii)From the Travancore Land Revenue Manual it would appear that the State grants like Kanan Devan Hills Concession and Ten square Miles Concession and Munro Lands, were treated under the heading 'Pandaravaka Lands', i.e., land belonging to the Sircar. It was held by this Court in Pushothaman Nambudri's case that Pandaravaka Verumpattam lands could be regarded as local equivalent of an estate under cl. (2) of Art. 31A. If it is held that the land in question does not fall within the expression 'janmam right, it may possibly be covered by the decision of this Court in Purushottam Namboodri's case but as no arguments were addressed on this point it was not necessary for the Court to express its final opinion. [379C-D] Purushothaman Nambudri V.. Sate of Kerala, [1962] Supp. 1 S.C.R. 753, referred to.
 (iii)The three purposes mentioned in s. 9 namely (1) reservation of land for promotion of agriculture; (2) reservation of land for the welfare of agricultural population and (3) assignment of remaining lands to agri- culturists and agricultural labourers, were covered by the expression " agrarian reform" and the legislation was protected from challenge under Art. 31-A. [382] Deputy Commissioner and Collector, Kamrup v. Durga Nath Sarma, [1967] INSC 211; [1968] 1 S.C.R. 561, P. Vajravalu Mudaliar v. Special Deputy Collector, Madras, [1964] INSC 214; [1965] 1 S.C.R. 614 and Ranjit Singh v. State of Punjab, [1964] INSC 178; [1965] 1 S.C.R. 82.
 The wide wording of the first two purposes did not carry them beyond the concept of 'agrarian reform'. The definition of 'common purpose' which was sustained by this Court in Ranjit Singh's case shows that the purposes sustained thereby would come under either the express "pro- motion of agriculture" or "welfare of agricultural population" in s. 9 Indeed some would fall under both. For instance, reservation of lands for manure pits water-works or wells, village water courses or water 358 channels and grazing grounds would promote agriculture;
 schools and playgrounds, dispensaries, public latrines etc.
 would be for the welfare of he agriculturists. [381C] If the State were to use lands for purposes which have no direct connection with the promotion of agriculture or welfare of agricultural population the State could be restrained from using the lands for these purposes. Any fanciful connection with these purposes would not be enough.
 [381D] If the two purposes were understood to mean that these include only common purposes', which were sustained by this Court and purposes similar thereto it would be difficult to say that they are not for agrarian reform. In a sense agrarian reform is wider than land reform. It includes besides land reform something more and something more is illustrated by the definition of "common purpose" which was sustained by this Court in Ranjit Singh's case. [381E-F] The third object-settlement of agriculturists and agricultural labour is clearly covered by the expression "agrarian reform". The main object of agrarian reforms has been to acquire excess land and settle landless labourers and agriculturists.- [382B-C] Ranjit Singh v.
