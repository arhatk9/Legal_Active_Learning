 Under a voluntary retirement scheme in force in the company the petitioner, a clerk in Burmah Shell Oil Storage Ltd., retired voluntarily after qualifying for pension. The pension payable to him was regulated by the terms of a trust deed of 1950 under which a pension fund was set up and regulations were made for its administration. The petitioner was also covered by a scheme under the Employees Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and to gratuity under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972.
 The annual pension to which he was entitled under the trust deed, without making the authorised deductions as provided under regulation 16 of the trust deed, worked out to a sum of Rs. 165.99 per mensem. He was also paid supplementary retirement benefit of Rs. 86/- per month for a period of 13 months after his retirement which was stopped thereafter.
 The employer informed the petitioner that from out of his pension of Rs. 165.99 two deductions were made, one of which was on account of employees provident fund payment made to the pensioner and the other on account of payment of gratuity with the result the pension payable to him was shown as Rs. 40.05. The company also cut off the monthly payment of Rs. 86/- which was paid as supplementary retirement benefit on the score that it was ex gratia, discretionary and liable to be stopped at any time by the employer.
 In the meantime the company was statutorily taken over by force of the Burmah Shell (Acquisition of Undertakings in India) Act, 1976. Thereafter the Central Government took steps to vest the undertaking in the second respondent, the Bharat Petroleum, which then became the statutory successor of the petitioner's employer. His pensionary rights such as he had, therefore, became claimable from the second respondent.
 A preliminary objection was raised on behalf of the corporation that no writ would lie against the second respondent since it is neither a government department nor a statutory corporation but just a company.
 ^ HELD : By the Court :
 The petitioner is entitled to the payment of full pension.
 (per majority Krishna Iyer and Chinnappa Reddy, JJ Pathak, J dissenting).
 
 1. The Bharat Petroleum is State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution and a writ will lie against it under Article 32. [128A] 112 (a) The settled position in law is that any authority under the control of Government of India comes within the definition of State. On the appointed day the right title and interest in Burmah Shell did vest in the Central Government and by virtue of section 3 the Central Government was the transferee of the undertaking. While the formal ownership was cast in the corporate mould, the reality reaches down to State control. The core fact is that the Central Government, through section 7 chose to make over its own property to its own offspring. Therefore, the Burmah Shell though a government company is but the alter ego of the Central Government and must, therefore, be treated as definitionally caught in the net of State since a juristic veil worn for certain legal purposes cannot obliterate the true character of the entity for purposes of constitutional law. [121A; G; 124 D-E] (b) Corporate personality is a reality and not an illusion or fictitious construction of the law. It is a legal person. Merely because a company or other legal person has functional and jural individuality for certain purposes and in certain areas of law, it does not necessarily follow that for the effective enforcement of fundamental rights under the constitutional scheme, the Court should not scan the real character of that entity. In the instant case section 7 gives a statutory recognition and a status above a mere government company. If the entity is no more than a company under the Company Law or society under the law relating to registered societies or cooperative societies one cannot call it an authority. [124F; 125B, E] (c) An authority in administrative law is a body having jurisdiction in certain matters of a public nature.
 Therefore, the ability conferred upon a person by the law to alter, by his own will directed to that end, the rights, duties, liabilities or other legal relations, either of himself or of other persons must be present ab extra to make a person an "authority". When the person is an `agent or instrument of the functions of the State' the power is public. [125F-H] Sometimes the test is formulated, by asking whether the corporation is formed by a statute or under a statute. The true test is not how legal person is born but why it is created. Apart from discharging functions or doing business as the proxy of the State there must be an element of ability to affect legal relations by virtue of power vested in it by law. [126A-B] (d) In the instant case sections 3 and 7 clothe the company with State functions. Section 7 contemplates that the company should step into the shoes of the executive power of the State. The legislative history of the corporation shows that it is more than a mere company registered under the Companies Act. Matters like conditions of service of employees, adjudication of disputes relating to employees, superannuation and welfare funds and so on are regulated statutorily unlike in the case of ordinary companies. Sections 9 and 10 create rights and duties vis a vis the government company itself apart from the Companies Act. Section 11 specifically gives the Act primacy vis a vis other laws. Section 12 clothes the Government company with power to take delivery of the property of Burmah Shell from every person in whose possession, custody or control such property may be. Whatever its character antecedent to the Act all the relevant provisions have transformed it into an instrumentality of the Central Government with a strong indicia of power to make it an "authority". It is a limb of the Government, an agency of the State, a vicarious creature of statute. [126C-H, 127B-C] 113 
 2. Some of the tests laid down by this Court for deciding whether a body is State within the meaning of Article 12 are :
 (i) If the entire share capital of the corporation is held by Government, it would go a long way towards indicating that the corporation is an instrumentality or agency of the Government;
 (ii) A finding of State financial support plus an unusual degree of control over the management and policies might lead, one to characterise an operation as State action.
 (iii) The existence of deep and pervasive State control may afford an indication that the Corporation is a State agency or instrumentality.
 (iv) Whether the corporation enjoys monopoly status which is State conferred or State protected is a relevant factor.
 (v) If the functions of the corporation are important public functions and related to governmental functions it would be a relevant factor in classifying the corporation as instrumentality or agency of the Government.
 (vi) If a department of Government is transferred to a corporation, it would be a strong factor supportive of the inference that it is an instrumentality of the State. [137E- H] (vii) Where the chemistry of the corporate body answers the test of State it comes within the definition of Article 
12. [136D] (viii) Whether the legal person is a corporation created by a statute, as distinguished from under a statute is not an important criterion although it may be an indicium.

 3(a) Having regard to the directive in Article 38 and the amplitude of the other articles in part IV Government may appropriately embark upon almost any activity which in a non-socialist republic may fall within the private sector.
 Any person's employment, entertainment, travel, rest and leisure, hospital facility and funeral service may be controlled by the State and if all these enterprises are executed through government companies, bureaus, societies, councils, institutes and homes, the citizen may forfeit his fundamental freedoms vis a vis these strange beings which are government in fact but corporate in form. If only fundamental rights were forbidden access to corporations, companies, bureaus, institutes, councils and kindred bodies which act as agencies of the administration there may be a breakdown of the rule of law and the constitutional order in a large sector of governmental activity carried on under the guise of `jural persons'. It may 114 pave the way for a new tyranny by arbitrary administrators operated from behind by Government but unaccountable to part III of the Constitution. The Court cannot assent to an interpretation which leads to such a disastrous conclusion unless the language of Article 12 offers no other alternative. [147C-F] (b) It is dangerous to exonerate corporations from the need to have constitutional conscience; and so that interpretation, language permitting, which makes governmental agencies, whatever their mein, amenable to constitutional limitations must be adopted by the court as against the alternative of permitting them to flourish as an imperium in imperio. [148A-B] (c) The common-sense signification of the expression "other authorities under the control of the Government of India" is plain and there is no reason to make exclusions on sophisticated grounds such as that the legal person must be a statutory corporation, must have power to make laws, must be created by and not under a statute and so on. [148C] 4(a) It is clear from section 10 which relates to the provident fund, pension, welfare fund and the like that the second respondent has made provision for the rights and interests of the beneficiaries of the trust established by Burmah Shell for the benefit of persons employed by it. Sub- section (1) puts this matter beyond doubt. This obligation of the second respondent is a statutory one and having regard to the provisions of section 11, it cannot be affected by any instrument or decree or order. The stautory continuation of a pre-existing liability to pay pension, provident fund or gratuity, cannot be avoided having regard to section 10. [150D-E] (b) Assuming that regulation 16 authorities deduction and that discretionary payments, although enjoyed by the employees are liable to be stopped section 12 of the Provident Fund Act forbids any such reduction or deduction out of the benefits in the nature of old age pension on the score of the payment of contribution to the provident fund.
 The benignant provision contained in section 12 must receive a benignant construction and even if two interpretations are permissible, that which furthers the beneficial object should be preferred. From that perspective the inference is reasonable that the total quantum of benefits in the nature of old age pension, gratuity or provident fund, shall not be reduced by reason only of the liability of the employer for payment of contribution to the fund. The section prevails over the trust deed. The provident fund accrues by statutory force and section 12 overrides any agreement authorising deductions. The expression `instrument' contained in section 15 covers a trust deed and notwithstanding the deduction that may be sanctioned by the trust deed, the overriding effect of section 14 preserves the pension and immunises it against any deduction attributable to the statutory payment of the provident fund. The deduction made by the second respondent is in that event illegal. [151A-H] (c) If regulation 16 is a provision which imposes a cut in certain eventualities it is possible to hold that the employee has a certain pensionary right. But if he draws provident fund or gratuity that pension will be pared down by a separate rule of deduction from the pension. It follows that there is no straining of the language of the regulations to mean, firstly, a right to pension quantified in certain manner and, secondly, a right in the Management to make deduction from out of that pension if other retiral benefits are drawn by the employee. That appears to be the pension scheme.
 115 If this be correct, there is no substance in the argument that the pension itself is automatically reduced into a smaller scale of pension on the drawl of provident fund or gratuity. Pension is one thing, deduction is another. The latter is independent of pension and operates on the pension to amputate it, as it were. If a law forbids such cut or amputation the pension remains intact. [152B-D] (d) The payment of gratuity or provident fund should not occasion any deduction from the pension as a "set-off".
 Otherwise, the solemn statutory provisions ensuring provident fund and gratuity become illusory. Pensions are paid out of regard for past meritorious services. The root of gratuity and the foundation of provident fund are different. Each one is a salutary benefaction statutorily guaranteed independently of the other. Even assuming that by private treaty parties had otherwise agreed to deductions before the coming into force of these beneficial enactments they cannot now be deprivatory. It is precisely to guard against such mischief that the non-obstante and overriding provisions are engrafted on these statutes. [152F-G] (e) It is not open to the second respondent to deduct from the full pension any sum based upon regulation 16 read with regulation 13. If regulation 16 which now has acquired statutory flavour, having been adapted and continued by statutory rules, operates contrary to the provisions of the P.F. Act and the Gratuity Act, it must fail as invalid.
 [153C] (f) What is discretionary depends on the discretion of the employer. But that power when exercised by an agency of government like the second respondent, must be based upon good faith and due care. If as a measure of reprisal or provoked by the drawl of gratuity, or by resort to legal authorities, such supplementary benefit is struck off, it will cease to be bona fide or valid. [153D-E] Pathak, J. (dissenting) On the merits the petitioner should be granted relief as proposed by the majority. [154 G] It is difficult to accept the proposition that the Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited is a "State" within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution, but the matter appears to be concluded because of the direction taken by the law since Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority [1979] 3 S.C.R. 489 a wider range of debate on the fundamental principles involved in the issue would have been welcomed in view of the implications flowing from the definition of a "government company" in the Companies Act, 1956. [154 D] The provisions of the Burmah Shell (Acquisition of Undertakings in India) Act, 1976 do not alter the basic nature of a "government company". They are provisions which could well have been applied to a private corporation, if the Act had selected one for vesting the undertaking in it.
 Had that been done, they would not have made the private corporation a State. [154F]
