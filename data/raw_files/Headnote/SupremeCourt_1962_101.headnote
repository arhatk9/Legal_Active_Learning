 One N, a cashier of a bank, was convicted of an offence under s. 381 of the Indian Penal Code on a charge of theft of a certain amount belonging to the Bank and was convicted to one year's rigorous imprisonment. His appeal to the Sessions Court was unsuccessful. On that very date within few hours after the pronouncement of the judgment by the Sessions Court he died. A revision petition was filed in the High Court by his wife and his two minor sons under s.
 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The High Court 'of Kerala set aside the conviction of the deceased accused.
 The State of Kerala came up in an appeal to the Supreme Court by a certificate granted by the High Court. The question is whether an application for revision under s. 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure could be entertained by the High Court after the death of the accused person against whom the order was made.
 Held, that in a proper case the High Court can exercise its power of revision of an order made against an accused person even after his death, and the High Court was right in 944 holding that the application for revision could be entertained under s. 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
 Held, with regard to the revisional jurisdiction of the High Court there is no provision similar to s. 431 of the Code, for is there any provision whether a revisional application can be or cannot be made in respect of an order of conviction when the convicted person is dead. The opening words of s. 439 of the Code, produce the result that revisional jurisdiction can be exercised by the High Court by being moved either by the convicted person himself or by any other person or sue motu, on the basis of its own knowledge derived from any source whatsoever without being moved by any person at all. All that is necessary to bring the High Court's powers of revision into operation is such information as makes the High Court think that an order made by a Subordinate Court is fit for the exercise of its powers of revision.
 The important dictinction between ss. 431 and 439 is that while the appellate jurisdiction can be exercised only after an appeal is filed by the convicted person or against an order of acquittal under ss. 411 or 417, there is no such limitation on the court's revisional jurisdiction.
