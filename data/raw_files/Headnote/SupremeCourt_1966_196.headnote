 Along with an agreement to execute a perpetual lease of mineral rights possession was delivered to the lessee in 1939. The lease was executed in 1951, in execution of a decree for specific performance. The leasee transferred his rights to the appellant in 1954. In 1960 the respondent Controller modified the terms of the lease under Mining Lease (Modification of Terms) Rules, 1956, which continued in force by s. 29 of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957. The modifications were that the period of lease was reduced to 25 years from 1939 and the -renewal was to be regulated in accordance with the law and rules in force. The appellant's revision was dismissed by the Central Government. Inappeal to this Court, the appellant challenged the order on the groundsthat (i) the mining lease in favour of the appellant was dated 1951, therefore, was not an "existing mining lease" as defined in r. 2(c) of the Rules; (ii) the lease was not for the purpose of merely " winning" the mineral but was also for extracting the mineral and taking it away; therefore, the protection of Art. 31A(i)(e) was not available to save the reduction in the period of the lease without payING compensation; (iii) the rules were made before enactment of the Constitution Seventh Amendment Act, and were therefore void as till then Central Legislature could enact with respect to acquiring of properly for Union purpose only and not for State purpose;
 (iv) the rules were ultra vires the 1948 Act and therefore could not continue after the enactment of the 1957 Act as only valid rules could continue under s. 29 of the 1957 Act;
 and (v) the Controller was not justified in limiting the period of the lease to 25 years from 1939.
 
HELD:(Per Subba Rao, C.J., Sikri and Dayal, JJ.) : The appeal must be allowed to the effect that the period of lease shall be 20 year.% from June 1, 1958, when the 1957 Act came into force, and its renewal would be 'regulated in accordance with the law and rules in force,. The appeal in respect of other modifications must be dismissed. [705 E] The granting of a lease is different from the formal execution of the lease deed. The execution of the formal deed is only compliance with the legal 'requirements to make the grant legally enforceable. Rule 27 of the Mineral Concession Rules., 1949 show that it is really the sanc- tioning of the lease which amounts to the granting of the lease. Further, the agreement to lease was acted upon by the parties and gives further, the terms of the lease. [698 C, D] M16Sup-CI/66-16 696 (ii)The expression "winning" in Art. 31A(1)(e) should be construed to mean "getting or extracting minerals from the mines and other incidental purposes." [701 D] The various definitions in the Act or the rules are for a limited purpose and the word 'winning' or 'win' does not always have the same content, and, therefore, they cannot be any guide for construing the word 'winning' in the constitutional provision of Art. 31A(1)(e). Therefore the rules for the modification of any rights accruing under this lease cannot bedeemed to be void on the ground that they take away the rights conferredby Arts. 14, 19 or 31 of the Constitution. [702 C-E] (iii) The 1956 rules were made in connection with the regulation of mines and for the development of minerals and the Central Legislature was competent to provide for the making of such rules by the 1948 Act. The rules do not come within the field of the acquisition and requisitioning of property.
 [702 H] (iv)Even if the rules were not consistent with the provisions of the 1948 Act and were therefore void, they could be continued after the enforcement of the 1957 Act.
 The effect of s. 29 of the 1957 Act is that the rules which were made or purported to have been made under the 1948 Act in respect of matters for which rules could be made under the 1957 Act would be deemed to have been made under the 1957 Act as if that Act had been in force on the date on which such rules were made and would continue in force. [703 E, G] (v)The Controller was competent to modify the terms of the lease in favour of the appellant in order to bring it into conformity with the provisions of the 1957 Act and the rules under s. 13 thereof. [704 F] Per Hidayatullah and Bachawat, JJ. The appeal must be dismissed.
 The lease in 1939 was the only subsisting lease. In order to bring the lease in conformity with the Act and the Rules, its period could be cut down to 20 years from 1939.
 Actually the Controller cut down the period to 25 years from 1939. The appellants had no just grievance against this order. [705 H; 706 A]
