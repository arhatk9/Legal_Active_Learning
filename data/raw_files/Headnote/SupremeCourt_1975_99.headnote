 The respondent is a manufacturer of and dealer in 'Woollen Carpet Yarn', popularly known as kati. For the assessment years 1959-60 and 1961-62 he was taxed by the Sales Tax officer at 6 pies per rupee and 3 pies per rupee, respectively, under two notifications applicable to the two assessment years respectively, issued under the U.P. Sales Tax Act, 1948. On appeal, the Assistant Commissioner held, that kati was an unclassified item taxable at 2 pies per rupee tinder s. 3 of the Act, and the order was confirmed on revision and by the High Court on reference.
 The two Notifications provided (1) that turnover of 'Yarn of all kinds including unspun fibre used in weaving' is liable to tax at 6 pies per rupee, and (2) turnover of yarn of all kinds including unspun fibre used in weaving, is liable to tax at 3 pies per rupee. There was another notification which provided that turnover of "Woollen goods excluding carpet but including knitting wool" is liable to tax at one anna per rupee.
 The authorities under the Act found that kati are short cut pieces of unspun fibre about 2 inches in length ; that the pieces have very little tensile strength and are not used, and are not capable of being used, for weaving, knitting or rope-making ; that the only use to which kati is put is by attaching each piece by hand around two warp threads ; that it is not a component of the basic fabric of the carpet ;
 that it is not an integral constituent of the warp and weft of the carpet which consists of a different spun fibre of great tensile strength ; and that the process of looping or knotting kati is different and distinct from the process of lengthwise and cross-wise combining of warp and weft components which makes the woven basic structure of the carpet.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court.
 
HELD : (1) Kati is not 'yam' because one of the characteristics of yam is that it should be spun thread, whereas kati is unspun fibre. [231-H] (2) It is not unspun fibre Used in weaving within the meaning of the first two notifications because, on the facts found, it is not used in weaving.
 [233-C-D] (3) it is not ;woollen goods' within the meaning of the 3rd notification, because. (233-C-D] (a) Katri is only raw material from which 'woollen goods' are prepared and [233-E] (b) Yarn used in weaving the warp and weft of carpets, or woollen fibre used in weaving is, tinder the notifications, taxable at a par lower rate than woollen goods'. and it could never have been intended that a mere component or raw material, used by a manual process, not being a process of weaving in the manufacture of 'woollen goods' should be taxed at a higher rate treating kati as finished 'woollen goods'. [233-E.F.] 229 (4) Therefore, it is an unclassified item and the turn-over is liable to tax only at 2 pies per rupee.
