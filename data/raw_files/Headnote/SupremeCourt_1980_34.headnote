 On the question whether a Government servant officiating in a class 1 or class II service or post could be retired compulsorily by exercising power under r. 56(j) (i) of the Fundamental Rules after he has attained the age of 50 years.
 ^ 
 HELD : 1. Rule 56(j)(i) is meant to cover only those who are in a post on a regular basis, that is, in a substantive capacity and not on an officiating basis only.
 [1094E] 
 2. A government servant ordinarily holds service at the pleasure of the State which means pleasure canalised by rules. [1093H] 
 3. An officiating hand has no right to the post and cannot be strictly said to be in that service or post as a member of that service. In short an officiating government servant does not really belong to class I or class II service until he acquires a right thereon. The structure of the clause "if he is in class I or class II service or post" emphasises the nature of the service or post vis-a-vis the Government servant concerned. When a government servant belonging to class I or class II service or post on a regular basis has to be retired compulsorily rule 56(j)(i) comes to the rescue of the Government. But if he is only a temporary hand who has no right to the post he can always be reverted to the post, if any, on which he has a lien.
 Similar is the position of an officiating hand. [1094B-D] 
 4. Although the rule vests an absolute right in the appropriate authority to retire a government servant in public interest absolutism, and arbitrariness are contrary to the scheme of the rules of this kind. Even while exercising the power under this rule the State should take care not to act arbitrarily, misguided by the absolute expression in the rule. [1094F-G]
