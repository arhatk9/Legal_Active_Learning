 Two suits were filed in the trial court, one by the respondents, claiming a prescriptive easement over the appellant's land for the ingress and egress of water, for agriculture and prawn fishing, and the other by the appellant, seeking to restrain the respondents from using his land for the above purposes. Due to the time-lag between their respective institution, the two suits, although involving common questions, were tried and disposed of separately. The respondents' easementary right was upheld in regard to agricultural user but not for prawn fishing. Cross appeals were filed by the parties against both the decrees, and the Subordinate Judge dismissed all the appeals confirming the decrees by a common judgment. Neither side challenged the decrees in appeals arising from the respondents' suit, but the respondents moved the High Court against the decree in appeals arising from the appellant's suit. The second appeal was contested on the ground that it was barred by res judicata, as the question in it had already been finally decided by the unchallenged decrees in the appeals arising out of the other suit. This contention was rejected and the appeal was remanded for a fresh hearing. The matter was thereafter disposed of on merits by the Subordinate Judge, and the pre-remand view stood confirmed. The High Court allowed a second appeal by the respondents, upholding their easementary right both for agriculture and prawn fishing. In appeal therefrom the plea of res judicata was raised before this Court, and was contested on the ground that the remanding judgment had not been appealed against, and the contention was, therefore, barred by res judicata.
 Allowing the appeal, the Court ^ 
 HELD : (1) The appeals filed in the District Court arose out of two different suits, one by the appellant and the other by the respondents. The failure of the respondents to challenge the decision of the District Court in so far as it pertained to their suit, attracts the application of section 11, Explanation I, Civil Procedure Code, because to the extent to which the District Court decided issues arising in the respondents' suit against them, that decision would operate as res judicata since it was not appealed against.

 (2) The circumstance that the remanding judgment of the High Court was not appealed against assuming that an appeal lay therefrom, cannot preclude the appellant from challenging the correctness of the view taken by the High Court in that judgment.
