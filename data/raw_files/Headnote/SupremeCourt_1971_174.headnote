 The employees of the Kanpur branch of the appellant batik..
 enjoyed medical facilities without a monetary ceiling.
 Under the Sastry Award, and under the Desai Award which substantially adopted the Sastry Award in this respect, the higher medical benefits enjoyed by the employees of the branch, were to continue. In pursuance of the Bipartite Settlement in 1966 an attempt was made to standardise "Medi- cal aid and expenses" by bringing the employees of the branch in line with the other branches of the bank, but without success. During the conciliation proceedings before the Regional Labour Commissioner the appellant was agreeable, until the next All India Settlement/ Award in the banking industry when the workmen of the appellnt bank at Kanpur would fall in line with that settlement/award to a higher limit of Rs. 250/- for medical aid and expenses for the, employees of the branch as compared to the ceiling fixed under the Bipartite Settlement for employees of other banks. This limit was 'to be applicable to the employees as well as to their families. The appellant bank was also agreeable to pay the hospitalisation expenses but only of the workmen. A dispute as to what should be the monetary limit up to which medical aid and expenses should be admissible,to the workmen of the Kanpur branch was referred to the Industrial Tribunal and the Tribunal gave-an award declaring that the employees of the branch and their families would be entitled to medical aid and ,expenses up to a monetary limit of Rs. 250 per year. The Tribunal further directed that the appellant-bank would defray the hospitalisation charges not only for the employees but also for the members of their families.
 In appeal to this Court, against the award, it was contended that the Tribunal, having rerognised the need for standardising benefits in respect of medical aid and expenses, ought not to have fixed them at a rate higher than those fixed for the employees of the bank in other branches, particularly, when nothing had been shown As to why the Kanpur branch employees should be given favoured treatment.
 It was also contended that the award relating to hospitalisation was made applicable to the members of the family of the employees at Kanpur' while no such facility was available to the other workers. The respondents took the stand that the benefits enjoyed by the employees of the branch of having unlimited medical aid facilities could not be curtailed.
 2-M1245Sup. Cl/71 8 
 HELD : (1) The object of the Bipartite Settlement was to standardise the facility in respect of medical aid and expenses; but when it was found that one of the branches of the appellant bank was not able to fall in line that was left to further negotiations, but nonetheless, it was made manifest that standardisation should be achieved to bring them in line With other workmen of the bank. When once there has been a general revision in respect of pay scales and other amenities and facilities which are more advantageous than under the previous award there seems to be no reason why the employees of the Kanpur branch should be treated as favoured employees, particularly, when nothing has been stated nor any material relied upon to show why they should be so treated. It is not a case of protecting the wage of an individual workman who was getting higher than what is envisaged in the standardisation scheme at. the time when such a scheme is brought into force. [14D 15B] (2)Further, there is no justification for the tribunal to extend the hospitalisation facilities to the members of the families if that was not enjoyed by the workmen in the other branches of the appellant Back and in other Banks which are similarly situated. [15E] (3) However, in view of the fact that the appellant Bank was agreeable to give a higher limit as indicated in its offer before the Conciliation Officer, though for a limited period, namely, till the next All India Settlement Award, which was also reiterated before this Court, the interest of the employees of the Kanpur branch are well served by that offer. [15G] [The Court accordingly,directed that a higher limit or Rs.
 250/be fixed ,towards medical aid and expenses of each of the employees of, the Kanpur branch and their families as defined in the Bipartite Agreement, the higher limit to be effective till the next All India Settlement/Award. It was further directed that each of the workmen would also be entitled to hospitalisation in terms of the said agreement.]
