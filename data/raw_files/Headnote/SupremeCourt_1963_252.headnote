 Provincial Insolvency Act (5 of 1920), s. 4--Whether Insolvency Court can go behind decree.
 1099 Jyoti Parshad was indebted to the Bank of Patiala. As he could not pay the debt, he asked the Bank in 1952 to allow him to pay the same in instalments and the Bank agreed.
 Rattan Singh, Respondent stood surety to the extent of Rs. 2 lacs and entered into a contract of guarantee with the Bank to discharge the liability of Jyoti Parshad to the extent of Rs. 2 lacs in case of default by Jyoti Parshad. A deed of guarantee was also executed. As Jyoti Parshad did not pay, the Bank started proceedings against Rattan Singh under the Act. The Managing Director of the Bank dismissed the objections raised by Rattan Singh. The Board of Directors dismissed the appeal. The appellant filed a petition in the Court of the Insolvency Judge praying for adjudication of Rattan Singh Respondent as insolvent on account of his transfer of his houses and agricultural lands without consideration to his wife and two sons within 3 months of the petition with intent to defeat and delay his creditor Bank having full knowledge of his liability towards the State. The contention of the Respondent was that he did not stand surety and that the impugned transfer of lands and houses was made on account of natural love and affection for his wife. The insolvency petition was dismissed by the Insolvency Judge on the ground that the Respondent had not executed a deed of guarantee. The appellant went in appeal to the District Judge but the appeal was dismissed. The revision was also dismissed by the High Court. The appellant came to this court after obtaining special leave.
 The contentions of the appellant before this court were that the Civil Court had no jurisdiction to determine matters which could be determined by the Head of the Department under the provisions of the Act, that the Head of the Department in the exercise of the powers conferred under s.
 4 on him could not only determine the amount due from the defaulter but also could determine whether the alleged defaulter was really a defaulter or not and that in view of s. 1 1 of the Act, a civil court could not determine the question of the liability of the alleged defaulter to pay the debt demanded from him. The contentions of the Respondent were that the Head of the Department could only determine the amount of debt due from a person alleged to be a defaulter but could not determine whether that person was defaulter or not and even if the Head of the Department could determine the liability of the alleged defaulter to pay the debt, the jurisdiction of the Insolvency Court itself to decide whether the debt was due from the alleged debtor sought to be declared insolvent was not ousted by the provisions of s. II of the Act and that the Insolvency Court was not a civil court. Dismissing the appeal, Held : The provisions of s. 4 of the Act empower the Head of department to determine not only the amount of State dues recoverable but also the liability of the alleged defaulter to pay those debts. In view of the provisions of s. 11 of the Act, no civil court has jurisdiction to determine the amount of State 1100 dues recoverable and the liability of the alleged defaulter to pay that amount. Such powers were however possessed by the Insolvency Court. In the present case, the Insolvency Court had found that the Respondent had not executed the surety bond and therefore, was not liable to make good any payment under it. The order of the Insolvency Judge dismissing the insolvency petition was correct. An insolvency court can go behind a decree and probe into the genuineness of the debt on which it is founded.
