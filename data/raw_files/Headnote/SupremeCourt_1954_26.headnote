 Held, (i) that explanation II to s. 2(g) of the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act (Act XXI of 1947) as amended by Central Provinces and Berar Act (Act XVI of 1949) is ultra vires the State Legislature.
 (ii) A threat by the State to realize tax from the assesses without the authority of law by using the coercive machinery of the impugned Act is a sufficient infringement of his fundamental right under art. 19(1)(g) and gives him a right to seek relief under art. 226 of the Constitution. The impugned Act, requiring the assesses to-deposit the whole of the tax before he can get the relief provided by it, cannot be said to provide an adequate alternative remedy.
