 The appellant was convicted under s. 165-A, I.P.C. for offering a bribe to a Customs appraiser and was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment and fine. On appeal the High Court upheld the conviction but reduced the sentence of imprisonment to six months.
 Before the Special Judge the appellant had filed applications for the production of three documents viz. :
 (i) the application made by S, the informer, for rewards for his services as an informer; (ii) receipts signed by S for the amounts he received as reward and (iii) the notings made by the appraiser on the Central Intelligence Unit file regarding the application by S for reward. The Department objected to their Production on the ground that the appraiser could not be compelled to say or divulge any information as to the commission of any offence against the public revenue and that the documents were made in official confidence and public interest would suffer from disclosure of any of the documents on the file. The Special Judge dismissed the applications. When the appeal was pending, the High Court passed an order bringing on record certain portions from the file of the Central Intelligence Unit.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (i) The order of the High Court permitting certain portions of the confidential file to be brought on record was not correct. The High Court seemed to have been more concerned with the provisions of s. 125 than with s. 124 of the Evidence Act. While portions brought on record might not contravene the provisions of s. 125 there was no doubt that they contravene s. 124. The notings on the file were made in official confidence. [608-H] (ii) The fact that S had acted as an informer and applied for rewards for his services did not in any way affect 'the, merits of the case. The crucial question was whether the appellant did make an offer of bribe to the appraiser and did give it to him. Documents in respect of which privilege was claimed did not impinge on the question of guilt or innocence of the accused. [609-D] In the circumstances of this case there was no harassment of the appellant and no case had been made out for reducing the sentence.
 Ramjanam Singh v. State of Bihar, A.I.R. 1955 S.C. 643, held inapplicable.
