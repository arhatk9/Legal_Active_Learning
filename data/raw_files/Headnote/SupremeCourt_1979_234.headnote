 A First Information Report alleging loss of legitimate revenues due to the railway by defrauding it with the connivance of railway officials either by loading pearl coke without being booked according to railway rules in the empty wagons after the manganese ore in them were unloaded at Adityapur in Tatanagar, a railway siding of the Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. or by diverting without regular booking of tanks containing furnace oil, was lodged on March 11, 1977, consequent upon which a case was registered at Tatanagar G.R.P.S. disclosing offences under sections 420/120B, 418 and 368 Indian Penal Code and sections 105/106 of the Indian Railways Act, against 9 persons. One S. R. I. Rizvi, Inspector of Railway Police, S. E. Railway Tatanagar commenced investigation into the offences under the general supervision of R. P. Singh S.P. Railway Police appellant in Crl. Appeal No. 300/79 and Respondent 6 in Crl. Appeal No.
 301/79. The D.I.G. Railway Police who was the immediate superior of Respondent 6, wrote a letter to the D.I.G., C.I.D., Bihar on May 11. 1977 requesting him to entrust the investigation to the Central Bureau of investigation, but the Inspector General of Police, Bihar, as per his letter dated June 24, 1977, declined the request. In the meantime on June 16, 1977 on a complaint from one Mr. Rusi Modi representative of TISCO, at Patna to the Chief Secretary to the Government alleging harassment of TISCO officials by respondent 6 and requesting for appropriate steps, the cabinet took the decision to transfer respondent 6. One Shri R. H. Modi who was required to appear before the Investigating Officer, made some enquiry by his letter dated November 4 1977 which was copied to some higher police officers including Respondent 2, Inspector General of Police, Bihar, acting on the copy of that letter requested Respondent 3, Addl. I.G., C.I.D. to look into the complaint of 17 Mr. Modi. The third respondent sent a telegraphic communication to Respondent 6 informing him that the investigation of the aforesaid offences had been taken over by the C.I.D. The Commissioner, South Chhota Nagpur Division, Ranchi, on a request made by the Secretary to Government of Bihar (Home) Police department enquired into the allegations made by officers of TISCO against respondent 6 and, after consultations with D.I.G., Railway, the immediate superior of Respondent 6 submitted his report dated December 27, 1977 giving a clean chit to Respondent 6.
 In the meantime, there was another application from M.L.As and M.L.Cs seven in all addressed to the Inspector General of Police, Vigilance, Bihar making serious allegations against the investigation made by the C.I.D. under the supervision of respondent 3, whereupon the Chief Secretary to Government of Bihar submitted a note to the Chief Minister on August 28, 1978 suggesting that the case involved in the matter be handed over to the CBI for inquiry. This note was approved and signed by the Chief Minister on the same day. In the meantime, the Chief Secretary by his letter dated September 2, 1978 directed respondent 3 to send all papers of the case with a note indicating the stage of investigation, to him and in compliance therewith respondent 3 sent all papers of investigation till then done to the Chief Secretary with his covering letter dated September 11, 1978. The CBI declined to undertake the investigation and suggested that the Inspector General, Vigilance Department may be asked to conduct the investigation. The recommendation made accordingly by the Chief Secretary on February 8, 1979 was accepted by they Chief Minister on February 27, 1979. In- between on January 18 1979, even though the papers were still with the Chief Secretary respondent 3 directed the investigating officer respondent 4 to submit the final report. When the Chief Secretary came to know about it he wrote to respondent 2 deprecating the conduct of respondent 3 in pushing through the matter, though the papers were not with him and he was orally instructed not to submit the final report. As under the direction and orders of respondent 3, respondent 4 had already submitted final report on February 6, 1979, a communication was addressed to respondent 5. Superintendent of Railway Police who had taken over charge from respondent 6 to move the court not to accept the final report and await report of Police after completion of the further investigation which was directed by the Government in the case. The matter was placed before the Addl. Chief Judicial Magistrate on February 24, 1979 along with report of the Assistant Public Prosecutor not to accept the final report of "no case" filed by respondent 4, whereupon the learned Magistrate passed an order to await report on further investigation and adjourned the matter to 23-3-1979 for further orders.
 On March 5, 1979, J. A. C. Saldanha respondent 1 and one of the officials named in the First Information Report filed a Writ Petition in the High Court questioning the validity, legality and correctness of the order of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate.. A full Bench of the High Court by its Judgment dated May 14, 1979 quashed the order inter alia holding that the direction given by the Chief Secretary with the concurrence of the Chief Minister for handing over investigation of the case to the Inspector General Vigilance was illegal in as much as the I.G., Vigilance could not be entrusted in law with the investigation of the case registered with the railway police and consequently the learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate was in error in postponing the consideration of the final report already submitted by respondent 4 till such unauthorised investigation was completed.
 18 Allowing the appeal by the State, the Court ^ 
 HELD : 1. A combined reading of sections 2(h), 2(r), 36, 156 and 173(8) of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 read with sections 1, 3, 12, and 22 of Indian Police Act, 1861 would indicate that the State Government was not precluded from directing further investigation in the case in which one investigating officer had submitted his 'final report' under section 173(2) of the Code, but on which the Court had not passed any order. Section 156 enables the officer incharge of a Police Station to investigate without the order of a Magistrate into a cognizable case committed within the area of the police station. Under section 36 police officers superior in rank to an officer in charge of a police station may exercise the same powers, throughout the local area to which they are appointed as may be exercised by such officer within the limits of his station.
 Section 173(8) enables an officer-in-charge of the Police Station to undertake for their investigation in a case where he has already submitted a report under sub-section (2) of section 173 and if in course of such further investigation he collects additional oral or documentary evidence, he has to forward the same in the prescribed form to the Magistrate. [27 G, 28 A, C-D, 32 G] 
 2. The officer directed by the State Government to carry on the investigation is Inspector General Vigilance.
 He is undoubtedly an officer superior in rank, may not be departmentwise administrative hierarchy, to an officer in charge of police station. Inter se departmental division such as Inspector General of Police or Inspector General Vigilance, Or Additional Inspector General C.I.D. may be merely a division of work for administrative efficiency but the Inspector General of Police could not by any stretch of imagination be said not to be an officer superior in rank to an officer in charge of a police station. [28 D-F] Rule 7(a) of the Bihar Police Manual provides that the police force of the entire State is under the overall charge of Inspector General of Police and for the help of Inspector General and for the convenience of carrying out the work connected with the different branches of police administration, Deputy Inspector General and Assistant Inspector-General of the rank of Superintendent are posted at headquarters. The use of the word 'rank' in s. 36 of the Code comprehends the hierarchy of police officers. It is equally clear that Inspector General of Police will have jurisdiction over the whole of the State. Division of work, but not demarcating any local area indicates that Inspector General, Vigilance, will have jurisdiction extending over the whole of the State and this equally becomes clear from the Notification dated June 6, 1973, issued by the State Government in exercise of the power under clause (s) of sub- section (1) of s. 4 of the 1908 Code declaring that in respect of certain offences the Vigilance Department shall be deemed to be a police station having its jurisdiction throughout the whole State of Bihar. Even apart from this, Inspector General appointed by the State Government has jurisdiction over the whole of the State unless the contrary is indicated. If he is thus an officer superior in rank to an officer in charge of a police station he could in view of s. 36 exercise the powers of an officer in charge of a police station throughout the local area to which he was appointed meaning thereby the whole of Bihar State as might be exercised by an officer in charge of a police station within the limits of his police station. It was to him that the investigation of the case was ordered to be handed over by the State Government. [28 G-H, 29 A-4] 19 R. P. Kapoor and Ors. v. Sardar Partap Singh Kairon and Ors., [1960] INSC 184; [1961] 2 SCR 143 at 153-154; applied.
 
 3. The State of Bihar is governed by the Indian Police Act, 1861. A combined reading of sections 1, 3, 12 and 22 of the Act makes it clear that (a) investigation comprehends detection of crime; (b) General police district covers the entire State and (c) the superintendence of the police throughout a general-police district shall vest in and shall be exercised by the State Government to which such district is subordinate. Inspector General, Vigilance being appointed for the whole of the State, is a police officer considered to be on duty for all purposes of the Act and it is open to the State Government to employ him as police officer in any part of the general district. [29 F, 30 A-C] 
 4. The general power of superintendence as conferred by section 3 of the Police Act 1861 would comprehend the power to exercise effective control over the actions performance and discharge of duties by the members of the police force throughout the general district. The word 'superintendence' would imply administrative control enabling the authority enjoying such power to give directions to the subordinate to discharge its administrative duties and functions in the manner indicated in the order. It is only when a subordinate authority subject to superintendence is discharging duties and functions of a quasi-judicial character under a statute that the inhibition of abdication of such power can be invoked. But where the subordinate subject to such power of superintendence of the superior is discharging administrative and executive function, obligations and duties the power of superintendence would comprehend the authority to give directions to perform the duty in a certain manner, to refrain from performing one of the other duty, to direct some one else to perform the duty and no inhibition or limitation can be read in this power unless the section conferring such power prescribes one. Such is the scope and ambit of power conferred by s. 3 on the State Government of superintendence over the entire police force of the State. [30 E-H] Makeshwar Nath Srivastava v. State of Bihar & Ors.
 [1971] INSC 69; [1971] 3 S.C.R. 863 followed.
 
 5. Unless the power is limited or fettered or taken away by some specific provision to the contrary, the general power of superintendence would comprehend power to issue directions, orders for performance of duty in a certain manner, directing some one else to discharge certain function, refrain from performing certain duty, etc.
 Superintendence connotes supervision which implies a hierarchy, viz. supervisor and the one supervised. It would, therefore, mean keeping a check, watch over the work of another who may be a subordinate in a hierarchy of authority. It would also comprehend that supervision is not merely a negative thing so as to keep a watch but it would imply giving of direction, guidance, even instructions, and in a given case and in a given situation asking one who is being supervised to forbear from doing a thing and directing someone else to do that thing. [31 G-H, 32 A-B] Rajkumar v. Ramsundar A.I.R. 1932 P.C. 69, referred to.
 
 6. Superintendence would comprehend the power to direct further investigation if the circumstances so warrant. There is nothing in the police Act to indicate the narrow construction of the word "superintendence" in section 3 to 20 mean 'general supervision' of the management of the police department and does not vest the State Government with authority to decide what the police alone is authorised to decide. [32 D-E] 
 7. Sub-section (8) of section 173 of the Code is not the source of power of the State Government to direct further investigation. Section 173(8) enables an officer in charge of a police station to carry on further investigation even after a report under s. 173(2) is submitted to Court.
 But if State Government has otherwise power to direct further investigation it is neither curtailed, limited nor denied by s. 173(8) more so, when the State Government directs an officer superior in rank to an officer in charge of police station thereby enjoying all powers of an officer in charge of a police station to further investigate the case. Such a situation would be covered by the combined reading of s. 173(8) with s. 36 of the Code. [32 F-H, 33 A] 
 8. There is no warrant or invoking the principle, namely "if a statute directs a thing to be done in a certain way that thing shall not, even if there be no negative words be done in any other way" because section 5 of the code provides that nothing in the code shall, in the absence of a specific provision to the contrary, affect any special or local law for the time being in force, or any special form of procedure prescribed, by any other law for the time being in force. Section 3 of the Police Act does not prescribe any special procedure for investigation contrary to one prescribed in the Code. It merely provides for conferment of certain power which, when exercised, would project into the provisions of the Code which confers power on the officer in charge of a police station to carry on further investigation under s. 173(8) after submission of a report and that too without any permission of the Magistrate. There is no conflict between the two provisions. Power to direct investigation or further investigation is entirely different from the method and procedure of investigation and the competence of the person to investigate. Section 3 of the Act deals with the powers of the State Government to direct further investigation into the case. Undoubtedly, such direction will be given to a person competent to investigate the offence and the police officer in rank superior to the police officer in charge of the police station, Inspector General, Vigilance, has been directed to carry on further investigation. An Officer superior to rank to an officer-in- charge of a police station could as well exercise the power of further investigation under s. 173(8) in view of the provision embodied in s. 36 of the Code. If that be so, such superior officer could as well undertake further investigation on his own and it is immaterial and irrelevant that he does it at the instance or on the direction of the State Government. Such a direction in no way corrodes his power to further investigate on his own. [33 G-H, 34 A-D] State of Gujarat v. Shantilal Mangaldas and Ors. [1969] INSC 8; [1969] 3 SCR 341 at 372, ex-parte Stephens [1876] Ch.D., 659 and Patna Improvement Trust v. Smt. Lakshmi Devi and Ors., [1963] Suppl 2 SCR 812; referred to.
 
 9. The power of the Magistrate under s. 156(3) to direct further investigation is clearly an independent power and does not stand in conflict with the power of the State Government. The power conferred upon the Magistrate under s.
 156(3) can be exercised by the Magistrate even after submission of a report by the investigating officer which would mean that it would be open to the Magistrate not to accept the conclusion of the investigating officer and direct 21 further investigation. This provision does not in any way affect the power of the investigating officer to further investigate the case and even after submission of the report as provided in s. 173(8). Therefore, the High Court was in error in holding that the State Government in exercise of the power of superintendence under s. 3 of the Act lacked the power to direct further investigation into the case. [34 E-F] 
 10. The contention that the action of the Chief Secretary in suggesting that the investigation be taken over by the C.B.I. and the acceptance of the same by the Chief Minister suffered from legal malice in as much as both had no jurisdiction, authority or power to make such an order to transfer investigation or to direct further investigation when a report was already submitted by the investigating officer to the Court competent to take cognizance of the case is not correct. [38 B-C] If the Chief Secretary as the highest executive officer at the State level exercising power of superintendence over the police of the State posted in general police district would have powers to suggest change of investigating machinery in the circumstances disclosed in the letter dated May 11, 1977, of the D.I.G., Railway, the report of the Commissioner of South Chhotanagpur Division, and the complaint of MLAs./MLCs., his action could not be said to be without power or authority. If he had acted otherwise, a charge of inaction or failure or default in performance of his duty as the highest chief executive officer would be squarely laid at his door. He acted in the best tradition of the Chief executive officer in public interest and for vindication of truth and in an honest and unbiased manner.
 Afterall, if he had even the remotest bias against any one, he could have as well suggested in agreement with the earlier investigation done by respondent 6 and the report submitted by him for submitting the charge-sheet that a charge-sheet should be filed. In fact, the Chief Secretary with utmost candour, with a view to vindicating the honour of the administration, proposed ascertainment of truth at the hands of CBI, a body beyond reproach as far as local politics is concerned, and that is unchallengeable.
 [38 F-H, 39 A-B] 
 11. The Police officers should refrain from addressing communications to the Courts on pending matters required to be determined judicially. In the instant case, though the conduct of the Superintendent of Police, in informing the learned Additional Judicial Magistrate about the decision of the Government to continue the investigation, by the letter dated February 15, 1979 is not proper, it makes no difference in the matter because the Magistrate acted not on that letter, but on an application made by the Assistant Public Prosecutor in charge of the case and that is the legally accepted mode of obtaining a judicial order. [39 C- E] 
 12. The power of the Police to investigate into a cognizable offence is ordinarily not to be interfered with by the Judiciary. There is a clear cut and well demarcated sphere of activity in the field of crime detection and crime punishment. Investigation of an offence is the field exclusively reserved for the executive through the police department, the superintendence over which vests in the State Government. The executive which is charged with a duty to keep vigilance over law and order situation is obliged to prevent crime and if an offence is alleged to have been committed it is its bounden duty to investigate into the offence and bring the offender to book. Once it investigates and finds 22 an offence having been committed it is its duty to collect evidence for the purpose of proving the offence. Once that is completed and the investigating officer submits report to the Court requesting the Court to take congizance of the offence under s. 190 of the Code its duty comes to an end.
 On a cognizance of the offence being taken by the Court the police function of investigation comes to an end subject to the provision contained in s. 173(8), there commences the adjudicatory function of the judiciary to determine whether an offence has been committed and if so, whether by the person or persons charged with the crime by the police in its report to the Court, and to award adequate punishment according to law for the offence proved to the satisfaction of the Court. There is thus a well defined and well demarcated function in the field of crime detection and its subsequent adjudication between the police and the Magistrate. [39-G-H, 40 A-D] King Emperor v. Khwaja Ahmad, [1944] L.R. 71 I.A. 203 at 213; followed.
 
 13. Court should be quite loathe to interfere at the stage of investigation, a field of activity reserved for Police and the executive. In the instant case, the High Court in exercise of the extraordinary jurisdiction committed a grave error by making observations on seriously disputed questions of facts taking its cue from affidavits which in such a situation would hardly provide any reliable material. The High Court was clearly in error in giving the direction virtually amounting to a mandamus to close the case before the investigation is complete. The High Court virtually has usurped the jurisdiction of the Magistrate.
 The case is not a stage where the Court is called up to quash the proceeding as disclosing no offence, but the case is at a stage where further investigation into the offence is sought to be thwarted by interference in exercise of the extraordinary jurisdiction. [41 B-D, 42 F-H] S. N. Sharma v. Bishan Kumar Tiwari, [1970] INSC 61; [1970] 3 SCR 946;
 applied.
 
 14. If an information is lodged at the Police station and an offence is registered, the mala fides of the informant would be of secondary importance if the investigation produces unimpeachable evidence disclosing the evidence. [43 D-E] [The Court directed the allegations of mala fide made against Respondent 6 be expunged for the purpose of this appeal.] Observation 
 15. In Parliamentary democracy elected representatives have a duty to perform and their vigilance in performance of duty without anything shown as unbecoming of them cannot be unilaterally chastised. [38 A]
