 Upto the assessment year 1953-54 a business was being carried on by P as an individual. in March 1953, he entered into a partnership consisting of himself and others. For the assessment years 1954-55, 1955-56 and 1956-57 the firm filed returns of income and applied for registration under s. 26A of the Income-tax Act. 1922. The income-tax officer rejected' the application holding that there was no genuine firm. He accordingly assessed P as an individual in respect of the income earned in that business. As against that order the firm as well as P appealed to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner who allowed both the appeals. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner held that the business was that of the firm and' not of P. When the income-tax Officer proceeded to assess the firm for the assessment years 1954- 55, 1955-56 and 1956-57, the firm resisted it taking the plea that the proceedings were barred by limitation under s 34(3) of the Act. On the question whether the assessment for each of the assessment years was valid the High Court, on reference, held that the assessments were barred by time and were not saved by the second' proviso to s. 34(3) of the Act.
 Allowing the appeals to this Court.
 
HELD : Under the proviso the limitation of time would not apply to an assessment or re-assessment made on the assessee or any person in consequence of or to give effect to any finding or direction contained in an order under s. 31, 33, 33A and 33B, 66 or 66A. A finding which can be considered as relevant under the proviso must be one which was necessary for deciding the appeal before the authority; and the expression ,any person' refers to one who would be liable to be assessed for the whole or part of the income that went into the assessment of the year under appeal or revision. The person should be intimately connected with the proceedings in which the finding was given. [658 CD; 660 A-B, E-F] In the present case, the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner was made under s. 31. Though he had not given any direction, the order made by the Income-tax Officer was in consequence of the finding given by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. The finding given by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner that the business was that of the firm was absolutely necessary for deciding both the appeals before him. P, who was the dominant partner of the firm was not only interested in his own assessment but was also interested, in the assessment of the firm. The partners and the firm were intimately connected with him and hence, they are 'persons' coming within the scope of the proviso.
