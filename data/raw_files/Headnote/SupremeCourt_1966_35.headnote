 The respondent filed a plaint claiming properties mentioned in Schedules A and B thereof on the ground that he was adopted by the appellant who was widow of L. Apart from adoption the respondent's claim was based on being mentioned as persona designata in L's will. The relevant words in the will were : "It has been settled that my wife should take, the second son of my elder brother.......... in adoption, celebrate his marriage, etc., and after he passes his minority she should deliver possession of my other movable and immovable properties that I have. ........... The trial court held that the respondent had not been adopted by the appellant nor was he entitled to any rights as persona designata in L's will. On appeal the High Court held that while there was no adoption, the respondent was entitled to the property as persona designata. The appellant came to this Court. The question presented for determination was whether the High Court was right in holding that upon a true construction of the will Ex.B-1 there was a gift of the property to the plaintiff as persona designata.
 
HELD :. The will contained no direct words of disposition in favour of the respondent. There was no expression of devise in favour of the respondent. There was only a direction to the widow to adopt and' the gift to the respondent was on condition of being adopted. The. respondent's claim as persona designata could not therefore be accepted.
