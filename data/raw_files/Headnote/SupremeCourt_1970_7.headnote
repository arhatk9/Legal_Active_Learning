 The appellants were exporters of jute carpet backing cloth and in connection with some exports by them between January 1957 and January 1963 penalties were imposed on them under s. 167(8) of the Sea Customs Act for contravention of s.
 12(1) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act No. 7 of 1947 in view of the provisions of s. 23A of the Act and s. 19 of the Sea Customs Act by the Adjudicating Officer. Appeals to the Central Board of Revenue were dismissed. The Board in upholding the penalties found two defects in the declarations filed by the appellants in purported competence with s. 12(1) of the Act 7 of 1947, namely : (1) that the invoice value of the goods was shown at a figure lower than the real sale, value;- (2) that in the declaration it was stated that the invoice value declared was the full export value of the goods and was the same as that contracted with the buyer, whereas the correct declaration should have been that the declarations contained a fair valuation or the goods which were unsold. The declarations were given in form G.R. It prescribed by the Rules framed under Act 7 of 1947. In appeal before this Court against the decision of the Board it was urged on behalf of the appellants that the defects in question did not amount to contravention of the restrictions imposed by s. 12(1) of the Act 7 of 1947, so that the imposition of the penalties was not justified.
 
HELD : (i) In view of the decision of this Court in the case of M/s. Rai Bahadur Shreeram Durga Prasad (P) Ltd. which was fully applicable to the facts of the present case the imposition of the penalties on the basis that the under- valuation of the goods amounted to contravention of s. 12(1), was unjustified. [447 B] Union of India v. M/s' Rai Bahadur Shreeram Durga Prasad Ltd. and Ors. [1969] 1 S.C. Cases 9 1, applied.
 (ii) The second defect found by the Board in the declarations related to points on which s. 12(1) does not require a declaration. A declaration, which is in contravention of the Rule or' the forms,prescribed under the Rules may be penalised under s. 23 of the Act but such contravention will not attract the provisions of the Sea Customs Act Under s. 2 3 A of the Act 7 of 1947 only a breach of restrictions imposed by s,'12(1) of the Act is to be deemed to be a contravention of restrictions imposed by s. 19 of the Sea Customs Act. An incorrect declaration in contravention of the Rules made under s. 27 of the Act 7 of 1947 is not to be deemed a contravention of any restriction imposed by s. 19 of the Sea Customs Act. Therefore the imposition on the appellants of penalties under s. 167(8) of the Sea Customs Act was totally unjustified: [447 C-F] 446
