 The truck of the respondent was requisitioned under s. 2 of the East Punjab Movable Property (Requisitioning) Act, 1947 for famine relief work. The section provides that the State Government, if it considers it necessary or expedient so to do, may requisition any movable property provided that no property used for the purpose of religious worship and no aircraft or any thing connected with aircraft, shall be requisitioned.
 On the question of the constitutional validity of the section 
HELD : (Per A. N. Ray, C.J., H. R. Khanna, A. Alagiriswami and P. N. Bhagwati, JJ. :) The Act confers arbitrary powers for requisitioning of movable property upon the authorities under the Act and no guidelines whatsoever have been prescribed for the exercise of the powers. The provision therefore falls within the mischief which Art. 14 of the Constitution is designed to prevent and hence is invalid.
 In view of the complex nature of the problems a modern State has to face, it is but inevitable that matters of detail should be left to the authorities acting under an enactment.
 Discretion has therefore to be given to the authorities con- cerned for the exercise of powers vested in them under in enactment. Such vesting does not by itself entail contravention of Art. 14. What is objectionable is the conferment of arbitrary and uncontrolled discretion without any guidelines for the exercise of that discretion. The enactment must therefore prescribe the guidelines so that, within the framework of those guidelines the authorities can exercise their discretion. But discretion which absolute and uncontrolled degenerates into arbitrariness. If a Legislature bestows such untrammeled discretion on authorities, it abdicates its essential function, for, such discretion is bound to result in discrimination which is a negation of the ideal of equally enshrined in Art. 14. A statute need not itself make any classification of the persons or things for the purpose of applying its provisions, but may leave it to the Government to select and classify In determining the validity of such a statute, the Court will not strike it down, merely because no classification appears on its face or because discretion is given to Government to make the classification. The Court will examine and ascertain if the statute has laid down any principle or policy for the guidance of the Government in the matter of classification; and it is only if the statute does not lay down any such principle or policy that the court will strike down the statute on the ground that it provides for the delegation of arbitrary and uncontrolled power to the Government which may result in discrimination. [774H] (1) In the present case, the Act confers uncontrolled power on the State Government or the officers authorised by it to requisition any movable property except those excluded. No guidelines have been laid down in the Act regarding the object or the purpose for which the State Government or its officers may consider it necessary or expedient to requisition. The Act does not even require that the authority requisitioning the movable property should specify the purpose in the order of requisition. [773G] (2) There is no provision in the Act that the power of requisitioning can be exercised only for a public purpose or in an emergency or in some special contingency. To read the words 'for a public purpose' in the section, when the words are not there, would amount to judicial legislation. [773H] 769 (3)It is open under the Act, for an authorised officer to requisition any movable property for any purpose. It is no answer to say that an officer would not do so when there is nothing in the Act which makes it impermeable for him to requisition any movable property for any purpose whatsoever.
 [774A-B] (4)The power under the Act can be exercised not only by the State Government but by any of its officers to whom it may be delegated by the State Government. The Act does not specify that the delegate should not be an officer below a particular rank and hence the powers of requisitioning could be conferred even upon a petty officer. [774D] (5)No suitable machinery is provided in the Act for determining the compensation payable to the owner.
 According to s. 4. it shall be such amount as the State Government may determine. [774D-E] (6)The fact that Act is a pre-Constitution Act makes no difference. The protection afforded by Art. 31(5) to pre- Constitution laws is against the challenge on theground of contravention of Art. 31(2) and not against challenge on the ground of contravention of Art. 14. [774G] (7)Both the conditions laid down in Pannalal Binjraj v.
 Union of India [1956] INSC 86; [1957] S.C.R. 233 are satisfied. There is every possibility of real and substantial discrimination under the impugned Act; and the Act impinges on the fundamental right of property. [776G-H] (8)In adjudicating on the Constitutional validity of statutes, the courts discharge an obligation imposed on them by the Constitution and no judicial arrogance is involved.
 The Courts would be shirking their responsibility if they hesitate to declare the provisions of a statute unconstitutional when they are found to be violative of the articles of the Constitution. Abnegations in a matter where power is conferred to protect the interests of others against measures which are violative of the Constitution is not commendable and is fraught with serious consequences.

 Per Mathew J : (dissenting) With the proliferation of the functions of the State, it has become necessary to vest wide discretionary powers upon administrative organs of the State. Often it is practically useless to lodge power in a public functionary without giving him a large measure of discretion for, the situations which might arise in public affairs are multifarious and very often unpredictable and unforeseen. There is always a potential danger in vesting any discretionary power in any person as it is liable to be abused or exercised in a discriminatory manner, however much the legislature might try to hedge the power with safeguards. [781F] (1)It is impossible for anybody to read the section as conferring a power to requisition any movable property for a purpose other than a public purpose.
 (2)Nothing hinges upon the presence or absence of such phrases as 'public interest' 'public good', 'public purpose', Courts and parties all assume that the legislature always wants protection of the public interest, to serve public causes and do things for public good or to exercise powers for public purposes, and, always intends that administrators act justly and reasonably whether the legislative says so or not in the statute. Government exists and its only title to exist is claim to advance the public good and serve the public interest. So, when the section said that the State Government may requisition if it considers 'necessary or expedient', it can only mean, when it considers 'necessary' or "expedient' so to do public interest. This is implied in the section and when the purpose for which a power is given may not be specified in the Act, the Court is not prevented from inferring the purpose. The expression 'necessary' or 'expedient' used in the section 770 is sufficient to give an adequate guidance to the Government when read in juxtaposition with the implied Purpose of the concernment of the power. 'Necessary' means 'what is indispensable, needful or essential' and 'expedient means 'useful for affecting a desired result, fit or suitable for the purpose.' One has to appreciate the fact that the legislature, while laying down the policy or principle, is bound to keep in mind the nature of the problem that is to be tackled by the State Government. A variety of factors and circumstances arise for consideration in deciding whether a particular movable property should or should not be requisitioned. The legislature rightly decided that it would not serve the purpose if it were to define and describe all the relevant factors which have to be taken into account for requisitioning any movable property. It was not necessary for the legislature to supply the State Government with a more specific formula for its guidance where flexibility and adaptation to infinitely variable conditions constitute the essence of the legislative scheme.
 The expression 'necessary or expedient' read in conjunction with the public purpose implied in the section does canalise the exercise of the power and discretion of the Government.
 [780H. 781H; 782F] (3)The validity of the section must be tested with reference to its terms and not what an officer to whom the State Government delegates the power under s. 8 might do in his quixotic vagaries. The presumption is that public functionaries will administer the law properly. Courts do not strike down a provision in a statute on the assumption that a person invested with power under it would, exercise it with an evil eye and unequal hand'. So long as courts are open in this country and the doctrine of abuse of power is there need be no apprehension that any power will be exercised arbitrarily or in a discriminatory manner merely because the power is apparently capable of being so exercised. It is perfectly open to the State Government or an officer to whom the power is delegated to exercise it in a reasonable and non-discriminatory manner. The court'& power is properly invoked it a person is actually aggrieved by the exercise of the power under the law. [785B] (4)If the power which is conferred on the State Government under s. 2 of the Act is valid there is no objection to that power being delegated. It cannot be assumed that the State Government will delegate the power without due regard to the status of, the delegate in the official hierarchy. The vesting of the discretionary power in a State Government or in a high public dignitary is a guarantee that the power will be exercised on the basis of a reasonable standard for the purpose intended by the legislature. [785F] (5)It is not contrary to the rule of law that powers should be vested ill public officers for performing public functions. What the rule of law requires is that any abuse of power by public officers should be subject to the control of the courts. There is nothing unreasonable in granting power to meet unforeseen situations. If there are no guidelines for the exercise of the power the vesting of the power in a functionary need not be struck down.
 Unreasonableness it to be found in its exercise and not in its existence. [782F-G] (6)Under Art. 31(5). being an existing law, the Act is not liable to be challenged on the score that it violates the fundamental right under Art. 31(2). It was not necessary for the Act to have expressly stated that the requisition of movable property could only be for a public purpose and to have fixed the amount of compensation or the principles therefore. [779H] (7)In Pannalal Binjraj v. Union of India, [1957] S.C.R.
 233 this Court held that a power which is discretionary is not necessarily discriminatory and abuse of power cannot be easily assumed where the discretion is vested in high officials. The Court was also of the view that there might be cases where improper execution of power will result in discriminatory treatment and injustice to the parties, but, the possibility of such discriminatory treatment cannot necessarily invalidate the legislation; and where there is abuse of such power, the parties aggrieved are not without ample remedies under the law and what will be struck down in such cases will not be the provision which invests the authorities with such power but the abuse of power itself by the authorities. [783H] (8)The attempt of the Court should be to preserve and not destroy. Respect for a coordinate branch of the Government as well as the presumption of constitutionality demands it.
 Before a duly enacted law can be judicially nullified, it 771 must be forbidden by some explicit restriction in the Constitution. The attitude of judicial humility which this consideration enjoins is not an abdication of the judicial function, but a due observance of its limits. A just respect for the legislature requires that the obligation of its laws should not be unnecessarily and wantonly assailed.
 In determining the constitutionality of an Act, the, Court should construe it in such a manner as to sustain it and every possible presumption will be indulged in for that purpose.
