 The State of Andhra Pradesh which came into existence under the States Reorganisation Act 1956 was formed out of the former State of Andhra and the Telengana area of the former State of Hyderabad. The appellants were engineers in the employment of Andhra State. On the formation of the State of Andhra Pradesh the appellants under the provisions of the Act continued to serve the State of Andhra Pradesh. The respondents who were Telengana Officers in the employment of the State of Hyderabad continued to serve the State of Andhra Pradesh. Prior to the reorganisation a Conference of Chief Secretaries was held in the months of April and May 1956, and certain principles were laid down for the equation of posts in the two services namely, the services of Andhra State and Hyderabad State which were to be allocated to the State of Andhra Pradesh. The factors to be taken into consideration for the fixation of inter se seniority of officers holding equivalent posts were laid down. In determining the length of continuous service periods for which an appointment was held in a purely stop-gap or fortuitous arrangement were to be excluded. In November 1961 the State Government of Andhra Pradesh, prepared a provisional common gradation list of gazetted officers in the Public Works Department. The Telengana engineers challenged the lists in the High Court and this Court. The result of the litigation was that the Central Government was asked to take immediate steps to finalise the list of integration in the manner prescribed in s. 115 of the States Reorganisation Act 1956 on the materials placed before it by the State Government. The Central Government after con- sidering representations made by the officers of the Telengana area and the Andhra State gave on December 24, 1965 its final decision concerning the equation of posts and inter se seniority of officers holding equivalent posts. In its decision the Central Government Inter alia pointed out hit the action taken by the Government of Andhra Pradesh in regularising with retrospective effect and in relaxation of the normal rules, the temporary appointments made in the erstwhile Andhra State to the posts of Assistant Engineers and Executive Engineers by Promotion from the next lower category of officers, had the effect of altering the service conditions of Andhra employees to the detriment of the interest of the employees from the Telengana unit and was therefore invalid. The Andhra Pradesh Government made a strong representation to the Central Government defending such regularisation. The Central Government by order dated 22/24 December, 1966, in partial modification of the order dated December 24, 1965, accepted the retrospective regularisation of service in respect of certain classes of officers. In the consequent writ petition filed lay the Telengana and Andhra Officers the High Court inter alia held : (i) that the decision of the Government of India dated 22/24 1966 11--L172Sup CI/73 946 was liable to be quashed on the ground that it violated the principles of natural justice and (ii) that the temporary promotion of Executive Engineers and Assistant Engineers in the Andhra State prior to November 1, 1956 were stop-gap and fortuitous arrangements. The High Court did not give any decision on the merits of the question of retrospective regularisation of the services of the Andhra Engineers on the equation of posts. In appeals to this Court by certificate, 
HELD : The High Court correctly held that the order of the Central Government dated 22/24 December 1966 was made without giving the Telengana area Officers any opportunity of making representation against the course of action which the Central Government adopted by that decision. The order was liable to be quashed. [954H-955A] It was not necessary to express any opinion as to whether the services of Andhra State Officers were stop-gap or fortuitous arrangements. Under the States Reorganisation Act power is conferred on the Central Government to bring about the integration of services in the State of Andhra Pradesh by ensuring fair and equitable treatment to all persons affected by the provisions of s. 115 of the Act.
 The observations of the High Court on the temporary service of the Andhra Officers to be stop-gap or fortuitous arrangements must therefore be set aside. [955H] In Raghavendra Rao's case this Court said that the broad purpose underlying the proviso to s. 115 (7) of the Act was to ensure that the conditions of service should not be changed except with the prior approval of the Central Government under Art. 309 of the Constitution the power of the State is preserved to make rules. The proviso to s.
 115(7) of the Act imposes a limitation on the State not to vary the contitions of service applicable immediately before November 1, 1956 to the disadvantage of persons mentioned in sub-sections (1) or (2) of s. 115 of the Act. If there is any question of change of conditions of service it will have to be found out whether in the first place it amounts to change in the conditions of service and. if so, secondly to find out whether there was prior approval of the Central Government. It will be within the province of the decision of the Central Government under a. 115 of the Act in regard to the integration of services and ensuring fair and equit- able treatment to all persons to determine the retrospective regularisation and relaxation of rules will amount to any change in the conditions of service or will result in denial of fair and equitable treatment to any of the persons affected thereby.
