 On December 19. 1962 the Government of Maharashtra referred certain ,disputes between the respondent workmen and their employers, to the Industrial Tribunal. Dispute no. 3 related to Production bonus payable to the workmen under the existing scheme. When the adjudication of the above reference was pending, the State Government on January 18, 1964 made another reference to the Tribunal of the question : "Should the existing Incentive Scheme of Production bonus be replaced by the new scheme evolved by Messrs. Ibcon Private Limited in their report dated October 1963 as desired by the Management ?" The respondent union filed an application before the Tribunal that the second reference dated January 18, 1964 should not be adjudicated upon as it really amounted to withdrawal of the previous reference made on December 19, 1962, and interfered with the powers of the Tribunal in dealing with dispute no. 3 in the first reference. The Tribunal overruled the objection but the High Court in a writ petition under Art. 226 accepted the contention of the union.
 In appeal by the State on certificate, 
HELD : Even without the second reference, the Tribunal, when dealing with demand no. 3 of the first reference. could have also considered the question of adopting the scheme evolved by Ibcon Private Limited because it was a relevant matter, and also connected with the Production Bonus Scheme. When it was so open to the Tribunal to consider the Scheme of Ibcon the fact that the Government specifically referred for consideration the said Scheme, makes no difference. At any rate the question covered by the second reference was a matter 'connected with or relevant' to dispute no. 3 of the first reference and hence the State was well within its jurisdiction under section 10(1)(d) of the Industrial Disputes Act in passing the order dated January 18, 1964.
 Accordingly, the appeal must be allowed and the judgment and order of the High Court must be set aside. [111G]
