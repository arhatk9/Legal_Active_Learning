 The respondent was charged under s. 408 I.P.C. for misappropriating the funds of his employer. The only witness to prove the entries and signatures on the cheques was the complainant (employer) and corroboration of his statement was sought from four documents two of which were said to be handed over to the complainant by the respondent when the respondent's conduct was found out. The other two documents were the, respondent's statement as are 'accused n a criminal case and an application given by the respondent in another case. The trial court convicted the respondent.
 On appeal, the High Court acquitted the respondent holding that (i) it was unsafe to rely on the statement of the complainant alone. (ii) the documents were inadmissible in evidence, and (iii) it was for the prosecution to example a handwriting expert to prove the disputed handwriting, In appeal by the State.
 HELD : The appeal must be allowed.
 (i) The complainant was competent to speak about entries and signatures, as the respondent had been his employee for a number of years. He had many an occasion to see the respondent write and sign. [251 D-E] (ii) The documents were admissible in evidence.
 The documents handed over by the respondent to the complainant and the statement of the respondent provide strong corroboration to the statement of the complainant.
 In fact the admission in the document together with the statement could also be treated as a confession of the respondent cashing the cheques, the subject matter of the charge in this case.
 The statements of the respondent in the criminal case and in the application in another case were admissible in evidence to prove his admissions with respect to these facts. [253 H;
 254 F] (iii) It was not essential that handwriting expert must be examined in a case to prove or disprove the disputed writing. A Court is competent to compare the disputed writing of a person with others which are admitted or proved to be his writings. It may not be safe for a Court to record a finding about a person's writing in a certain document merely on the basis of comparison, but a Court can itself compare the, writing in order to appreciate properly the other evidence produced before it in that regard. The opinion of an handwriting expert is also relevant in view of s. 45 of the Evidence Act, but that too is not conclusive.
 The sole evidence of a handwriting expert is not normally sufficient for recording a definite, finding about the writing being of a certain person or not. [251 G, H]
