 While s. 20 of the Limitation Act requires that the payment should be made before the expiration of the period of limitation, it does not require that the acknowledgement of the payment should also be made within that period. But it is essential that such acknowledgement, whether made before or after the period of limitation, must be in exist- ence prior to the institution of the suit. An acknowledge- ment of the payment by the defendant in a written statement filed after the institution of the suit is not enough.
