 A Khoti in the district of Kolaba is only a hereditary farmer of land 'revenue and is entitled to hold a village as Khoti on his entering every year into the customary Kabulayat. The presumption is that forest tracts and old waste belong to Government unless the presumption is displaced by positive evidence that Government has granted rights in any particular tract or piece of land or has consciously allowed adverse rights to grow therein.
 Therefore, in the absence of a sanad or a deed or a grant granting proprietary rights over the soil a Khoti is not a proprietor of the lands constituted as reserved 'forest in the Khoti village and is not entitled to any proprietary rights in the uncultivated or forest land.
 IN the present case the Special Deputy Collector (Khoti) Kolaba, directed certain amounts to be paid to the appellants for their share of compensation for Khoti rights in respect of reserved forest and unassessed land in a village under s. 12 of the Bombay Khoti Abolition Act, 1949.
 The Maharashtra Revenue Tribunal, in appeal, set aside the order and remanded the case for retrial stating the various points for decision, one of which was, 'whether the appellants prove that they are the proprietors of the lands in the village or in the lands attached as a reserved forest to the said village'.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The appellants should be given sufficient opportunity by the Special Deputy Collector for proving by oral and documentary evidence that they had proprietary rights in the status of Khoti and then dispose of the matter according to the law relating to the rights of a Khoti.
