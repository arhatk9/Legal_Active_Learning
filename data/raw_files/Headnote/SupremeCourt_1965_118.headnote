 The appellant submitted a return of her income from property and business for the assessment year 1947-48 and disclosed in a statement that the Maharani of Baroda had, between November 1945 and February 1948, "out of natural love and affection", given her some jewellery and money amounting to Rs. 5,20,000. The income-Tax Officer accepted this statement and did not treat the jewellery and money as taxable income. But while considering the payment of further similar amounts in the course assessment proceedings for a subsequent year, the Income-Tax Officer decided to issue the appellant a notice under s. 34; he eventually held the gifts made by the Maharani during the years in question to be remuneration for services rendered by the appellant as a maid-servant, or Secretary, and therefore to be taxable income.
 In appeal, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the Tribunal ,substantially agreed with the view taken by the Income-Tax Officer. Upon a reference, the High Court also decided in favour of the respondent, mainly on the ground that as the assessee was admittedly in receipt of large sums of money, in order to claim exemption from tax, the burden was upon her to-establish that these amounts were voluntary payments by the Maharani out of natural love and affection:
 and that this burden had not been discharged.
 On appeal to this Court.
 
HELD : The burden of proof was wrongly placed on the appellant. In all cases in which a receipt is sought to be taxed as income, the burden lies upon the Department to prove that it is within the taxing provision. Where, however, a receipt is of the nature of income, the burden of proving that it is not taxable because it falls within an exemption provided by the Act, lies upon the assessee. The appellant admitted that .she had received jewellery and diverse sums of money from the Maharani and claimed that as these were gifts made out of love and affection, they did not fall within the taxing provisions. It was not her case that being income, the receipts were exempt from taxation because of a statutory provision. Consequently, it was for the Department to establish that these receipts were chargeable to tax. [12 E-13 A] Whether a receipt is liable to be treated as income depends very largely upon the facts and circumstances of each case;
 it is open to the income-tax authorities to raise an inference that a receipt by an assembly is assessable income where he fails to disclose satisfactorily the source and the nature of the receipt. But here the source of income was dis- 9 closed by the appellant and there was no dispute about the truth of the disclosure. [14 C-D] Commissioner of Income Tax, West Bengal v.
