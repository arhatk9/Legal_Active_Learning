 In December, 1958, the appellant was appointed by direct recruitment as 'temporary Assistant Engineer on contract basis' for a period of three years' and he took charge on January 19, 1959. On March 14, 1962, the Government, after consulting the Public Service Commission and obtaining its concurrence passed an order regularising the appellant's service by absorbing him into the regular cadre of an Assistant Engineer retrospectively from Jan 19, 1959, though temporarily. On Nov. 15, 1968, he was confirmed as Assistant Engineer with effect from Feb. 27, 1961; in 1969, he was confirmed as an Executive Engineer with effect from Dec. 2, 1967; and in 1973, he was promoted as Superintending Engineer. The respondent was appointed, also by direct recruitment, on provisional basis on April 14, 1960 to act as temporary Assistant Engineer. On Nov. 15, 1968, he was also confirmed as Assistant Engineer but with effect from May 2, 1962; and in 1970, he was confirmed as Executive Engineer with effect from December 2, 1967. The respondent challenged the appointment of the appellant as Assistant Engineer and his subsequent promotions and claimed seniority over him. The High Court quashed the order absorbing the appellant into the regular cadre and the subsequent promotions, holding the absorption to be contrary to the Orissa Service of Engineers Rules, 1941, and hence invalid.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, ^ 
 HELD: (1) By r. 6 of the Rules, recruitment to the rank of Assistant Engineers can be made directly in compliance with rr. 8 to 15. The appellant satisfied everyone of the qualifications prescribed by these rules and was selected by the Public Service Commission in accordance with the rules.
 He was recommended by the Public Service Commission, under r. 13 and the recommendation was accepted by the Governor under r. 15. He was thereafter appointed as temporary Assistant Engineer on contract basic. But his appointment was, in terms, on a temporary basis and the fact that he held his post on contract did not make his tenure other than temporary. The subsequent course of his career, within the contractual period itself, shows that he was granted all the facilities and privileges which are available to employees in the regular cadre, temporary or permanent, which are generally not available to contractual employees. He drew the same pay as any other employee in the regular cadre of Assistant Engineers and he was fitted into the same pay scale. He drew no special benefits by reason of being on a contractual basis. [64 DG; 65 B-C] (2) Under r. 19(a), persons appointed by direct recruitment are required to be on probation for two years, and under r. 19(b), notwithstanding anything in cl. (a), when a temporary Assistant Engineer is selected for a permanent appointment to the service, the whole or part of the period of his temporary service shall, if approved by the Governor, count towards the prescribed period of probation. In the present case, what the Government did was to count the appellant's temporary service from January 19, 1959 to March 14, 1962, as it was entitled to do towards his probationary period. The 60 State Government selected him for permanent appointment as an Assistant Engineer and before doing so also obtained the concurrence of the Public Service Commission. [65 F-G; 64 F] (3) The appellant's appointment as an Assistant Engineer on a temporary basis was thus made on January 19, 1959, whereas the respondent's appointment to act was made on April 14, 1960. All along their respective service careers extending over 13 years, the appellant was recognised as senior. [66 C] Narayan Chandra Parida v. State of Orissa and I.L.R.

 (4) The respondent is guilty of laches. The appellant's appointment was gazetted on March 14, 1962. On November 15, 1968, the appellant and the respondent were confirmed as Assistant Engineers by a common Gazette Notification which showed the appellant's confirmation as on February 27, 1961, and that of the respondent as on May 2, 1962. And yet, till May 29, 1973, when the writ petitions were file in the High Court, the respondent did nothing except to file a representation to the Government in June, 1970 and a memorial to the Governor in April, 1973. The High Court should not have exercised its extraordinary jurisdiction in favour of the respondent who was unmindful of his rights for 12 years and in utter disregard of consequences to other service personnel. In June, 1974, the High Court set aside an appointment of March, 1962, of a person who had, in meantime, risen to the rank of Superintending Engineer. [66 D-G]
