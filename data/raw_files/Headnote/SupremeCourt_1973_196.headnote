 The appellant/petitioner, a dealer in scented supari, was charged with the offence of having sold and retained for selling scented supari with saccharin and cyclamate, prohibited artificial sweeteners, in contravention of S.
 7(i)(ii) and rule 47 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 and thereby having committed an offence punishable under section 16(1)(a)(i) of the Act. The Magistrate convicted the accused and imposed a fine of only Rs. 100/-.
 On revision the High Court enhanced the punishment to the statutory minimum of six months imprisonment and one thousand rupees fine. The rules which were, extant at the time of the alleged offence in January 1971 were rules 44(g) and 47 as redrafted by the Prevention of Food Adulteration (Third Amendment) Rules 1968 which prohibited the two sweeteners as additives to supari. In October 1972, a circular was issued by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay that the Central Committee for Food Standards had accepted the recommendation of is Sub-Committee that saccharin may be permitted to be used in scented. supari.
 In appeal of this Court the appellant admitted the sale as also the presence of saccharin and cyclamate in the supari sample. But he urged that section 23(i)(b) of the Act which empowered the framing of rules was bad, because, the statute laid down no policy, principles or guidelines regarding articles of food for which standards are to be prescribed, that supari is not( an article of food and, as such, the admixture of any sweetener cannot attract the per-at provisions; that the dealer believed in good-faith that there was no cyclamate in the substance sold induced by the warranty and did not know that saccharin was contraband, that neither saccharin nor cyclamate is biochemical risk, and so a blanket ban on their use is an unconstitutional restriction on he freedom of trade guaranteed in article 19;
 that there is discrimination against supari vis-a-vis carbonated waters wherein the use of saccharin is permitted under rule 47; and that in any event the Probation of Offenders Act should have been applied.
 Dismissing the appeal and the writ petition.
 
HELD : (i) The contravention of s. 7 read with rr. 44(g) and 47 being plainly proved the offence falls not under sub-s.
 (i) but sub-sec. (v) None of the many alternatives in s.
 2(i) applies because there is neither averment nor proof that the sweeteners in question are injurious to health and the other subclause cannot be attracted. [159G] (ii) The naked power submission is demolished by the guidelines implicit in the statute, by the committee built into the system. by the specifications contained in the rule making provisions and by the safeguard of laying the rules before the House. [161H] (iii) Supari is food within the meaning of S. 2(v) of the Act. The Act defines 'food' very widely as covering any article used as food and every component which enters into it and even flavoring matter and condiments. [162E] (iv) In food offenses strict liability is the rule. Nothing more than actus reus is needed where regulation of private activity in vulnerable areas like public health is intended.
 Social defence reasonably overpowers individual freedom to irrure, in special situations of strict-liabilily. Section 7 casts an absolute obligation regardless of scienter, bad faith and mens rea.

 35, p. 864, referred to.
 (iv) It is not the judicial function to enter the thicket of research controversy or scientific dispute where Parliament has entrusted the Central Government with the power, and therefore the duty of protecting public health against potential hazards and the Central Government, after consultation with a high-powered technical body, has prohibited the use of saccharin and cyclamates. The fact that for a long timepwen3 shrdlu cmfwyp etaoin shrdlu cmfwyp hmm against the reasonableness of their later ban. Where expertise of a complex nature is expected of the State in framing rules, the exercise of that,power not demonstrated as arbitrary must be presumed to be valid as a reasonable restriction on the fundamental right of the citizen and judicial review must halt at the frontiers. [164H] (v) There is no substance in the plea that there is a discrimination against supari Vis-a-vis carbonated waters.
 There is a basis for the distinction. Courts will not make easy assumption of unreasonableness of subordinate legislation. [165E] Kartar Singh's case[1964] INSC 30; , [1964] 6 S.C.R. 679; 690, and Andhra Grain Merchants. case[1970] INSC 79; , [1971] 1 S.C.R. 166, referred to.
 (vi) The kindly application of the probation principle is negatived by the imperatives of social defence and the improbabilities of moral proselytisation. No chances can be taken by society with a mar, whose antisocial operations, disguised as a respectable trade, imperil numerous innocents. Secondly economic offenses committed by white collar-criminals are unlikely to be dissuaded by the gentle probationary process. [166H] Isher Das v. State of Punjab, F19721 3 S.C.C. 65. referred to.
 (vii) The Court has jurisdiction to bring down the sentence to less than the, minimum prescribed in s' 16(1) provided there are adequate and special reasons in that behalf. The normal minimum is six months in jail and a thousand rupees fine. There is no reason to depart from the proposition that generally food offenses must be deterrently dealt with. The High Court, under the erroneous impression that the offence fell under s. 7(1) read with s. 16(1)(a)(1) did not address itself to the quantum of sentence. Even so that punishment fits the crime and the criminal. The magistrate completely failed to appreciate the gravity of food offers when he imposed the negligible sentence of one hundred rupees fine. [167H] [The necessity for the evolution of a rational and consistent policy of Sentencing emphasised.]
