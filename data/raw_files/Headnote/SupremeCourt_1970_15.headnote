 The Central Government promulgated the Sugar Control Order, 1963, under r. 125(2) of the Defence of India Rules, 1962.
 The respondents, who were holders of licences under the Andhra Pradesh Sugar Dealers Licensing Order, 1963, (issued under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955) and who were dealers in sugar in the cities of Hyderabad and ' Secunderabad, were 'recognised dealers' under the Sugar Control Order. They were allocated quotas of sugar, but, in 1964, the State Government) ordered that the sugar allocated to the two cities be given in its entirety to a Cooperative Stores. The respondents were thus prevented by an executive order from carrying on their business. They challenged the order successfully in the High Court.
 In appeal to this Court on the questions : (1) whether the order was protected under Arts. 358 and 359, because the President had declared a state of emergency; and (2) whether the order was violative of Art. 301, 
HELD : (1) (a) Under Art. 358 the respondents could not challenge any executive action which, but for provisions contained in Art. 19, the State was competent to take. But in the present case, the executive order was not one which the State was competent to make. Since the order of the State Government has the effect of cancelling the licences of the respondent, which could be done only after an enquiry according to the procedure prescribed in the Andhra Pradesh Sugar Dealers Licensing Order, the executive order was contrary to the statutory provisions contained in the Andhra Pradesh Sugar Dealers Licensing Order and the Sugar Control Order. Such executive action of the State, which is otherwise invalid, is not immune from attack under Art. 358, merely because a proclamation of emergency was in operation.
 [502 A-D] (a) In the present case, there was discrimination against the respondents in that the impugned order conferred a monopoly on the Cooperative Stores in disregard of the subsisting right of the respondents. The order is not protected under Art. 359, because only if it was shown to have been made under the authority reserved by the Defence of India Ordinance or the Rules made thereunder, that the jurisdiction of the court to entertain a petition for infringement of the guarantee under Art. 14 is excluded.
 [502 E-G] (2) The impugned order trenches Won the freedom of trade and commerce guaranteed by Art. 301.
 499 By this Article the freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of India is declared free. Under it, a restriction upon the legislative power of Parliament and State Legislature is imposed by the Constitution. The guarantee of the freedom is not in the abstract but to individuals. Within the limits of Arts. 304 and 305 there could be legislative restrictions upon the individuals' right to freedom of trade, but not, by executive action.
