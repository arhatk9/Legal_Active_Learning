 The petitioners were detained by orders of detention under s. 3 (2) of the Preventive Detention Act IV of 1950. After the grounds of detention were communicated to them, they made representations to the State Government against their detention. These were considered by the Advisory Board which reported under section 10 of the Act that there was sufficient cause for detention in each case and the State confirmed the detentions. under s. II (1) of the Act. By petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution, the petitioners challenged the legality of their detention on the ground that the representations made by them against their orders of detention were not considered by the respondent Government, but were merely forwarded by it to the Advisory Board.
 It was contended on behalf of the State Government that there was no, obligation on it to consider the representations since an Advisory Board had been constituted under Section 8 of the Act to consider the cases of the detenus and had reported that there was sufficient cause for their detention; and that there was no express language in Article 22 (5) of the Constitution requiring the State Government to consider the representations of the detenus.
 An alternative contention was that the State Government might be obliged to consider the representation of a detenu only in a case where the detention was for a period of less than three months or in a case contemplated by Article 22 (7).
 
HELD : The orders of detention against the petitioners were illegal and ultra vires.
 It is necessarily implicit in the language of Art. 22 (5) that the State Government to whom the representation is made should properly consider the representation as expeditiously as possible. The constitution of an Advisory Board under Section 8 of the Act does not relieve the State Government from the legal obligation to consider the representation of the detenus soon as it is received by it, and to take appropriate action thereon including revocation of the order which it was empowered to do under section 13 of the Act.
 [486 H] It is manifest that the right under Art. 22 (5) to make a representation has been guaranteed independent of the duration of the period of detention and irrespective of the existence or non-existence of an Advisory Board. The constitution of an Advisory Board for the purpose of report- ing whether a person should or should not be detained for a period of more than three months is a very different thing from a right of consideration by the State Government whether a person should be detained even for a single day.
 Even if a reference has to be made to the Advisory Board under section 9 of the Act, the appropriate, Government is, under a legal obligation, to consider the representation of the datenu before such a reference is made.. [488 D] 480 All the procedural requirements of Article 22 are mandatory in character and even if one of the procedural requirements is not complied with, the order of detention would be rendered illegal.
