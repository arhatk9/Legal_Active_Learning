 The appellant is the owner of No. 5 Parliament Street, New Delhi. The building was not entered in the assessment list to be operative during April 1, 1958 to March 31, 1959, although it was occupied after completion on July 1, 1968.
 Under S. 67 of the Punjab Municipal Act, 1911, the NDMC by a resolution dated November 20, 1959 amended the assessment list which was operative for the period April 1, 1959, to March 31, 1960 and imposed house tax on the building for the year 1959-60.
 Section 67 of the Act provides that the Committee may at any time amend the list after giving notice to any person affected by the amendment and Sub. s. (2) provides that any interested person may tender his objection and he shall be given an opportunity of being heard etc.
 The only question that arose for decision before this Court was whether the Respondent was entitled to include the building in the assessment list, which was operative for the period April 1, 1959 to March 31, 1960.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) The assessment list for the year commencing from April 1, 1959, had to be settled by March 31, 1959, at the latest. This list was liable to be amended under S. 67 even after March 31, 1959, on any of the grounds mentioned in that Section. Sec. 66 does not say that the amendment of the assessment list should have been made before March 31, 1959. The expression "subject to such amendment as may thereafter be duly made" in Sec. 66 would indicate that the amendment of the list could be made even after March 31, 1959 as Sec. 67 provides for amendment of the list "at any time." [193BC] It is not necessary that the assessment list should have been amended before March 31, 1959, in order that the Municipal Committee may impose house tax on the building for the period from April 1, 1959 to March 31, 1960. An amendment of the list under S. 67 was permissible on any of the grounds mentioned in the Section even after March 31, 1959, as otherwise, the expression "at any time" would have no meaning. [193EF] (ii) Further, the meaning of the expression "at any time" will depend upon the context in which the expression occurs.
 The expression "at any time" occurring in S. 67 read with the word "thereafter" in S. 66 can only lead to the conclusion that the amendment of the list in question was permissible even after March 31, 1959.
