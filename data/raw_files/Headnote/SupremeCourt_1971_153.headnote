 The Waqf of the Durgah at Fatehpuri is one of the Waqfs to which the provisions of the Uttar Pradesh Muslim Waqfs Act, 1960 applied. When vacancies arose on the committee of Management constituted under the Religious Endowment Act, 1861 (Act 20 of 1863) and these were not filled by election in terms of s. 10 of this Act, the appellant Board, constituted under the 1960 Act, filled in the vacancies acting under the provisions of the Act. Thereupon respondent no. 1 filed an application in the court of the District Judge under Act 20 of 1863 to appoint persons to fill in the vacancies. The District Judge held that he had the power to reconstitute the managing committee under s. 10 of Act 20 of 1863 and directed that the vacancies be filled in according to the rules. The High Court in revision came to the conclusion that there was no provision in the 1960 Act corresponding to s. 13 of Act 20 of 1863 which cast an additional responsibility on the committee to keep in its custody accounts and consequently held that the Committee constituted under Act 20 of 1863 could still continue to discharge some of the functions assigned to it, and the District Judge was thus competent to entertain an application under s. 10 there of.
 
HELD: The District Judge had no jurisdiction or power to fill in, vacancies on the Committee constituted under the provisions of Act 20, of 1863.
 Sections 49 and 50 of the 1960 Act leave no room for doubt that accounts, which would include books of account, and all relevant records,.deeds and documents have to be in Mutawalli's custody and he is bound to produce them for inspection by the Board whenever so desired an& Mutawalli according to the definition includes a committee of management The Act is self contained and makes provision for complete superintendence,.administration and control of the Waqfs over which the boards established under s. 10 of the 1960 Act, have jurisdiction.
 Therefore, there cannot be an independent existence of a committee constituted under Act 20 of 1863 only for the purpose of having custody of books of account particularly when the 1960 Act fully contemplates and provides for the maintenance, custody etc. of accounts and account books by the mutawalli. There is a clear inconsistency between its provisions and those of Act 20 of 1860 relating to committees, their functioning and control. [814F-H]
