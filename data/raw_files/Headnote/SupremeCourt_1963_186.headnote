 The appellant was a civil surgeon in the employment of the State of Punjab having joined the Punjab Civil Medical Service in 1947. In 1956 he was posted to Jullunder where he remained till he proceeded on leave preparatory to retirement sometime in December 1960. His leave was sanctioned on December 18, 1960, and was notified in the Punjab Gazette dated January 27, 1961. On June 3, 1961, the Governor of Punjab passed orders suspending the appellant with immediate effect and revoking his leave as the Government had decided that a departmental enquiry be instituted against him under s. 7 of the Punjab Civil Services (Punishment and Appeal) Rules, 1952. The Governor further passed an order under r. 3.26(d) by which "A government servant under suspension on a charge of misconduct shall not be ............ permitted to retire on his reaching the date of compulsory retirement but should be retained in service until the enquiry into the charge is concluded and a-final order is passed thereon." The order under r. 3.26(d) was that in view of the appellant's reaching the age of superannuation on June 16, 1961, he should be retained in service beyond that date till the completion of the departmental enquiry. These orders reached the appellant, according to him, only on June 19, 1961, but they were published in the Punjab Government Gazette Extraordinary dated June 10, 1961. By a writ petition filed under Art. 226 of the Constitution of India before the High Court of Punjab, the appellant challenged the legality of the orders of suspension, revocation of leave, retention in service after the date of superannuation and institution of the departmental enquiry, on the grounds inter alia, (1) that the rules governing his service did not empower the Governor to pass the impugned orders, and (2) that the impugned orders were passed mala fide by or at the instance 734 of the Chief Minister, who was in-charge of the department of Health and who was personally hostile to him by reason of certain incidents, and that the orders were promoted by the desire on the part of the Chief Minister to wreak personally his vengeance on the appellant.
 
HELD:(i) Under r. 8.15 of the Punjab Civil Services (Punishment and Appeal) Rules there is no restriction on the power of revocation of leave with respect to the time when it is to be exercised, and the authority empowered to grant leave has the discretion to revoke it even after the officer to whom leave had been sanctioned had proceeded on leave, (ii)The date from which a Government servant is on leave preparatory to retirement cannot be treated as the date of his retirement from service, and an order of suspension of the Government servant during such leave is valid.
 (iii)Though the orders of suspension and revocation dated June 3, 1961, were actually communicated to the appellant only after the date of his retirement, since he was on leave the said orders were effective from the moment they were issued.

 (iv)The appellant had no absolute right to opt for retire- ment on his attaining the age of superannuation, that any such option was subject to r. 3.26(d) which applied to him and that his case came under that rule as he was on the date of his compulsory retirement under suspension on charges of misconduct.
 (v)Whenever any charge of misconduct is under enquiry by the Government, be it informally or formally, the Government is competent to suspend the Government servant and, if the requirements ofthe case require, to take action under s. 3.26(d).
 (vi)The provisions of r. 3.26(d) do not contravene Arts. 19 and 23 of the Constitution of India.
 (vii)Rendering of the tape recorded conversation can be legal evidence by way of corroborating the statements of a person who deposes that the other speaker and he carried on that conversation or even of the statement of a person who may depose that he overheard the conversation between the two persons and what they actually stated bad been tape recorded. Weight to be given to such evidence will depend on the other factors which may be established in a particular case.
 Per Das, Subba Rao and Rajagopala Ayyangar, JJ.-(i) Where an authority exercising a power has taken into account as a relevant factor something which it could not properly take info account, the exercise of the power would be bad. Where the purposes sought to be achieved are mixed, some relevant and some alien to the purpose, the difficulty is resolved by finding the 735 dominant purpose which impelled the action, and where the power itself is conditioned by a purpose, the courts would invalidate the exercise of the power when an irrelevant purpose is proved to have entered the mind of the authority.
 (ii)The Court is not an appellate forum where the correct- ness of an order of Government could be canvassed and it has no jurisdiction to substitute its own view as to the necessity or desirability of initiating disciplinary proceedings, for the entirety of the power, jurisdiction in that regard is vested in law inthe Government. The only question which could be consideredby the court is whether the authority vested with the power has paid attention to or taken into account circumstances, eventsor ma tters wholly extraneous to the purpose for which the powerwas veste d, or whether the proceedings have been initiated malafide for satisfying a private or personal grudge of the authority against the officer. If the act is in excess of the power granted or is an abuse or misuse of power, the matter is capable of interference and rectification by the Court.
 (iii)It is not correct to say that mala fides in the sense of improper motive could be established only by direct evidence, that is, that it must be discernible from the order impugned or must be shown from the noting in the file which preceded that order. If bad faith would vitiate the order, the same can be deduced as a reasonable and inescapable inference from proved facts.

 Per Dayal and Mudholkar, JJ. (dissenting). On the facts, the dominant motive which induced the Government to take ac- tion against the appellant was not to take disciplinary proceedings against him for misconduct which it bona fide believed he had committed, but to wreak vengeance on him for incurring his wrath and for the discredit that he had brought on the Chief Minister; the impugned orders were vitiated by mala fides, in that they were motivated by an improper purpose which was outside that for which the power of discretion was conferred on Government ; and the said orders revoking the leave granted and placing the appellant under suspension and directing an enquiry into the charges against him, should be set aside.
 Quaere, whether the provision in Art. 310(1) of the Consti- tution of India that "members of a Civil Service of a State hold office during the pleasure of the Governor", conferred a power on the State Government to compel an officer to continue in service of the State against his will apart from service Rules which might govern the matter even after the age of superannuation was reached.
