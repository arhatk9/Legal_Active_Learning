 The petitioner was a resident of Mizo District. He was arrested by the Armed Forces under s. 4(c) of the Armed Forces (Assam & Manipur) Special Powers Act, 1958. He was handed over to the Civil Authorities on March 2, 1968, i.e., about two months after his arrest. Thereafter two criminal cases covering a wide range of offences under the Assam Maintenance of Public Order Act, the Arms Act and several sections of the Indian Penal Code were started against him.
 He was remanded to Judicial custody from time to time the period of remand being on each occasion more than 15 days.
 He filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the High Court and on its dismissal hr. filed a writ petition in this Court under Art. 32 of the Constitution. The questions that fell for consideration were : (i) whether his detention was illegal on the ground that the armed forces had not handed him over to the civil authorities with the 'least possible delay' as required by s. 5 of the 1958 Act; (ii) whether the detention of the petitioner could be held to be illegal because (a) the remand orders were for more than 15 days and (b) there was a break in the remand orders while the petition under Art. 32 was pending in this Court.
 
HELD : (i) Under s. 5 of the Armed Forces (Assam & Manipur) Special Powers Act the person arrested has to be made over to the officer in charge of the nearest police station with the least possible delay, together with the circumstances occasioning the arrest. What is the least possible delay in a case depends upon the facts, that is to say, how, where and in what circumstances the arrest was affected. In the present case the petitioner was, according to the affidavit filed on behalf of the State Government, connected with the Mizo hostiles who were waging war against India., It was, therefore, necessary to question him about his associates, his stores of arms, and like matters. The difficulty of the terrain, the presence of hostile elements in the area must be considered in this connection. Although the Armed Forces surrendered the petitioner to the Civil authorities after some delay, which was not intended by the law, there was not too much delay. [506 A-D] (ii) The Criminal Procedure Code is not applicable by reason of the sixth Schedule to the Constitution, in the area in question. only the spirit of the Criminal Procedure Code applies. Therefore strict compliance with the provisions of Art. 344 could not be insisted on. [506 E-F] State of Nagaland v. Rattan Singh,[1966] 3 S.C.R. 830, referred to.
 50 4 The period of remand in the present case was each time more than 15 days but not so unconscionably long as to violate the spirit of the Code. There was a gap when the petitioner was in the custody of this court but no request was made for his release then. He was remanded to the custody of the Magistrate by this Court and thereafter his detention could not be held to be illegal. [406 G]
