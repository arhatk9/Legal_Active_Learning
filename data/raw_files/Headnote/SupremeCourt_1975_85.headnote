 One Roshan Lal and two others filed a suit in the Court of Munsif Havali, Lucknow against Balmukund and another for dissolution of partnership, rendition of accounts and recovery. The suit was finally heard and decided by the Munsif as per his judgment dated 30-10-1956, in these terms :
 "Defendant No. I Lala Balmukand shall pay a total sum of Rs. 15,927/2/- to the plaintiffs in which they have equal shares. Plaintiffs shall also get their costs from defendant No.
 
 1. Let a final decree be PM pared accordingly provided necessary court-fee is paid by the plaintiffs within one month." The plaintiffs did not pay the court-fee within the time originally fixed in the judgment. They asked for extension of time which was granted without notice to the other side.
 The plaintiffs then deposited the necessary court-fee within this extended time, on 18-1-1957. About 12 days thereafter, on 30-1-1957, the final decree was drawn up and signed.
 The appellant (defendant No. 1) made an application for obtaining a copy of the judgment on 14-11-1956. The copy was prepared and delivered to the appellant on 16-11-1956.
 On 26-11-1956 i.e. about two months before the decree was actually drawn up and signed, the appellant made an application for a copy of the decree. The copy was prepared and delivered to counsel for the appellant on 1-2-1957.
 information about the supply of this copy was received by the appellant at Delhi on 3-2-1957.
 Against the judgment and decree of the Munsif, the defendant filed an appeal on 12-2-1957 before the Additional Civil Judge, Lucknow. Along with the Memorandum of Appeal, he submitted an application under a. 5 of the Limitation Act, for condonation of delay in respect of the period from 6-2- 1957. By his judgment dated 14-2-1957, the Judge dismissed the. appeal as time barred. The second appeal preferred by the defendant was also- dismissed by the High Court. This appeal is based on the special leave granted by this Court.
 On behalf of the appellant it was contended that the Additional Civil Judge had exercised his discretion under 8.
 5 of the Limitation Act in a grossly unjust and unreasonable manner in not condoning the delay. It was also contended that the entire period between the date of the judgment and the signing of the decree, in the circumstances of this case, was the "time requisite" for obtaining a copy of the decree and should have been excluded, as such under s. 12(2) of the Limitation Act, 1908.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) In the courts below, the appellant did not take up the plea that the delay was due to wrong advice of the Counsel or that the appellant 45 was labouring under any mistake or misapprehension of law.
 The case then set up by him was that being a patient of heart disease, he remained confined, under medical advice, to bed. He was fit enough to travel on the 10th February, but for want of funds he could not reach Lucknow from Delhi on the 11th February. He produced a post-dated medical certificate, but did not examine the Doctor concerned. The appellant had an adult son who used to look after the case.
 In these circumstances, it could not be said that the first appellate court exercised its discretionary power perversely or illegally so as to warrant interference by the High Court in second appeal [47D-E] (ii)limitation Act deprives or restricts the right of an aggrieved person to have recourse to legal remedy, and where its language is ambiguous, that construction should be preferred which preserves such remedy to the one which bars or defeats it. A Court ought to avoid an interpretation upon a statute of Limitation by implication or inference as may have a penalising effect unless it is driven to do so by the irresistible force of the language employed by the legislature.[50A] (iii) The expression '%me requisite' in the phrase, "time requisite for obtaininga copy of the decree", occurring in s. 12 (2A) of the Act means all the time counted from the date of the pronouncement of the judgment (the same being under Order 20, Rule 7, C.P.C., the date of the decree) which would be properly required for getting a copy of the decree including the time which must ex-necessitas elapse in the circumstances of the particular case, before a decree is drawn up and signed. If any period of the delay in preparing the decree was attributable to the default or negligence of the appellant, the latter shall not be entitled to the exclusion of such period under s. 12(2) of the Limitation Act, 1908. [50G-H] (iv)Under the judgment or any rules of the court the appellant was not required to take any step towards the preparation of the decree. No period of the delay in drawing up the decree was attributable to the fault of the appellant. The delay was mainly due to the delayed deposit of the court-fee by the plaintiffs and partly due to the laxity of the office of the court. Although the appellant prematurely filed an application for getting a copy of the nonexistent decree on 26-11-1956, he could legitimately defer that action till the condition precedent on which the drawing up of the decree was dependent, was performed by the plaintiffs. It would not have been extravagant for the appellant to wait till the court-fee was deposited by the plaintiffs, for, in the event of non-deposit of the court- fee, there was a reasonable possibility of their suit being, dismissed, or at any rate, of the decree against which the defendant felt aggrieved and eventually appealed, not being passed. Under the circumstances, the appellant was entitled to the exclusion of the entire time between the date of the pronouncement of the judgment and the date of signing of the decree, as the 'time requisite for obtaining a copy of the decree. After such exclusion--avoiding double counting-his appeal filed in the court of the Additional Civil Judge on 12-2-1957, was fully within time. [51B-E]
