 Section 13(1)(e) of the Karnataka Excise Act, 1965 prescribes that no person shall bottle liquor for sale except under the authority and subject to the terms and conditions of a licence. Rule 3(2) of the Karnataka Excise (Bottling of Liquor) Rules, 1967, as it stood at the relevant time, provided that no person shall be granted a licence to bottle liquor, unless he was a lessee of the right of retail vend of arrack, or he held a licence for the distillation or manufacture of liquor, or trade and import licence or a licence for compounding, blending or reducing of liquors or any other licence which required possession of bottling licence. Rule 4 provided that a lessee of the right of retail vend of liquor or a person holding any of the licences specified in rule 3 and desirous of obtaining a licence to bottle liquor may make an application for licence.
 Pursuant to the decision of the State Government to supply liquor in sealed bottles, the Excise Commissioner by a 410 Gazette Notification dated April 11, 1984 invited applications from intending persons/firms for bottling arrack, though according to the rules it was to be confined to persons already connected with the liquor trade.
 Out of the one hundred thirty one applications received the Excise Commissioner rejected twenty eight on the ground that the applicants were distillers, ninety on the ground that they were connected with the liquor trade and five on the ground that there was no proof that they had a base i-n Karnataka. me remaining eight applications were recommended for the award of the bottling contracts.
 The Secretary to the Government being dissatisfied with the manner of selection, made adverse observations in his note to the Excise Minister. But all the same, the Minister accepted the recommendation of the Commissioner in consultation with the Chief Minister. The Deputy Secretary to tile Finance Department in his note to the Home Department also observed that it was not clear from the file as to how the Excise Commissioner had selected the contractors. The Government, however, by its order dated September 27, 1984 allotted the bottling contracts to the persons recommended by the Excise Commissioner.
 Aggrieved by the said order some of the unsuccessful applicants filed writ petitions in the High Court alleging arbitrariness in selecting contractors. The Government at this stage on November 23, 1984 issued a notification, containing a draft amendment of r. 3(2) by addition of the words "or to persons entrusted with the bottling of arrack by the Government" after the words "reducing of liquors", and inviting objections, if any, by the public before November 28, 1984 barely five days' time. This amended rule making persons unconnected with the liquor trade eligible for grant of licences, was published on November 30, 1984.
 Later, r.4 was also amended to bring it in line with the amended rule 3. More writ petitions were thereafter filed, including some by public spirited citizens, one of them alleging malafides on the part of the Chief Minister whose son-in-law was stated to be interested in some of the firms to whom the contracts had been awarded.
 MANOHAR 411 The petitions were contested by the State Government contending in their counter affidavit that it was thought desirable to award the bottling contracts to persons unconnected with the manufacture or sale of arrack as that would prevent the possibility of its adulteration and short measurement, and evasion of excise duty. B The High Court while allowing the two writ petitions, struck down the impugned order as being unlawful, arbitrary, capricious, in flagrant violation of law, and as shocking to judicial conscience. It held that the allegation of personal bias against the Chief Minister was false, without however, recording any finding on the question of malafides. C In appeals by special leave filed by some of the aggrieved contractors, it was contended that the bottling scheme introduced by the Government in 1984 was entirely outside the Karnataka Excise (Bottling of Liquor) Rules, and that r.3 had no application to the persons seeking or obtaining bottling contracts under the scheme, and that the Rules, as they stood before October 1984, were applicable only to those who were engaged in the manufacture and sale of liquor and who desired to bottle such liquor for sale, not to those who were merely engaged in the business of bottling liquor, having nothing whatever to do with the manufacture or sale of liquor. It was also averred that the persons who merely bottled liquor at the instance of the Government were no more than the agents of the Government appointed for the purpose of doing a job work, and since it would not be necessary for the Government to obtain bottling licences, it would be equally unnecessary for the agents of the Government to obtain bottling licences. It was further argued that the public interest litigation ceased to be in public interest as soon as the relator wilfully indulged in false allegations and that should be a sufficient ground not to warrant the exercise of the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court under Art.226 of the Constitution. G Dismissing the appeals, the Court, ^ 
 HELD: 1.(i) Bottling of liquor meant for sale by whosoever in Karnataka was regulated by the Bottling of Liquor 412 Rules, and r.3 thereof, as it stood at the relevant time, was attracted to persons seeking or obtaining bottling contracts under the scheme introduced by the State Government in 1984. [428 C; 426 G; 427 A-D] (ii) me action of the Excise Commissioner in excluding from consideration for the award of the bottling contracts those persons who were eligible under the rules and recommending such persons as were not eligible was an unusual, wilful and perverse way of exercising the power of distributing State largesse. [420 F] 2.(i) It was only subsequent to the award of the bottling contracts that the Government thought it prudent to amend r.3 of the Bottling of Liquor Rules. The almost surreptitious manner in which it was sought to be achieved indicates anxiety on the part of the Government to favour the chosen ones with the bottling contracts. [422 F-G; 425 E] (ii) Governments and the governed are equally bound by the laws. If any prior policy decision had been taken by the Government of Karnataka to award the bottling contracts to strangers to the liquor trade and not to persons connected with the trade, nothing would have been simpler than to make necessary amendments to the rules before giving effect to the policy and restrict the advertisement inviting applications to applicants who were unconnected with the liquor trade. But apart from the statement in the counter, no such decision was brought to Court's notice. m e so- called policy decision, if any, was only an after-thought tailored to meet the situation and clearly in the teeth of the Bottling of Liquor Rules, which contemplated the grant of bottling licences to persons connected with the trade and not to strangers to the trade. [422 C-G] 3.(i) By virtue of the prohibition contained in s.l3(1)(e) of the Excise Act no person could engage himself in the business of bottling liquor without obtaining a licence under the Rules. [427 F] (ii) Bottling liquor for sale may be for selling the liquor by the bottler himself or by someone else for whom the bottling has been done by the bottler. me expression "bottle liquor for sale" occurring in s.l3(1)(e) when read with the definition of the words "to bottle" in s.2(2) of the Act makes 413 it amply evident of that all that was necessary was that the liquor bottled must be meant for sale. m ere was, therefore, no warrant to say that only a bottler who himself sells the liquor bottled by him was subject to and governed by s.l3(1)(e) and the Rules and not a bottler who merely bottles liquor for others. [427 H, 427 F, 428 A, 427 G] In the instant case, the recommendation of the Excise Commissioner to award the bottling contracts to eight chosen persons was not wholly consistent with the very principle on which he had excluded as many as 118 out of 131 applications from consideration. One of the successful applicants (Sr.No.73) was already an excise contractor and, therefore, was ineligible from being considered in terms of criteria enunciated by him. It was strange that while ten applications by the same person were rejected on the ground that he was connected with the liquor trade, the 11th application by that very person should have been granted without a word to indicate the sudden departure from the principle or the reason for the departure. [421 B-D] 
 4. me persons who have been awarded bottling contracts cannot be said to be mere agents of the Government and thus not required in law to take out licences under the Rules.
 may are not instrumentalities of the Government but are independent contractors who deal with the Government at arm's length. may are as much agents of the Government as contractors of the Public Works Department who build roads and bridges or, for that matter, the arrack vendors in whose favour the Government parts with its exclusive privilege of selling liquor. [428 C-D] 
 5. The Court should refuse to act at the instance of the pseudo-public spirited citizens who indulge in wild and reckless allegations besmirching the character of others.
 All the same, it cannot close its eyes and persuade itself to uphold publicly mischievous executive actions which have been exposed. When arbitrariness and perversion are writ large and brought out clearly, the Court cannot shirk its duty and refuse its writ. Advancement of the public interest and avoidance of the public mischief are the paramount considerations. me Court is always concerned with the I balancing of interests. [426 A-C] 414
