 The appellants were convicted and sentenced for the offence of kidnapping. They filed an appeal which was admitted by the High Court and notice was ordered to be issued. On the date an which the appeal was posted for hearing neither the appellants nor their counsel appeared and the High Court dismissed the appeal in the following terms: 'On perusal of the Judgment under appeal I find no merits in the case. It is accordingly dismissed.' On the question whether the disposal of the appeal by the High Court is in conformity with s. 423, Cr. P. C., 
HELD:If a criminal appeal by the accused is not dismissed summarily under s. 421 of the Code and notice as required by s. 422 is issued, then; under s. 423, it is obligatory for the appellate court to send for the record if it is not already before the Court. After the records are before the court and the appeal is set down for hearing, it is essential that the appellate court should: (a) peruse such record; (b) hear the appellant or his pleader appears;
 and (c) hear the public prosecutor if he appears. After complying withthese requirements, the appellate court has full power to pass any of the orders mentioned in the section. If the appellant and his counsel are not present the appellate court cannot dismiss the appeal enable them to appear or it should consider the appeal on merits and pass final orders. The consideration of the appeal on merits at the stage ,of final hearing and deciding the appeal on merits and passing final orders will not be possible unless the reasoning and findings recorded in the judgment under appeal are tested in the light of the record of the case.
 While there is no emphasis on the perusal of the record in s. 421 at the admission stage, under s. 423, one of the essential requirements and a condition precedent to a final disposal of the appeal either by dismissing it or in any other manner contemplated by the section, is that the appellate court should peruse the record. The requirement regarding the perusal of the record that has been sent for and received in court before disposing of an .appeal is not an empty formality. On the contrary, the expression after perusing the record' in the section assumes importance in the context of the enormous powers that the appellate court has in the final disposal of the criminal appeal. Record of the case does not mean only the judgment, because, that must have already been perused under s. 421 when the High Court admits the appeal [14OA-B, C, E, G-14; 141A-D, H;
 142BC, D-E, F-H; 143A-B] In the present case, there is no indication in the order that it was passed after perusing the record that must have been sent for as required by s, 423(1). From the mere recital in the High Court's order that there is no merit in the case it is not possible to infer that the High Court has come to the conclusion after applying its judicial mind and after perusing 134 the record. There must be a clear judication in the judgment or order of' the appellate court that it has applied its judicial mind to the particular appeal it was dealing with. Such an indication will be available when the appellate court has considered the material on record which means, not only the judgment and petition of the, appeal, but also other relevant materials. Since the impugned order of the High Court was passed without considering the material on record the order was not in conformity with s.
 423 of the Code and had to be to set aside. [143C-D, E-G, H 144A-C] Sankatha Singh v. State of U.P. [1962] Supp. 2 S.C.R. 817,
