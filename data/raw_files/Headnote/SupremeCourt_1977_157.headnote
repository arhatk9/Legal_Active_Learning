 Section 19(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 provides that a settlement shall be binding on the parties for such period as is agreed upon by them and shall continue to be binding after the expiry of the period until the expiry of two months from the date on which a notice in writing of an intention to terminate the settlement is given by one of tile parties to the other party or parties to the settlement.
 The appellant-employers and the respondent-workers agreed that the settlement reached by them in 1970 should be in force for three years till 5th July, 1973. On May 6, 1973 the workers gave notice terminating the settlement after the expiry of two months from the dated of notice.Demands raised by the workmen on August 1, 1973 were referred to an Industrial Tribunal. The employers' preliminary objection that the reference was incompetent since there was no legal and valid termination of the settlement under s. 19(2) was rejected by the Tribunal.
 Dismissing the employers' appeal to this Court 
HELD : There is no legal bar to give advance intimation about the intention to terminate the settlement on the expiry of the agreed period and to start negotiation for a more favorable settlement immediately thereafter. The only condition to be fulfilled by such a notice is that the period of two months from the date of notice must end on the expiry of the settlement and not before it. [255H] (1)The policy of the Act is to ban agitations over the matters covered by a settlement or by an award during the period specified under s. 19(2) and s. 19(6) respectively.
 To avoid uncertainty and speculation s. 19 prescribes a terminus a quo and a terminus ad quem. If in a settlement there is no time limit agreed upon between the parties the period of operation is a space of six months from the date of signing of the settlement and will last until the expiry of two months from the date of receipt of the notice of termination of the settlement. If the period is fixed it commences from the date as specified in the settlement and will theoretically end as agreed upon, but shall continue to operate under the law until the expiry of the requisite period of two months by a clear written notice. [253C-D] (2) In an industrial matter this Court is not prepared to subject a notice under s. 19(2) to the irksome vagaries or tyranny of technicalities of a notice under s. 106 of the Transfer of Property Act. [256B] (3)Notice under s. 19(2) or under s. 19(6) is only for intimation of an intention to terminate a settlement or an award respectively. There is no legal impediment to give advance intimation of the aforesaid intention provided the contractual or statutory period of settlement is not thereby affected or curtailed.

 5-768SCI/77 250 (4)Section 19(2) does not entitle a party to a settlement to repudiate the settlement while the same is in operation.
 Giving advance notice within the ambit of the law is not repudiation of the settlement. [255A] (5)The appellant's argument that since there is a power in the Government to extend the period of an award a notice of termination prior to the date of expiry of the award cannot be contemplated under the law and since this is the position regarding an award, a settlement cannot be treated differently, has no force. Even if an advance notice is given in the case of an award, provided the period of two months expires on the usual expiry of the award permitted by law and Government in exercise of its power extends the award in a given case, such a notice would be in fructuous and inoperative under the law. The extension of the award by the Government in exercise of a statutory power would prevail upon the action of the party to terminate the award by notice. It is only if a notice under s. 19(2) or 19(6) expires within the period of operation of the award or settlement, such a notice will be invalid under the law. In that event the settlement or the award will continue to be in operation and any reference by Government of a dispute during the period of settlement or an award without the same being terminated under the law will be invalid.
