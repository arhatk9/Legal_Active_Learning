 The French settlement of Chandernagore was merged in the State of West Bengal with effect from October 2, 1954 by virtue of the Chandernagore (Merger) Act, 1954. It was made part of Hoogly District. By s. 17 of the Merger Act the laws relating to Lists I and III-of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, in force in West Bengal 'generally' were extended to the merged territory. By s. 18 the corresponding laws of French Chandernagore were repealed.
 The Chandernagore (Assimilation of Laws) Act, 1955 by s. 3 thereof extended the laws relating to List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution in force in West Bengal to the merged territory. By S. 4 the corresponding laws in force before merger were repealed. The Collector of Hoogly in exercise of Powers conferred on him by notification dated May 11, 1948 made two orders under s. 3(1) of the Acquisition Act. The appellants challenged them in a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution. The petition being dismissed appeal was filed in this Court. It was contended : (i) that the orders of requisitions were illegal as the Acquisition Act under which they were issued did not apply to the territory previously known as French Chandemagore; (ii) that under the notification dated May 11, 1948 the Collector could exercise the powers of requisition only in respect of lands within the local limits of the territories the forming part of the Hooghly District.
 
HELD : (i) The first contention had no force. Section 3 of the Chandernagore (Merger) Act, 1954 made Chandernagore part of the State of West Bengal and s. 17 extended the Acquisition Act to it. The Acquisition Act was a law within the meaning of 'law' contained in s. 2(c) of the Chandernagore (Assimilation of Laws) Act because it related to a matter enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution which refers to acquisition and requisitioning of property. In so far as the Acquisition Act related to entry 42 of List III which deals with compen- sation, it was applied by s. 3 of the Chandernagore (Assimilation of Laws) Act, 1955, and s. 17 of the Chandernagore (Merger) Act, 1954, read with the definition of the word 'laws, in s. 2(d) of the latter- Act. [799 F800 A] The argument that the Acquisition Act was not in force in West Bengal generally' because it was extended for short periods from time to time could not be accepted. The word 'generally' refers to the territory of West Bengal and not to the duration of time during which it had to operate. [800 B-C] The contention that because there was no corresponding law within the meaning of s. 17 of the Merger Act and s. 4 of the Assimilation Act, s. 3 Of the latter Act did not have the effect of extending the' Acquisition Act to Chandemagore must also be rejected. Section 4 has a limited effect 796 and that is that if there as a corresponding law then that law shall, as from that date, stand repealed in Chandernagore. If there is no corresponding law then s. 4 does not operate and it has no effect on the scope of s. 3.
 [800 D] The fact that there was no law of requisitioning of property in French territory could not mean that the citizen enjoyed the privilege of immunity 'from such a law. If by virtue of s. 3 of the Assimilation of Laws Act an Act becomes applicable to Chandernagore all privileges and immunities in conflict with the Act would cease to exist. [800 E-F] (ii)The High Court was right in holding that the Collector of Hoogly had the authority to issue the orders in question.
 If the order of requisition is by a Collector then the notification of 1948 applies and the Collector of Hoogly would be authorised to issue orders requisitioning land existing in Chandernagore because Chandernagore had come within the limits of his jurisdiction. The notification must be construed to refer to the limits of the District as it exists on the date of the exercise of the powers conferred by the notification. If the orders of requisition were issued by the Additional District Magistrate, then he had authority by virtue of notification dated September 15, 1959, by which he was empowered to perform the functions of a Collector. The said notification amounted to 'special' appointment of the said officer within the meaning of the definition of 'Collector' in the Acquisition Act as it stood in 1059. "[800 G-801 B]
