 The appellant, a firm of ghee merchants, through its partner as A2 was charged with having sold ghee to Al (the vendor of ghee). A sample of that ghee purchased by the Food Inspector was found (on analysis) to be adulterated. The two accused were prosecuted jointly under ss. 7 and 16 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954.
 At the trial, the vendor prayed for the discharge or acquittal of the warrantor so that he might examine the warrantor as his defence witness to prove his own purchase of the article under a warranty. The trying magistrate acquitted the partner of the appellant. The vendor was also acquitted on the ground that he was protected by a warranty covered by s. 19(2) of the Act.
 On appeal, the High Court, while maintaining acquittal of A- 1, set aside the acquittal of the appellant (A-2). On the question whether the charge should be quashed because two accused were set tip for trial jointly.
 
HELD : The High Court was right in holding that the joint trial of the appellant with the vendor was not illegal.
 [42A] (1)(a) In a suitable case, a vendor, a distributor, and a manufacturer could be tried together provided the allegations made before the Court show that there were connecting links between their activities so as to constitute the same transaction. The connecting links, in a case could be provided by (i) the fact that a sale at an anterior stage could be viewed as the cause of the subsequent sale; (ii) the allegation that each of the accused parted with the article of food when it was in an adulterated state and (iii) the common object of the manufacturer, the distributor and the vendor was that the article should reach the consumer to be used as food. The third and last link is decisive and must tilt the balance in favour of legality of a joint trial of the parties concerned. [41-C-D] (b)A mens rea as a particular state of mind which could be described as guilty or wrongful was not needed, and, therefore, could not provide the connecting link between the co-accused in a trial for such an offence in order to constitute the same transaction. [39D] Sarjoo Prasad v. The State of Uttar Pradesh, [1960] INSC 303; A.I.R. 1961 S.C. 631, referred (c)Where a joinder of several accused persons concerned dealing in different ways with the same adulterated article of food at different stages is likely to jeopardise a fair trial, a separate trial ought to be ordered. It is not proper to acquire or discharge an accused person on this ground alone. The order of separate trial in a case where prejudice to an accused from a joint trial is apprehended is enough. A joint trial of such accused persons is not ab initio illegal. [40A] V.N. Kamdar & Anr. v. Municipal Corporation of Delhi [19741 IS.C.R. 157 @-161 and Kadiri Kunhammad v. The State of Madras. A.I.R. 1960, S.C. 661 @663, followed.
 31 (2)Neither S. 7 nor S. 14 of the Act bars trial of several offences by the same accused person, be he a manufacturer, a distributor or a last seller referred to as "the vendor" in S. 14 of the Act. The definition of "sale" in sub-s. (xiii) of the Act, is wide enough to include every kind of seller.
 Every seller can be prosecuted for an offence created by s.
 7 of the Act. The mere fact that, for purposes of S. 14, the person who could be thelast seller is described as "the vendor", could not affect a liability for an offence under s. 7 of the Act by a sale of an article of food which is found to be adulterated. A sale of an article of food by a " manufacturer, distributor or dealer" is a distinct and separable offence. Section 14 was not meant to carve out an exemption in favour of a distributor or a manufacturer who sells articles of food, found to be adulterated, irrespective of the question whether any warranty was given for them. [36C-F] The spacial provisions contained in Ss.19(2) and 20A do not take away or derogate from the effect of the ordinary provisions of the law which enable separate as well as joint trials of accused persons in accordance with the provisions of the old Ss. 233 to 239, Cr. P. C. On the other hand, there is no logically sound reason why, if a distributor or a manufacturer can be subsequently impleaded under s. 20A of the Act, he cannot be joined as a co-accused initially in a joint trial if the allegations made justify such a course.[37B] (b)The special provisions of S. 20A are only enabling and do not give rise toa mandatory duty. They do not bar either a separate or a joint trial of an accused person if other conditions are satisfied. Similarly S. 239(d), Cr.
 P.C. is only an enabling section. [41-B] In the instant case although the charge stated that the ghee sold by the vendor was found to be adulterated, it is not stated that it was in that very state when the appellant sold it to the vendor. It is left to be inferred from the charge that the appellant also sold the ghee in an adulterated state. It is true that defects in the charge would not invalidate a trial. Even so, continuation of such an old prosecution is likely to handicap the appellant in his defence. Assuming that the charge implied an allegation that ghee was adulterated when the appellant sold it to the vendor an enquiry in 1975 into the actual state of the ghee sold by the' distributor in 1967 would be obviously difficult. It would impose undue hardship on the distributor to prove at this distance of time, the actual state of the small quantity of ghee analysed. [41G-H] Alagiriswami, J. (concurring in the final result) The High Court was not correct in saying that the action of both the accused formed part of the same transaction and there was unity of purpose of the manufacturer, the distributor and the vendor furnished by the purpose of all of them to sell, and, therefore. it was the same transaction and ill of them could be tried together. [43E] (1)If the common purpose of all of them was to sell ghee, joint trial of all of them would not be valid; but, if it was to sell adulterated ghee it would be valid. If it is alleged that at every one of the stages ghee was adulterated then it would be the same transaction and they could all be jointly tried. In the absence of an allegation that the ghee distributed by the appellant to the vendor was adulterated both of them could not be tried together. [43G] (2)At the stage of considering the validity of the charge, it is the allegation that is material ; at the stage of considering the guilt of the parties, it is proof that is material. [43H] In the instant case, although the charge states that the ghee purchased from the vendor was found to be adulterated, there was no allegation that the ghee sold by the appellant to the vendor was adulterated. While the common object was to sell the article of food sold, it is not said that it was to sell adulterated article of food. [42E] 32 (3)It is now well settled that for establishing an offence under the Act it is not necessary to establish mens rea i.e., criminal intention either on the part of the manufacturer or distributor or vendor. Even knowledge on the part of all of them that the food was adulterated is not necessary. Ignorance on the part of any one of them that the food was adulterated would not absolve them of liability.
