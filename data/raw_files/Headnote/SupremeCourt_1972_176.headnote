 Entry 28 of Schedule C of the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1959, as amended by the Gujarat Act. 1962, pertains to soaps. Entry 21A of Schedule E deals with toilet articles excluding soap as specified in Entry 28 in Schedule C. and Entry 22 of Schedule E is a residuary entry relating to all goods other than those specified from time to time in the Schedules and in the preceding entries.
 On a reference under s. 61 of the Act, the High Court held that Colgate tooth paste and Colgate tooth brush were not toilet articles falling under Entry 21A but were covered by the residuary Entry 22; and that Palmolive Shampoo was soap within the meaning of Entry 28 of Schedule C.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) Colgate tooth paste and brush are toilet articles under Entry 21A, Sch.E.
 (a) in Sarin Chemical Laboratory v., Commissioner of Sales Tax, U.P. (1970) 26 S.T.C. 339 (SC), this Court came to the conclusion that tooth powder was a toilet requisite.
 Moreover, this Court by approving in Sarin Chemical Laboratory Case the decision of the Bombay High Court in Commissioner of Sales Tax v., Vicco Laboratories (1968) 22 S.T.C. 169, approved the view that for the purpose of Bombay, Sales-Tax Act also dental powder is a toilet article. The reasoning given by this Court in respect of tooth powder in Sarin Chemical Laboratory's case holds equally good for tooth paste. [920F; 921D-F] (b) The dictionary meaning of the word 'toilet' as "an act or process of cleansing one's person" shows that a tooth brush, which is meant for cleansing one's teeth, is also a toilet article. If a tooth brush is in fact used for cleansing one's teeth it must be held to be an article of toilet even teeth may also be cleansed without the use of a tooth brush. [920G-H;921F-G] (2) Shampoo is a kind of liquid soap. It has all the ingredients of a soap though the proportion of ingredient differs from those of a soap in the form of a cake. But that fact would not alter the basic character of shampoo and take it out of the category of soaps. The High Court was therefore right in holding that the Shampoo falls under Entry 28, Schedule C.
