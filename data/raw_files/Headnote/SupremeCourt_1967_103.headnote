 The petitioner carried on the business of import, export and the manufacture of automobile parts and in connection with his business it was necessary for him to travel abroad. For this purpose he was holding two valid passports when on August 31, 1966 and on September 24, 1966 the first and the second respondents, being the Assistant Passport Officer at New Delhi and the Regional Passport Officer at Bombay respectively wrote to the petitioner calling upon him to surrender the two passports as the Central Government had decided to withdraw the passport facilities extended to him.
 The petitioner filed the present petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution alleging that the respondent's action infringed his fundamental rights under Art. 21 and 14 of the Constitution and prayed for a writ of mandamus directing the respondents to withdraw and cancel the decision contained in the two letters.
 It was contended, inter alia, on behalf of the petitioner that the right to leave India and travel outside India and return to India is part of personal liberty guaranteed under Art. 21 of the Constitution; refusal to give a passport or withdrawal of one given amounts to deprivation of personal liberty inasmuch as, (a) it is not practically possible for a citizen to leave India or travel abroad or to return to India without a passport, (b) instructions are issued to shipping and air travel companies by the Central Government not to take passengers on board without a passport; (c) under the Indian Passport Act, re-entering India without a passport is penalized. The deprivation of personal liberty in the refusal' or impounding of a passport is not in accordance with any procedure established by law within the meaning of Art. 21, as admittedly there is no law placing any restrictions on 'the citizens of the country to travel abroad. Furthermore, the unfettered discretion given to the respondents to issue or not to issue a passport to a person offends Art. 14 of the Constitution.
 The respondents contested the petition mainly on the grounds that no fundamental right of the petitioner had been infringed, that the petitioner had contravened the conditions of an import licence obtained by him, that investigations were going on against him in relation to offences under the Export and Import Control Act, and that the passport authorities were satisfied that if the petitioner was allowed to continue to have the passports, he was likely to leave India and not return to face a trial before a court of law and that therefore it was necessary to impound his passport. Further it was contended that the passport was a document which was issued to a person at the pleasure of the President in exercise of his political function and was a political document, and the refusal 526 to grant a passport could not be a subject of review in a court of law. ,For the same reason it was contended that the petitioner had no right to have the passports issued to him.
 
HELD : (per Subba Rao, C.J., Shelat and Vaidialingam, JJ.), A writ of mandamus must issue to the respondent to withdraw and cancel the decision contained in their letters dated August 31, 1966 and 'September 20, 1966.
 A person living in India has a fundamental right to travel abroad under Art. 21 of the Constitution and cannot be denied a passport be,cause, factually, a passport is a necessary condition for travel abroad and the Government, by withholding the passport, can effectively deprive him ,of his right. [528 H; 530 G; 540 B] "Liberty" in our Constitution bears the same comprehensive meaning as is given to the expression "liberty" by the 5th and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and the expression "personal liberty" in Art. 21 only excludes the ingredients of liberty enshrined in Art. 19 of the Constitution. In other words, the expression "personal liberty" in Art. 21 takes in the right of locomotion and to travel abroad, but the right to move throughout the territories of India is not covered by it inasmuch .as it is specially provided in Art. 19. [540 C-D] Kharak Singh v. State of U.P. [1964] 1 S.C.R. 332, 347, referred to.
 Under Art. 21 of the Constitution no person can be deprived of his -right to travel except according to procedure established by law and no law had been made by the State regulating or depriving a person of such a right. [542B] Whether the right to travel is part of personal liberty or not within the meaning of Art. 21 of the Constitution, the unchanelled arbitrary discretion with the executive in the matter of issuing or refusing passports ,lo different persons is violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution. [542 E- F; H] Case law discussed.
 Per Hidayatullah and Bachawat JJ., dissenting The citizen's right of motion and locomotion, in so far as it is recognisable, has been limited by Art. 19 of the Constitution to the territories ,of India and according to Kharak Singh's cave, that is the limit of the right. It is not possible to read more of that right in Art. 21. [554 H] Whatever the view of countries like the U.S.A. where travel is a means of spending one's wealth, the better view in our country is that a person is ordinarily entitled to a passport unless, for reasons which can be established to the satisfaction of the Court, the passport can be validly refused to him. Since an aggrieved party can always ask for a mandamus if he is treated unfairly, it is not open by straining the Constitution, to create an absolute and fundamental right to a passport where none exists in the Constitution. There is no doubt a fundamental right to equality in the matter of grant of passports (subject to reasonable classifications) but there is no fundamental right to travel abroad or to, the grant of a passport. The solution of a law of passports will not make things any better. Even if a law were to be made the position would hardly change because utmost discretion will have to be allowed to decide upon the worth of an applicant. The only thing that can be said is that where the passport authority is proved to be wrong, a mandamus will always right the matter. The affidavits filed by the respondents showed that one of the petitioners was a member of a gang of passport racketeers and had got many students stranded in foreign countries by arranging for their travel with a company which did not exist, had countermanded emigration laws of a foreign power and had suppressed the fact that he had once been refused a passport. The other petitioner had obtained an import licence to import goods of the value of Rs. 3 lakhs on condition that he would export finished goods worth Rs. 4 lakhs but had sold away most of the imports in the Indian market; he was also alleged to have defrauded the import control authorities in different ways and investigations into his activities were proceeding.
 It was for these reasons that the respondents took the action complained of and judging of these cases on the evidence of the affidavits, it was possible to hold that the passports were properly refused or impounded. In the present case there was therefore no valid ground for the issuance of a mandamus. [543 E-544 F] The passport is a political document and one which the State may choose to give or to withhold. Since a passport vouches for the respectability of the holder, it stands to reason that the Government need not vouch for a person it does not consider worth. [555 A-B] Case law discussed.
