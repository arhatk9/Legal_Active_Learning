 The respondent was engaged by the appellant as a watchman under a scheme framed by the Police Department. His services were discharged pending an industrial dispute between the appellant and its workmen. The respondent complained to the Industrial Tribunal under s. 33A of the Industrial Disputes Act. The Tribunal accepted the application. The appellant contended that the respondent was not its employee. The scheme provides that private persons requiring the services of watchmen may apply to the District Superintendent of Police who supplies a watchman if one suitable is available under the scheme. The amount towards pay Is recovered in advance each month by the Dis- trict Superintendent,of Police and credited to the watchman's fund. After deducting Rs. 250 towards the uniform supplied, the rest is paid by the police Department to the watch. man. The Department requires the persons to whom the watchman is supplied to give a fortnight's notice if it is desired to dispense with the services of the watchman. The watchmen are mustered at the Police Station and their work supervised by the Police night patrol, They are under the disciplinary control of the District Superintendent of Police.
 Held, that the decision of the question whether a person is the employee of another or not has to depend on the facts and circumstances of each individual case. The test as to who is entitled to tell the employee the way in which he is to do the work on which he is engaged though in a given case satisfactory it would be unreasonable to treat that test as the most satisfactory as a general rule. Having regard to all the relevant facts the respondent cannot be said to be the employee of the appellant and could not claim to be an industrial employee concerned in the pending Industrial Disputes.
