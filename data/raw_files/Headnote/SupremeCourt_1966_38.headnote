 The appellants made affidavits in the High Court denying receipt of money by way of compromise in a first appeal pending before that Court. The High Court ordered the Registrar to hold an enquiry. The Registrar after recording the evidence of the parties reported that the appellants' denial of receipt of money was false. thereafter an application was made to the High Court under s. 476 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which was kept pending and taken up after the appeal was decided. The High Court held that the offence committed by the appellants was one under s. 199 Indian Penal Code and ordered the Registrar to file a complaint. The appellants came to this Court under s. 476B.
 The questions for consideration were; (1) whether the offence committed by the appellants fell under s. 191 and 192 of the Penal Code or under s. 199, and (2) whether proceedings under s. 479-A could be taken against the appellants, for if they could be, then action ought to have been taken under that section and s. 476 could not be invoked.
 
HELD : (i) When the appellants made declarations in their affidavits which were tendered in the High Court to be taken into consideration they intended the statements to appear in evidence, and so appearing, to cause the court to entertain an erroneous opinion regarding the compromise Their offence came within the words of ss. 191/192 rather than g. 199 of the Indian Penal Code. [556 C] (ii) In respect of offenses under ss. 191 and 192 of the Indian Penal Code when committed by a witness action under s. 479-A alone can be taken and action under s. 476 is ruled out because of sub-s. (6) of 9. 479-A. [556 E-G]
