 An election petition was filed by the respondent against the appellant, a returned candidate to the council of the State from the constituency of the Punjab Legislative Assembly, on the ground that the result of the election was materially effected (a) by non-compliance with the provisions of the Representation of the People Act and the rules made thereunder; (b) by improper reception of votes in his favour by tampering with the postal ballot papers and by commission of corrupt practice in the interest of the appellant by its agents and also commission of corrupt practice by obtaining assistance of persons in the service of the Punjab Government. The appellant denied all the allegations and contested the petition. The High Court found that the four ballot papers one each allotted to P.Ws. (the voters) Nos. 13, 14, 15 and 16 were tampered with in that each the voter had cast his first preference vote in favour of unsuccessful Akali candidate Gurcharan Singh Tohra and no second preference vote was indicated and each one of the vote was so altered as to appear that each one of them has cast his first preference vote in favour of the appellant and second preference vote in favour of Gurcharan Singh. The High Court allowed the election petition and declared the unsuccessful Akali candidate Gurcharan Singh Tohra as elected and set aside the election of the appellant.
 Dismissing the appeal, the Court ^ 
 HELD: (1) Section 94 of the Representation of People Act, 1951 cannot be interpreted or examined in isolation.
 Its scope, ambit and underlying object must be ascertained in the context in which it finds its place in the Act, and further in the context of the fact that the Act itself was enacted in exercise of power conferred by Articles in Part XV titled "Election" in the Constitution with a view to achieve the constitutional goal, viz., setting up of democratic sovereign socialist secular republic. For this a free and fair election, a fountain spring and corner stone of democracy, based on universal adult suffrage is the basic. The regulatory procedure for achieving free and fair election for setting up democratic institution in the country is provided in the Act which includes the cross or performance indicated by the dumb-sealed lip voter in the ballot paper. That is his right and the trust reposed by the Constitution in him is that he will act as a responsible citizen choosing his masters for governing the country for the period prescribed by it. Therefore, any interpretation of s. 94 must essentially subserve the purpose for which it is enacted. The interpretative process must advance the basic postulate of free and fair election for setting up democratic institution and not retard it. [1312 G-H, 1313 A- C, E-F] 1303 H. H. Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalavaru v. State of Kerala, [1973] Suppl. S.C.R. 1; Mohinder Singh Gill v. The Chief Election Commissioner, New Delhi & Ors., [1978] 2 S.C.R. 272, referred to.
 (2). It is legitimate and indeed proper to have recourse to heading and sub-heading given to a group of sections in an Act of Parliament to find guidance for the construction of the words in a statute. One of the canons of construction is that every section of a statute is to be construed with reference to the context and other sections of the Act, so as, as far as possible, to make a consistent enactment of the whole statute. [1316 F-G] Rex v. Board of Trade, Ex-parte St. Martin's Preserving Co. Ltd., [1965] 1 Q.B. 603 at 607 referred to.
 (3). Provisions cast in negative words are generally treated as absolute admitting of no exception. But this is not a universal rule. The words 'negative' and 'affirmative' statutes mean nothing in particular. The question is one of intendment. Emphasis is more easily demonstrated when a statute is negative than when it is affirmative, but the question is one of intendment. If the language is open to two constructions one must ascertain the intendment, the mischief sought to be remedied and the remedy provided to cure the mischief. And, in such a situation the court must escalate in favour of that construction which carries out the intendment behind enactment and accords with reason and fairplay. [1318 E-G] Mayor of London v. Rex, [1848] 3 Q.B. 30; Victoria Sporting Club Ltd. v. Hannam, (1969) 2 W.L.R. 454 referred to.
 (4). The words "shall be required" in s. 94 of the Act, which is cast in negative language indicate an inbuilt element of compulsion. Section 94 carves out an exception to section 132 of the Evidence Act and also section 95 of the Representation of People Act, 1951. In view of the imperative language of s. 132 of the Evidence Act and also from the constitutional guarantee against self-incrimination as enacted in Article 20(3) of the Constitution a witness when questioned in the witness box relevant to the matter in issue in a proceeding in which he is called as a witness has to answer the question put to him and cannot escape the obligation to answer the question even if the answer was likely to incriminate him except to the extent the qualified privilege is extended to him under the proviso to section 132 of Evidence Act. A conspectus of the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act and ss. 93, 94 and 95 of the Representation Act makes it clear that they provide for a procedure, including the procedure for examination of witnesses, their rights and obligations in the trial of an election petition. The expression "other person" extends the protection to a forum outside courts. Section 94, therefore, cannot be singled out as a substantive provision and being unrelated to the procedure prescribed for trial of election petition. [1314 A, B, E, F, 1315 A, F-G, 1316 C-F] Dr. Chhotalal Jivabhai Patel v. Vadilal Lallubhai Mehta and Ors. (1971) 12 Guj. L.R. 850 @ 860 approved.
 (5) Section 94 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 can be construed in two possible ways firstly, that the section casts an absolute prohibition and seals the mouth of the voter permanently and admits of no exception in which he can divulge his vote, and secondly, that it is a privilege of the voter to disclose his vote if he voluntarily chooses to do so 1304 but he cannot be compelled by court or any other authority to divulge his vote. [1318 G-H, 1319 A] If s. 94 is interpreted to mean to be a privilege of the voter to divulge or not to divulge how he voted and if he chooses not to divulge, s. 94 protects him inasmuch as he cannot be compelled to divulge that information, then it does not stand in conflict with the other important principle of free and fair elections to sustain parliamentary democracy. When it is said that no witness or other person shall be required to state for whom he has voted at an election it only means that both in the Court when a person is styled as a witness and outside the Court when he may be questioned about how he voted though he would not have the character or the qualification of a witness yet in either situation he is free to refuse to answer the question without incurring any penalty or forfeiture. That guarantees the vital principles behind secrecy of ballot in that the voter would be able to vote uninhibited by fear.
 But if he chooses to open his lips of his own free will without direct or indirect compulsion and waive the privilege, nothing prevents him from disclosing how he voted as there is no provision in the Act which would expose him to any penalty. If a voter voluntarily chooses to disclose how he voted or for whom he voted s. 128 of the Representation of People Act has nothing to do with the voter disclosing for whom he voted. It casts an obligation of secrecy on those connected with the process of election and not on the voter. [1319 A-D] If the other construction is adopted the mischief thereby perpetrated can be demonstrably established. One can then manipulate the vote cast by a voter and poor voter will be helpless and unable to assist the court by his testimony which is the best direct evidence to establish for whom he voted and what mischief has been played with his vote. [1319 E-F] (6) Free and fair election is not an a priori concept but of cherished constitutional goal oriented value. Secrecy of ballot though undoubtedly a vital principle for ensuring free and fair elections, it was enshrined in law to subserve the larger public interest, namely, purity of election for ensuring free and fair election. The principle of secrecy of ballot cannot stand aloof or in isolation and in confrontation to the foundation of free and fair elections, namely, purity of election. They can co-exist but where one is used to destroy the other, the first one must yield to principle of purity of election in larger public interest.
 In fact secrecy of ballot, a privilege of the voter, is not inviolable and may be waived by him as a responsible citizen of this country to ensure free and fair election and to unravel foul play. [1320 F-H, 1321 A] N. P. Ponnuswami v. Returning Officer, Namakkal Constituency & Others, [1952] INSC 2; [1952] S.C.R. 218 at 230, referred to.
 (7). Ordinarily secrecy of ballot has to be guarded, but where secrecy of the ballot itself is sought to be availed of as a protective sheath against disclosure of fraud, forgery or wrongful conduct, it must yield in the larger public interest to ensure purity of free and fair election. [1322 D-E] Queen v. Beardsall, LR [1875-76] 1 Q.B. 452 quoted with approval.
 (8) Section 94 of the Act enacts a qualified privilege in favour of the voter in that no one can compel him to disclose for whom he voted but the 1305 privilege ends there for if he desires to waive the privilege and volunteers to give information as to for whom he voted, neither s. 94 nor any provision of the Act is violated. No one can prevent him from doing so nor a complaint can be entertained from any one including the person who wants to keep the voters mouth sealed as to why he disclosed for whom he voted. Once the voter chooses to waive the privilege and volunteers to disclose for whom he voted there is no contravention of s. 94 nor any other provision of the Act and there is no illegality involved in it. [1324 B-E] (9) Normally, where a prohibition enacted is founded on public policy Courts should be slow to apply the doctrine of waiver. But, if a privilege was granted for the benefit of an individual, in the instant case for the benefit of voter, even if it was conferred to advance a principle enacted in public interest nonetheless the person for whose benefit the privilege was enacted has a right to waive it because the very concept of privilege inheres a right to waive it. And where a voter waives his privilege not to be compelled to disclose for whom he voted, if he wants to run the gamut of risk of disclosure it does not violate any other principle because it was enacted to help him to vote free from any inhibition or fear or apprehension of being subjected to some calamity.

 (10) A recount of votes cannot be ordered just for the asking. A petition for recount after inspection of some ballot papers must contain an adequate statement of material facts on which the petitioner relies in support of his case.
 The Tribunal must be prima facie satisfied that in order to decide the dispute and to do complete justice between the parties an inspection of the ballot papers is necessary.
 Only on the special facts of a given case sample inspection may be ordered to lend further assurance to the prima facie satisfaction of the Court regarding the truth of the allegations made for a recount and not for the purpose of fishing out materials for declaring an election void.

Narayanan v.
 S. Semmalai & Ors. [1979] INSC 172; [1980] 1 S.C.R. 571 followed.
 (11) In an election appeal under s. 116A of the Act the Supreme Court does not ordinarily interfere with the finding of facts recorded by the High Court particularly when the High Court comes to a conclusion on appreciation of all material evidence placed before it. As a corollary this Court would be slow to interfere with such findings of facts based on appraisal of evidence unless there is something radically wrong with the approach of the learned judge trying the election petition. [1330 C-E] Ramji Lal v. Ram Babu Maheshwari & Anr. AIR 1970 SC 2075; D. Gopala Reddy v. S. Bai Talpalikar & Ors. (1972) 39 Election Law Reports 305 (SC) and Smt. Sumitra Devi v. Sheo Shanker Prasad Yadav & Ors. [1972] INSC 274; [1973] 2. S.C.R. 920, applied.
 1306 (12) A petition for a recount on the allegation of miscount or error in counting is based upon not specific allegation of miscounting but errors which may indicate a miscount and recount becomes necessary. When it is alleged that postal ballot papers were tampered with, the implication in law is that those postal ballot papers have been wrongly received in favour of a candidate not entitled to the same and improperly refused in favour of the candidate entitled to the same and therefore there is a miscount and a recount is necessary. In the very nature of things the allegation can be not on each specific instance of an error of counting or miscount but broad allegations indicating error in counting or miscount necessitating a recount. In the instant case, the discretion used regarding the necessity of inspection of ballot papers is amply justified. Further it is established that the four ballot papers have been tampered with. [1326 C-F, 1333 C] (13) To avail of the procedure prescribed in s. 64A of the Act the conditions prescribed in that section must be satisfied. Section 64A envisages a situation where tampering, damaging, destruction or loss of ballot papers used at a polling station is on such a large scale that the result of the poll at the polling station cannot be ascertained. But s.64A is not attracted in the facts and circumstances of this case. The four ballot papers sent from different jails and received as postal ballot papers are shown to have been tampered with. The votes cast by the ballot papers can be succinctly ascertained and have in fact been ascertained. [1333 G-H, 1334 A] (14) The decision in Jagannath Rao v. Raj Kishore & Ors. AIR [1972] SC 447 does not purport to lay down that as soon as it is shown that some ballot papers have been tampered with, the Court has merely to chart an easy course of rejecting these ballot papers. Such an approach, apart from anything else, would be a premium on unfair election practice. Where voting is by the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote, if a tampering as of the nature indulged into in this case is brought to light, the necessity of rejecting such ballot papers as invalid would give an unfair advantage to the very person who indulged into such practice. When the Returning Officer did not reject the ballot paper as being invalid, under Rule 56(2) of the Election Rules, 1961, once tampering is held proved if the circumstances permit and evidence of unquestionable character is available it would be perfectly legitimate for the Court in an election petition to ascertain for whom the vote was cast before it was tampered with and if it can be ascertained as a valid vote it must be accepted as such. Any other approach has an inbuilt tendency to give an unfair advantage either to the candidate who himself might have indulged in tampering or someone who must have acted for his benefit. [1334 C-G] (15) The expression "improper reception" and "improper refusal" of vote must carry out the purpose underlying the provision contained in s.100 of the R. P. Act. Section 100(1) (d) (iii) comprehends a situation where the result of an election in so far as it concerns a returned candidate has been materially affected by improper reception, or improper refusal of any vote or the reception of any vote which is void. The adjective 'improper' qualifies not only the word 'reception' but also the word 'refusal'. When a vote is received by the returning officer at 1307 the time of counting it implies two things, that it is not only received as a valid vote but that the valid vote is cast in favour of one of the contesting candidates at the election. Similarly, when it is said that there is improper refusal of any vote it implies again two things, namely, a vote which ought to have been accepted as valid vote has been improperly refused as an invalid vote, or there is an improper refusal to accept the vote in favour of a particular candidate. Therefore, an improper reception of any vote or an improper refusal of any vote implies not only reception or refusal of a vote contended to be invalid or valid, as the case may be, but subsequent reception in favour of any contesting candidate at the election which would simultaneously show the vote being refused in counting to any other candidate at the election. The expression 'refusal' implies 'refuse to accept' and the expression 'reception' implies 'refuse to reject'. [1335 D-H] (16) The wide comprehensive panorama of s. 100 of the Representation of People Act, 1951 embraces within its fold, all conceivable infirmities which may be urged for voiding an election. To construe otherwise will have the election petitioners without a remedy. It would mean that even though one can indulge into forgery what is tampering of ballot papers, if not forgery-and get away with it. [1337 D-H] Mohinder Singh Gill v. The Chief Election Commissioner, New Delhi & Ors., [1978] 2 S.C.R. 272 followed.
