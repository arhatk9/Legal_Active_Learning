 The Expenditure Tax Act, 1957 was brought into force with effect from April 1, 1958. The respondents executors under the will of M--were served a notice under s. 13(2)- of the Act requiring them to furnish a return in respect of the expenditure incurred by M between April 1, 1957 and August 1957 the date of his death. The respondents objected that the Act did not apply to M because he had died before the date on which the Act came into force and on that account the respondents as executors of his will were not liable to submit the return demanded. The contention was overruled by the Expenditure-tax Officer whereupon the respondents filed a writ petition in the High Court praying that the proceedings be quashed. The High Court held that the charge under the Act in respect of expenditure incurred in the relevant previous year to the assessment year 1958-59 was not on the estate of any individual or any Hindu undivided family: it was on the individual or the Hindu undivided family incurring the expenditure, and as it was imposed for the first time on April 1, 1958, unless the unit of assessment Was in existence on the date when the Act came into force, no tax could be levied. With certificate granted by the High Court the Revenue came to this Court.
 
 HELD : (i) In terms Subs. (1) of s. 18 imposes liability upon the legal representatives of a person who dies, to pay out of his estate, expenditure-tax assessed as payable by such person, or any sum which would have been payable by him if he had not died. There is nothing in the expression 'where a person dies' or in the context in which it occurs which suggests that it was intended thereby to restrict the operation of the sub-section to cases of persons dying after the Act was brought into force. [622 C-D] (ii) In the context of the declared liability under sub-s. (1) and the provisions of sub-s. (3) of s. 18 which make sections 13, 14 and 15 ,of the Expenditure Tax applicable to the executor, administrator or legal representative, as they apply to any person, it would be difficult to hold that the legislature has not expressed its intention clearly so a.-, to render the estate of a deceased person liable to be assessed to expenditure tax merely because he had died before that date in which this Act was brought into force.

 The judgment of the High Court had therefore to set aside. [625 HI
