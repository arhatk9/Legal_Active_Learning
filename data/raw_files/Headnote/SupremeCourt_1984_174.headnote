 A partition took place between the parties in or about 1927, whereunder survey Nos. 95 and 96 fell to the share of the appellants-plaintiffs and 15 cents of land in plot no.
 96/5 in which the common well W2 is situate and the channel running from that common well were, however, kept joint for the common enjoyment of the parties Water from well W2 situate in plot no. 96/5 was not sufficient to irrigate the lands of both the parties got by them in the said partition.
 The appellants-plaintiffs therefore, were irrigating the land in survey Nos. 96/3, 96/1, 95 and 92 from the well in survey No. 103/2 purchased by their father, in 1928 in the name of their mother under Exh. AI by means of a small channel connecting it to the common channel in the common land in survey No. 96/5. The respondents defendants objected to the use by the appellants of the common land in survey No. 96/5 and the common channel running in survey No. 96/5 for taking water from their exclusive well in survey No.
 103/2. Hence the appellants filed a suit for declaration of their right to take water from the exclusive well through a portion of a channel to their plots at survey Nos. 95 and 96 lying to the north of the common well W2 in the joint land of the parties and for a consequential relief of permanent injunction. Restraining the respondents-defendants from interfering with the enjoyment of the appellants-plaintiffs right to take water from W 1 throughout the aforesaid channel. The trial Court, found that the appellants- plaintiffs being co-owners of the common property were entitled to use the property in the way advantageous to them and the respondents-defendants having not pleaded or proved any damage or loss to the common property cannot obstruct the appellants-plaintiffs from taking water to their lands from their exclusive well through the common channel. On appeal the first Appellate Court substantially concurred with all the findings of the trial Court but to avoid any complaint or prejudice, thought it fit to modify the decree of the trial Court by fixing terms for the appellants- plaintiffs' use of the channel and with this little modification confirmed the decree of the trial Court.
 However, in the second appeal 809 carried by the respondents, the High Court found that the appellants-plaintiffs by taking water from their exclusive well W1 through common channel and common land which was not and could not have been intended by the parties at the time of the partition when they kept their well W2 and the lands situated around it and the common channel for the common enjoyment of the parties and allowed the appeal.
 Hence the appeal by Special Leave of the Court.
 Allowing the appeal, the Court ^ 
 HELD : 1:1 Findings of a Court should always be with respect to specific plea of the parties in the pleadings. In the instant case, in the absence of any specific pleading regarding prejudice or detriment to the respondents- defendants the appellants-plaintiffs have every right to use the common land and the common channel The appellants- plaintiffs were claiming their right on the basis of admitted co-ownership and rights which includes unrestricted user, unlimited in point of dispossession. The right of co- ownership presupposes a bundle of rights which has been lost sight of by the High Court and therefore the High Court was not justified in holding that appellants-plaintiffs' right to take water was acquired by any grant from the respondents-defendants or from any other sale deed. [812H;
 813A-B] 1:2. The only restriction put by law on the common user of the land by a co-owner is that it should not be so used as to prejudicially effect or put the other co-owners to a detriment. [813D] (2) Illustration (c) to s. 8 of the Indian Easements Act applies where a co-owner seeks to impose an easementary right on the land or any part thereof. In the instant case, however, the appellants-plaintiffs claim easementary right only as an alternative ground but the main ground on which they based their claim is on the right of co-ownership.
 [813D] 3:1. The judicial propriety or decorum warrants a Judge not to hold contrary to the decision of the same High Court.
 Here, if the learned Judge did not agree with the decision in Subbiah Goundan's case of that High Court, he should have referred the matter to a larger Bench.
 Subbiah Goundan v. Ramaswamy Gounda & Ors. A.I.R. 1973 Mad. 42, approved.
 3:2. Neither the law nor expediency warrants a conclusion that if the appellants had acquired new land, then they cannot have any right in irrigate from the common well or channel If the parties had entered into a contract then they would be governed by the terms of the contract but in the case in hand there was no such stipulation about the manner or mode of enjoyment of the common land or common channel. Further in these days of scarcity when every effort is being made at all levels to increase the agricultural production to feed the country's teeming millions it would not be desirable to allow the respondents-defendants to create any hurdle in the irrigation of 810 the appellants-plaintiffs' plots through the common channel from their exclusive well W1. [815F; D-E] Sivarama Pillai & Ors. v. Marichami Pillai A.I.R, 1971 Mad. 230, held inapplicable.
