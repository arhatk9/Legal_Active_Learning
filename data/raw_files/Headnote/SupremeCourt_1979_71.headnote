 Section 3 of the Bombay Tenancy Act, 1939 classified a tenant as a protected tenant in respect of any land if he had held such land continuously for a period of six years immediately preceding 1st January, 1938 to 1st January, 1945 and had cultivated such land personally during that period.
 Tenancy held by a protected tenant could be terminated only in the circumstances stated in s. 5 as for example, failure to pay arrears of rent subletting and so on. Section 7 provided that the landlord could recover possession of the land from the protected tenant on the ground that he bonafide required such and for the purpose of cultivating it personally or for a non-agricultural purpose. If after taking possession of the land he ceased to use it for that purpose at any time within 12 years from the date on which he took possession the landlord was required to restore possession of the land under s. 7(2) to the protected tenant. The Act also defined that a protected tenant shall include his heirs by an explanation to this section.
 The 1939 Act was repealed and replaced by the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948. This Act also empowered the landlord to terminate the tenancy of a protected tenant by giving the tenant one year's notice in writing if he bonafide required the land for any of the purposes mentioned in the Act and the grounds on which a tenancy could be terminated were also enumerated in the Act.
 A provision similar to s. 7(i) of the 1939 Act was contained in s.34(i) of this Act. The 1948 Act did not contain provisions corresponding to Explanation (ii) to s. 7 of the 1939 Act declaring that a tenant shall include his heirs.
 Section 40 provided that if a protected tenant died the landlord shall offer to continue the tenancy on the same terms on which such tenant was holding it at the time of his death, to the heir or heirs of the deceased tenant. The Explanation to s. 40 declared that a heir meant the lineal descendant of a tenant or his adopted son and failing both, his widow.
 The 1948 Act underwent substantial changes in 1956.
 Section 40 as amended in 1956 provided that on the death of the tenant the landlord shall be deemed to have continued the tenancy on the same terms and conditions on which such tenant was holding it at the time of his death to such heir or heirs of the deceased tenant as may be willing to continue the tenancy.
 The land in dispute belonging to the appellants was held by the respondent's father who was a protected tenant within the meaning of that term in the 1939 Act. In June, 1950 the appellants recovered possession of the 573 land allenging that they needed it for their personal cultivation. In 1951 the potected tenant died. In 1962 the landlords sold a part of the land, whereupon the respondents who were the heirs of the late protected tenant filed a petition alleging that the landlords had ceased to cultivate the land personaily within 12 years from the date of dispossession of the protected tenant and, therefore, they were entitled to recover possession of the land. While the Aval Karkun and the Deputy Collector held in favour of the heirs of the tenant, the Revenue Tribunal allowing the revision application of the landlords dismissed the application of the tenant/respondents. The High Court in a petition under Art. 226 of the Constituton reversed the order of the Revenue Tribunal.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellants that the right of a protected tenant whose tenancy had been determined and who had been dispossessed of the land under s. 39 of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act was a right which was personal to the tenant himself and, which could not for that reason be exercised by the tenant's heirs.
 Allowing the appeal.

 HELD: The contrast between s. 40 before and after its amendment in 1956 was that while after the amendment, the heirs of the tenant were automatically deemed to succeed to the tenancy there was no such deeming before the 1956 amendment. The landlord was merely required to make an offer and it was not stipulated what would happen if he did not make the offer. Where the landlord had obtained possession of the land for cultivating it personally there could be no question of making an offer to continue the tenancy. The 1948 Act before its amendment in 1956 contained no provision corresponding to Explanation (ii) to s. 7 of the 1939 Act.
 Therefore under the provisions of 1948 Act as it stood before the 1956 amendment the right of a tenant to recover possession of the land from the landlord who had obtained possession of such land on the ground that he required it to cultivate it personally was not a heritable right. [581 B-E] Explanation (ii) to s. 7 of the 1939 Act expressly provided that for the purpose of that section a tenant included his heirs. The position under the 1948 Act after its amendment in 1956 as could be seen from ss. 4B and 40 was that the tenancy under the Act was heritable. When it is found that the tenancy was heritable the right given to the tenant may be exercised by the heirs of the tenant also. In the instant case death of the protected tenant occurred in 1951 i.e. before the 1956 Act came into force. His heirs had therefore no right to recover possession from the landlords.
