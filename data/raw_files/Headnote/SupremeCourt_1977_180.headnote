 The respondent filed a suit for rendition of accounts against the appellant, The Trial Court delivered its judgment on 27-3-1976 and granted a final decree. The respondent was directed to make up deficiency in court fees within one month. On 14-4-1976, the appellant requested his advocate in the trial court to take necessary steps to file an appeal in the High Court. On 17-4-1976 the advocate in the Trial Court applied for a certified copy of the judgment. The deficit court fees was paid on 6-5-1976. On the same day the decree was drawn up. The advocate who filed the appeal in the High Court applied for another certified copy of the judgment and decree on 14-7-1976. The said copies were ready on 17-9-1976. The appeal was filed on 29- 9-1976. If the limitation is counted from 6-5-1976 the appeal would be within period of limitation. However, if the limitation was counted from 27-3-1976, the appeal would be timebarred. The High Court on construction of s.12(2) of the Limitation Act, 1963. read with the explanation held that the limitation would commence from 27-3-1976. and therefore, the appeal was time-barred. The High Court 'held that the delay till 17-9-1976 was explained, however, since the appeal was filed on 29-9-1976, the delay of 12 days was not explained and, therefore, dismissed the appeal.
 Allowing the appeal by special leave, 
HELD :-(1) In the Limitation Act of 1908 there was no explanation to section 12 and there was a sharp cleveage of opinion in the High Courts with regard to the expression "the time requisite for obtaining a copy of the decree".
 Ultimately this Court in the case of Lala Bal Mukund held approving the view of the majority of the High Courts that the period taken in drawing up of the decree would be part of the requisite period. This Court, however, did not express any opinion on the new section 12(2) of 1963 Act read with explanation. [550 H, 553 C-E] Jagat Dhisli Bhargava v. Jawahar Lal Bhargava & Ors. [1960] INSC 257; [1961] (2) SCR 918 and Lola Bal Mukand (Dead) by L.Rs v. Lajwanti and others A.I.R. 1975 SC 1089, referred to.
 (2) The Court after referring to the object of the new section and the recommendation of the Law Commission held that in computing the time requisite for obtaining the copy of a decree the time that elapsed between the pronouncement of the judgment and the signing of the decree is not to be excluded if the application for copy was made after the preparation of the decree. [553 F-G] Subhash Ganpatrao Buty and Another v. Maroti slo Krishnaji Dorlikar and Others A.I.R. 1975 Bombay 244, overruled.
 Sitaram Dada Sawant and Another v. Ramit Dada Sawant, AIR 1968 Bombay 204, approved.
 (3) The Court held that "shall not be excluded" does not mean "shall be included". [555 C] 548 (4) The position would be different if a decree cannot be prepared in law because of noncompliance with some directions in the judgment. It is not possible to conceive how a person may obtain a copy of a decree if that decree in view of the recitals in the judgment pronounced cannot be prepared without some further action by a party. A judgment which is unconditioned by the requirement of any action by a party stands on a different footing and in that event the date of the 'judgment would necessarily be the date of the decree. In such a case a party cannot take advantage of any ministerial delay in preparing the decree prior to his application for a copy i.e., to say if there is any impediment in law to prepare a decree immediately after the pronouncement of judgment, no matter, if in fact, a decree is prepared after some time lapses. It is only when there is a legal impediment to prepare a decree on account of certain direction in the judgment or for non-compliance with such directions or for other legally permissible reasons the party who is required to comply with such directions or provisions cannot rely upon the time required by him, under those circumstances, as running against his opponents.
 In the present case, time was given to the respondent for paying the deficit court fees. There can be no decree in existence in law until the respondent supplied the court fees. Without the existence of the decree any application for a copy of the decree would be futile. In the present case, therefore the date of the decree was when the respondent furnished the court fees as ordered. It was only when the respondent paid the court fees that it was possible to prepare the decree in terms of the judgment. In the present case the period of 90 days would count from the date when the respondent had deposited the court fees.
 Even otherwise in the entire circumstances of the case disclosing sheer in difference on the part of the Trial Court advocate and no laches whatever on the part of the appellant, the court would have been inclined to condone the delay of 12 days under sec. 5 of the Limitation Act.
