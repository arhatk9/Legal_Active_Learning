 As a result of a fire breaking out and destroying its stock- in-trade, machinery and buildings, the assessee received Rs.
 65 lakhs from the Insurance Company in full settlement of its claim. Though the Insurance Company finally accepted the claim on 13th December 1948, the amount was paid only on 27th March 1950. Out of that amount, a sum of Rs. 27 lakhs and odd represented the loss in respect of buildings and machinery, and it was not included in the return of assessee for the assessment year 1949-50. The Income-tax Officer, on the ground that the said amount became receivable by the assessee in December 1948, included it in the taxable income for the assessment year 1949-50. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner allowed the assesse's appeal holding that the amount could only be; assessed to tax under the 4th proviso to s.. 10(2)(vii) of the Income tax Act, 1922, when the assessee actually received the amount. The Appellate Tribunal and the High Court on a reference, agreed with the Appellate Assistant Commissioner.
 In his appeal to this Court, the Commissioner contended that the assessee maintained its accounts on mercantile basis and therefore, its profits and gains should be computed in accordance with that method of accounting; and if so computed, the assessee acquired a right to receive the amount in December, 1948 with the result that it became a part of the taxable income of the assessee during the accounting year.
 
HELD: As the compensation for the loss of machinery and buildings by fire was not actually received by the assessee during the accounting year the said amount could not be assessed during the assessment year. [401 H] The profit and loss of a business concern is ascertained on commercial principles. Section 13 of the Act imposes a duty on the Revenue to compute the profits of a business in accordance with the method of accounting adopted by an assessee under the said principles. But the concept of assessable income under the Act is different from profit and loss in a commercial sense. Though profit and loss ascertained under the system adopted by ,in assessee is the basis, the assessable income is arrived at by adopting some artificial rules incorporated in s. 10(2). Under the 4th proviso to s. 10(2)(vii), when insurance money is received in respect of any building, machinery or plant which has been destroyed, and it exceeds the difference between the written down value and the scrap value. so much of the excess as mentioned therein will be, deemed to be the profits of the previous year in which such money is received. Though fact the said compensation represents a capital asset, because compensation received from an insurance company towards loss of a capital asset does not represent profit in a commercial sense, to the extent men- tioned in the proviso, the compensation is deemed to be the profits of previous year in which such money is received.
 The proviso therefore, 3 9 4 introduces a fiction that what is not a profit in the previous year is deemed to be a profit in that year. Since the fiction serves the purpose of section it cannot be enlarged by importing another fiction, namely that if an amount was receivable during the previous year it must be deemed to have been received during that year. Further, the definition of the expression "paid" in s. 10(5) incorporating the concepts of mercantile system of accountancy into it, is a clear indication that in the case of the other terms such as "received" etc., in s. 10(2), the Legislature intended to give those expressions their natural meanings. There is, therefore, no scope for holding that the expression "received" means "receivable". [398 E-H; 399 D-G; 401 E, F] Case law referred to.
