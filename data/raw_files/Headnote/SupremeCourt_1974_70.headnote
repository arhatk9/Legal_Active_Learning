 A parliamentary constituency from which election to Lok Sabha took place in March 1971 consisted of five assembly constituencies. The polling at two of them was scheduled to take place on March 1, and at the other three on March 3.
 1971. 15th March. 1971 was fixed as the last day for the completion of the election. The polling at the first two constituencies took place on March 1. 1971. but. on March 2, there was a communal riot as a result of which, the Election Commissioner postponed the poll at the other three constituencies from March 3 to March 9. After the polling took place the first respondent was declared elected. The appellant filed an election petition challenging the election of the first respondent alleging several corrupt practices against him, one of which was that on 6th March.
 the second respondent, who was one of the candidates, was induced to withdraw from the contest by the first respondent offering to recommend him to a seat in the legislative council and by a financier offering him a large sum of money; and that the second respondent, though he declined the offers, did, in fact, withdraw. He also contended that the Election Commissioner had no power to alter the date of poll at the remaining constituencies. The election petition was dismissed by the High Court.
 in appeal to this Court, the first respondent raised the contention that even if the facts relating to the offers were established, the first respondent would not be guilty of the corrupt practice under s. 123(1)(A)(a), because, the withdrawal of the 2nd respondent was after the date fixed for withdrawal from being a candidate.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD.(1) The Election Commissioner had power to alter the date of the poll from 3rd March to 9th March in the remaining constituencies. Secs. 57 & 58 could not be invoked by Election Commissioner for this purpose, because they are applicable only in the circumstances specified and in the manner provided, in those sections and s. 153. on which the High Court relied, is also not applicable, because it in terms provides only for extending the time for completion of election and not for altering the date of the poll. But s. 30 of the Representation of the People Act.
 read with s. 21 of the General Clauses Act gives the necessary power to the Election Commissioner to alter the date of the poll. [742H; 743F-H; 744C-E-] (2) The amendment of the date of the Poll gets engrafted in the original form no. 1 in pursuance of the subsequent notification made in valid exercise of the power under s. 30 of the Representation of the People Act read with s. 21 of the General Clauses Act, and therefore, a fresh notification of the date under r.3 of the Conduct of Election Rules. in the requisite form, is not necessary. [744E-G] (3) If the facts regarding the offers to the second respondent had been established it would amount to corrupt practice within the meaning of s. 123(1) (A)(a) of the Representation of the People Act. (a) Bribery to induce a person to withdraw from being a candidate at an election amounts to corrupt practice within the meaning of the sub- section. It cannot be said that since the time for withdrawal of candidature fixed for that purpose in the appropriate notification had already expired in this case there could be no withdrawal of candidature after the date.
 When s.123 (1) (A)(a) speaks of withdrawal from being a candidate it is not limited to a condidate who has been validly nomi- 739 nated and who has withdrawn earlier according to law. The expression "to withdraw from being a Candidate" cannot be given a restricted meaning and confined to the stage where law permits a' candidate to withdraw from the election. For the purpose of the section the words are of wide amplitude to include subsequent withdrawal even at the last stage prior to the poll. [746B-747C] (b)The omission of the words "retire from contest" from the section as it originally stood is not significant, because the dictionary meaning of the word withdraw' includes 'to retire from the field or battle or any contest', and it is because the words 'retire from contest' have become unnecessary that they were advisedly deleted by the legislature. [746G-H] (c) Since purity of elections is the most important object of the Act, a narrow meaning to the word "withdraw" to refer only to legal withdrawal under section 37 would defeat the very aim. We have therefore, to give meaning to the word "withdraw" keeping in mind the object and scheme of the Act with a view to effectuate the intention of the legislature to ensure purity in ,elections; else there will be an absurd position where actual withdrawal after the time limit by taking bribe will be free from the vice of corrupt practice ,whereas that prior to it will not be so. Such an intention cannot be attributed to the legislature from deletion of the words "retire from contest". The word "Withdraw" is Comprehensive enough to also connote "retire from contest".
 [747C-F] (4) On the evidence, however, it could not be held that any corrupt practice had been proved to have been committed by the first respondent under s. 123(1) to (4) of the Act. In the matter of appreciation of oral testimony in an election dispute this Court, in an appeal under s. 116-A, must have convincing and clinching reasons to take a contrary view from that of the High Court. It is not enough that another view is merely possible on the oral evidence. Strict proof of the allegations is Called for and the High Court has in the present case rightly declined to accept the oral evidence of the appellant's ,,side and rightly preferred that on the respondent's side.
