 The appellants were the landlords of a building in which the tenant was running a hotel. They filed a suit for the tenant's eviction on the ground that he had defaulted in the payment of rent. The suit was decreed. The landlord, in anticipation of the premises falling vacant, filed an application before the Rent Controller and Eviction Officer under section 16 of the U.P. Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent and Eviction) Act, 1972 for release of the building in question.
 In the meantime respondent No. 3 filed a petition before the District Judge alleging that he was a partner in the hotel business with the consent and permission of the landlord and that the landlord be directed not to dispossess him. This application was rejected on the ground that respondent No. 3 was neither a party to the ejectment suit nor was any objection filed by him during the pendency of the suit alleging that he had a share in the business carried out by the tenant.
 After physical possession of the premises was delivered to the appellant decree-holder respondent No. 3 filed a suit against the appellant and the former tenant for setting aside the ejectment decree. He claimed that it was he who was the sole tenant and, that for this reason the decree could not have been passed against the former tenant. The suit was dismissed.
 The appellant made an application before the Eviction Officer that the premises be allotted to him. The Eviction Officer rejected the objection raised by respondent No. 3 and released the property in favour of the appellant. The Appellate Authority, however, allowed respondent No. 38 appeal holding that the application filed by the landlord was not maintainable under section 16 of the Act as the tenant had not been actually ejected when the application for notifying the vacancy was made.
 The appellant's writ petition was dismissed by the High Court on the ground that before notifying the vacancy the Eviction Officer did not hear respondent No. 3.
 Allowing the appeal ^ 
 HELD : The High Court was in error in dismissing the appellant's writ petition. The High Court does not appear to have considered the history of the case and the various proceedings leading to the eviction of the tenant and to the fact that respondent No. 3 had no claim or right to the property. Respondent No. 3 never came in possession of the premises but tried to defeat or 505 delay the decree by various subterfuges and pretexts. At no stage could he show that he was either a sub-tenant or a partner of the tenant. There was, therefore, no question of his being heard by the Eviction Officer after possession was delivered to the landlord and the vacancy notified. If at all, such a hearing would have been futile and would have ultimately led to the same result. [508 E & D] The Appellate Authority took a wrong view of the law in allowing the respondent's appeal. Under section 16(1) of the Act it was not necessary that the application for notifying the vacancy should be made only after the premises have become actually vacant. Section 16(1) (a) so far as relevant, provides that the District Magistrate may require a landlord to let any building which is about to fall vacant to any person specified in the order. Manifestly it is not necessary that under section 16(1)(a) the premises must actually become vacant before an application under it could be filed before the District Magistrate. In the instant case as the decree for ejectment was under contemplation it was open to the appellant to move the District Magistrate for notifying the vacancy under the section. [507 E-G]
