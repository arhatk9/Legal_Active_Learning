 By a deed Ex. A I dated 10th September 1885, five members of the family of one Nagi Reddi dedicated certain properties belonging to their family described in Schedule A and B to the plaint to two charities one called Annadhana-Chatram and the other called Sachindananda Matam situated in the village Vairichettipalayam, After the death of Ramalingachi Reddiar his. adopted son Nagu Reddiar appellant in C.A. 2456/68 assumed management of the trust properties, in accordance with the succession indicated in Ex. A2, in 1942. A suit O.S. 152155 under Section 92 of the Civil Procedure Code was filed by the plaintiffs respondents herein in the Court of Sub-Judge Trichirapalli. for removing the appellant No. I from the trusteeship of the suit charities and for framing a scheme for the said charities. The Trial Court found that the two charities in question were public Trusts and comprised all the alienated properties except item 7 of the Plaint 'A' Schedule of the trust properties; that 'B' Schedule properties were bequeathed for performance of Puja in Samadhi and for feeding the 'agathis' and `paradesis' in the Matam and that the samadhi could not be separated from the Matam and therefore the dedication of the 'B' Schedule properties in forum of the matam and samadhikoil is invalid in 'law. The Court ordered the removal of the defendant from the office of the trusteeship and directed him to render accounts and ordered the framing of a scheme for plaint 'A' Schedule properties except item 7 which was found to be not a trust property.
 Aggrieved by the said decision both the plaintiff respondent and defendant appellant preferred appeals to the High Court.
 A.S. 114/68 is an appeal preferred by the first defendant appellant against the decree removing him from, trusteeship, directing the framing of a scheme and declaring alienations made by him to be not binding on the Trust. A.S. 194/58 is an appeal preferred by the plaintiff against that part of the decree of the judgment dismissing the suit in respect to Sachidananda Matam and 'B' Schedule properties and declaring item 7 of the plaint 'A' Schedule as property not belonging to the Chatnam Trust. Both the appeals were disposed of by the High Court by a common judgment dismissing A.S. 114/58 of the defendant appellant subject to the modification of the decree of the lower Court that he would be liable to render accounts in respect of the trust properties only for five years prior to the date of the suit and allowing in part A.S. 194/58 of the plaintiff respondent holding that item 7 of the plaint 'A' Schedule properties was also part of the Trust properties. It also found that alienations 7, 8 and 15 of 'B' Schedule properties were not valid or binding on the Trust. Differing from the Trial Court it held that the Matam and the Samadhikoil were not inextricably mixed up and that the endowment for Sachidananda Matam was a valid endowment. The High Court allocated half the properties mentioned in 'B' Schedule to the Sachidananda Matam and feeding charity and directed the other half of the 'B' Schedule properties should go to the defendant No. I because it related to the Puja in the Samadhi, the endowment for which purpose not being valid.
 Allowing the appeals by certificate, in part the Court 
HELD : 1. The samadhi was a tomb of ancestors of the settlors of the Trust and as such the settlement in favour of the tomb is not valid in law. [776 D] 771 
2. The word "Poruthatharavu" in the words "Dharumathirkaga Ezhuthivaitha Poruthatharavu" does not mean a 'charge'. The words mean a document evidencing the transaction 'Atharavu' means 'support' and 'Poruthatharavu means a document in support. The document also explicitly states that the properties are given absolutely for the charities. A reading of the documents makes it clear that the properties were absolutely endowed in favour of the charities and the settlors specifically relinquished all their rights in the endowed properties. [776 F, G. H] 
3. The recital makes it clear that the endowment was in favour of not only Sachidananda Swami Matam but also the Samadhikoil, but the properties as described in the schedule were intended to be vested in the Matam with a direction that income from specified properties were to be spent for the purpose mentioned in the schedule itself. The intention was that while all the properties were endowed for the purpose of charities mentioned, the vesting was to be as directed in the schedule with the obligation that the income from the properties as mentioned should be utilised for upkeep of the Nandavaram attached to the Annadanam Choultry and for the purpose of Puja in the samadhi also from the income of the properties that were allotted to the Sachindananda Matam. [777B, D-E] The properties described in the schedule referred to as the properties allotted to Sachidananda Swami Matam vested in the Matam with a charge that part of the income should be spent on the Puja to be performed in the samadhi [777 E].
 In this view (i) the conclusion arrived at by the High Court that properties were endowed for the Matam and the samadhi and that as the purposes of charities were distinct and separate, they could be separated cannot be accepted. (ii).
 The allotment of half the 'B' Schedule proper-ties for the charities concerned with the Matam is not correct and (iii) The direction that the other half of 'B' Schedule properties should go to the first defendant (appellant No. I in C.A.
 2456/68) cannot be sustained in law for on the findings of the High Court the properties would have to revert back to the settlors and their descendants. [777 F-G] 
4. For the settlement to be valid and for the trust to claim exemption from the rule against perpetuity, it must be for a religious and charitable purpose The English law relating to settlement on tombs does not apply to Hindu religious endowments. What are purely religious purposes and what religious purpose will be charitable must be entirely decided according to Hindu law," and Hindu notions.
 [777G-H, 778A, C] 
5. The determination of what conduces to religious merit in Hindu law is primarily a matter of shastric injunction and therefore any purpose claimed to be a valid one for perpetual dedication on the ground of religious merit though lacking in public benefit must be shown to have a shastric basis as far as Hindu are concerned. Other religious practices and beliefs have also grown up and obtained recognition from certain classes as constituting purposes conducive to religious merit. But if such beliefs are to be accepted by Courts as being sufficient for valid perpetual dedication of property therefore without the element of actual or personal public benefit, it must be shown that they have obtained wide recognition and constitute the religious practice of a substantial and large Class of persons. [778C-E] The building of a samadhi or a tomb over the remains of a person and the making of provision for the purpose of 'Gurupooja' and other ceremonies in connection with the same cannot be regarded as charitable or religious purpose according to Hindu law.

6. The rule that a provision for the purpose of puja over the tomb of the remains of a person is invalid is subject to certain exceptions. Cases of Hindu saints having been entombed deified and worshipped stand on a different footing from the case of an ordinary private individual who is entombed and worshipped therein. Samadhi over one who comes to be regarded as of the illuminate and the tombs of heroes may evolve in course of time as a shrine of Hindu public religious worship [778 G, 779 A] Saraswathi Ammal and Anr. v. Rajagopal Ammal, [1953] INSC 65; [1954] SCR 277, Sri Ramanasramam by its Secretary G. Sambasiva Rao and Ors. v. The Commissioner for Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments, [1960] 2 M.L.J. 121; Board of Commissioners for Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras v. Pidugu Narsinham and Ors., [1939] 1 M.L.J. 134, Ratnavelu Mudaliar v.
 Commissioner of H.R. & C.E. [1953] 2 M.L.J. 574; Ramaswami v. The Board of Commissioners, Madras, [1958] 2 M.L.J. 511 referred to.
 The raising of a tomb over the remains of an ancestor, an ordinary person is not recognised as religious in nature.
 The burden is on the person setting up a case of religious practice in the community to prove it. This prohibition may not apply when an ancestor is cremated and a memorial raised for performing sharaddha ceremonies and conducting periodical worship for this practice may not offend the Hindu sentiment which does not ordinarily recognise entombing the remains of the dead. A place of worship will not cease to be religious because of its being in the memory of a person. In the instant case, it was never pleaded that any religious practice existed amongst the community of building samadhis over the remains of the ancestors and performing pujas.
