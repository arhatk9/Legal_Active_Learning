 There was a dispute between the appellant mills and their workmen as to the bonus payable for the year 1967. The dispute was referred to the Industrial Court, Gujarat under s. 73-A of the Bombay industrial Relations Act. 1946. The workmen claimed inter alia that bonus should be paid at the rate of 6.59% of the annual earnings. The Mills on the other had contended that bonus was payable only at the minimum rate of 4%. The Mills in calculating the available surplus claimed deductions of certain items falling under item 6(g) of the Second Schedule of the Payment of Bonus Act 1965, as subsidies. The dispute centred round the meaning of the word 'subsidy' in item 6(g) of the Second Schedule to the Payment of Bonus Act. Another incidental question was whether the Joint Plant Committee or the, Indian Cotton Mills Federation was a 'Body Corporate established by any law for the time being in force'.
 
HELD : (i) The Industrial Court was right in holding (a) that the word Subsidy' cannot be confined only to those cases where cash payment is made by Government in order that an industry may survive, (b) that even if assistance is given by way of an incentive it would not cease to be a subsidy provided it is a cash payment given by way of assistance and (c) that certain types of assistance particularly those Which are only indirect like rebates etc.
 should be excluded. [127D] Whether the grant is made to a single establishment or it is granted on certain terms which make it available to all persons and establishments carrying on the same industry does not make any difference in,; principle. The subsidy is received by the concern or establishment carrying on that industry or activity. [129E-F] In view of the clear provision in item 6(g) for subsidy being deducted it was not open to the Court to consider whether it was proper to deduct the subsidy from the allocable surplus. But the word 'Subsidy' should be restricted to the narrowest possible limits and should take in, only, direct cash subsidies as contemplated under item 6(g). It cannot cover indirect assistance like Customs Drawback or rebate on railway freights. [13OA-C] The mere fact that the full excise duty and railway freight is paid' in the first instance and part of it is later refunded should not make 123 124 any difference to the ultimate fact that what is paid by the management is A ,only concessional excise duty and concessional freight.

 1960 A.I.R. 1320, referred to.
 Accordingly, while item I claimed by the appellant Mills i.e. the subsidy paid by the Government should be deemed to be a permissible deduction, items 3 & 4 were not permissible deductions.
 (ii) (a) The Joint Plant Committee is certainly not a Government Body. It seems to be more or less functioning on an informal basis. It does not seem to have any statutory powers. The decision of the Industrial Court that the cash paid by the Body is a deductible item could not be upheld.
 Item 2 claimed by the appellant Mills was therefore not a permissible deduction. [133C-D] (b)Item 5 claimed by the Company was also not an allowable ,deduction because the Indian Cotton Mills Federation which made the ,cash payment in this case was not a Body Corporate established by any law for the time being in force. The contention that the words 'body corporate established by any law' should be deemed to include even a body corporate established under any law i.e. even a company, could ,not be accepted. [133G] Majoar Sahkari Bank Ltd. v. M. N. Jujumdar & Anr. 1955 2 L.L.J. 755 applied.
 (iii)The amount of Rs. 6873 due for the year 1966 but received (under item 1) in 1967 should also be deemed to be income for the year 1967.
