 The petitioner a factory owner, manufacturing ropes had entered into agreements with intermediate contractors who had hired the respondent union's workmen. In an industrial dispute raised by the respondent union the petitioner contended that no direct employer-employee vinculum juris existed between him and the workmen. However, the Tribunal gave an award in favour of the workmen which was affirmed by both the single Judge as well as a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court.
 Dismissing the special leave the Court, 
HELD : 1. Where a worker or a group of workers labour to produce goods or services and these goods or services are for the business of another, that other is in fact the employer. He has economic control over the workers' sub- sistence, skill, and continued employment. If he, for any reason, chokes off the worker is, virtually, laid off. The presence of intermediate contractors with whom alone the workers have immediate or direct relationship ex-contractu is of no consequence when, on lifting the veil or looking ;it the conspectus of factors governing employment, Courts discern the naked truth, though draped in different perfect paper arrangement, that the real employer is the management, not the immediate contractor. [1075 C-D] If the livelihood of the workmen substantialy depends on labour rendered to produce goods and services for the benefit and satisfaction of an enterprise, the absence of direct relationship or the presence of dubious intermediaries or the make-believe trappings of detachment from the Management cannot snap the real-life bond. The story may vary but the inference defies ingenuity. The liability cannot be shaken off. Of course, if there is total dissociation in fact between the disowning management and the aggrieved workmen, the employment is, in substance and in real-life terms, by another. The Management's adventitious connections cannot ripen into real employment.
 [1075 E-F-G] 2.The source and strength of the industrial branch of Third World Jurisprudence is social justice proclaimed in the Preamble to the Constitution. The Court must be astute to avoid the mischief and achieve the purpose of the law and not be misled by the maya of legal appearance when myriad devices are resorted to when labour legislation casts'welfare obligations on the real employer based on Articles 38, 39, 42, 43 and 43A of the Constitution. The contention of the_ petitioner as to the non-existence of the vinculum juris between the respondent and himself is if at all impeccable only in laissez faire economics red in tooth and claw' and under the Contract Act rooted in English common law as the human gap of a century yawns between this strict doctrine and the industrial Jurisprudence of today.
