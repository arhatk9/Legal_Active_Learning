 The appellants were duly prosecuted. convicted and awarded sentences of 2 1/2 years rigorous imprisonment each for the offence of having robbed the State Bank by committing dacoity. Appeals by the accused and the State ended in the enhancement of the sentence to seven years R.I.
 each. Hence the appeal by special leave.
 Dismissing the appeal, but modifying the sentence as awarded by the Sessions the Court ^ 
 HELD: The High Court has superseded the trial Court's discretionary impost for which it has power, provided error in principle or perverse exercise or like faux pas is pointed out and those reasons are stated. Appellate power to prune or protract is not unbridled when discretion once exercised is to be upset. And the higher Court can be draconic, if grounds exist, but it cannot be laconic. The specific reasons assigned by the Sessions Court must be countered by clear ratiocination and then the Supreme Court ordinarily keeps out. [6 A-B, E] In the instant case, the four words which did justice to the trial court were "the ends of justice" without specifying what they were and there was no speaking order in the High Court's substantial enhancement. None of the reasons given by the Sessions Court have been expressly dissented from by the High Court or can be called impertinent. [6E, 7C] Observations:
 (i) "Cash awards for bravery" to witnesses when a criminal case is pending may be euphemistic officialese but may be construed by the accused as purchase price for testimonial fidelity. The overzealous antics and objectionable tactics are far from fair for a political Government which pays homage to judicial justice and betrays a mood of executive interference with the course of justice where political vendetta shows up. No one is above contempt power in our constitutional order. [5A-B] (ii) Prison justice is part of social justice. The writ of the rule of law, if it runs within the jail system shall not permit inhumanity. On appropriate motion made to this Court showing violation of the residual rights of a prisoner by unnecessary cruelty and unreasonable impositions and denial and deprivations within the prison-setting, the judicial process will call to order the prison authorities and make them respect the fundamental rights of the appellants Prisoners are not non-persons. [8B-C, 10-B] 3 (iii) The Court has responsibility to see that punishment serves social defence which is the validation of deprivation of citizen's liberty. Correctional treatment with a rehabilitative orientation, is an imperative of modern penology which has abandoned jus talionis. The therapeutic basis of incarceratory lifestyle is not unknown to Gandhian India because the Father of the Nation regarded a criminal as a morally aberrant patient. A hospital setting and a humanitarian ethos must pervade our prisons if the retributive theory, which is but vengeance in disguise, is to disappear and deterrence as a punitive objective gain success not through the hardening practice of inhumanity inflicted on prisoners but by reformation and healing whereby the creative potential of the prisoner is unfolded.
 These values have their roots in Art. 19 of the Constitution which sanctions deprivation of freedoms provided they render a reasonable service to social defence, public order and security of the State. [7D-G] [The Court-directed that the appellants being "children" within the meaning of the "Saurashtra Children Act", though not under the Andhra Children Act, be separated from adult prisoners. More particularly the appellants should be allowed opportunities for improving themselves and nourishing their minds with wholesome reading so that on return to society they turn a new leaf.]
