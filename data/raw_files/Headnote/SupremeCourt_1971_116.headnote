 On the question whether the relationship of landlord and tenant continued to subsist between July 20, 1955 when the inams were abolished and the land vested in the State under the Hyderabad Abolition of Inams Act, 1954 (VIII of 1955) and July 1, 1960 when a notification under s. 1(3)(b) of the Act made the entire Act applicable, 
HELD: Though the Inams were abolished and the land vested in the State by reason of s. 3(1) of the Act the rights and interests of landlord and tenant mentioned in s.
 3(2) (b) were preserved by s. 33 inasmuch as s. 3(2) cls.
 (d), (g) (h) and (i) did not come into effect until July 1, 1960. The crucial date for grant of occupancy rights under the 1955 Act is July 1, 1960 when the entire Act including, in particular, the provisions regarding grant of occupancy rights and cls. (d), (g), (h) and (i) of s. 3(2) came into effect. The relation between landlord and tenant ceased on July 1,1960 and if any tenant surrendered possession prior to July 1, 1960, and the inamdar accepted such surrender and remained in possession of the land on the relevant date, i.e., July 1, 1960, the inamdar would be entitled to grant of occupancy rights. On the other hand if the tenant claimed to be in possession of the land on the relevant date and the inamdar also claimed to be in possession the Government will have to ascertain as to who was lawfully in possession on the relevant date.
