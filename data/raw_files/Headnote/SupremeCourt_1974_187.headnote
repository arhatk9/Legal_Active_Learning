 The respondent company is manufacturing paper and other products. Since the Mysore Electricity Board was not in a position to supply the entire quantity required by the respondent company, the company started generating electricity. In 1966, the appellants made a demand of Rs.
 3,53,953.45 as arrears of electricity tax under the Act from the respondent for the period from July 1959 to March 19'66.
 The respondent company filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging the demand notice contending that, (1) it was not liable to pay electricity tax on the quantity of electrical energy lost in the course of transmission, i.e.
 as a result of transmission or transformer loss; and (2) some electrical energy was used by it for generation of further electrical energy and therefore, no electricity tax was payable on the quantity of electrical energy utilised by it for generation of further electrical energy. The High Court decided on both the points of controversy in favour of the respondent company. This appeal by certificate under' article 133(1)(a) has been filed by the appellant.
 Allowing the appeal with respect to the second contention, 
HELD : (1) (Per H. R. Khanna and V. R. Krishna Iyer, JJ.) The entire scheme of the Mysore Electricity (Taxation on Consumption) Act, 1959, is to tax the consumption of electrical energy. Where some energy is not consumed but lost before it reaches the point of consumption, the ques- tion of levy of tax on consumption, of such energy would not in the very nature of things arise. The place of consumption is normally at some distance from the place where electrical energy is generated. Electrical energy has consequently to be transmitted through metal conductors to the place where it is consumed. Such transmission admittedly entails loss of some electrical energy and what is lost can plainly be not available for consumption and as such would not be consumed. To realise tax on all the electrical energy generated would be tantamount to levying tax on generation or production of electrical energy and not on its consumption. Such a tax on the generation or produc- tion of electrical energy is plainly not permissible under the Act. The fact that the consumer happens in the present case to be the same company which generated the electrical energy would make no material difference. [131 B-F] Gokak Mills-Ltd. v. State of Mysore (1969)2 Mysore Law Journal 99, approved.
 Per M. H. Beg J. (dismissing).
 No distinction is made anywhere in the Act between consumption for different purposes, such as generation, transmission, transformation or utilisation of electricity for any other purpose. One who generates electricity and then transmits and transforms it before utilising it for another purpose may be said to be generating it for several purposes. Spending up or utilisation of energy for each of the purposes, whether it be generation, or transmission, or.
 transformation, or, manufacture of some particular commodity, can be said to be a use which must necessarily fall within the ordinary grammatical or dictionary meaning of the word consumption. The consumption begins immediately after electricity can be said to be generated. So long as energy is spent or used up, 128 whatever be the process or purpose of such using up, it will be consumption. For a division of consumption into effective consumption and non-effective consumption, there is no warrant in the relevant provisions of the Act. L134 F-H, 135 F-G, 136 A-Di It may be that the electricity tax is imposed upon a person only in the character or capacity of a consumer. It does not follow from this that the character or capacity of a consumer only begins when energy is used up for a particular purpose in which a consumer is consumer. If he consumes it is evident that the character of a consumer attaches to him even if he is a generator or producer of energy. He has then a dual character when he consumes and also generates.
 What the Act does is simply to tax the using up of energy by a Person whatever be the capacity in which the use may have been made. It is really a tax on using up and not on use in any particular character or manner. [136 F-H] Indian Aluminum Co. Ltd. v. The C.I.T. West Bengal, Calcutta, 849 T-R 735 referred to.
 (2) (By Full Court) : Electrical energy can be consumed for a variety of purposes. The fact that such energy has been used not for manufacturing some other article but for generating further electricity would not go to show that such energy has not been consumed. Sub-section (3) of section 4 makes it clear that electricity tax would be payable if a person consumes electrical energy generated the consumer himself. The definition of thee word "consumer" also shows that it would include a person who consumes energy generated by himself. [132 C-E, G-H]
