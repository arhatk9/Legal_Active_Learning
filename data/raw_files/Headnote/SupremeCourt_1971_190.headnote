 The Executive Officer of the Municipal Board, Kannauj (U.P.) dismissed 74 striking employees. Some of the employees appealed against the order of dismissal and most of them were, reinstated. The others did not appeal and the dismissal order stood in their cases.
 After a year, the State Govt. purporting to act under s. 34 (1-B) of, the U.P. Municipalities Act, passed an order prohibiting the execution or further execution of the order of dismissal passed by the Executive Officer on the ground that r. 5 of the U. P. Municipal Board Servants (Enquiry punishment and termination of service) Rules were not followed and the dismissed employees were not heard and so the alleged order was illegal and improper. Section 34(1-B) of the U.P. Municipalitie Act, inter alia, provides that the State Govt. may by order 'prohibit the execution or further execution of a resolution or order', passed by a Board, 'if in its opinion such resolution or order is prejudicial to the public interest' or has been passed 'in abuse of powers or in fragrant breach of provision of any law in force', and 'may prohibit continuance by any person or any act in pursuance of such resolution or order.' The Municipal Board challenged the order of the State Government in a writ petition; but the High Court dismissed the petition.
 In appeal to this Court the Board contended that the provisions of s. 34 (1-B) were incapable of application to an order of dismissal. Allowing the appeal, 
HELD:The State Government has no power to cancel or set aside an order which exhausts itself after it has been passed or made. Where the resolution or order does not require any acts to be performed or steps to be taken for the execution or further execution of the resolution or order of the Board or its officer there remained nothing of which execution could be prohibited. The sub-section only empowers the State Government to prevent something being done in futuro. [200A-E] Shujaat Ullah Khan v. State of U.P. & Ors, 1966 A.L.J. 499, referred to.
