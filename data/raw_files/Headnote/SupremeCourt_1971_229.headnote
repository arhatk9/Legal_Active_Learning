 The assessee (respondent herein) was the selling agent of a cement company. Under s. 2(g) of the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1959 the term 'dealer' is defined to include a commission agent. in February 1967 the Deputy Commercial Tax Officer, Lalgudi. asked the assessee to show cause why its turnover relating to the price of the packing material used in packing the cement sold 'should not be included in its taxable turnover under the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1959. The assessee thereupon moved the High Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution. In its petition the assessee averred that its rights were the same as those of its principal and since the price of packing material was separately shown in the bills the same was deductible from the total turnover in view of r. 6(c) (ii) of the Rules under the Act. The High Court held that the assessee was entitled to deduct from its total turnover the turnover relating to the packing charges if its principal would have been entitled to deduct the same had the principal sold the cement in question directly. The question whether in the present case the principal was so entitled was not decided by the High Court. The State appealed to this Court.
 
HELD : Under the general law the agent merely represents the principal. Therefore while functioning within the scope of the agency he can exercise all the rights which his principal could have exercised. This provision must hold good even under the Madras General Sales Tax Act unless otherwise provided therein. The fact that for the purpose of that Act an agent is considered as a dealer does not alter the legal position in other respects. Excepting to the extent otherwise provided in the Act the agent must be held to represent his principal while dealing with the goods of his principal; he merely steps into the shoes of his principal. He is entitled to the same exemptions as his principal would have got had he dealt with the concerned goods himself. The decision of the High Court to this effect was correct. [550 H-551 B; 552 E] [The question whether the principal in the present case was entitled to the exemption claimed having been left open by the High Court, this Court did not find itself called upon to decide that question. However it drew the attention of the assessing authority to the principles laid down by this Court in the case of the Hydrabad Deccan Cigarette Factory.] [551 C] Hyderabad Deccan Cigarette Factory v. State of Andhra Pradesh, S.T.C. 17 p. 624, referred to.
