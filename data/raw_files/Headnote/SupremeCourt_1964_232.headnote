 Teas produced by the appellants were classified and stocked in lots in, godowns at Willingdon Island which at the relevant time was in the State of Travancore-Cochin. The sale of the said teas was however effected by public auction at Fort Cochin in Madras State under the Rules of the Tea Trade Association of Cochin. Sales-tax was imposed on the appellants by the State of Kerala under the Travancore- Cochin General Sales Tax Act (Act 11 of 1125) on the authority of the judgment of the Kerala High Court in Deputy Commissioner of Agricultural Income-tax & Sales Tax v. A. V.
 Thomas & Co. Ltd. which was on similar facts. According to the said decision the sales were completed at the fall of the hammer in Fort Cochin but, nevertheless by virtue of explanation 2 to s. 2(j) of the Travancore Act they remained 'inside' sales for the purpose of taxation in Kerala State.
 Because of this judgment being against them, the appellants also could not succeed before the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal or before the High Court. They were however, granted special leave to appeal by the Supreme Court.
 Before the connected appeals came up for hearing the Supreme Court had reversed the judgment of the Kerala High Court in the case of A. V. Thomas & Co. Ltd. on the authority of which the appellants had been taxed. Counsel for the State of Kerala therefore sought and was given permission to defend the imposition of tax on alternative reasoning. Relying upon ss. 17 and 18 of the Sale of Goods Act he contended that the sale at the auction in Fort Cochin being a sale by sample was not completed at the fall of the hammer but remained at that stage only a conditional sale.
 It became a completed sale when the buyer after comparing the bulk with the sample accepted the goods in Willingdon Island. 'Me property in the goods thus passed in Kerala State making the sale liable to tax in that State. Rules of the Tea Trade Association of Cochin were called for and examined by the Court.
 
 HELD : The title to the goods passed to the buyer under s. 64(2) of the Sale of Goods Act as soon as the sale was completed by the auctioner announcing its completion by the fall of the hammer. The initial auction cannot be treated as an executory contract which had become a conditional contract on the fall of the hammer. The sale at the auction was in respect of ascertained goods and it was concluded in every case on the fall of the hammer. The High Court was therefore in error in upholding the imposition of sales tax on the appellant by the State of Kerala. [814 E-G]
