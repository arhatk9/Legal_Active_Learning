 The first respondent's suit questioning the adoption of the appellant was dismissed by the trial court. The first appellate court held that the ceremony of giving and taking had not taken place and allowed the appeal. The single judge of the High Court held that the giving and taking had taken place and that there was intention to transfer the appellant from the family of his birth to that of the adoptive family within the meaning of s. I 1(vi) of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956. However, in Letters Patent Appeal the Division Bench held that there was no intention to transfer the appellant from his natural family to the family of adoptive father.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : The single Judge was right in his conclusion that there was evidence of intention to transfer the appellant from his natural family to that of the adoptive father and that the fact that the adoptive father was at one time governed by customary law or that the adoption was stated to have been validly made in accordance with custom would not go to show that the intention at the time of the adoption was not to transplant the appellant from his natural family to that of the adoptive family, because customary law also recognises formal adoption resulting in change of family.
 The Division Bench failed to take into consideration the fact that the very ceremony of giving and taking is in itself symbolic of transplanting the adopted son from the family of his birth to the adoptive family. [743 F-744A,H] (2) The adoption deed refers to the adoptive father taking the appellant into his lap from his parents and adopting him as his son. The adoptive father referred to the appellant as adopted son and specifically called the document "adoption deed". The adoption deed is to be read as a whole and so read there could be no doubt that what the adoptive father intended was to make an adoption according to law and not merely appoint an her according to custom. After the abolition of the customary law of adoption, whether of the formal or informal kind, there is no room for any argument about the validity of the adoption provided the formalities prescribed by Jaw were complied with. The words in s.
 11(vi) of the Act" with intent' to transfer the child from the family of its birth to the family of its adoption" are merely indicative of the result of actual giving and taking by the parents or guardians concerned referred to in the earlier part of the clause. Where an adoption ceremony was gone through and the giving and taking took place there cannot be any other intention.[745D-F, H-746A] In the instant case there was a clear finding that the intention was to transfer the adopted son to the adoptive family.
