 The Petitioners moved this Court u/s 406 Crl. P. C., 1973 r/w Order XXXVI Supreme Court Rules, 1966, when their matter was at the investigation stage itself for an order of transfer of the case to some other court.
 Dismissing the petition for transfer, the Court 
HELD : The Code of Criminal Procedure clothes the Supreme Court with power u/s 406 to transfer a case for appeal from one High Court or a Court subordinate to one High Court to another High Court or to a Court subordinate thereto, but not with the power to transfer investigations from one police station to another in the country simply because the first information or a remand report is forwarded to a Court. 'lo come to this Court directly seeking an order of transfer in such a case is travelling along the wrong street. If justice is denied, there are other redresses, not u/s 406. [604 F-G 605 A]
