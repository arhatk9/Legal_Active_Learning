 The respondent, which is an electricity company, contested the claim of the appellant for three months' wages as bonus on the ground that if calculation was made on the Full Bench Formula evolved by the Labour Appellate Tribunal and approved by this Court in the Associated Cement Companies Ltd. v. Its Workmen, (1959) S. C. R. 925, there would be no surplus available to pay the bonus. The question which arose for decision was whether depreciation should be calcu- lated according to the provisions of Income-tax Act and the 935 rules framed thereunder or in accordance with the provisions of the Seventh Schedule to the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948.
 Held, that the Income-tax rules should be applied in calculating depreciation under the Full Bench formula in preference to the provisions of the Seventh Schedule to the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 even in the cases of electricity companies.
