 The appellant was the working partner in a firm. It was agreed among the partners that he should carry on the work of recovery of the dues of the partnership. On the allegation that he misappropriated certain sums and also failed to deposit in bank some collections as he was required to do, he was convicted for the offence of criminal breach of trust under s. 409, Indian Penal Code. In appeal to the Supreme Court it was contended that as he realised the sums in his capacity as partner and utilised them for the business of the partnership, he was only liable to render accounts to his partners and his failure to do so would not amount to criminal breach of trust.
 
HELD : The appellant could not be said to have been guilty of criminal breach of trust, Though as a partner he had dominion over the property of the partnership for the purpose of criminal breach of trust the mere existence of such dominion is not enough. It must be further shown that his dominion was the result of entrustment, that is, the prosecution must establish that the dominion over the partnership assets was, by a specific agreement, entrusted to the accused.

 Cal. 23(F.B.) approved.
 Even if there was a mandate to the appellant with respect to some dues to collect and deposit in bank, faliure to do so would not constitute the offence, as he was also authorised by the other partners to spend the money for the business of the partnership. [434 D-E] The appellant would not also be guilty of dishonest misappropriation of property under s. 403 of the code, because, he had undefined ownership along with the other partners over all the assets of the partnership and as such owner, in whichever way, and with whatever intention he used the property, he would not be liable for misappropriation.
