 The Autonomous District of Jowai, which was previously as subdivision of the United Khasi Jaintia Autonomous District, took the shape of an autonomous district with effect from December 1, 1964 pursuant to a notification issued by the Governor of Assam on November 23, 1964.
 The District Council came into being on March 23, 1967 and in that very year it passed the Jowai Autonomous District (Administration) Act, 1967. By virtue of s. 3 of that Act, the United Khasi and Jaintia Hills Autonomous District (Management and Control of Forests) Act, 1958 and the Rules framed under it, were adopted and made applicable to the Autonomous District of Jowai. Subsequently, on April 20, 1968 the Secretary of the Executive Committee of the District Council issued a notification in exercise of its power under s. 8 of the latter Act fixing the rates of royalty chargeable on red pine, white pine and log pine timber grown in the private forests situated within the jurisdiction of the District Council.
 The respondents having become liable to pay the royalty, as specified in the Notification, instituted writ petition in the High Court, questioning the competence of the District Council and its Executive Committee and officers to levy royality on the timber that came from 570 private forests within its jurisdiction, contending that the royalty, in question, which was in the nature of tax was not leviable by the District Council since it had no authority under the Constitution and the laws made thereunder to impose the said levy.
 The District Council contested the writ petitions contending that since the private forests were also under its management and control under the provisions of the law in force in that area, it was open to it to levy the royalty even though it may be in the nature of a tax, and that even though a tax cannot be levied on the trees grown in private forests, since the District Council had the competence to levy tax on lands and buildings, the trees in the private forests being grown on such land the C. tax in question could be treated as tax on land which it was entitled to levy. It was further contended that even if it could not levy a tax, such amount can be realised by way of fee in order to meet the expenses incurred by the District Council m connection with the management and control of the private forests; that the forests in question were not private forests and so the respondents could not maintain the petition at The High Court found that the forests in question were private forests and held that the District Council had no constitutional authority to impose either royality or tax or fee on these forests and that the notification dated 20th April, 1968 issued under s. 8 of the Act was ultra vires and not sanctioned by the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, and issued a writ of mandamus restraining the District Council from realising royalty from the petitioner- respondents in respect of timber extracted by them from the two private forests situated within the jurisdiction of the District Council.
 In the appeals to this Court by special leave by the District Council, on the question of the constitutional validity of the Notification dated April 20, 1968 and whether the royalty levied could be realised by the District Council in respect of trees in private forests.
 Dismissing the Appeals, the Court, ^ 
 HELD: 1. What is sought to be recovered under the Act is not royalty since the forest does not belong to the District Council. The amount claimed is a compulsory exaction of money by a public authority for public purposes enforceable by law and is not a payment for services rendered. It is truly, in the nature of a tax. [584C-D] 571 
 2. Section 4 of the United Khasi and Jaintia Hills Autonomous A District (Management and Control of Forests) Act, 1958 which prohibits removal of forest produce except on payment of royalty, refers to protected Forests, Green Blocks and Raid Forests. It does not refer to private forests. Section 8 of the Act, under which the impugned notification is issued merely says that the Executive Committee may make rules fixing the rates of royalty for each class of trees, timber or forest produce. [582G-H;
 583A] 
 3. Paragraph 3 of the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution does not contain any subject which authorises the District and Regional Councils to levy taxes. It confers powers on the said Councils to make laws only to regulate matters specified therein. The subjects relating to taxation are dealt with separately in Paragraph 8. [585D] 
 4.1 The levy in question does not come within subparagraphs ( I) and (2) of Paragraph 8, which authorised levy of tax on lands and buildings. If the levy is land revenue then it should have been fixed in accordance with the principles for the time being followed by the Government of the State in assessing lands for the purpose of land revenue as required by sub-paragraph (1). It cannot be sustained as any other kind of tax on land since the royalty payable has no reference to the extent of the land and the nature of the land and its potentialities. [584E-G] K. T. Moopil Nair v. The State of Kerala & Ors., [1960] INSC 285; [1961] 3 S.C.R. 77, distinguished.
 
 4.2 The royalty in question is not covered by cls. (a) and (c) of Paragraph 8(3) either, for it cannot be said to be a tax on profession, trade, calling and employment or a tax on the entry of goods into the market for sale therein.
 The appellants have not been able to establish that the impugned royalty was leviable under any other provision.
 [584D-E] 
 4.3 The levy is a tax only on the timber which is brought from private forests. The notification in unambiguous terms says that the royalty shall be on the squared log pines, but it has no reference to the land on which those trees have grown. The District Council has no power to levy such a tax on forest produce under Paragraph 
8. [584G-H] 
 5. Though Paragraphs 3 and 8 of the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution follow almost the same pattern in which the subjects in List I and List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution have been en- H 572 umerated, the legislative powers in respect of certain topics mentioned in Paragraph 3 and the power to levy taxes specified in Paragraph 8 of the Sixth Schedule enjoyed by the District Councils cannot be equated with the plenary powers enjoyed by a legislature. Their powers to make laws are limited by the provisions of the Sixth Schedule. The Courts cannot constructively enlarge their powers to make laws. [580B-C] District Council of United Khasi & Jaintia. Hills & ors. Etc. v.Miss Sitimon Sawian Etc., [ [1971] INSC 216; 1972] 1 S.C.R. 398 at page 407, referred to.
 
 6. The High Court erred in holding that even fees could not be levied under Paragraph 3 of the Sixth Schedule. The Act was enacted for the purpose of making provisions regarding the management and the control of forests in exercise of the powers conferred by Paragraph 3(1)(b). There is no specific reference to the power to levy any fees in respect of any matter mentioned in Paragraph 3 similar to the corresponding provisions in the penultimate entry in List I and the last entry in the other two Lists in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. But having regard to the nature of a fee, which is an amount levied as quid pro quo for services rendered, the power to levy fees in respect of any of the matters mentioned in Paragraph 3 should be necessarily implied. But such fee should not be disproportionately very high, i.e., a tax in disguise.
 Therefore, even though there is no express provision to levy such fees, the District Council can levy fees under Paragraph 3. But that would not save the Notification since there is no material placed before the Court to uphold it on that ground. In the absence of any evidence showing the expenses incurred by the District Council towards the services rendered and the total amount of royalty realised by it levy cannot be upheld even as a fee.

 7. The High Court rightly held that the forests in question were private forests. It has not been shown by the appellants that they belong to any other category of forests referred to in s. 3 of the Act. The Notification purports to levy royalty on timber brought from private forests. If there were no private forests at all the District Council would not have issued the notification levying royalty on timber got from private forests. [585G-H] 573
