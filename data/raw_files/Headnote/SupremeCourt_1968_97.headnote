 The appellant agreed to sell to the respondent 41 acres of jirayat land in Mysore, but failed to execute a conveyance.
 The respondent filed a suit for a decree for specific performance of the agreement and possession of the land.
 The trial court dismissed the suit holding that the agree- ment, if enforced, would result in "transgression of the provisions of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act 67 of 1948". In appeal, the High Court of Mysore granted a decree for specific performance.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that the respondent was already holding 31 acres of jirayat land at the time the agreement was entered into and by acquiring another 41 acres the respondent's holding would exceed the ceiling prescribed by s. 5 of Bombay Act 67 of 1948, and further more, that the Civil Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit for specific performance.
 
HELD:(i) A contract for the sale of land entered into with the knowledgethat the purchaser may hold land in excess of the ceiling is not void,and the seller cannot resist enforcement on the ground that, if permitted, it will result in transgression of the law. [711 C-D] By the acquisition declared invalid under s. 35, the land does not revert to the transferor; it is deemed to be in the transferee's ownership and, on the Mamlatdar making a declaration that any land held in excess of the ceiling, the excess land vests in the Government. The statutory forfeiture incurred in the event of the transferee coming to hold land in excess of the ceiling does not invalidate the transfer between the parties. [710 E] There was nothing in the agreement, nor could it be implied from the circumstances, that it was the object of the parties that the provisions of the Act relating to the ceiling should be transgressed. The more possibility that the respondent may riot have disposed of his original holding at the date of the acquisition of title would not render the object of the agreement such, that, if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any law-,A,. [710 H] (ii) There was no substance in the contention that the Civil Court had no jurisdiction to entertain and decree the suit for specific performance of an agreement to sell land.
 Power to decide whether the transfer or acquisition is invalid under s. 84C and to dispose of the land as provided in that section is conferred upon the Mamlatdar, and the civil court has no jurisdiction in that behalf. But there is nothing in el. (mb) of s. 70 or in s. 85 which excludes the jurisdiction of the civil court to entertain a suit for specific performance of a contract to sell land. An inquiry under s. 84C to determine whether the transfer or 707 acquisition is invalid may be Made oNLy after the acquisition of title pursuant to a decree for specific performance or otherwise.
