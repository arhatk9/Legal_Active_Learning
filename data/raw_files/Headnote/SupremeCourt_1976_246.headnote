 The appellant is a Private Limited Company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913, its shares being held by the members of the Nawn family. The object of the appel- lant Company inter alia was purchase of land and buildings and letting out of lands and buildings in lieu of appropri- ate consideration. The appellant at the relevant time was investing monies in the house properties and its major income every year has been derived from those properties.
 The Income Tax Officer held that the appellant was a Company whose business consisted mainly in holding of in- vestments as envisaged by section 23A(1) and explanation 2(i) thereto of the Income Tax Act 1922 and that since it had declared dividend. which was less than the prescribed statutory 100 per cent of his total income as reduced by taxes referred to in clauses a, b and c of section 23A(1), it was liable to pay super tax on the undistributed balance of the distributable profits at the prescribed rate of 50 per cent. An appeal by the assessee before the Appellate Asstt. Commissioner succeeded. The Tribunal. however, restored the order of the Income-tax Officer. In a reference filed at the instance of the assessee, the High Court an- swered the reference in favour of the Revenue and against the assessee.
 In an appeal by Special Leave, the appellant contended :
 That the appellant was not a company whose business consisted wholly or mainly in holding of investments because the meaning to be attributed to the said expres- sion having not been defined by the Income Tax Act, 1922, the technical meaning assigned to "investment Companies" under section 87(f) of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which was in force when the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 was enacted should be given, or, in the alternative, the meaning given to it in section 372(11) of the Companies Act,1956 should be given to the said expression. So construing only the Companies whose principal business is the acquisition and holding of shares, debentures, stocks and other securities would be covered by the Company whose busi- ness consists wholly or mainly in holding an in vestment and that if it is so construed the appellant would not be covered by section 23A(1).
 The counsel for the respondent Revenue con- tended: That the expression "A company whose business consists wholly or mainly in the holding of investments" means a Company whose income is derived from investments in contra- diction to the income received from manu facturing or processing or trading operations.The expression "investment" in the context in which it occurs not being a term of art 799 with a definite and technical meaning should be understood in its ordinary popular sense as understood in business parlance.
 Dismissing the appeal.
 HELD:
 
 1. The expression investment is not defined in the Income-Tax Act but the Act also does not lay down that the terms and expression not defined therein shall have the same meaning as given to them in the Companies Act. [802A] 
 2. The legislative history-of the Income Tax Act, 1922 right from its amendment in the year 1955 and thereafter as well as the Legislative history of the Income Tax Act, 1961, clearly shows that Legislature did not adopt the definition of investment Companies as given in the Indian Companies Act, 1913 or in the Companies Act, 1956. [801H, 802A---B] 
 3. While enacting section 23A and explanation 2(i) thereto the Legislature intended to cover fields of activity wider than those contemplated the provisions of the Compa- nies Act, 1913 and 1956. [802--B] 
 4. The term 'investment' in the text in which it occurs not being a term of art there is no warrant for giving it the restricted meaning. The said expression has to be understood in the ordinary popular sense as used by busi- nessmen and so construed it would embrace within its compass the appellant Company whose primary or principal income is admittedly derived from house property which it leases out to tenants.

 5. It is now well settled that on analogous provisions, fundamental concepts and general. principles unaffected by the specialities of the English Income Tax Statutes, the English Authorities can be useful guides. [802-E]..

 Distributors (Baroda) P. Ltd. (83 ITR 377) approved.
 
 6. The genesis and development of the law relating to additional super tax on undistributed profits of certain Companies also confirms the conclusion that the expression "A company whose business consists wholly or mainly in the dealing in or holding of investments" takes within its compass 'Companies which wholly or mainly derived their income from house property. [804-D] 
 7. Even if it is assumed that the expression has a legal character, it would not make any difference in the result of the present appeal as the dictionary meaning of the expres- sion "Investment Companies" is Companies whose income consists mainly of investment income i.e., income which in the hands of individual would not be earned income.
