 The petitioner was arrested at Dhanbad on 6th March, 1974 and after being produced before the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, he was taken to Bhagalpur Central Jail from Dhanbad. On an application made by the petitioner, the Sessions Judge granted bail to the petitioner, and an order dated 18th ,March, 1974, was passed for release of the petitioner. On the same day that is 18th March, 1974, the District Magistrate, Dhanbad passed an order detaining the petitioner under section 3 of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971, on the ground that it, was necessary to do so with a view to preventing the petitioner from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. Pursuant to the order of detention, the petitioner was arrested on 21st March, 1974 as soon as he was released on bail. At the time of his arrest the Hindi as well as English versions of the order of detention were served on him together with the grounds of detention which were also in Hindi and English versions. After enumerating the grounds, the Hindi version proceeded to recite the satisfaction of the District Magistrate that in the circumstances he was satisfied that if the petitioner "is allowed to remain at large he will indulge in activities prejudicial to the maintenance of public order" and for prevention of such activities he considered the detention of the petitioner necessary. The words "or security of the State" were added in the recital of the satisfaction in the English version though they were absent in the Hindi version. The petitioner's representation to the State Government was rejected by the Govt. on 24th April, 1974.
 The Advisory Board before which the case of the petitioner had been placed by the State Govt. gave ,in opportunity to the petitioner to be personally heard and after considering all the facts and circumstances of the case, it gave its opinion on 2nd May, 1974 that there was sufficient cause for the detention of the petitioner. After the rejection of the petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution by the High Court, the petitioner filed the present petition under Art.
 32 of the Constitution challenging the validity of his detention.
 It was contended that (i) the recital "or security of the State" in the English version of the grounds of detention showed that the District Magistrate did not apply his mind with any seriousness either to the acts alleged in the grounds of detention against the petitioner or to the question whether they fell within the purview of the expression "the maintenance of public order" or "the security of the State" or both and that was sufficient to vitiate the order of detention; (ii) the first ground in so far as it alleged that the petitioner was propagating communal hatred between Adivasis and others (Biharis) and also between Adivasis and non-Advasis was vague and unintelligible and (iii) the District Magistrate had taken into account many more instances than those set out in grounds (2) and (6).
 Dismissing the petition under Article 32 of the Constitution, 
HELD : If the order of detention purports to be based on the satisfaction of the detaining authority that it is necessary to detain the petitioner with a view to preventing him from acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public;
 order or security of the State, it would clearly be an invalid order. [220 E-F] 216 Kishori Mohan Bera v. The State of West Bengal, A.I.R. 1972 S.C. 1749 and Akshoy Konai v. State of West Bengal, A.I.R.
 1973 S.C. 300, relied on.
 If it appears in the present case that the order of detention made by the District Magistrate was based on the satisfaction that it was necessary to detain the petitioner with a view preventing him from carrying on activities prejudicial to the maintenance of public order or the security of the State, it would have to be struck down as invalid. But there is no such infirmity in the order of detention. It is only in the English version of the grounds of detention that the words "or security of the State" has been added. This is obviously the result of inadvertence and no argument can be founded upon it. In the first place, Hindi being the official language of the State, it is the Hindi version of the grounds of detention which must be regarded as authentic and the validity of the detention must be judged with reference to the Hindi version of the grounds and not the English version. Secondly, even on the English version of the grounds of detention, it is clear that at the end of each of the grounds it is stated in so many words that the acts of the petitioner were prejudicial to the maintenance of public order and there is no reference to prejudice to the security of the State. It is only in the con, elusion based on these facts that there is a recital of the satisfaction that if the petitioner is allowed to remain at large, he would indulge in activities prejudicial to the maintenance of public order or the security of the State.
 The words "or the security of the State" are obviously incongruous in the context. There can be no doubt that these words have crept in the English, version of the grounds of detention through some mistake. The order of detention cannot be invalidated on the basis of such an obvious error, ignoring the order of detention in both its Hindi and English versions, the Hindi vision of the grounds and the totality of the context so far as the English version is concerned. [220 E-F; 221 E-H] (ii)The petitioner was, according to the allegation contained in the first ground stirring hatred between Adivasis and outsiders. The was also propagating hatred between two other groups of people', namely, Adivasis on the one hand and non-Adivasis on the other. This allegation can hardly be regarded as vague or unintelligible. In fact the District Magistrate gave not less than five instances containing detailed and elaborate particulars and they are sufficiently informative so as to provide more than adequate opportunity to the petitioner to make an effective representation. [222 B-C] (iii) What the District Magistrate meant to say by using the expression "It would not be possible to give details of such instances" was that instances of this nature were so many that one could not possibly have details of all of them, but there were a few before him by way of illustration and since he had relied on them for arriving at the requisite satisfaction, he proceeded to reproduce them in grounds (2) to (6). [222E-F] The instance involving removal of paddy crops from two plots of land asset out in ground (4) does not stand in isolation.
 It is part of a se 'es of instances set out in grounds (2), (3), (5) and (6) and if it is viewed in the context of these other instances. it is clear that it is not a localised instance affecting merely maintenance of law and order but a part of public order.[223 B] The various statements in regard to the activities of the petitioner in paragraphs 5 and 7 of the counter-affidavit of the respondent were obviously intended to repel the allegations of the petitioner that he was a dedicated social and public worker devoted to the uplift of the backward and down trodden classes. These facts were not taken into account by the District Magistrate for the purpose of arriving at his subjective satisfaction. [223D]
