 Under s. 4(3)(i) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 income derived front property held under trust for religious or charitable purposes was exempt from taxation in so far as such income was applied for those purposes. By cl. (b) of the proviso to s. 4(3)(i) income mentioned in cl. (i) was includable in the total income of the assessee if it was "derived from business carried on behalf of a religious or charitable institution". But cl. (b) of the proviso contained an exception to an exception to the effect that even income derived from business carried on behalf of a religious or charitable institution was exempt from tax if it was applied wholly for the purposes of the institution and either the business was carried on in the course of the actual carrying out of a primary purpose of the institution or the work in connection with the business was mainly carried on by the beneficiaries of the institution. Section 11(1)(a) of the 1961 Act contains an identical provision.
 Section 2(15) of the 1961 Act defines "charitable purpose" to include, inter alia, the advancement of any other object of general public utility not involving the carrying on of any activity for profit.
 In respect of certain previous assessment years (1952-53 to 1956-57) of the assessee the Kerala High Court in Dharmodayan Co v. C.I.T. Kerala (45 ITR 478) held that since the business of kuries (chit funds) was held by the assessee under a trust for religious or charitable purposes, it could not be said that the business was conducted "on behalf of" the religious or charitable institution and that the income from kuries in so far as it was applied for religious or charitable purposes was exempt from tax. Revenue filed an appeal in this Court but withdrew it with the result the High Court's decision became final.
 After the 1961 Act came into force, for the assessment year 1968-69, the Income Tax Officer declined to grant exemption in respect of income derived by the assessee from its kurie business. On appeal, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner held that despite the amendment introduced in s. 2(15) of the 1961 Act the earlier decision in Dharmodayan held good and that the assesses was entitled to claim exemption in regard to its income from kuries. This was upheld by the Tribunal.
 Two questions, whether the Tribunal was correct in holding (1) that the income derived by the assessee was exempt under s. 11(1)(a) of the 1961 Act and (2) that setting apart of reserves under art. 39 of the assessee's articles of association did not vitiate the charitable purpose of the institution, which were referred to the High Court were answered in favour of the assessee.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended by the Revenue that by reason of the words "not involving the carrying on any activity for profit" occurring in s. 2(15) of the 1961 Act the decision of the High Court in Dharmodayan was no longer good law and therefore that decision could not be said to go-tern the question whether income received by the assessee by conducting kuries was exempt from taxation.
 320 Dismissing the appeals, 
HELD: Income derived by the assessee from kuries is exempt from taxation under s. 11(1)(a) of the 1961 Act.
 [328E] 1(a) The significant change brought about in this regard by the 1961 Act is that by reason of the definition in s. 2(15) income derived from a business which is carried on for the advancement of an object of general public utility has to be included in the assessee's total income, if it involves carrying on of any activity for profit, while, under the 1922 Act income derived from a business carried on for the purpose of advancing an object of general public utility was excludable from the assessee's income, even if such advancing involved the carrying on of an activity for profit, if the income was applied wholly for the purpose of the institution. [323G- H] (b) It will be erroneous to say that the decision in Dharmodayan has lost its validity by reason of the change in the definition of charitable purpose brought about by the 1961 Act. That ' judgment concludes the point that the kurie business is not conducted by the respondent in order to advance or for the purpose of advancing any object of general public utility. [324G] (c) The assumption in the appellant's argument that the respondent is running the kurie business as a matter of advancement of an object of general public utility or for that purpose is plainly contrary to the finding of the High Court in Dharmodayan that the kurie "business itself is held under a trust for religious or charitable purposes". It is a necessary implication of this finding that the business activity was not undertaken by the respondent in order to advance any object of general public utility. The appeal to This Court against that decision was withdrawn by the Revenue. Though the relevant legislative provision has undergone a change the nature of the respondent's activity remains what it was when the High Court gave its judgment in Dharmodayan. [324D-F] C.I.T. v. P. Krishna Warrier 53 ITR 176 explained.
 East India Industries (Madras) (P) Ltd. v. C.I.T. 65 ITR 611 and C.I.T. v. P. Krishna Warrier, 84 ITR 119 referred to Sole Trustee, Lok Shikshana Trust v. C.I.T. 101 ITR 234 distinguished.
 (d) Although in the Indian Chamber of Commerce v. C.I.T.
 (101 ITR 796) attention of this Court was specifically drawn to the judgment under appeal (reported in 94 ITR 113) and this Court criticized that decision as applying the wrong test, it cannot be said that decision has been overruled as stated in the headstand because the facts of the instant case were not before this Court. Further, it is evident from this decision that the test applied by the High Court was held to be wrong on the assumption that the case-fell under the last clause of s. 2(15) which was the only part of that clause relevant for deciding the Indian Chamber of Commerce case. From the fact that the word industry occurring in the sentence "the assessee-company was conducting a profitable business of running chit funds and its memorandum of association had as one of its objects 'to do the needful for the promotion of charity, education and industry' has been italicised in that case it is plain that the Court assumed that the assessee was engaged in running an industry. On the facts of this case it is impossible to hold that the last clause of s. 2(15) has any application.
 Moreover, in the light of the activities of the respondent spread over the past several years, no importance can be attached to cl. 39 of the Articles of Association. It is, therefore, difficult to read the decision in Indian Chamber of Commerce as overruling the judgment under appeal. The Court was not even apprised in that case that this appeal was pending against the decision of the High Court. [327B, 328A-C] 2(a) The mere power under art. 39 of the Articles of Association to set apart reserves will not, without more, vitiate the charitable nature of the institution. The only activity in which the respondent is engaged over the years is the conduct of kuries. The respondent had never engaged itself in any industry or in any other activity of public interest. [328F] (b) If and when the respondent sets apart the entire profits or a substantive part of it for reserves the Department will have ample powers and opportunity 321 to deny the exemption to it. The High Court has found that the respondent has spent its income for charitable purposes.
