 The requirement under sub-section (1) of section 479A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, of giving the witness an opportunity of being heard after the recording of the necessary findings and before making the complaint is not mandatory. That step is required to be taken only if the court thinks fit-a matter left to the discretion of the trial court. The prosecution of the appellant is therefore not vitiated because such an opportunity was not given.
 [594F-G] Dr. B. K. Pal Chaudhry v. The State of Assam, [1960] 1 S.C.R. 945 and Dr. Kuppa Goundan and Anr. v. M.S.P. Rajesh, [1966] Supp S.C.R. 373, distinguished.
 Rukmani Bai v. G. R. Govindaswamy Chetty, [1963] M.L.J. 421 and Re: Javvaji Uthanna, A.I.R. 1964 A.P. 368, referred to.
 [In the instant case adequate opportunity was given to the appellant, before the findings were recorded to show cause why he should not be prosecuted. Therefore the Court did not find it necessary to express any opinion as to the correctness of the observations of the Madras and Andhra Pradesh High Courts in Rukmani Bai v. Govindaswamy Chetty and In re Javvaji Uthanna that even though sub-section (1) does not mandatorily require that any opportunity should be given to the person complained against there is no reason why the principle of audi alteram partem should not apply.] [595D-E]
