 A public trust to manage the Sawai Man Singh II Museum had been created by the late Maharaja of Jaipur. After the Maharaja's death, his son Sawai Bhawani Singh became the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, which included his step- mother. Disputes and differences regarding the conduct and the management of the Trust arose between the trustees. In this letter-petition, in the nature of public interest litigation under article 32 of the Constitution, the petitioners, after stating that the Chairman and his supporters were acting in a manner totally detrimental to the interests of the Trust and public interest, have sought the intervention of the Court in the matter and prayed for the appointment of a knowledgeable person of integrity as the Chairman of the Trust.
 Dismissing the petition, it was, 
HELD: (I) This litigation is between the members of the erstwhile Raj family to settle their own scores. It is not pro bono publico, for the benefit of the public, but the benefit of a particular section of people for their personal rights. Hence, the assertion that this dispute is a public interest dispute is, wrong. [86A-B] (2) It is true that life in its expanded horizons today includes all that gives meaning to a man's life including his tradition, culture and heritage and protection of that heritage in its full measure would certainly come within the encompass of an expanded concept of Article 21 of the Constitution. Yet, when one seeks relief for breach of Article 21, one must confine oneself to some direct, overt and tangible act which threatens the fullness of his PG NO 870 PG NO 871 life or the lives of others in the community. In the instant case, the allegations are too vague too indirect and too tenuous to threaten the quality of life of people at large or any section of the people. [876C-D] (3) Public interest litigation is an instrument for the administration of justice to be used properly in proper cases. Public interest litigation does not mean settling disputes between individual parties. [876G] [Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India, [1983] INSC 206; [1984] 2 SCR 67, referred to.
 (4) It is imperative to lay down clear guidelines and outline the correct parameters for entertaining such petitions. It is only when courts are apprised of gross violation of fundamental rights by a group or a class action or when basis human rights are invaded or when there are complaints of such acts as shock the, judicial conscience, that the courts, especially this Court, should leave aside procedural shackles and hear such petitions and extend its jurisdiction under all available provisions for remedying the hardships and miseries of the needy, the underdog and the neglected. [877F-G] [Sachidanand Pandey & Anr. y. State of West Bengal & Ors., [l987] 2 SCC 295 at 331, referred to.] 
 5. The instant petition, does not seek to advance any public right. It seeks to exploit private grievances. The petition under Article 32 of the Constitution is not maintainable. On the facts as appearing from the pleadings it cannot be predicted that there is any breach of any fundamental rights of the petitioners. In view of the nature of the allegations it is a case which is more amenable to be proceeded under sections 37 & 38 of the Rajasthan Public Trust Act, 1959, which correspond to Sections 91 & 92 of the Code of Civil Procedure. [875G-H]
