 The Nizam of Hyderabad granted a jagir to his prime minister. The successor of the jagirdar granted an island in one of the villages, comprising a hillock of granite, to the predecessor-in-interest of the respondent. The area covered by the grant was acquired by the State Government for purposes of an irrigation project.
 On the question whether the respondent was entitled to sub- soil rights, and as a consequence, became entitled to compensation for the granite and quarries as minerals, 
HELD:It was for the respondent to establish his claim to minerals or quarry rights by putting forward proof of the grant thereof by the Nizam to the jagirdar and by the jagirdar to his predecessor. But assuming that the Nizam conferred the right on the jagirdar, the patta granted by the jagirdar and the connected documents showed that what was in contemplation of the jagirdar and his grantee at the time of the grant, was either the cultivation of the land or the grazing of cattle on it. Nobody at that time had any thought or idea of the land being put to any other use or any mining or quarrying rights being exercised therein.
 When the grantor was careful to exclude even the fruit bearing trees, it would be wrong to hold that he must have parted with the sub-soil rights by implication.
 Therefore,the right to minerals was not granted to the respondent's predecessor.[287B-C; 289B; 292D-E] What has to beconsidered in each case is the purpose for which the lands are leased oran interest created therein with all the clauses which throw any light on the question as to whether the grantor purported to include his rights to the sub-soil in the grant when there was no express mention of it. If the grant shows that the purpose of the grant was to allow the user of the surface only it would be wrong to presume that subsoil rights were also covered thereby.
 [292C-D] The test of what is a mineral is, what at the date of the instrument, the word meant in the vernacular of the mining world, the commercial world, and among landowners; and in case of conflict that meaning must prevail over the purely scientific meaning. Since granite is a mineral according to this test the respondent had no right to the granite or quarries. [293B-C] State of Andhra Pradesh v.
