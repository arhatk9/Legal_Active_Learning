 In 1958, the services of respondents I and 4 to 14, who were permanent employees of the State Government holding posts of foremen. were provisionally placed at the disposal of the State Electricity Board (appellant), constituted under the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, The Electricity Board was directed to frame its own grades and service condi(.ions, but this was never done. In 1960, the first respondent was taken on deputation from the Board and posted to the P.W.D.
 of the State Govvernment retaining his lien in the Electricity Board. The first respondent remained with the P.W.D. for about three years, and during that time, the Electricity Board promoted respondents 4 to 14 as Assistant Engineers under the Electricity Board. In 1963, the State Government directed the reversion of the first respondent to his parent department, namely. the Electricity Board; and the latter posted him as one of its foremen. Zen big request that he was also entitled to be considered for pro- motion as Assistant Engineer was rejected, he moved the High Court under Arts. 226 and 227 of the Constitution the ground that there was a violation of Arts. 14 and 16; and the High Court allowed the petition.
 In appeal to this Court, the appellant-Board contended that : (1) the first respondent never became its permanent servant and so could not claim to be considered along with respondents 4 to 14 ; and (2) the appellant-Board could not be held to be "State" as defined in Art. 12 and consequently no direction could be issued to it under Art. 226 and 227.
 
HELD : (1) The words "deputation" and "reversion" used in the orders of the State Government and the Electricity Board implied that the first respondent was being sent back to his parent department, namely, the Electricity Board, from the P.W.D. where he had been sent on deputation. Moreover in the case of respondents 4 to 14 who were identically placed with the first respondent, there was nothing to show that after their services were provisionally placed at the disposal of the Board, any order was passed permanently transferring them to the Board, and yet they were treated as permanent employees of the Board. Thus, both the Government and the Board, in dealing with respondent 1 and 4 to 14, treated them as it they had become employees of the Board.
 Since the Board did not frame any new grades or service conditions, these respondents continued to be governed by identical rules, namely, the old grades and service con- ditions applicable to them when they were servants of the State Government and therefore, the first respondent was entitled to be considered for promotion under the Board on the basis of equality with respondents 4 to 14. [381E-F; 382D-H] 378 (2)(Per Subba Rao, C.J., Shelat, Bhargava and Mitter JJ.):
 The appellant-Board is "other authority" within the meaning of Art. 12 and therefore, is "State" to which appropriate directions could be given under Arts. 226 and 227. [386D] The expression "other authority" is wide enough to include within it every authority created by a statute, on which powers are conferred to carry out governmental or quasi- governmental functions and functioning within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India.
 It is not at all material that some, of the powers conferred may be for the purpose of carrying on commercial activities, because, under Arts. 19(1) (g) and 298 even the State is empowered to carry on any trade or business. In interpreting the expression "other authority" the principle of ejusdem generis should not be applied, because, for the application of that rule, there must be distinct genus or category running through the bodies previously named. The bodies specially named in Art. 12 are the Executive Government of the Union and the States, the Legislatures of the Union and the States and local authorities. There is no common genus running through these named bodies, nor could the bodies be placed in one single category on any rational basis. [384C-D, G-N, 385-A, C-D; 386B-C] Ujjamnbai v.

 (Per Shah, J.) : Every constitutional or, statutory authority on whom powers are conferred by law is not "other authority" within the meaning of Art. 12. It is only those authorities which are invested with sovereign power, that is, power to take rules or regulations and to administer or enforce them to the detriment of citizens and others that fall within the definition of "State" in Art. 12 : but constitutional or statutory bodies invested with power but not sharing the sovereign power of the State are not "State" within the meaning of that Article. [389B-C, G-H] Since, under Art. 13, it is only the State which is prohibited from taking away or abridging fundamental -rights in considering whether a statutory or constitutional body is "other authority" within the meaning of Art. 12, it would be necessary to consider not only whether against that authority, fundamental rights in terms absolute are intended to be enforced, but also whether it was intended by the Constitution-makers that the authority was invested with the sovereign power to impose restrictions on fundamental rights. [387F] The State Electricity Board has the power of promoting coordinated development, generation supply and distribution of electricity and for that purpose is invested by the State with extensive powers of control over electricity undertakings, The power to make rule and regulations and to administer the Act is in substance the sovereign power of the State delegated to the Board. Since the Board is an authority invested by the Statute with sovereign powers of the State it is "other authority" within the meaning of Art.
