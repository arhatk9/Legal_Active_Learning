 The appellant landlord filed a suit against the respondent tenant claiming a decree for eviction on grounds of non- payment of rent and for bonafide personal necessity in accordance with the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947. The respondent filed a written statement. An exparte decree was passed which was set aside on the application of the respondent. Ultimately, the suit was disposed of on the compromise between the parties.
 According to the terms of the compromise the tenant was to hand over possession of the suit premises to the landlord within a period of 3 years. The tenant did not vacate on the expiry of the period and contested the execution on the ground that the decree was a nullity. The Trial Court held that the decree was a nullity. That was upset by the Appellate Court. The High Court accepted the Revision Application filed by the tenant and held that the compromise decree, is a nullity and. therefore, cannot be executed.
 The High Court held that the order passed by the Court did not disclose any satisfaction recorded by the Court about the existence of one or more grounds of eviction under the Act, and in the compromise pursis also there is no admission on the part of the tenant express or implied.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : 1. It has been laid down by the Court in the case of Nagindas Ramdas that existence of any of the statutory grounds is a sine quo non to the exercise of jurisdiction by the Rent Court in order to enable it to make a decree for eviction. It was also laid down that if at the time of passing of the decree there was some material before the Court on the basis of which the Court could be prima facie satisfied about the existence of a statutory ground for eviction it would be presumed that the court was so satisfied and the decree for eviction though apparently passed on the basis of a compromise would be valid. This Court also held that such material might take the shape of either of evidence recorded or produced or express or implied admission made in the compromise agreement itself.
 In Roshanlal's case this Court field that the Court can pass a decree on the basis of a compromise and that in such a situation the only thing to be seen is whether the compromise is in violation of the requirements of law. [389 C-G] Nagindas Ramdas v. Dalpatram Ichharam @ Brijram and Ors., [1973] INSC 227; [1974] 2 S.C.R. 544 and Roshan Lal v. Madan Lal, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 878, relied on.
 
2. There is abundant intrinsic material in the compromise itself to indicate that the decree passed upon its basis was not in violation of the Act but was in accordance With it.
 If there is no dispute about the standard rent or no bonafide dispute or the dispute raised is a mere pretence of it a decree can follow under section 12(3)(b) of the Act in a suit in which rent is not due for 6 months of more but is due even for lesser period. The tenant will get the protection against eviction in such a case only if he pays or tenders in court on the first date of hearing of the suit or such other date as the Court may fix. In the instant case, the High Court was not right that on the face 3 88 of the compromise pursis or the order passed thereon there was no material to show that the tenant had either expressly or impliedly suffered a decree for eviction as being liable to be evicted in accordance with section 12(3) (b). While recording the compromise under order 23 rule 3 of the Civil Procedure Code, it is not necessary for the Court to say in express terms in the order that it was satisfied that the compromise was a lawful one. It will be presumed to have done so unless the contrary is shown. But that apart, on examination of the plaint which certainly should be looked into and which must have been in the records of the Court at the time of passing of the compromise decree, it would be found that landlords had claimed arrears of rent for two months at the rate of Rs. 17/- per month and mesne profits also for one month upto the date of the suit at the same rate. They had also claimed electricity charges @ Rs. 2/- per month. In the compromise petition the same amount of rent, mesne profit and electric charges are admitted by the tenants to be payable to the landlords. There is nothing to indicate that any genuine dispute was raised by the tenant in regard to the standard rent or the electric charges nor is there anything to show that he had ever filed a Petition under section 11 of the Act or any other provision of law for fixation of standard rent. Nor was he able to show that the Court at his request had ever fixed any other date for payment of the said amount. In view of his admission in the compromise deed to pay the rent as demanded it is manifest that there was no dispute in the case in regard to the standard rent. The facts clearly show that the tenant had incurred liability to be evicted under the said provisions of law and the compromise decree was passed on the tenant's impliedly admitting such liability.
