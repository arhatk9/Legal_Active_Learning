 As a result of proceedings for consolidation of holdings in certain villages in Punjab, some lands had been taken away from the proprietors, reserved and given over to the village panchayats or allotted to non-proprietors, under powers derived from various enactments, namely, the East Punjab Holdings (Consolidation and Prevention of Fragmentation) Act (L of 1948) as amended by Punjab Act (27 of 1960), the Punjab Gram Panchayat Act (4 of 1953) and the Punjab Village Common Lands (Regulation) Act (1 of 1954). Under s. 7 of the last Act the proprietors were not entitled to any compensation. They challenged by writ petitions the validity of the proceedings and the enactments under which the proprietor's interest was acquired without compensation as being in breach of Arts. 19(1)(f) and 31 of the Constitution. The High Court dismissed them following its own full bench decision in Jagat Singh v. Punjab State, (1962) P.L.R. 241. In appeals to the Supreme Court, it was contended that : (i) The Full Bench decision was not correct in view of the decision in K. K. Kochuni v. State of Madras [1960] 3 S.C.R. 887, and (ii) the Amending Act (27 of 1960) and the Regulation Act (1 of 1954) were ultra vires, HELD : (i) The Full Bench decision was right. [94C-D].
 The view taken by this Court has always been in favour of giving a large and liberal meaning to the terms "estate", "rights in an estate" and "extinguishment and modification" of such right-, in Art. 31-A of the Constitution of India, and also, to give a wide meaning to the expression agrarian reform". [93C-D; 94A-B].
 The enactments referred to above and the Punjab Security of Land Tenures Act (10 of 1953) are all part of a general scheme of agrarian reforms and the modification of rights envisaged by them had the protection of Art. 31-A. [95B-C].
 Case law considered.
 The Kochuni case [1960] 3 S.C.R. 887 did not involve any agrarian reform. It considered a bare transfer of the rights of the sthanee to the tarwad without alteration of the tenure and without any pretence of agrarian reform.
 That was a special case and could not be applied to cases where the general scheme of legislation was definitely agrarian reform. [94B-C].
 (ii) The changes proposed by the consolidation proceedings were included in the general scheme of planning of rural areas and the productive utilisation of vacant and waste lands. If agrarian reforms are to succeed, mere distribution of land to the landless is not enough. There must be a proper planning of rural economy and conditions.
 A scheme 83 which makes villages self-sufficient cannot, but be regarded as part of the larger reforms which consolidation of holdings, fixing of ceilings on lands, distribution of surplus lands and utilising of vacant and waste lands contemplate. [94 E-G; 95A-B].
 Quaere : What is the relevance and bearing of Art. 31-A as amended by the Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act, 1964 on the case. [90D-E].
