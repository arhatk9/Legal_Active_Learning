 % The appellant Sushil Kumar filed a Civil Suit against the wife of respondent No. 2 and obtained, on the strength of a copy of a deed of partnership, a temporary injunction restraining the wife and her husband from interfering with the possession of some property. Thereupon the respondent No. 2 lodged a report with the police against the appellants, alleging that the partnership deed was a forged one and, accordingly, the appellants had committed offences punishable under ss. 465, 468, 471, 474, 120B and 420, I.P.C. The magistrate framed charges against the appellants under ss. 465, 468, 120B and 420, I.P.C., but refrained from framing charges under ss. 471 & 474, I.P.C., on the ground that, in the absence of a complaint from the Civil Court. he could not take cognizance under those sections.
 On a revision preferred by the State, the Additional Sessions Judge upheld the order of the magistrate. The respondent No. 2 then moved the High Court under s. 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973, which reversed the decision, holding that as the document was not forged during the period it was in Court Custody, the bar of s.
 19(1)(b)(ii) Cr.P.C. was not attracted, and directed the magistrate to frame fresh charges. The appellants thereupon appealed to this Court by special leave against the order of the High Court.
 Dismissing the appeal and confirming the direction of the High Court but on a different ground, the Court, ^ 
 HELD: The original document, the deed of partnership, was not filed in the Civil Court and a temporary injunction was obtained on the strength of its copy. The reasoning given by the High Court in support of its judgment is not correct but that does not help the appellants. The Privy Council in Sanmukhsingh v. The King, [1949] L.R. 77 I.A. 7, observed that by production of a copy of the 182 allegedly forged document, it cannot be said that the document itself was given in evidence. This view accords with the plain grammatical meaning of the words and is also supported by the practical common sense. [184D, F-G] Since the document alleged to have been forged in the case was not produced in the Court, the provisions of section 195(1)(b)(ii) of the Code of Criminal Procedure have no application. The High Court's direction is confirmed but on a different ground, as indicated.[184G-H] Sanmukhsingh v. The King, [19491 L.R. 77 I.A. 7 and Budhu Ram v. State of Rajasthan,[1963]3 S.C.R. 376, referred to.
