 H, a conductor in the employ of the appellant undertaking was found in possession of some used tickets which was forbidden by Instruction No. 12 issued under Standing Order 
2. After enquiry into his conduct the charge was held proved and on the recommendation of the Enquiry Officer the Traffic Manager proposed to dismiss him. As this occurred during the pendency of an industrial dispute the undertaking by an application sought the approval of the Tribunal to the proposed order of dismissal under s. 33 (2) (b) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The Tribunal after hearing both the parties declined to accord its approval. It held that under Executive Instruction 12 no action could be taken because this Instruction was not made a part of the Standing Order and in the Standing Orders governing the conduct of employees there was no provision that the possession of used tickets amounted to misconduct meriting dismissal. The Tribunal also held that there was no satisfactory proof that one month's wages were actually paid or could be treated as having been tendered prior to the coming into operation of the order of dismissal on October 31, 1961, as required by the proviso to s. 33(2) (b) of the Act.
 
HELD : (i) The Tribunal took too narrow a view of the Standing Orders. By virtue of Standing Order 2 the Executive Instructions were issued and they are a code of principles and practice which every conductor has to follow rightly and invariably, and there is a warning that a breach of any Instruction would expose the conductor to disciplinary action as laid down in para 15(2) of the Regulations. Clause (in) of Standing Order 19 is sufficiently wide to cover a breach of Instructions issued under Standing Order 2. if was charged for breach of Executive Instruction 12 and this brought in the application of Standing Order 19(m) read with Standing Order 2 and paragraph 15(2) of the Regulation [1004 A-F] (ii) The particulars in the charge were sufficient for if to understand what he was charged with. The omission to mention the appropriate Standing Order or Regulations or sections of the Act did not vitiate the charge and the Tribunal was in error in holding it to be defective. [1004 G-H] Laxmi Devi Sugar Mills v. Nand Kishore, [1956] INSC 62; [1956] S.C.R. 916 and Lord Krishna Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Union of India. [1961] 1 S.C.R. 39 held inapplicable.
 (iii) The Tribunal was wrong in holding that there was no tender of wages. The proviso does not mean that the wages for one month should have been actually paid because in many cases the employer can only tender the amount before the dismissal but cannot force the employee to receive the payment before dismissal becomes effective. In the present case tender having been made within time there was no failure to comply with s. 33(2)(b) in this respect. [1003 D- E] 999
