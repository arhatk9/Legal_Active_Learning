 The respondent firm was assessed to sales-tax in 1953 but the order was set aside by the Financial Commissioner, because, the authority who made the assessment had no jurisdiction to do so. Fresh proceedings we're then started for assessment, but the respondent firm was dissolved before the proceedings were initiated. The Sales-tax Officer however however made the assessment. The turnover and tax were reduced on appeal and the Financial Commissioner, in revision, confirmed the appellate order. But the High Court on a -reference, held in favour of the respondent on the ground that a firm was a separate assessable entity under the Act and that there was no machinery provided under the Act for assessing a firm after its dissolution in respect of its turnover of business before the dissolution.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The High Court was right in holding that the assessment order on the dissolved firm could not be supported under the provisions of the Act. [464 E] Though under the partnership law a firm is not a legal entity, for the purposes of sales-tax, under the Act, it is a legal entity. If that be so, on dissolution, the firm ceases to be a legal entity. Thereafter, on principle, unless there is a statutory provision permitting the assessment of a dissolved firm, there is no longer any scope for assessing the firm which ceased to have, a legal existence. There is no provision in the Act, as it stood in 1953 expressly empowering the assessing authority to assess a dissolved firm in respect of its turnover before its dissolution. Neither s. 16 of the Act, nor r. 40 of the Rules made thereunder, provide for the assessment of a dissolved firm and the provisions of the Partnership Act have no bearing on the question of assessment. [461 G; 462 C-D, F, G, H] As in the present case, admittedly the firm was dissolved before the order of assessment was made, the said order was bad and it made no difference whether the proceeding was initiated before the dissolution or thereafter.
