 A strike during the pendency of an appeal would be an illegal strike under ss. 24 and 25 of the industrial Disputes (Appellate Tribunal) Act, 1950, even though the appeal is not a valid or competent one.
 The Bombay Industrial Relations Act, 1946, provided that a union may be registered as a "representative union" if it had a membership of not less than 15 per cent. of the total number of employees employed in any industry in any local area and if a union had a membership of less than 15 per cent and not less than 5 per cent. it can be registered only as "qualified union" :
 Held, that the above provisions did not infringe the fundamental right of the workers to freedom of speech and expression and to form associations or unions under article 19(1) (a) and (c) of the Constitution. The classification of unions as "representative and "qualified" according to the percentage of membership and giving the right to unions with a membership of not, less than 15 per cent. alone to represent the workers was a reasonable classification, and did not infringe the rule of equality before the law.
