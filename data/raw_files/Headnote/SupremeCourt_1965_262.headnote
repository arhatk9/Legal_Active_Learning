 The assessee company carried on the business of supplying electricity to various cities under licences from the Government. All the licences, except one for the supply of electricity to the city of Lahore, were terminated or disposed of by 1942. Soon after that, the Provincial Gov- ernment acquired the company's undertaking for the supply of electricity in Lahore and part of the value for the acquisition remained due to be paid to the company after the listing and valuation of the assets. The company also possessed considerable assets not appertaining to the Lahore Electric Supply Undertaking and all its funds were invested in securities and shares, the income from which was the sole income after September 5, 1946.
 In its assessment to income-tax for the years 1948-49 and 1949-50, the company claimed deduction of various amounts under s. 10(2)(xv) of the Income-tax Act, 1922, on the basis that it had been carrying on business in the accounting years concerned and the expenses had been incurred solely for the purpose of that business. Their contention was rejected by the Income-tax Officer and his stand was confirmed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner.
 However, the Tribunal held in appeal, that the question depended on what the intentions of the company were and on the facts took the view that the assessee company had not ceased to carry on business. The High Court, upon a reference, also answered the question in the assessee's favour. In arriving at this conclusion, the Tribunal and the High Court relied on, Inter alia, the following facts :- (1) the company did not sell its undertaking as a going concern;
 (2) it continued in possession of all assets of its undertakings other than those appertaining to the Lahore Electric Supply Undertaking;
 (3) it continued to hold deposits from consumers of electricity which had to be returned with interest;
 (4) it had no intention of going into liquidation;
 (5) the Directors had indicated in their report that they were considering purchasing some manufacturing concern to have an additional source of profit; etc.
 
HELD : (Per Sarkar and Mudholkar JJ.) None of the grounds set out by the Tribunal and the High Court led to the conclusion that the company intended to carry on business.
 The facts found made it clear that since 1942 the only business of the company was to work the Lahore Electric Supply licence. It stopped that business when the undertaking was taken over by the Government. Thereafter, during the accounting years concerned, namely 1947-48 and 1948-49 it bad not started any other business.

 (Per Bachawat, J., dissenting) (i) The Memorandum of the assessee company showed that one of its subsidiary objects was to invest in stocks, shares, securities, etc. and to sell, exchange or otherwise deal with them from time to time. The main business of generating and supplying electricity having stopped, the company invested its funds in deposits and stocks and shares. The activity of investment and getting a return for its capital was a part of its legitimate business activities [728 H-729 B] The Commissioners of Inland Revenue v.
