 The respondent filed an election petition, not only questioning the election of the appellant but also claiming the seat for himself, alleging infraction of the Conduct of Election Rules. Accordingly, he prayed for recounting of the votes and for declarations that he was duly elected and that the election of the appellant was void. The appellant in his counter affidavit denied all the allegations in the petition. However, the appellant did pot file any Recrimination application u/s 97 of the Act. The respondent filed an interlocutory application for directing a scrutiny and recounting of all the votes. The evidence was duly re- corded and the learned Judge of the High Court eventually passed an order on various grounds for recount of the votes.
 As a result of the recount, 'it was finally found that the majority of 127 votes by which the appellant had been declared elected was reduced to 75 votes.
 The respondent urged before the High Court that in a case where the election petitioner had applied not merely for setting aside the election of the successful candidate but also for declaring himself (the defeated candidate) as elected, it was the duty of the successful candidate to have filed a Recrimination application u/s 97 of the Act. The High Court took the view that in the absence of the Recrimination petition u/s 97 the appellant was not entitled to question any votes which might have been improperly received on behalf of the respondent. Consequently, the High Court found that leaving out of account votes improperly received on behalf of the respondent and taking into account only the votes which ought to have gone to the respondent which had been improperly rejected, the respondent had secured 96 votes more than the appellant and declared him elected.
 On appeal to this Court the appellant made the following submissions : (i) Sec. 97 has no application to a case where a prayer is for total count and. re-scrutiny; (ii) Sec. 97 has no application to the present case where the returned candidate let in or did not have to let in any evidence on any single vote all of which were produced and tendered in evidence by the election petitioner notwithstanding the respondent's protest; iii) Since no case has been made out in respect of individual votes and no finding given for inspecting individual votes, the petitioner would not be entitled to the benefit of the decision in Jabar Singh's case [(1964) 6 S.C.R. 54] and his right is only to a general recount or none at all; (iv) The respondent is estopped from questioning the result of the recount because of mutual concessions; (v) The present case is wholly different from the one in jabar Singh v. Genda Lal and the whole question should be reconsidered by a larger 1017 bench in view' of Justice Rajagopala Ayyangar's dissenting judgment; and (vi) The democratic process should be allowed to have full sway and no more technicality should be allowed to come in the way of. justice being done.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) The appellant did not comply with the requirements of Sec. 97 of the Act. The appellant bad not given notice u/s 97 within 14 days of his appearance to give evidence to prove that the election ,of the respondent would have been void if the respondent bad been the returned candidate nor had he given the security and further security referred to in sections 117 and 118 respectively nor was there any statement and particulars as required u/s 83 in case of an election petition. Even when an attempt was made to file a recrimination petition with a petition to excuse the delay, the other requisites of See. 97 were not complied with. [1032-G-1033B] (2)The respondent's prayer for recount was not a request for mere mechanical process of counting but for counting contemplated u/r. 56 with all its implications. The very grounds on the basis of which the recount was ordered by the learned Judge show that there was a possibility of mistakes having arisen under any one of the grounds set out in R. 56 (2) clauses (a) to (h) and it is to have them taken into account and tested correctly that the respondent wanted recount. When the respondent wants recount for the purpose of setting aside the appellant's election, he necessarily has got to have not merely the benefit of votes which. would have originally gone to him but which bad been wrongly given to the appellant but also all votes which bad been cast in his favour but had been rejected wrongly on one or the other grounds mentioned in R, 56(2) clauses (a) to (b). it was necessary for the purpose of respondent's case not merely that votes Which were held invalid should be re-scrutinised but also votes which had been held to have been cast in favour of the appellant. The improper reception or rejection, therefore, would include not merely cases where a voter appears before the Presiding Officer at the time of the polling and his vote is received where it should not have been received and his vote rejected where it should not have been rejected. The improper rejection or reception contemplated u/s lOO (i)(d)(iii) would include mistakes or wrong judgments made by the Returning Officer while counting and exercising his powers under R. 56(2) clauses (a) to (h).
 [1035D-H] The appellant knew not only that the respondent wanted his election to be set aside but also that he wanted himself declared elected. He should have, therefore, filed a recrimination petition in proper compliance with Sec. 97.
 The election petition is not an action in law or a suit in equity but one under the provisions of the. statute which has specifically created that right. If a relief provided under the statute can be obtained only by following a certain procedure laid down therein for that purpose, that procedure must be followed if the relief is to be obtained.
 It is not a question of mere pleading. it is a question of jurisdiction. The Election Tribunal had no jurisdiction to go into the question whether. any wrong votes had been counted 'in favour of the election petitioner, who had claimed the seat for himself. unless the appellant had filed a recrimination petition u/s 97. [1037D] 797Sup.Cl/73 1018 (3) It was not necessary to lead evidence in respect of any individual vote about the improper reception or improper rejection as the decision on that question had been given mostly on concessions by both the parties and in disputed cases by the Judge himself scrutinising the votes. There is no such thing, as a general recount and there is no authority in law for suggesting that all that the respondent could have asked for was either a general recount or none at all. [1037F] (4) No question of estoppel arises, where the law provides that no evidence can be given about the improper reception of votes in favour of the defeated candidate who had claimed a seat for himself unless the successful candidate had complied with Sec. 97. Concession is akin to admission and the use of such an admission would be evidence. What is barred under the proviso to Sec. 97 is the giving of evidence by the appellant. The evidence furnished by the valid as well as invalid votes in favour of both the petitioner and the respondent was not admissible because of the appellant's failure to comply with the provisions of Sec. 97. [1038B] (5) There is no justification for ordering that the case should be heard by a larger bench for reconsideration of the decision in Jabar Singh's case.
 (6)Courts in general are averse to allow justice to be defeated by a mere technicality. But in deciding an election petition, the High Court is merely a Tribunal deciding the election dispute. Its powers are wholly the creature of the statute under which it is conferred the power to hear the election petition. The election petition 'is not an action at law or a suit in equity but is a purely statutory proceeding unknown to the common law and the Court possess no common law power. Though the election of a successful candidate is not to be lightly interfered with one of the essentials of that law is also to safeguard the purity of the election process and also to see that people do not get elected by flagrant breaches of that law or by corrupt practice.
