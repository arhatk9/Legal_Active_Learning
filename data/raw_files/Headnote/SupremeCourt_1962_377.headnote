 The petitioner was challenged in a dacoity case but was released is there was no evidence against him. The police opened a history sheet against him. He was put under sur- veillance -is defined in Regulation 236 of the U. P. Police Regulations. Surveillance involves secret picketing of the house or approaches to the houses of the suspects, domiciliary visits at night, periodical enquiries by officers not below the rank of Sub-Inspector into repute, habits, association, income, expenses and occupation, the reporting by constables and chaukidars of movements and absences from home, the verification of movements and absences by means of inquiry slips and the collection and record on a history sheet of all information bearing on conduct.
 The petitioner filed a writ petition under Art. 32 in which he challenged the constitutional validity of Chapter XX of U. P. Police Regulations, in which Regulation 236 also occurs.
 The defence of the respondent was that the impugned Regulations did not constitute an infringement of any of the freedoms Guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution, and even if they were, they had been framed in the interests of the General public and public order and to enable the police to discharge its ditty in a more efficient manner, and hence were reasonable restrictions on that freedom.
 Held, (Subba Rao and Shah JJ., dissenting) that out of the five kinds of surveillance referred to in Regulation 236, the part dealing with domiciliary visits was violative of Art. 21 333 of the Constitution and as there was no law on which the same could be justified it must be struck down as unconstitutional, and the petitioner was entitled to a writ of mandamus directing the respondent not to continue domiciliary visits. The other matters constituting surveillance were not unconstitutional. The secret picketing of the houses of tile suspects could not in any material or palpable form affect either the right on the part of the suspect to move freely' or to deprive him of his 'Personal liberty' within the meaning of Art. 21. In dealing with a fundamental right such as the right to free movement or personal liberty, that only can constitute an infringement which is both direct as well as tangible, and it could not be that under these freedoms the Constitution- makers intended to protect or protected mere personal sensitiveness, 'The term 'picketing' has been used in the Regulation not in the sense of offering resistance to the visitor-physical or otherwise-or even dissuading him from entering the house of the suspect but merely of watching and keeping- a record of the visitors. Clauses (c), (d) and (e) of Regulation 236 dealt with the details of the shadowing of the history-sheeters for the purpose of having a record of their movements arid activities, and the obtaining of information relating to persons with whom they came into contact with a view to ascertain the nature of their activities, arid did not infringe any fundamental right of the petitioner. The freedom guaranteed by Art. 19 (1) (d) was not infringed by a watch being kept over the movements of the suspect. Art. 21 was also not applicable. The suspect had the liberty to answer or not to answer the question put to him by the police,and no Law provided for any civil or criminal liability if the suspect refused to answer a question or remained silent. The right of privacy is not a guaranteed right under our Constitution, arid therefore the attempt to ascertain the movements of an individual is merely a manner in which privacy is invaded and is not an infringement of a fundamental right guaranteed in Part III.
 The term 'personal liberty' is used in Art. 21 as a compendious term to include within itself all the varieties of rights which go to make up the 'personal liberties' of man other than those dealt with in the several clauses of Art. 19 (I ). While Art. 19 (1) deals with particular species or attributes 'of that freedom, 'personal liberty' in Art. 21 takes in and comprises the residue. The word "life" in Art. 21 means not merely the right to the continuance of a person's animal existence, but a right to the possession of each of his organsarms, legs, etc.
 The contention of the respondent that if an act of the police involved a trespass to property, that could give rise to a 334 claim in tort as that action was not authorised by law, and the remedy of the petitioner was a claim for damages and not a petition under Art. 32, was without any substance and wholly irrelevant for considering whether such action was -in invasion of a fundamental right. It is wholly erroneous to assume that before the jurisdiction of this Court uinder Art. 32 can be invoked, the applicant must either establish that he has no other remedy adequate or otherwise or that he has exhausted such remedies as the law affords and has yet not obtained pro. per redress, for when once it is proved to the satisfaction of this Court that by State action the fundamental right of the petitioner tinder Art. 32 has been infringed, it is not only the right but the duty of this Court to afford relief to him by passing appropriate orders in this behalf.
 Per Subba Rao and Shah, JJ.-The petitioner was a class A history-sheeter and hence was subject to the entire field of surveillance. Policeman were posted near his house to watch his movements and those of his friends and associates who went to his house. They entered his house in the night and woke him up to ascertain whether he was in the house and thereby disturbed his sleep and rest. The officials, not below the rank of Sub-Inspector, made inquiries from others as regards his habits, associations, income, -expenses and occupations. They got information from others as regards his entire way of life. The constables and chaukidars traced his movements, shadowed him and made reports to their superiors. It was conceded that there was no law which imposed restrictions on bad characters.
 Held, that the whole of Regulation 236 is unconstitutional and not only cl. (b). The attempt to dissect the act of surveillance into its various ramifications is not realistic. Clauses (a) to (f) of Regulation 236 are the measures adopted for the purpose of supervision or close observation of tile movements of the petitioner and are therefore parts of surveillance.
 Both Arts. 19(1) and 21 deal with two distinct and independent fundamental rights. The expression "personal liberty" is a comprehensive one and the right to move freely is an attribute of personal liberty. But it is not correct to say that freedom to move freely is carved out of personal liberty and therefore the expression "Personal liberty" in Art. 21 excludes that attribute. No doubt, these fundamental rights overlap each other but the question of one being carved 335 out of the other does not arise. The fundamental rights of life and personal liberty have many attributes and some of them are found in Art. 19. The State must satisfy that both the fundamental rights are not infringed by showing that there is a law within the meaning of Art. 21 and that it does amount to a reasonable restriction within the meaning of Art. 19(2) of the Constitution.
 The right of personal liberty in Art. 21 implies a right of an individual to be free from restrictions or encroachments on his person, whether those restrictions or encroachments are directly imposed or indirectly brought about by calculated measures. If so understood, all the acts of surveillance under Regulation 236 infringe the fundamental right of the petitioner under Art. 21 of the Constitution.
 As regards the fundamental rights guaranteed by Art. 19(1) (d), mere movement unobstructed by physical restritions cannot in itself be the object of a person's travel. A person travels ordinarily in quest of some objective. He goes to a place to enjoy, to do business, to meet friends, to have secret and intimate consultations with other and to do many other such things. If a man is shadowed, his movements are obviously constricted. He can move physically but it can only be a movement of an automation. A movement under the scrutinising gaze of a policeman cannot be described as a free movement. The whole country is his jail. The freedom of movement in Art. 19(1)(d) must, therefore, be a movement in a free country, i.e.. in a country where lie can do whatever lie likes, speak to whomsoever he wants, meet people of his choice without any apprehension, subject of course to the law of social control. The petitioner under the shadow of surveillance is certainly deprived of this freedom. He can move physically, but be cannot do so freely, for all his activities are watched and the shroud of surveillance cast upon him perforce engenders inhibitions in him, and he cannot act freely as he would like to do. Hence, the entire Regulation 236 offends Art. 19(1) (d) of the Constitution.
 Held, also that petitioner's freedom under Art. 19(1) (a) of the Constitution was also infringed. It was impossible for a person in the position of the petitioner to express his real and intimate thoughts to the visitor as fully as he would like to do.
