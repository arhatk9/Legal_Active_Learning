 The appellant challenged the election of Respondent No. 1 to the Parliament at the, 1971 General Election on the ground that there were irregularities in the counting of votes.
 She asked for inspection of the ballot papers. The High Court disallowed the application for inspection and dismissed the election petition. in appeal under s. 116-A of the Representation of the People Act .1951, the appellant submitted (i) that the evidence of the witnesses examined by her proved the several illegalities committed in the counting of the ballot papers and (ii) that, in any event, the appellant's application for inspection should have been allowed.
 
HELD : (i) The High Court had taken into consideration all the material circumstances and had appreciated the evidence from the correct perspective. It has been the consistent practice of this Court not to interfere with findings on questions of fact unless there is some grave or palpable error in the appreciation of the evidence on the basis of which the findings were arrived at. [922 E] Dr. Jagjit Singh v. Giani Kartar Singh and Others, A.I.R.
 1966 S.C. 773. referred to.
 (ii) The High Court was justified in rejecting the application for inspection. The allegations in the election petition were vague- and the petition did not contain an adequate statement of the matrial facts. The evidence adduced by the appellant to prove the allegations was found unreliable. No definite particulars were also given in the application for inspection as to the illegalities alleged to have been committed in the counting of the ballot papers. A recount will not be granted as a matter of right but only on the basis of evidence of good grounds for believing that there has been a mistake in the counting. It has to be decided in each case whether a prima facie ground has been made out for ordering an inspection. [923 H] Ram Sewak Yadav v.
