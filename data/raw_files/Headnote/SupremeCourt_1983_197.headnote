 The petitioners who claimed to be carrying on the business as railway travel agents and rendering service to the travelling public in booking II class seats and berths in various passenger trains, challenged the validity of sec.
 114A of the Indian Railways Act, 1890 as being ultra-vires Art. 19(1) (g) of the Constitution and also the validity of the Railway Tourist Agent Rules, 1980 as ultra-vires the Act, and Art. 19(1) (g) of the Constitution on the ground that the Rules and the Act placed unreasonable restrictions on the petitioners' right to carry on their lawful business guaranteed by Art. 19(1) (g) of the Constitution. The petitioners argued that the conditions of eligibility prescribed in the Rules for obtaining status of authorised agents in their cumulative effect were impossible of compliance and were so deliberately drawn up as to help and encourage wealthy commercial heavy-weights to obtain recognition simultaneously denying the same opportunity to persons like the petitioners who cater to the needs of the common man. The petitioners urged that railways earn bulk of their revenue from second class travelling passengers and they were the most neglected and to such needy persons, petitioners were affording some respite from standing in queues for hours, to be jostled out by shutting the ticket window in their face. It was also stated that the court should be realistic in taking note of the prevailing corruption in booking railway tickets which would be further accentuated if every intending passenger had to stand in the queue for hours and return empty-handed.
 Dismissing the petitions, but directing the Railway Board to prepare an appropriate scheme, ^ 
 HELD: If a privilege is granted to do a certain thing, it would be open to prescribe conditions for enjoying the privilege. The railway administration alone should ordinarily sell its tickets. Sec. 66 of the Act enables the administration to appoint authorised agents for sale of tickets. These authorised agents must of necessity fulfil certain criteria. The criteria appear to 1017 have been devised with an eye on extending facility to foreign travellers as well as the financial viability to secure against failure to pay for tickets sold by recognised agents. With this end in view, the conditions for minimum financial guarantee and having a Money Changer's licence and other allied conditions were prescribed. Intendment underlying the scheme of setting up authorised agents is not only to check sharp practices, curb fleecing of gullible passengers, but render efficient service. The Rules ensure fulfillment of the intendment underlying the impugned provisions. Viewed from this angle, the conditions are neither irrelevant nor arbitrary. It is stated by the respondents that as many as 17 agents have been given the status of authorised railways tourist agents in Delhi alone.
 This is not controverted. Therefore, the conditions are capable of being complied with. Failure or inability of some of the petitioners to comply with them would not be sufficient to reject them as unreasonable, arbitrary or irrelevant. The conditions are reasonable and are conducive to the objects sought to be achieved. [1022 A-E] Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. The International Airport Authority of India and Ors. [1979] INSC 111; [1979] 3 S.C.R. 1014 and M/s Kasturilal Lakshmi Reddy and Ors. v. State of Jammu and Kashmir and Anr., [1980] INSC 118; [1980] 4 S.C.C. 1 referred to.
 Sec. 114A of the Act merely prescribes punishment for unauthorisedly carrying on of business of procuring and supplying railway tickets. If sec. 66 envisages appointment of authorised agents obviously anything to the contrary would be contravention of sec. 66 and if it is made punishable under sec. 114A of the Act, the section would not be ultra vires the Constitution. [1023F] An agency has to be devised to cater to the needs of class II passengers, which can render service in this behalf. The agency has to be subjected to strict control and regulatory measures. May be, that the petitioners were abusing their activities and were guilty of some sharp practices. It cannot be said that all of them were of the same class, and it also should not be forgotten that their activities were facilitated by their counter parts in the booking-office. It can be safely said that to some extent, it was a joint venture. Therefore. merely dismissing these petitions would be further adding to the miseries of the travelling public. The Railway Board is therefore directed to prepare a scheme for recognising travel agents catering to the needs of the class II passengers with sufficient control over their activities and put the same before this Court within three months from today.
