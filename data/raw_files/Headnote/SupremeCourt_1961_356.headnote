As required by the University Statute XVI this fact was intimated to the University, but the appointment was not approved by the Syndicate as required by Art. 5, of the University Statute, In 1960 a new governing body resolved to appoint a new principal and decided that in the meantime the appellant was to continue to act till the new appointment was made. The governing body interviewed candidates including the appellant and by a resolution authorised its Chairman to make a final selection. The validity of the selection of the Principal was challenged by the appellant under Art. 226 of the Constitution by asking a write of mandamus to issue.
 ^ Held, that in order that mandamus may issue to compel the authorities to do something, it must be shown that the statute imposes a legal duty and the aggrieved party had a legal right under the statute to enforce its performance.
 In the instant case it has not been shown that there was any right in the appellant which can be enforced by a writ of mandamus.
