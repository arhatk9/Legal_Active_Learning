 Section 185 of the Cantonments Act, 1924, deals with the erection or re-erection of buildings on private lands and the Cantonment Board is given the power to direct the alteration or demolition of such a building within twelve months of the completion of erection or re-erection.
 Section 187 deals with constructions, which are projections or structures, encroaching on any street, drain, sewer or aqueduct. The Cantonment Board has the right to direct the demolition of such structures under s. 187, within the period of limitation for suits for possession of public streets or roads, that is, within 30 years from the date of encroachment.
 In the present case, the owner of a shop constructed a stone projection over the drain belonging to the Cantonment Board, after obtaining permission of the Cantonment Board, to facilitate approach to his shop. But, without obtaining the permission of the Cantonment Board, he put up a kiosk on the stone projection , which thus encroached upon the drain belonging to the Cantonment Board. The Board, eighteen years after the construction, directed the removal of the kiosk under S. 187.
 On the question whether s. 185 or s. 187 applied.
 HELD : The act complained of fell within the scope of s.
 187, because, the permission given by the Board to put up the stone projection did not confer on the owner of the shop any proprietary right over the drain but merely gave him a licence. As the action of the Board was within 30 years from the date of encroachment, the Board was competent to get the kiosk removed. [242 A; 243 A-B, E-F] [Whether the Board could take action even after the period of limitation of 30 years, left open]. [243 E]
