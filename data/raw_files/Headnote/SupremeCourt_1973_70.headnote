 Unit No. IV of the Hindustan Machine Tools, a public sector undertaking, was started at Kalamassery, in Kerala in 1963.
 Production and sale at this Unit started in 1965-66. In an industrial dispute referred to the National Tribunal at Calcutta the workmen of Unit No. IV claimed bonus for the years 19 3-64 to 1966-67 at the same rate as was paid in Units Nos. 1 and 11 and the Watch Factory of the H.M.T. at Bangalore. It was contended by the workmen of Unit No. IV that bonus was payable on the basis of the consclidated accounts of all the Units of the H.M.T. The National Tribunal held that bonus for the year 1963-64 was payable to the workmen of Unit No. IV at the same rate as in Units Nos.
 1 and 11 and the Watch Factory at Bangalore, but no bonus were payable to them for the years 1964-65 1966-67. In appeal to this Court by special leave it wits contended on behalf of the workmen of Unit No. IV (appellants) (i) that minimum bonus was payable to the appellants for the years 1964-65 to 1966-67, Under s., 10 of the Payment of Bonus Act, 1964 and in applying s. 10 the provisions of s. 16 could not be taken into consideration: (ii) that the H.M.T.
 had in fact maintained a consolidated account for all its Units and the claim of the management that separate profit and loss accounts were maintained was falsely made to defeat the rights of the workmen. The management, by leave of the Court challenged the finding of the Tribunal that bonus was payable to the appellants for the year 1963-64.
 
HELD : (i) The Tribunal was right in holding that the appellants were not entitled to any bonus for the year 1964- 65 to 1966-67.
 (a) Though section 10 has not been made subject to section 16 the two provisions will have to be read harmoniously so as to give effect to the purpose of the Act. Section 10 will apply to all those units, which are otherwise bound to pay bonus, irrespective of the fact whether the units make profit or loss. Section 16 has to be read as an exception to section 10.
 Section 16(1) gives a total exemption to the establishments in the circumstances mentioned therein from payment of bonus Which includes the minimum bonus also. When the section says that an employee of the establishment referred to in section 16 shall be entitled "to be paid bonus under this Act" only if the conditions mentioned therein are satisfied, it is idle to contend that, notwithstanding the exemption granted under section 16, the establishment referred to therein is sill bound to pay minimum bonus.
 If section 16(1) applies, section 10 will not entitle an employee to get even the minimum bonus under section 10.
 Therefore the contention of 851 the appellants that in any event, the minimum bonus under section 10' ought to have been awarded, could not be accepted.. [861 E-H] Alloy Steel Project v. The Workmen, 1971 3 S.C.R. 629, referred to.
 (b) In this case Units 1 and 11 alone have always been treated together ,for the computation of bonus. All the other three Units and the Watch Factory at Bangalore have each been treated separately and each of them has been having a separate balance-sheet and profit and loss account.
 This is the evidence on record which has been accepted by the Tribunal. There was no reason to differ from this finding. As Unit No. IV is a different establishment coming under the proviso and not falling under the exception to the proviso to section 3, the main part of section 3 will not assist the appellants. Therefore the exemption claimed under section 16(1) by the management for 1964-65 to, 1966- 67 in respect of Unit No. IV, has been correctly acceptedly the Tribunal, [863E-G] Delhi Cloth & General Mills Co. Ltd. v. Workmen, [1971] INSC 236; [1972] 1 S.C.R. 594, referred to.
 (ii) The Tribunal missed certain items of evidence and proceeded on the wrong assumption that profit bonus for the year 1963-64 was paid to the workmen of the Units on the basis of the Full Bench Formula. Hence the direction of the Tribunal that profit bonus was to be paid to Unit No. IV as was paid to the Units at Bangalore was clearly erroneous.
 Even otherwise the finding of the Tribunal-that all the Units Were treated as part of one establishment for purposes of bonus for the year 1963-64 was also erroneous. For the above reason,. the direction of the Tribunal for payment of bonus for the year 1963-64 to Unit No. IV must be set aside.
