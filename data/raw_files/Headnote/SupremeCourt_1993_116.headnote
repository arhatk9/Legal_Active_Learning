 The respondent-company obtained a Term Loan of Rs. 50,00,000 repayable within a period of seven years. The company included proportionate amount of the said Term Loan in its capital base and claimed the statutory 10% deduction in the calculation of its chargeable profits for the assessment year 1965-66. The Income-tax Officer rejected the claim of the respondent company on the ground that the repayment of the Term Loan was not during a period of not less than 7 years as contemplated in Rule 1(v) of the Second Schedule to the Companies (Profits) Surtax Act, 1964. On appeal, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner reversed the findings of the Income-tax Officer. Revenue preferred further appeal to the Tribunal which held that only the last instalment of Rs.
 16,00,000 satisfied the requirements of Rule 1(v); but in respect of the other four instalments aggregating to Rs.
 34,00,000 the Tribunal allowed the appeal of the Department and rejected the claim of the respondent-company. However at the instance of the respondent-company, Tribunal referred to the High Court the question whether the Tribunal was right in holding that only Rs. 16,00,000 out of the loan of Rs. 50,00,000 taken from Bank qualified for inclusion in the capital base under Rule 1(v). The High Court answered the question in the negative and in favour of the respondent- company. Against this, Revenue has come in appeal.
 Allowing the appeal , this court, 
HELD : 1. On a plain reading of the proviso to Rule 1(v) of Second Schedule to the Companies (Profits) Surtax Act, 1964, it is clear that in 188 order to claim benefit of the said provision the borrowed money has to be repaid during the period of more than seven years. The only interpretation which can be given to the expression "during a period of not less than seven years" is that the said period should go beyond seven years. The reasoning is simple. The period of seven years would not complete till the last 'minute' or even the last 'second' of the said period is counted. The period of 'not less than seven years" can only mean till after the completion of seven years. Therefore the repayment of borrowed amount during the period of seven years does not mean repayment 'during a period of not less than seven years". To claim the benefit under Rule 1 (v) of the Second Schedule to the Act the repayment of the borrowed money must be during a period which is more than seven years. [191D-G] 2. In the instant case, the entire term loan of Rs.
 50,00,000 taken from the bank does not qualify for inclusion in the capital base under Rule 1(v) of the Second Schedule to the Act but in view of the fact that the order of the Tribunal granting relief to the respondent-company to the extent of Rs. 16 lacs has not been challenged by the department, the Revenue shall be entitled to relief to the extent of Rs.34 lacs only as not qualified for inclusion in the capital base.
