 The dispute between the appellant and the respondents in relation to a contract were referred in accordance with their contract to arbitration. The award was filed in the District Court and notice of filing was given to the parties. The appellant applied to the Court under ss. 30 and 33 of the Indian Arbitration Act, 1940 to have the award set aside on the ground inter alia that it was unstamped.
 The District Judge ordered the document to be impounded and directed that an authenticated copy of the instrument be sent to the Collector together with a certificate in writing stating the receipt of the amount of duty and penalty.
 Against that order the appellant moved the High Court of Madhya Pradesh in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction.
 The High Court rejected the petition. By special leave appeal was filed in this Court. Relying on the difference in the phraseology between ss. 35 and 36 it was urged that an instrument which is not duly stamped may be admitted in evidence on payment of duty and penalty, but it cannot be acted upon because s. 35 operates as a bar to the admission in evidence of an instrument not duly stamped as well as to its being acted upon, and the Legislature has by s. 36 in the conditions set out therein removed the bar only against admission in evidence of the instrument.
 
HELD : The appellant's argument ignored the true import of s. 36. By that section an instrument once admitted in evidence shall not be called in question at any stage of the same suit or proceedings on the ground that it has not been duly stamped. Section 36 does not, prohibit a challenge against an instrument that it shall not be acted upon because it is not duly stamped, but on that account there is no bar against an instrument not duly 'stamped being acted upon after payment of the stamp duty and penalty according to the procedure prescribed by the Act. The doubt if any is resolved by the terms of s. 42(2) which enact in terms unmistakable, that every instrument endorsed by the Collector under s. 42(1) shall be admissible in evidence and may be acted upon as if it had been duly stamped. [740 C-E] The Stamp Act is a fiscal measure enacted to secure revenue for the State on certain classes of instruments : it is not enacted to arm a litigant with a weapon of technicality to meet the case of his opponents The stringent provisions of the Act are conceived in the interest of the revenue. Once that object is secured according to law, the party staking his claim on the instrument will not be defeated on the ground of the initial defect in the instrument. Viewed in that light the scheme is clear. Section 35 of the Stamp Act operates as a bar to an unstamped instrument being admitted in evidence or being acted upon, s. 40 provides the procedure for the instrument being impounded, sub-s. (1) of s. 42 provides for certifying that an instrument is duly stamped, and sub-s. (2) of s. 42 enacts the consequences resulting from such certification.
