 In March 1963, the appellant-State issued a memorandum raising the age of retirement of the State government servants from 55 to 58. The memorandum however, stated that no government servant would be entitled to the benefit of the increased age unless he has been permitted to continue in service after the age of 55 after the appointing authority is satisfied that he is efficient and physically fit. In the annexure to the memorandum the procedure for finding out the efficiency and physical fitness of the employee was laid down.
 In the case of respondents BR and K, the Board constituted to codsider their cases recommended the extension of their service, but the Minister in charge did not agree.
 In the case of respondents S and H, though the Deputy Commissioner recommended their continuance in service, the Commissioner, who was the appointing authority, was not satisfied that they were fit to be continued in service and hence they were not continued.
 In the case of respondent B K, the appointing authority was not ,satisfied with his work so as to extend his services.
 The five respondents filed petitions in the High Court. The High Court allowed the petition of BR, and following that judgment allowed the other petitions without doing into the facts and merits of each of those cases.
 Allowing the appeals to this Court, 
HELD : (1) The memorandum was a mere executive instruction and not a rule under Art. 309. It did not confer legal rights and no legal action can be founded on it [164C] (2)The petitioners did not get any right to continue in service beyond the age of 55 years as a result of the memorandum. A government servant has no such tight beyond the age of superannuation and if he is retained beyond that age it is only in exercise of the discretion ,of the Government. [165-D] Assam v. Premadhar-, [1970] INSC 124; [1971] 1 S.C.R. 503 and Kailash Chatidii v. Union of India, [1961] INSC 100; [1962] 1 S.C.R. 374 followed.
 (3)The fact that certain persons were found fit to be continued in service does not mean that others who were not so found fit had been discriminated against. Otherwise, the whole idea of continuing only efficient people in service after 55 years becomes meaningless. [165-G] 159 B. N. Mishra v. State, [1964] INSC 222; [1965] 1 S.C.R. 693, followed.
 Union of India v. J. N. Sinha, [1971] 82 I.T.R 561, referred to.
 (4)(a) It is true that in the case of respondents BR and K, the Screening Board recommended their continuance and there is no material to show why the Minister formed a different impression about their capacity. But once it is held that the memorandum is only an executive instruction which confers no right on any body, the judgment of the Minister cannot be questioned unless it could be shown that there was mala fides, or that Minister was guided by ulterior motives or that the decision contravenes some law.
 In the present case, there is no allegation of any mala fides on the part of any of the authorities. [161-H] (b)The High Court erred in merely following the judgment in the case of BR and ignoring the facts in the other cases.
 It was its duty to haveconsidered the merits of each case.
 [163G] (5)The certificate of leave to appeal to this Court was granted by the High Court without mentioning under what particular clause or sub-clause of Art. 133 the leave was granted. But in the present case, the fact that the leave obtained was not a proper one is not a ground for dismissing the appeal. A,,n objection to the certificate should be taken by the respondent at the earliest possible moment, and this Court is always prepared to consider the request by the appellant for grant of ,special leave at any stage if the circumstances of the case so requires. [168-B] When the High Court decided these cases, the judgment of this Court in Premadhar's case had not be delivered.
 Therefore, a substantial question of law arose for decision in these cases, and, if the respondents had raised the point about leave at the earliest possible time, this Court would have been prepared to consider an oral request for special leave by the appellant and for condonation of delay and would have directed the appellant to file appropriate petitions. But the #poin ' t was @aised after the appeals were taken up for hearing and hence, the appellant should not be made to suffer by the respondent's negligence. [168D] Sardar Bahadur S.
