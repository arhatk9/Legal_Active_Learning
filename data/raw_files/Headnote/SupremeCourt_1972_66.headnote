 The first appellant and another were conviced under s. 302 read with ss. 34, 120B and 201 of the Penal code and two other accusedwho were tried along with them were convicted under ss. 120B and 201.On the materials on record, the trial Court and the High Court foundthat the first appellant was responsible for the death of the deceased by poisoning.
 The doctor who performed the post mortem examination on the dead body gave evidence that the death of the deceased might have been a normal death. He ruled out an asphyxial death by morphine poisoning, hecause, accrording to him, there was no indication of any of the following characteristics which are to be found in cases of such a death: "(a) Right lung is full of blood and left is empty (b) Lividity of faces and fingers and nails (c) Congestion of the brain (d) Froth or blood froth in the trachea (e) Puncti form ecchymosis in the lungs with congestion of lung-,". He was declared hostile and another doctor examined by the prosecution also stated that he could not form any opinion about the Cause of death except that death had resulted due to respiratory failure.
 Confirming the conviction of the first appellant for murder and allowing.- the appeals in part, 
HELD : (i) The circumstances of the case and the evidence on record clearly point out that the first appellant was responsible for the death of the deceased and the death was caused by poisoning. When there is no eye witness of the occurrence, the court should not insist upon evidence regarding the exact manner in which the death was caused.
 Poison can be administered not only orally but also hypodermically or intervacularly with the help of a syringe.
 In the present case, the conduct of the first appellant in removing the dead. body immediately after the death of the deceased and the same remaining submerged in water for more than 24 hours prevented promt post mortem examination on the dead body. On the material, it can be said that there were some features like the congestion of both the lungs, the kidney, the liver and the spleen of the victim, which, according to the doctor were indicative of death by respiratory failure and the same could be caused by poisoning. Tile fact-that the heart of the deceased at the time of post mortem examination was found to be empty would not rule out asphyxial death as a result of poisoning. In many cases of asphyxial death both the sides of' the heart are found to be full if examined soon after death but after rigor mortis has set in, the heart is-found contracted and empty. The fact that no poison could be detected in the viscera of the deceased would not militate against the conclusion that the death of the' deceased was due to poisoning. There ire several poisons which do not leave any characteristic signs as can be seen on post mortem examination.

 (ii) If circumstantial evidence in the absence of direct proof is so decisive that the Court can unhesitatingly hold that the death was as a result of administration of posion (though not detected.) and that the posion must have been administered by the accused person, then conviction can be rested on it. Therefore there are no cogent grounds to interfere with the findings of the two courts that the death of the deceased was not natural but homicidal.
 (iii) No case has been proved against two of the appellants and their conviction has to be set aside. The rule in section 162 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not applicable to statements falling within the provisions of clause (i) of section 32 of the Evidence Act or to affect the provisions of section 27 of that Act. But there is nothing in the present case to show that statements made by the two appellants to the police. on which the prosecution relied. resulted in the discovery of any incriminating material as may make them admissible under section 27 of the Evidence Act. As such the aforesaid statements must be excluded from consideration.
