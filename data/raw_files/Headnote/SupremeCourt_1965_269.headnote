 The appellants were a limited company with their registered office at Madras. The Company carried on the business of financing purchases ,of motor vehicles on the security of those vehicles. A customer desirous ,of purchasing a motor vehicle but unable to pay the price to the dealer would make part payment to the dealer and then approach the appellants for a loan. The appellants would advance the loan to the customer on 'the strength of nine documents executed by the customer one of which 'Was a 'sale letter' purporting to sell the vehicle to the appellants on the date of the loan;
 another was a promissory-note agreeing to pay the difference between the price of the vehicle and the amount paid by the ,customer to the dealer and interest thereon at the stipulated rate. An,other of these documents was the hire- purchase agreement itself; in cl. 6 it recited that on the customer paying the entire amount due under the second schedule to the agreement the vehicle would become the sole and absolute property of the customer. On September 28, 1958 the Sales-tax Officer, Ernakulam, issued a notice calling upon the appellants to file returns of their turnover from sales in the course of business and to secure registration as dealers under the Travancore-Cochin General Sales-tax Act 11 of 1125 M.E. and to furnish details of the transactions ,of sale with parties in the State of Kerala in the year 1955-56, 1956-57 and 1957-58. Later another notice was issued for the years 1958-59 and 1959-60. 'Me appellants contended that they were not liable to pay Sales- tax on their financing transactions as they mere financiers and did not enter into any transactions of sale of goods with parties within 'the State of Kerala and that they were not 'dealers' under the Act. The 'Sales-tax Officer however held that they were dealers and that the hire purchase transactions entered into by them resulted in sales which were liable to sales-tax. According to the Sales-tax authorities between the date on which the customer agreed to purchase a vehicle and the date ,on which he became full owner without any encumbrance three sale transactions were interposed-a sale by the dealer of the vehicle to the 'Customer; a sale by the customer to the appellants under the 'sale letter'; and a sale by virtue of cl. 6 of the hire-purchase agreement-while the second transaction was not liable to tax, the first and third were. The appellants filed petition in the High Court praying for writ of certiorari and prohibition against the Sales-tax Officer.
 The High Court rejected these petitions. With certificate under Art. 133(1)(a) of the Constitution the appellants came to this Court.
 
HELD : Per Shah and Sikri, JJ. (i) The true effect of a transaction may be determined from the terms of the agreement considered in the light of the surrounding circumstances. In each case the Court has, unless prohibited by statute, power to go behind the documents and to determine the nature of the transaction, whatever may be the form of the documents. An owner of goods who purports to convey absolutely 829 or acknowledges to have conveyed goods and subsequently purports to hire them under a hire-purchase agreement is not estopped from proving that the real bargain was intended to be a loan on the security of the goods. [841 C] (ii) A hire-purchase agreement is a complex transaction.
 The owner under a hire-purchase agreement enters into a transaction of hiring out goods on the terms and conditions set out in the agreement, and the option to purchase exercisable by the customer on payment of all the instalments of hire arises when the instalments are paid and not before. In such a hire-purchase agreement there is no agreement to buy goods; the hirer being under no legal obligation to buy, has an option either to return the goods or to become its owner by payment in full of the stipulated hire and the price for exercising the option. This class of hirepurchase agreements must be distinguished from transactions in which the customer is the owner of the goods and with a view to finance, his purchase he enters into an arrangement which is in the form of a hirepurchase agreement with the financier, but in substance evidences a loan transaction subject to a hiring agreement under which the lender is given the licence to seize the goods. [841 G-842 B] (iii)The appellants were financiers; they were not dealing in motor vehicles. The motor vehicles purchased by 'the customer was registered in the name of the customer and remained at all material times so registered in his name.
 In the letter taken from the customer under which he agreed to keep the vehicle insured, it was expressly recited that the vehicle had been given on security for the loan advanced by the appellants. As a security for repayment of the loan, the customers executed a promissory note for the amount paid by the appellants to the dealer of the vehicle. The so- called 'sale-letter' was a formal document which was not made effective by registering the vehicle in the name of the appellants and even the insurance of the vehicle had to be effected as if the customer was the owner. The appellants' 'right to seize the vehicle was merely a licence to ensure compliance with the terms of the hire-purchase agreement.
 The customer remained qua the world at large the owner, and remained in possession, and on condition of performing the convenants had a right to continue to remain in possession.
 The right of the appellants may be extinguished by payment of the amount due to them under the terms of the hire- purchase agreement even before the date fixed for payment.
 The agreements undoubtedly contained several onerous covenants but they were all intended to secure to the appellants recovery of the amounts advanced. The intention of the appellants in obtaining hire-purchase and allied agreements was to secure the return of loans advanced to their customers. The transactions were merely financial transactions. [844 C-H] As there was no sale no sales-tax could be levied on the transactions as decided by this Court in Gannon Dunkerley & Co.

 (1965) S.C. 1082, distinguished.
 Per Subba Rao, J. (i) There was no question in the present case of going behind the documents executed by the parties to determine their true intentions. The transactions in question were in accordance with mercantile usage. Both the financiers and the customers entered with 830 eyes open into transactions of hire-purchase. Their intention was ex. pressed in clear terms. They could have executed hypothecation bonds but they did not, and entered instead into hire-purchase transactions. There was no reason to camouflage the real nature of the transactions.
 None was suggested. They were therefore bound by the terms of the agreement. [833 A-B] (ii)Neither the fact that the agreements were entered into because the customers had no funds to purchase the motor car nor the circumstance that part of the consideration was already paid to the dealer affects the nature of the transaction. The fact that the customer executed a pro- missory note for the money advanced by the financier does not affect the question for that was merged in the hire- purchase transaction. If the said terms were not carried out the customers could not claim any rights under the agreements and the financier continued to be the owner freed from any obligation created under the agreements. Could the financier thereafter return the promissory note ? He could not. The transactions purported to he hire-purchase agreements and they must be treated as such as the common intention of the parties was to enter into such transactions. A deeper study of the transactions showed that the dealer and the financier were closely connected Companies and for their own reasons they had split up the business of hire-purchase between them. In effect and in substance, the dealer without receiving the whole money put the customers in possession of the cars under the hire- purchase agreements. [833 H; 834 C] (iii) If the transactions were hire-purchase agreements in terms of the judgment of this Court in M/s. K. L. Johar & Co. when all the terms of the agreements were satisfied and the option was exercised,, sales took place in the goods which till then had been hired. Having thus fructified into sales the transactions were liable to sales-tax. [831 B; 834 B] M/s. K. L. Johar & Co. v. The Deputy Commerical Tax Officer, Coimbatore III, [1965] 2 S.C.R., 112 relied on.
