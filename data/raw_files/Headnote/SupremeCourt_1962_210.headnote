 Up to the assessment year 1951-52, the appellant -adopted the year ending on 30th June as the previous year applicable to him. For the assessment year, 1952-53, the assessee filed a return for 21 months commencing on 1st July 1950 and ending on 31st March, 1952 and requested the Income-tax Officer to accord his sanction to the change of the previous year from an year ending on 30th June to an year ending on 31st March. The Income-tax Officer sanctioned the change on condition that the total income in the period of 21 months ending on 31st March 1952 would be assessed to tax at the rate applicable to the total income in the said 21 months.
 The Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the Appellate Tribunal. on appeal, and the High Court, on a reference, confirmed the order.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended that : (i) the scheme of Act and particularly ss. 2(11) and 3 show that there cannot be a previous year consisting of more than 12 months; (ii) the Income-tax Officer had no power to direct under the proviso to cl. (1) (a) of s. (2) (11) that the previous year should consist of 21 months; (iii) the Income- tax Officer should have granted the sanction on condition that the ass shall have 2 previous years, one consisting of a period of nine months from 1st July 1950 up to 31st March 1951 and the other of a period of 12 months from 1st April 1951 to 31st March 1952; and (iv) the Income-tax Officer should have accorded sanction to the change on the basis that the income for 21 months should be assessed at the rate applicable to the income of the last period of 12 months.
 HELD : (i) A combined reading of the several clauses of s.
 2(11) shows that the length of a previous year need not necessarily be 12, calendar months. Under s. 2(11)(i)(b), the previous year is such period as may be determined by the Central Board of Revenue or such, authority as the Board may authorise in this behalf, and the period so, determined may be more or less than 12 months. [362 H-363 A] (ii)The Income-tax Officer may -refuse to give his consent to a change of the previous year, but if he gives his consent, he has ample power to impose the condition that the full period from the end of the "previous year" for the preceding year's assessment to the end of the new accounting year should be taken as the previous year for the cur-rent assessment year. The condition properly safeguards the interests of the Revenue because, if he had sanctioned the change on the footing that the previous year would only be the period of 12 months from 1st April 1951 to 31st March 1952 the income of the preceding 9 months from 1st July 1950 to 31st March 1951 would have escaped taxation. [363 D-F] (iii)There cannot be two previous years in respect of the same assessment year and such a concept of two previous years is repugnant to s. 3. Section 25(1) does not contemplate assessments in the same assessment CI/66-10 360 year in respect of two previous years. It only contemplates the usual assessment in respect of the income of the previous year and a special and separate assessment in the same assessment year in respect of the income of the broken period between the end of the previous year and the date of discontinuance of the business. [363 H-364 C] (iv)The Income-tax Officer has no power to vary the rate on which the income of the previous year is to be assessed.
 The condition imposed by the Income-tax Officer, that the income of the Previous year of 21 months would be assessed at the rate applicable to the income for 21 months is redundant, because, once the length of the previous year is found to be a period of 21 months, the income of the entire period of 21 months, must be considered to be the income of the previous year relevant for the assessment year. 1952-53, and the entire income must be assessed at the rate specified in the relevant Finance Act, and at no other rate.
