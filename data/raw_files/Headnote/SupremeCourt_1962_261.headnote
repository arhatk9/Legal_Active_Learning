 The appellant was a registered firm under the Mysore Sales Tax Act on which was imposed a tax of Rs. 1,16,728.44 Nps at the rate of .02 Nps per rupee on a return of over Rs.58, 36,422-26 Nps . Its grievance was that according to Mysore Sales Tax Act, it was liable to Sales Tax at the rate of 3 pies for every rupee but after the amendment of Indian Coinage Act (Act 30 of 1906) by amending Act 31 of 1955, tax was levied at the rate of .02 Nps per rupee, which made him liable to pay more than what he would have paid if charged at the rate of 3 pies per rupee. It was contended that such enhancement of tax was unconstitutional and illegal being in contravention of Article 255 of the Constitution.
 Objections by the appellant regarding the validity of tax were (1) that by the substitution of 2 naya paisleys in place of 3 pies, a change was brought in the tax eligible by the Mysore Sales Tax Act and since this enactment enhancing the tax was not enacted according to procedure for money bills not being in accordance with Articles 198, 199 and 207 of the constitution, the tax was illegal and invalid; (2) that the Indian coinage Act, being a central Act dealing with "coinage and legal-- tender" under item 36 of List 1, could not change the rate of tax under the Mysore Sales Tax Act.
 276 Held, that by substitution of new coinage, no enhancement of tax was enacted but was merely a sbusttution of one coinage by another of equivalent value and even assuming that it was a taxing measure, its validity could not be challenged on the ground that it offends Arts. 197 to 199 and the procedure laid down in Art. 202 of the Constitution, because of Art. 212 which prohibits the validity of any proceedings in a legislature from being called in question for irregularity of procedure and formalities of Art. 255 are only matters of procedure.
 Held,, further, that if the Indian Coinage Act had not the effect of changing 3 pies into .02 Nps in the rate of tax leviable under the Mysore Sales Tax Act, the Mysore Existing Laws (construction of References to Values) Act, 1957, had made a provision for charging the tax in terms of naya paisas instead of pies, therefore, the levy of tax in terms of naya paisas was not unconstitutional, nor was it a taxing measure, but dealt merely with the canversion of the old coinage into new coinage.
