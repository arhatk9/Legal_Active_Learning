 The question that arose in the three appeals and a connected appeal related to the jurisdiction of Civil courts under the Delhi Land Reforms Act to adjudicate on certain questions.
 The four matters were disposed of by a common judgment by the High Court. Special leave having been granted, there were four appeals to this Court. The appellants then moved this Court with a view to save money etc., that one of the four appeals may be got ready and directed to be posted as the matter for decision is common to all. Accordingly, one of the appeals was heard and decided against the appellants.
 It was, however, contended, as regards the other three appeals, that the earlier adjudication was a judgment per incuriam and, therefore, was not binding either on the) appellants or the Court.
 Rejecting the contention, 
HELD : (1) As a result of an application at an earlier stage the appellants got benefits like reduced security deposit and consolidation for printing and hearing on their representation to the Court that the points arising in all the appeals were common and the disposal of one would govern the rest. A litigant cannot play fast and lose with the Court. [836F-H] Ex Parte Pratt (52) Q.B. 334, referred to.
 (2) Ordinarily a decision once rendered must later bind like cases that is, a prior decision of the Court on identical facts and law binds the. court on the same points in a later case. In the present case the earlier decision was admittedly rendered on facts and law, indistinguishably identical with those in the other the, appeals. (837B, C-D] (3) In exceptional and rare instances, where by obvious inadvertence or oversight a judgment fails to notice a plain statutory provision or obligatory authority running counter to the reasoning and the result reached, it may not have the sway of a binding precedent. But in the present case, the point about the Civil Court's power to go into a land reform litigation had been considered and adversely decided, so much so, it is not correct for the appellants to say that the matter had, by grave inadvertence been missed. to give rise to any question of a judgment given per incuriam.
