 A charge-sheet was served on the respondent, a Government servant, containing two articles of charges alleging misconduct involving lack of integrity and lack of devotion to duty and conduct unbecoming of a Government servant. In his defence the respondent denied the charges.
 The Inquiry Officer held that both the articles of charges were established. The Disciplinary Authority accepted the report of the Inquiry Officer and by his order dated May 15, 1980 dismissed the respondent from service. Against the dismissal order, the respondent preferred an appeal. The Appellate Authority by its order dated July 8, 1981 upheld the finding of the Disciplinary Authority. It, however, altered the penalty of dismissal to one of compulsory retirement of the respondent from service.
 The respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court.
 The Single Judge quashed the order of dismissal and directed reinstatement of the respondent in service holding that there was no evidence to substantiate the charges and that as no opportunity was given to the respondent to show cause against the punishment before the same was imposed the order of dismissal was vitiated.
 In the appeal preferred by the Department, the Division Bench agreed with the Single Judge that the respondent was deprived of an opportunity to show cause against the punishment imposed on him by the Disciplinary Authority, modified the order of the Single Judge and directed the 743 Disciplinary Authority to proceed further with the disciplinary proceedings against the respondent from the stage of giving a fresh notice to show cause against the punishment to be proposed.
 Allowing the appeal by the Department, ^ 
 HELD : (1) Both the Single Judge and the Division Bench were not justified in holding that the order of dismissal was vitiated as the respondent was not given a second opportunity to make a representation against the punishment of dismissal before the same was imposed on him. [747 F-G] (2) The judgment of the Division Bench is set aside. As the Division Bench did not consider the judgment of the Single Judge on merits, the case is remanded to the Division Bench for disposal of the appeal on merits after giving the parties an opportunity of being heard. [747 H; 748 A-B] (3) The Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976 has deleted from clause (2) of Article 311 of the Constitution the requirement of a reasonable opportunity of making representation on the proposed penalty and, further, it has been expressly provided in the first proviso to clause (2) that "it shall not be necessary to give such person any opportunity of making representation on the penalty proposed". After the amendment, the requirement of clause (2) will be satisfied by holding an inquiry in which the Government servant has been informed of the charges against him and given a reasonable opportunity of being heard. [746 C-E] In the instant case, such an opportunity has been given to the respondent. Undisputedly after the order of dismissal was passed, the respondent was supplied with a copy of the report of the Inquiry Officer which enabled him to prefer an appeal to the Appellate Authority against the order of dismissal. [746 E-F] (4) In view of the amendment of Article 311(2) of the Constitution, Rule 15(4) of the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965 was amended, which, inter alia, provided that it would not be necessary to give the Government servant any opportunity of making 744 representation on the penalty proposed to be imposed.
 Therefore, the respondent cannot claim a second opportunity to show cause against the punishment either under Article 311(2) of the Constitution or under Rule 15(4) of the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal), Rules, 1965. [746 G; 747 D-E] Union of India v. Tulsi Ram Patel, [1985] 3 S.C.C. 389, relied upon.
