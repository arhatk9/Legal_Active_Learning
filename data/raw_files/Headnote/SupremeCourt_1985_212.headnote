 The Government of India set up a special Central Assistance Scheme for the welfare of Scheduled Castes.
 Consequent to a proposal under this Scheme, allotment of bunk free of Cost were to be made to cobblers by profession who worked on the roadside, by the State Government of Tamil Nadu in pursuance to G.O. No. 580 Social Welfare Department dated February 13, 1982. This Order specifically stated that persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes and converted to Christianity were not eligible for assistance under the scheme.
 The petitioner, who was a Hindu belonging to the Adi- Dravida caste and on conversion to Christianity continued as a member of that caste,-contended in his writ petition to this court that he had been denied the benefit of the welfare assistance intended for Scheduled Castes on the ground that he professes the Christian religion, and that such discrimination had been affected pursuant to the provision contained in paragraph 3 of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 and that the provision was constitutionally invalid as being violative of Articles 14 to 17.
 In the connected writ petition, relief was sought against the Circular letter dated August 16/25, 1983 issued by the State Government of Tamilnadu to the State Public Service Commission stating that "Scheduled Caste" Christians who revert to Hinduism and on that basis obtain appointments to reserved seats in Government services and having done so change their religion once 243 again after their entry into Government service were liable to have their selection cancelled, as being constitutionally invalid and violative of Articles 14 to 17.
 On the question: whether the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 is constitutionally invalid on the ground that only Hindu or Sikh members of the castes enumerated in the Schedule to that Order are deemed to be Scheduled Castes for the purpose of the Constitution of India.
 Dismissing the writ petitions, ^ 
 HELD: 1. It is not possible to say that the President acted arbitrarily in the exercise of his judgment in enacting paragraph 3 of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950. [250 F] 2.Dr. J.H. Hutton, a Census Commissioner of India, framed a list of the depressed classes and that list was made the basis of an order promulgated by the British Government in India called the Government of India (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1936. The Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 was substantially modelled on the Order of 1936. The Order of 1936 enumerated several castes races or tribes in an attached schedule and they were, by paragraph 2 of the Order, deemed to be Scheduled Castes.
 Paragraph 3 of the same Order declared that the Indian Christians would not be deemed to be members of the Scheduled Castes. [249 C-D] 
 3. The President had before him material indicating that the depressed classes of the Hindu and the Sikh Communities suffered from economic and social disabilities and cultural and educational backwardness so gross in character and degree that the members of these Castes in the two communities called for the protection of the Constitutional provisions relating to the Scheduled Castes, and that in order to provide for their amelioration and advancement it was necessary to conceive of intervention by the State through its legislative and executive powers. [249 H; 250 B] 4.(i) In discharge of the obligation imposed by clause (1) of Article 341 the President issued the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950. In its original form, paragraph 3 declared that (1) no person who professes a religion different from Hinduism would be deemed to be a member of a Scheduled Caste. There was a proviso to paragraph 3 which declared that every member of the Ramdasi, Kabirpanthi, Mazhabi or Sikligar caste 244 resident in Punjab or the Patiala and East Punjab States Union would in relation to that State be deemed to be a member of the Scheduled Castes whether he professed the Hindu religion or the Sikh religion. Subsequently, Parliament enacted the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Orders (Amendment) Act, 1956 which substituted for the original paragraph 3 the present paragraph 3, which declared :- "3. Notwithstanding anything contained in paragraph 2,no person who professes a religion different from the Hindu or the Sikh religion shall be deemed to be a member of a Scheduled Caste." [247 F; 248A] (ii) For the purposes of the Constitution the constitutional provisions relating to Scheduled Castes are intended to be applied to only those members of the castes enumerated in the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 who profess the Hindu or the Sikh religion. If a Christian belongs to one of those castes, he is barred by reason of paragraph 3, from being regarded as a member of a Scheduled Caste and is, therefore, not entitled to the benefit of the constitutional provisions relating to Scheduled Castes. [248 B-Cl 
 5. The declaration incorporated in paragraph 3 was a declaration made for the purposes of the Constitution. It was a declaration enjoined by clause (1) of Article 341 of the Constitution. To establish that paragraph 3 of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 discriminates against Christian members of the enumerated castes it must be shown that they suffer from a comparable depth of social and economic disabilities and cultural and educational backwardness and similar levels of degradation within the Christian community necessitating intervention by the State under provisions of the Constitution. It is not sufficient to show that the same caste continues after conversion. It is necessary to establish further that the disabilities and handicaps suffered from such caste membership in the social order of its origin - Hinduism continue in their oppressive severity in the new environment of a different religious community. No authoritative or detailed study dealing with the present conditions of Christian society have been placed on the record in this case. [250 B-E]
