 In Civil Appeal No. 1841 of 1981, the appellant- assessee was a partner in Messrs Suvas Trading Company, a partnership firm constituted under a deed of partnership dated September 27, 1973. As his contribution to the capital of the partnership firm, the assessee made over certain shares of limited companies which were held by him as his capital assets. The book value of the said shares in his account books was shown as Rs. 1,60,279 but on the date when he contributed those shares to the partnership firm he revalued the shares at the market value of Rs. 1,49,819, and debited the resulting difference of Rs. 10,460 to his capital account. Since the Income Tax Officer, when drawing up the assessment order for the assessment year 1974-75 in respect of the assessee did not include the difference in the assessable income, the Commissioner of Income Tax, being of the opinion that the difference between the market value of the shares and the cost of acquisition of the shares to the assessee is liable to tax as capital gains under section 45 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 exercised his revisional jurisdiction and reopening the assessment, remanded the case to the Income Tax Officer directing him to revise the assessment after computing the capital gains arising out of the transfer. The assessee appealed to the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, which held that while the transaction did amount to a transfer within the meaning of sub-section (47) of 103 section 2 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, it did not result in capital gains liable to tax. Subsequently the Appellate Tribunal referred the case to the High Court of Gujarat for its opinion on the said two issues.
 In Civil Appeal No. 1777/1981, the appellant was a partner in a registered partnership firm, M/s. Rajka, constituted under an agreement dated February 24, 1973 of which the other partner was his wife. The assessee had in his possession 580 ordinary shares of the Ahmedabad Manufacturing and Calico Printing Co. Ltd. and 82 ordinary shares of Karamchand Premchand Private Ltd., the total cost of purchase being Rs. 1,81,106. On March 22, 1973, the assessee introduced the two share holdings in the partnership firm as his capital contribution ant the firm credited his account with the market value of the shares, namely Rs. 475,136. In the assessment proceedings for the assessment year 1973-74, the Income Tax Officer took the view that the contribution by the assessee of the shares to the assets of the partnership constituted a transfer within the meaning of sub-section (47) of D section 2 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and that the assessee was liable to income tax on a capital gain of Rs. 2,94,030, being the difference between the market price at which the shares were entered in the books of the partnership firm and the cost of the shares to the assessee. The appeal before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner failed, but in second appeal, the Appellate Tribunal took the view that there was no transfer of a capital asset within the meaning of section 45 read with sub-section (47) of section 2 of the Income Tax Act and consequently deleted the item from the assessment. In the circumstances the Tribunal did not go into the question whether the transfer was without consideration. At the instance of the Commissioner of Income Tax a reference was made to the High Court on the correctness of the Tribunal's views. By a common judgment dated April 30/May 1 and 4, 1981 the High Court answered the questions referred in favour of the Revenue ant against the assessee. Hence the appeals by special leave of the Court, Allowing the appeals in part, the Court ^ 
 HELD: 1.1 When the assessee brought the shares of the limited companies into the partnership firm as his contribution to its capital, there was a transfer within the meaning of sub-section (47) of section 2 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, of a capital asset within the terms of section 45 of the Act.

 1.2 It is well settled that a partnership firm is not a separate legal entity ant that the assets owned by the partner ship are collectively owned by the partners and that when a partner hands over a business asset to the partnership firm as his contribution to its capital, he cannot be said to have effected a sale.

 1.3 But while the transaction may not amount to a sale, it can be described as a transfer of some other kind. m e definition of the expression transfer in sub-section (47) of section 2 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 is inclusive merely and does not exhaust other kinds of transfer. [114 A-B] 
 1.4 In its general sense, the expression transfer of property" connotes the passing of rights in the property from one person to another. In one case there may be a passing of the entire bundle of rights from the transferor to the transferee. In another case, the transfer may consist of one of the estates only out of all the estates comprising the totality of rights in the property. In a third case, there may be a reduction of the exclusive interest in the totality of rights of the original owner into a joint or shared interest with other persons. An exclusive interest in property is a larger interest than a share in that property.
 To the extent to which the exclusive interest is reduced to a shared interest it would seem that there is a transfer of interest. Therefore when a partner brings in his personal asset into the capital of the partnership firm as his contribution to its capital he reduces his exclusive rights in the asset to shared rights in it with the other partners of the firm. While he does not lose his rights in the asset altogether what he enjoys now is an abridged right which cannot be identified with the fulness of the right which he enjoyed in the asset 105 before it entered the partnership capital. When a partner brings in his personal asset into a partnership firm as his contribution to its capital, an asset which originally was subject to the entire ownership of the partner becomes w subject to the rights of other partners in it. It is not an interest which can be evaluated immediately. It is an interest which is subject to the operation of future transactions of the partnership, and it may diminish in value depending on accumulating liabilities and losses with a fall in the prosperity of the partnership firm. The evaluation of a partner's interest takes place only when there is a dissolution of the firm or upon his retirement from it. Upon the dissolution of the firm or upon the partner retiring from the firm, the partner's right to realise the interest and receive its value arises. What is realized is the interest which the partner enjoys in the assets during the subsistence of the partnership firm by virtue of his status as a partner and in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement. It is because that interest exists already before dissolution that the distribution of the assets on dissolution does not amount to a transfer to the erstwhile partners. What the partner gets upon dissolution or upon retirement is the realisation of a pre-existing right or interest. It is nothing strange in the law that a right or interest should exist in praesenti but its realisation or exercise should be postponed. Therefore, what was the exclusive interest of a partner in his personal asset is, upon its introduction into the partnership firm as his share in the partnership capital transformed into a shared interest with the other partners in that asset. Qua that asset, there is a shared interest. During the subsistence of the partnership the value of the interest of each partner qua that asset cannot be isolated or carved out from the value of the partner's interest in the totality of the partnership assets. And in regard to the latter, the value will be represented by his share in the net assets on the dissolution of the firm or upon the partner's retirement. But the position is different when a partner retires or the partnership is dissolved. What the partner receives then is his share in the partnership. What is contemplated here is a share of the partner qua the net assets of the partnership firm. On evaluation, that share in a particular case may be realised by the receipt of only one of all the assets. What happens here is that a shared interest in all the assets of the firm is replaced by an exclusive interest in an asset of equal value. That is why it has been held that there is no transfer. It is the realisation of a pre-existing right. The position is different, when a partner brings his personal asset into the partnership firm as 106 his contribution to its capital. An individual asset is the sole subject of consideration. An exclusive interest in it before it enters the partnership is reduced on such entry into a shared interest.

 2.1 When the Assessee transferred his shares to the partnership firm he received no consideration within the meaning of section 48 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 nor did any profit or gain accrue to him for the purpose of section 45 of the Income Tax Act, 1961- [118 A-B] 
 2.2 The consideration for the transfer of the personal assets is the right which arises or accrues to the partner during the subsistence of the partnership to get his share of the profits from time to time and, after the dissolution of the partnership or with his retirement from the partnership, to get the value of a share in the net partnership assets as on the date of the dissolution or retirement after a reduction of liabilities ant prior charges. The credit entry mate in the partner's capital account in the books of the partnership firm does not represent the true value of the consideration. It is a notional value only, 107 intended to be taken into account at the time of determining the A value of the partner's share in the net partnership assets on the date of dissolution or on his retirement, a share which will depend upon a deduction of the liabilities and prior charges existing on the date of dissolution or retirement. It is not possible to predicate before hand what will be the position in terms of monetary value of a partner's share on that date. At the time when the partner transfers his personal asset to the partnership firm, there can be no reckoning of the liabilities ant losses which the firm may suffer in the years to come. All that lies within the womb of the future. It is impossible to conceive of evaluating the consideration acquired by the partner when he brings his personal asset into the partnership firm when neither the date of dissolution or retirement can be envisaged nor can there by any ascertainment of liabilities and prior charges which may not have even arisen yet.
 Therefore, the consideration which a partner acquires on making over his personal asset to the partnership firm as his contribution to its capital cannot fall within the terms of section 48. And as that provision is fundamental to the computation machinery incorporated in the scheme relating to the determination of the charge provided in section 45, such a case must be regarded as falling outside the scope of capital gains taxation altogether.

 2.3 Applying the principle that profits or gains under the Income Tax Act must be understood in the sense of real profits or gains, that is to say, on the basis of ordinary commercial principles on which actual profits are computed, a sense in which no commercial man would misunderstand, and having regard to the nature and quality of the consideration which the partner may be said to acquire on introducing his personal asset into the partnership firm as his contribution to its capital, it cannot be said that any income or gain arises or accrues to the assessee in the true commercial sense which a businessman would understand as real income or gain. Of course, the partnership firm in question mu t be a genuine firm and not the result of a sham or unreal transaction, and the transfer by the partner of his personal asset to tee partnership firm must represent a genuine intention to contribute to the share capital of the firm for the purpose of carrying on the partnership business.

 2.4 If the transfer of a personal asset by the assessee to a partnership in which he is or becomes a partner is merely a device or ruse for converting the asset into money which would substantially remain available for his benefit without liability to income tax on a capital gain, it will be open to the income tax authorities to go behind the transaction and examine whether the transaction of creating the partnership is a genuine or a sham transaction and, even where the partnership is genuine, the transaction of transferring the personal asset to the partnership firm represents a real attempt to contribute to the share capital of the partnership firm for the purpose of carrying on the partnership business or is nothing but a device or ruse to convert the personal asset into money substantially for the benefit of the assessee while evading tax on a capital gain 121 E-G]
