 In 1962, the appellant was appointed Secretary of the Board of Secondary Education constituted under the West Bengal Secondary Education Act, 1950, as amended in 1954. In 1963, the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education Act was enacted repealing the earlier Acts and the rules made thereunder.
 The 1963-Act 'constituted an entirely new Board of Secondary Education. Under s. 46(2), the services of the persons in the employment of the Board under the old Act are continued until other provision is made. Under s. 16, the power of appointment of the Secretary for the Board is vested in the State Government and not in the Board. Rule 8 of the Rules made under the 1963-Act provided that the State Government may dispense with the services of the Secretary on three months' notice or payment of three months' salary in lieu of notice. The State Government dispensed with the services of the appellant paying him three months' salary in lieu of notice, and appointed a new secretary in his place.
 On the questions : (1) Whether the State Government could act under r. 8 in respect of a person who is continued in service under s. 46 of the 1963-Act; and (2) Whether the services of an employee of the Board could be terminated by the State Government, 
HELD : (1) All that the 1963-Act provides for is the continuance of the employees of the previous Board till other arrangements are made. That is, in the present case, the appellant was continued in service only until another secretary was appointed by the State Government under the 1963-Act; and the State Government has the power to appoint a Secretary under s. 16 of the Act, irrespective of its powers under the Rules. [1901 A-C] (2) Under s. 46(2) of the 1963-Act the appellant merely continues in service but he is not deemed to be on employee of he Board. Therefore, there is no basis for the argument that the services of an employee of the Board could only be terminated only by the Board and riot by the State Government. [901 C, F] State of Assam v.
