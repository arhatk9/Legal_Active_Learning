 On the production of a forwarding note for booking a consignment of dry chillies to Calcutta, a railway wagon was allotted to the appellants who loaded it without any help from any railway employee. The wagon was rivetted and card labels were fixed on both sides. A railway receipt was made out wherein the consignment was 'said to. contain' 251 bags of dry chillies. The letters "L/U" were endorsed on the receipt meaning that the responsibility of loading and unloading rested with the consignor. There was no facility for weighing the goods at the loading station and it was indicated that the weight was as given by the consignor by the endorsement S.W.A. (Sender's weight accepted). The Wagon was attached to a goods train which left for Calcutta.
 Two days later the seal on one side of the wagon was found broken and when the wagon was examined it found to contain 197 bags of chaff instead of 251 bags of chillies. The police investigated into the matter and filed a charge sheet against the appellant and they were convicted of the offence of cheating and the Conviction was confirmed by the High Court. It was found that the appellants had obtained a SLIM of Rs. 5,500 from a third party by handing over the railway receipt to him representing that they had booked 251 bags of chillies.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The appellants had by deceiving the Station Master induced him to deliver a railway receipt which they had used as a valuable security but, the false representation made by them in obtaining the receipt, in the form in which it was issued, did not cast any additional liability on the Railway and therefore, the issue of the receipt did not cause any damage or harm to the railway. Hence no question of cheating the railway or Station Master arose in the case.
 [829 F] The 'railway did not run any additional risk or liability in acting upon the representation of the appellants and issuing the receipt because, there would be no presumption that the goods put in the wagon were chillies since the railway did not accept the consignment as such but described as allegedly containing 251 bags of chillies. Nor was there any acceptance of the weight of the goods. In case of loss the appellants had to prove that they had put on rail 251 bags of chillies with their weight and approximate value, before any liability of the railway could arise under ss.73 and 74 of the Indian Railways Act. Under r. 15 of the Goods Tariff General Rules the mention of the weight of the goods in the receipt did not amount to an admission in that behalf by the railway, and Rule 22 read with Rule 24(2) only made a false declaration as to goods in a forwarding note subject to the penalty of a fine in addition to the liability to pay for the freight of the goods at the proper rate.
