 The appellant employs about 1000 workmen. In the year 1955 all the 1000 workmen were dismissed by the appellant after holding certain enquiries. Out of the 1000 workmen 200 workmen apologised and they were reinstated, The remaining 800 workmen were, however, not reinstated. The workmen Union invoked jurisdiction of the Regional Conciliation officer under clause 4(1) of the Government Notification dated 14-7- 1954 passed under sec. ;3 of the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. A Conciliation Board consisting of the Additional Regional Conciliation officer as the Chairman and one representative each of the Management and Labour as members was constituted. Before the Conciliation Board, no settlement could be arrived at. The members of the Conciliation Board sent their reports to the Labour Commissioner which were placed before the Government. The Additional Regional Conciliation officer who was the Chairman of the Board sent a secret report to the Labour Commissioner recommencing that the allegations made by the workers against the management, were baseless and should not be entertained. The Government by its order dated 28-2-1956 refused to make a reference to the Industrial tribunal on The ground that it was not expedient to do so. The workmen filed a Writ Petition in 1958 for quashing the order of the Government dated 28-2-1956 and for directing a fresh reference. The learned Single Judge allowed the Writ Petition in October, 1963. The Appellate Bench of the High Court dismissed the appeal of the management in 1972. The Writ Petition was pending in the High Court for 14 years.
 The learned Single Judge set aside the order of the Government on the following grounds:
 (1) The Government relied on the secret report sent by the Additional Regional Conciliation officer.
 (2) The order of the Government was not a speaking order.
 The Division Bench held that the order need not be a speaking order. Rules of natural justice would apply to administrative proceedings. It is not necessary that the administrative orders should be speaking orders unless the Statute specifically enjoins such a requirement. It is desirable that such orders should contain reasons when they decide matters affecting the rights of parties. The Division Bench set aside the order of the Government refusing to make a reference on the following grounds:
 (1) The Government took into consideration the Secret report which had seriously prejudiced and coloured its decision.
 (2) The Additional Regional Conciliation officer should have shown the secret report to other members of the Conciliation Board in accordance with the principles of natural justice.
 169 (3) The Government order was passed purely on the secret report sent by the Additional Regional Conciliation officer as also the report of the Labour Commissioner.
 Pursuant lo the judgment of the High Court, the State Government made a reference in the year 1973.
 Allowing the appeal by certificate, ^ 
 HELD: (1) The administrative decisions are not generally required to be accompanied by statement of reasons. In a diverse Society such as ours, the Government has to work though several administrative agencies which have got a were wide sphere and if every administrative order is required to give reasons it will bring the Governmental machinery to a stand-still. [172F-G] 
 2. There is no reliable material on record to show that the Government order was passed mainly on the secret report of the Additional Regional Conciliation officer or of the Labour Commissioner. In the counter affidavit filed on behalf of- Government it was specifically stated that in the opinion of the Government it was not expedient to refer the dispute to the adjudication after the matter was fully considered by the Government. Under section 4K of the U.P.`.
 Industrial Disputes Act, the Government has wide discretion to act under certain circumstances. If the Government on the basis of the material before it comes to the conclusion that no real dispute existed and it was not expedient to make a reference one can hardly find fault with the order of the Government. There was no reason for excluding the secret report submitted by the Additional Regional conciliation officer at all. [173E-H, 174E-G] 
 3. Before the Additional Regional Conciliation Officer made his report all the rules of natural justice were fully complied with. The parties were given hearing, their points of view were fully considered and, in fact, the representatives of the management and that of the labour were the members of the Board. There is no provision for submitting the report by Chairman and members of the Board to each other. The principles of natural justice are very essential but they have got their own limits and cannot be stretched too far. A. K. Kraipak's case distinguished. In the present case, all The indicia of the principles of natural justice were present. [176B-E; 177A, D] 
 4. Even if the High Court thought that the impugned order of the Government suffered from any legal infirmity- all that it could have done was to ask the Government to reconsider it but it had no jurisdiction to direct the Government how to act and low to exercise its statutory discretion which was conferred on the Government by section 4K of the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act. There was absolutely no warrant for the High Court in prohibiting the Government from considering the secret report of the Additional Regional Conciliation Officer or that of the Labour Commissioner. [178B-D] 
 5. The order of the High Court is not legally sustainable and must be quashed. [178D] 
 6. The reference made by the Government in the year 1973 was not in exercise of its independent decision but was mainly because of the directions given in the High Court judgment. If the order of the High Court is quashed it will undoubtedly materially affect the decision of the Government in making a reference to the Industrial Tribunal. Had the Government made a reference uninfluenced by the High Court's direction the situation would have been different. Any subsequent proceedings which come into existence, as a result of the High Court order would fall to the ground as a logical corollary of the setting aside of the High Court judgment. [179A-B] [1. We would like to make it clear that the Government has ample discretion to make a reference to the Industrial Tribunal under sec. 4K of the U.P. Industrial disputes Act if it so thinks fit. Even if a reference was refused by 170 the Government that will not debar the Government from making a reference at a later time if it is satisfied that under the changed circumstances the reference is necessary.
 [179D-F] 
 2. The Court is constrained to observe that labour matters should have been given top urgency and should not have been allowed to prolong for such a long period in the High Court, otherwise, inordinate delay results in a situation causing embarrassment both to the court and to the parties. It is very necessary that such matters should be disposed of by the High Court within 2 year of the presentation of the petition. [172A-C]
