 The petitioner, an Excise Sub-Inspector, was charged with the offence of accepting an amount of Rs. 50,000 as illegal gratification from an arrack contractor. The defence of the petitioner was that the Contractor offered him the said amount towards arrears of rental, stating that he could not deposit the amount in Bank since the banking hours were over on that day. Despite his refusal to accept the same and requesting that it may be remitted in Bank the following day, the Contractor placed the cover containing the said amount on the table of the petitioner, it was claimed. The trial court disbelieved the defence version and convicted the petitioner and sentenced him to undergo two years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 2000 and in default thereof, to undergo 2 months simple imprisonment.
 On appeal, the High Court confirmed the conviction and sentence awarded by the trial court. Aggrieved against the said order, the petitioner has preferred the present special leave petition, raising the same grounds as were urged before the Courts below.
 Dismissing the special leave petition, this Court, Held : 1.1. It remains undisputed that an amount of Rs.
 50,000 was recovered from the possession of the accused, lying on a tea-poy in a room of office-cum-residence of the accused. In view of the fact that on washing the hands of the accused by a solution of sodium carbonate, the water turned pink, it leaves no manner of doubt that the amount of Rs. 50,000 359 was touched and handled by the accused. Under the Excise Rules, the accused-petitioner had no right or authority to accept any arrears of rentals of an excise contract. Even if the bank was closed as suggested by the accused, there was no question of accepting such amount by the accused as the rentals could have been deposited by the Contractor in the bank when it opened. Once the amount of Rs. 50,000 is found in the possession of the accused, the burden shifts on him to explain the circumstances to prove his innocence as contemplated under Section 4 of the Prevention of Corruption Act. [362 C-E] 1.2. Even if the statements of the prosecution witnesses who were declared hostile are excluded from consideration, it would not make any difference in believing the substratum of the prosecution story. [362 B,C] 
 2. The circumstance that the Contractor was inimical and had an axe to grind inasmuch as he was instrumental in getting the petitioner transferred and such transfer was subsequently stayed by the Administrative Tribunal, has been considered be the High Court and it rightly took the view that such circumstance cannot improbablise the demand and acceptance of the illegal gratification by the patitioner.
 The conviction is based on concurrent findings of fact and appreciation of evidence. Both the trial court as well as the High Court have considered the facts and circumstances of the case in detail and have placed reliance on the prosecution witnesses and there is no ground or justification to take a different view. [362 F-H; 363A] 
 3. There is no ground or justification to reduce the sentence awarded to the petitioner, in the facts and circumstances of the case.
