 Section 6 of the Cochin University Act, 1971, read as a whole, indicates that it was meant to eliminate unjustifiable discrimination. Section 6(2) lays down the mandatory duty upon the University to observe cls. (a), (b) and (c) of Rule 14 of ' ha Kerala State Subordinate Service Rules muiatis mutandis. Rule 14 lays down rule of rotation in making appointments. Clause (C) of the Rule lays down a scheme of rotation for every block of 20 vacancies, the first vacancy to be filled by open competition. The Syndicate of the University passed a resolution in 1972 providing that the rules mentioned in s. 6(2) be implemented in the case of teaching staff as a class, except in the case of post of Professor which shall be filled up exclusively in consideration of merit and that the reservation quota against this category should be provided additionally in the category of Readers, Lecturers etc. taken collectively.
 The first respondent applied for the post of Reader in the department of Hindi, and though he ranked first. the post was given to another who was a member of the backward class.
 'The respondent filed a writ petition sad High Court allowed it.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) Section 6(2) does not indicate the manner in which the clarification of members of service under the University has to be made for the purpose of applying the rules mentioned therein, but, inasmuch as every statutory power has to be exercised reasonably, the classification has to be reasonable.
 [533C] (2) Though rule 14(c) does not specifically say that the rule of rotation will be applied in the order in which vacancies occur, by necessary implication, the rule is intended to be so applied. That being the object of the rule the rule must have been intended to operate with reference to the dates on which the vacancies occur and not with reference to some other events. Though the rules were made by the Government in 1967, for the purpose of applying the rules to the Universiry the rotation could only be applied to vacancies existing on the date when the Act came into force and in the order in which the vacancies had occurred. [533E-IH] (3) The Syndicate of the University appointed a Standing Committee to draw up the list of vacancies at the time when the Act came into force and the list indicates that the vacancy of a Reader in the department of Hindi was the first to occur. [534A-B; 535A-B] (4) The High Court was right in holding that the power to apply the rules mutatis matandis does not include the power of amending the substantial provisions in the rules. The power of the University is confined to making only what are necessary adaptations so as to make the rules, applicable to those in the service of the University in place of the government servants for whom they were promulgated. It could include a power to ignore only such parts as may be inapplicable or in conflict with the Act itself. The Syndicate could not, in any case, alter the provisions of s.
 6(2) of the Act itself which made it incumbent on the University to apply the rotation rule as contemplated under the rules to every service, class or category under the University. If the post of Reader in the department of Hindi was the first to arise in service under the University an application of the rotation principle would compel the first appointment to take place on the basis of an open competition.That principle could certainly not be modified by the University by taking shelter behind the words mutatis mutandis. [535D-H] 527 (5) The resolution of 1972 is on the face of it partly Invalid by attempting to place appointment to the post of a Professor outside the reservation and rotation rules altogether, and it is ambiguous irk its exact meaning. The second part seems resigned to provide for other backward classes a compensatory quota of reserved appointments in a category other than of Professors in-lieu of the removal of post of Professors from subjection to the rules, The second part is apparently a consequence of the exclusion of the professors from the operation of the rules, which is itself not permissible, and not an adaptation for the purpose of applying the rules to the University. The two parts are inseparable and therefore the whole resolution is invalid. [536F-537C] (6) The appointee as well as the respondent are now both holding posts of readers in the Hindi Department as the needs of the University have expanded; but it is necessary to determine the order of their appointments after the University has laid down its own method of reasonable classification either of the whole teaching staff of the University collectively or by putting various categories of the teaching stat into separate compartments for the applications of the rules. The University may treat all the teaching posts as belonging to one class for the application of the rules. On the other hand, it may treat only post of readers in all subjects or in a particular subject as a category by itself for the application of the rules. But it cannot exempt any class or category such as professor from the operation of the rules altogether. It is desirable that the University should be left to make its own reasonable classification in accordance with these Principles and to determine which of the two readers was entitled to be appointed earlier.
