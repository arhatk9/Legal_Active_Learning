 The respondent having secured the highest votes in the 1984 general elections was declared elected as a Member of the Lok Sabha from the Amethi Constituency of Uttar Pradesh.
 On the last date for challenging the election, the appellant, an elector from that constituency filed an election petition challenging the election of the respondent alleging various corrupt practices. The respondent upon being served, instead of filing a written statement, raised preliminary objection to the maintainability of the petition contending that the petition was lacking in material facts and particulars and was defective on that account, and that since it did not disclose any cause of action it deserved to be dismissed.
 The High Court upheld the preliminary objection of the respondent and dismissed the petition.
 In the appeal to this Court on behalf of the appellant it was contended : (1) that where the legislature wanted to provide for summary dismissal of the election petition, the legislature has spoken on the matter and that the intention was to provide for summary dismissal only in case of failure to comply with the requirement of sections 81, 82 and 117 and not section 83; (2) that the powers to reject an election petition summarily under the provisions of the Code of Civil 783 Procedure should not be exercised at the threshold, and that the Court must proceed with the trial, record the evidence, and only after the trial of the election petition is concluded that the powers under the Code of Civil Procedure for dealing with the defective petition which does not disclose cause of action should be exercised.
 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD : 1. The results of an election are subject to judicial scrutiny and control only with an eye on two ends.
 First, to ascertain that the 'true' will of the people is reflected in the results and second, to secure that only the persons who are eligible and qualified under the Constitution obtain the representation. In order that the "true will" is ascertained the Courts will step in to protect and safeguard the purity of Elections, for, if corrupt practices have influenced the result, or the electorate has been a victim of fraud or deception or compulsion on any essential matter, the will of the people as recorded in their votes is not the 'free and true' will exercised intelligently by deliberate choice. It is not the will of the people in the true sense at all. And the Courts would, therefore, be justified in setting aside the election in accordance with the law if the corrupt practices are established. So also when the essential qualifications for eligibility demanded by the constitutional requirement are not fulfilled, the fact that the successful candidate is the true choice of the people is a consideration which is totally irrelevant notwithstanding the fact that it would be virtually impossible to re-enact the elections and reascertain the wishes of the people at the fresh elections, the time scenario having changed. [788 B-F] 
 1.1 In matters of election the will of the people must prevail and Courts would be understandably extremely slow to set at naught the will of the people truely and freely exercised. If Courts were to do otherwise, the Courts would be pitting their will against the will of the people, or countermanding the choice of the people without any object, aim or purpose. But where corrupt practices are established the result of the election does not echo the true voice of the people. The Courts would not then be deterred by the aforesaid considerations which in the corruptior-scenario lose 784 relevance. Such would be the approach of the Court in an election matter where a corrupt practice is established.
 [788 F-H; 789 A] 
 2. Undisputedly, the Code of Civil Procedure applies to the trial of an election petition by virtue of section 87 of the Representation of People Act of 1951, and so the Court trying the election petition can act in exercise of the powers of the Code including Order 6, Rules 16 and Order 7, Rule 11(a). The fact that a reference to section 83 does not find a place in section 86 of the Act does not mean that power under the Civil Procedure Code cannot be exercised.
 [792 D-E; 793 F] 
 3. An election petition can be summarily dismissed if it does not furnish cause of action in exercise of the powers under the Code of Civil Procedure. So also appropriate orders in exercise of powers under the Code of Civil Procedure can be passed if the mandatory requirement enjoined by section 83 of the Act to incorporate the material facts in the election petition are not complied with. [794 F-H] 
 3.1 Even in an ordinary Civil litigation the Court readily exercises the power to reject a plaint if it does not disclose any cause of action, or the power to direct the concerned party to strike out unnecessary, scandalous, frivolous or vexatious parts of the pleadings. Or such pleadings which are likely to cause embarassment or delay the fair trial of the action or which is otherwise an abuse of the process of law. An order directing a party to strike out a part of the pleading would result in the termination of the case arising in the context of said pleading. The Courts in exercise of the powers under the Code of Civil Procedure can also treat any point going to the root of the matter such as one pertaining to jurisdiction or maintainability as a preliminary point and can dismiss a suit without proceeding to record evidence and hear elaborate arguments in the context of such evidence, if the Court is satisfied that the action would terminate in view of the merits of the preliminary point of objection. Such being the position in regard to matters pertaining to ordinary Civil litigation, there is greater reason why in a democratic set-up, in regard to a matter pertaining to an elected representative of the people which is likely to inhibit him in the discharge of his duties towards the Nation, the controversy is set at rest at the earliest if the facts of the case and the law so warrant. [795 H; 796 A- C; 797 D-E] 785 
 3.2 Since the Court has the power to act at the threshold, the powers must be exercised at the threshold itself in case the Court is satisfied that it is a fit case for the exercise of such power and that exercise of such power is warranted under the relevant provision of law. [797 E-F] 
 4. All the primary facts which must be proved by a party to establish a cause of action or his defence are material facts. The omission of a single material fact would lead to an incomplete cause of action and an election petition without the material facts relating to a corrupt practice is not an election petition at all. [795 B-C; A-B] 
 4.1 Whether in an election petition a particular fact is material or not and as such required to be pleaded is dependent on the nature of the charges levelled and the circumstances of the case. All the facts which are essential to clothe the petition with complete cause of action must be pleaded and failure to plead even a single material fact would amount to disobedience of the mandate of s. 83(1)(a).
 An election petition, therefore, can be and must be dismissed if it suffers from any such vice. [795 C-D] Hardwari Lal v. kanwal Singh, [1972] 2 S.C.R. 742, Samant N. Balkrishna & Anr. v. George Fernandez & Ors., [1969] 3 S.C.C. 239, Udhav Singh v. Madhav Rao Scindia Popatlal Manilal Joshi & Ors., [1969] INSC 2; [1969] 3 S.C.R. 217, relied upon.
 
 5. The pleading in regard to matters where there is scope for ascribing an alleged corrupt practice to a returned candidate in the context of a meeting of which dates and particulars are not given would tantamount to failure to incorporate the essential particulars. And inasmuch as there was a possibility that witnesses could be procured in the context of a meeting at a place or date convenient for adducing evidence, the High Court should not even have permitted evidence on that point. No amount of evidence could cure the basic defect in the pleading and the pleading as it stood must be construed as one disclosing no cause of action. [806 E-G] Nihar Singh v. Rao Birendra Singh, [1970] 3 S.C.C. 239, relied upon.

 6. In the instant case, on a scrutiny of the averments made in the Election Petition it is evident that it is not pleaded as to who had distributed the pamphlets, when they were distributed, where they were distributed, to whom they were distributed, and in whose presence they were distributed. The pleading is ominously silent on these aspects. It has not even been pleaded that any particular person with the consent of the respondent or his election agent distributed the said pamphlets. The pleading, therefore, does not spell out a cause of action. [818 E-G] 
 7. The election petition, in the instant case, was filed on the last day on which the election petition could have been presented. Having regard to the rigid period of limitation prescribed by section 81 of the Act, it could not have been presented even on the next day. Such being the admitted position, it would make little difference whether the High Court used the expression 'rejected' or dismissed'.
 It would have had some significance if the petition was 'rejected' instead of being 'dismissed' before the expiry of the limitation inasmuch as a fresh petition which contained material facts and was in conformity with the requirements of law and which disclosed a cause of action could have been presented 'within' the period of limitation. The High Court was, therefore, perfectly justified in dismissing the petition. And it makes no difference whether the expression employed in 'dismissed' or 'rejected' for nothing turns on whether the former expression is employed or the latter.
 [821 H; 822 A-D] 
 8. The expression 'corrupt practice' employed in the Act would appear to be rather repulsive and offensive. It can perhaps be replaced by a natural and unoffensive expression such as 'disapproved practices'. [822 D-E]
