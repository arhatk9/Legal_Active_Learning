 The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation published, under s. 22 of the Bombay Town Planning Act, 1954, a declaration of its intention to make a town planning scheme in respect of certain areas which included the lands of the petitioners.
 The petitioners submitted their objections and suggestions.
 A draft Town Planning Scheme was published thereafter under s. 23 (1) and the petitioners again submitted the same objections. After considering the objections and suggestions, the draft scheme was forwarded to the State Government under s. 28(1). The State Government sanctioned the scheme under s. 28(2) and appointed a Town Planning Officer under s. 31(1). He issued a public notice inviting objections and suggestions from owners of land and the petitioners reiterated their objections. The Town Planning Officer, thereafter, -aye his decision under s. 32 regarding the value of the land originally owned by the petitioners, the extent of reconstituted land allotted to them, the compensation payable to them, the value of the land allotted to them taking into account the improvements in the Scheme and the net amount payable by the petitioners as their share of the contribution towards the cost of the Scheme. As a result of the decision, the petitioners were allotted a much smaller extent of land than they originally owned and were directed to pay certain sums as their share of the con- tribution. On appeal under s. 34 the Board of Appeal slightly reduced the amount payable by the petitioners. The petitioners thereupon filed a writ petition in this Court and contended that : (1) the State Legislature was not competent to enact the statute, and (2) the provisions Of the Act, by conferring arbitrary powers on the authorities functioning under the Act and by depriving the petitioners of theirproperty,infringed their fundamental rights under Arts. 14, 19(1)(f) and 31.
 
HELD : (1) The heads of legislation in the Lists of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution should be given a large and liberal interpretation unless cut down by the terms of the item itself or by other part,,; of the Constitution, so that, they may have effect in their widest amplitude.
 Therefore, the various aspects dealt with in the Act can be considered to deal with "land" in Entry 18 of List II and the competency of the State Legislature can be found in that entry. [78 F-G; 79 A, C-D, G] Navinchandra Mafatlal V. Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay City, [1955] 1 S.C.R. 829, Sri Ram Ram Narain Medhi v. State of Bombay [1959] Supp. 1 S.C.R. 489 and Atma Ram v. State of Punjab, [1959] Supp. 1 S.C.R. 748, followed, 66 The Act is a legislation to consolidate and amend the law for the making and execution of town planning schemes for the healthy and orderly development of the area. With a view to achieve that purpose, a very elaborate procedure and machinery is prescribed in the Act. Therefore, the competency of the State Legislature could also be rested on Entry No. 20 of List III, which deals with "Economic and Social Planning". [79 G-H; 80 H] (2)The Act and the Rules make very elaborate provisions regarding the formalities to be gone through, at every stage, by the local authority, the State Government and other authorities concerned in preparing and making final the Town Planning Scheme. At all stages, very wide pub- licity is given to the proposals. Provision has been made for the filing of objections and suggestions and a duty is cast on the authorities to take them into account. The procedure to be adopted by the Town Planning Officer in the matter of giving his decisions on the various aspects has been indicated in s. 32 and in the Rules made under the Act.
 Principles have also been laid down regarding the fixing of the value of the original and the reconstituted plots., and for fixing the amount of contribution payable by the various owners of land. The contribution was payable in easy instalments and was towards the cost of the scheme which the local authority had to incur and was not a tax or fee. All important decisions of the Town Planning Officer are appealable to a Board of Appeal presided over by a Judicial Officer of the status of a District Judge, and the procedure to be adopted by the Board is also clearly indicated in the Act and Rules. Therefore, the Act does not vest any arbitrary or unguided power in the authorities and only imposes reasonable restrictions on the petitioners' right to hold property. Hence, the Act is not violative of Art. 14 and is saved by Art. 19(5). [71 C-D; 82 A-D, H; 83 A-B, G] The petitioners have no doubt lost a large extent of land.
 But. having due regard to the scheme of the Act and the object sought to be achieved, such results are inevitable.
 Moreover, the reconstituted plots, though of a lesser area have a higher value in view of the various improvements, and so what the petitioners lost in actual area had been more than sufficiently compensated by the increased value.
 Therefore,, there is no question of any deprivation of property so as to attract Art. 31. [83 D-F]
