 The petitioner appellant purchased groundnuts mostly from cultivators for the manufacture of oil. Relying on decisions of the Madhya Pradesh and Punjab High Court he contended that groundnuts were not oilseeds and thus not liable to be subjected to purchase-tax under the UP. Sales Tax Act. The Allahabad High Court rejected the contention.
 In appeal by certificate, 
HELD : In finding out the true meaning of term 'oilseeds' found in the Sales-Tax law in question the Court must refer not to the, dictionary meaning but the meaning ascribed to the term in commercial parlance. There can hardly be any doubt that in commercial articles ground nut is dealt with as oilseed. The commercial journals refer to groundnuts as a species of oilseeds, [547D-F] Commissioner of Sales Tax, Madhya Pradesh, Indore v. Jaswant Singh Charan Singh, (19 S.T.C. 469), relied on.
 A seed is one which germinates. It is not disputed that the groundnut germinates. Hence it is undoubtedly seed. It is mostly used for the manufacture of groundnut oil which is an edible oil. The decision relied on by the appellant must accordingly be held to be wrong and the appeal must be dismissed. [547F-G] Commissioner of Sales Tax, Madhya Pradesh, Indore v. Bakhat Rai & Co. (18 S.T.C. 285) and Hans Rai Choudhri v. J. S.
 Rajyana, Excise and Taxation Officer, (19 S.T.C. 489), disapproved.
