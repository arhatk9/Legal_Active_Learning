 Before the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1955, it had been held by this Court in Bhanit Munji's case [1955] 1 S.C.R. 777 and other earlier cases, that both clauses (1) and (2) of the, Art. 31 of the Constitution dealt with a law giving power to the State 'to acquire or requisition property I , and that, Art. 19 ( 1) (f ) was not attracted to such a law. After the Amendment, in Kochuni's case [1960] 3 S.C.R. 887, this Court held that of the Art.- 31 alone dealt with acquisition and requisition of property by the, State., that cl. (1) dealt with, deprivation of property in other ways, and that, a law under cl. (1) had to satisfy the test of reasonablenss under Art. 19(1). The court also observed that Bhanji Munii's case "no longer holds the field". This Court, in Babu Barkva Thakur's case, [1961] 1 S.C.R. 128, decided after Kochuni's case held that an Act providing for acquisition or requisition of property by the State could not be attacked for the, reason that it, offended Art. 1.9 (I.) (f).
 The appellant's land was requisitioned under the West Bengal Land (Requisition and Acquisition) Act, 1948 and she questioned the validity of the Act by a writ petition in the High Court on the ground that it offended Art.19(1) (f).
 The High court followed the decision in Barkvao Thakur's case and dismissed the petition.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended, that Barkva Thakur's case Was based on Bhanj Munji's case which had lost its authority in view of Kochuni's case and that therefore, should not have been followed.
 
HELD:Kochuni's. case was not concerned with a law of requisition or acquisition- Therefore, the observation in that case has to be understood as only meaning that Bhanii Munji's case no longer,govems.a case of deprivation of property by means other than requisition and acquisation by the State. There is thus no conflict between Birkva Thaur's case and kochuni's case with respect to acquisition and requisition of property by the State under Art.-, 31(2) and;
 therefore the validity of an Act relating to acquisitioa or requisition cannot be questioned on the ground that it offends Art. 19(1) (f) and need not be tested by the criterion in Art. 19(5).[951 F-H; 952 B-C]
