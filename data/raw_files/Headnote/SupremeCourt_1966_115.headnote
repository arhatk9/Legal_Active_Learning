 Per Mudholkar, J.: Under s. 354 of the Indian Penal Code, while the individual reaction of the victim to the act of the accused would be irrelevant, when any act done to or in the presence of a woman is clearly suggestive of sex according to the common notions of mankind, that act must fall within the mischief of the section and would, constitute an offence under the section. [293 A-C] Since the action of the accused (respondent) in interfering with and thereby causing injury to the vagina of the child, who was seven and half months old, was deliberate, he must be deemed to have intended to outrage her modesty. [293 C] Per Bachawat J: The essence of a woman's modesty is her sex.
 Even a female of tender age from her very birth possesses the modesty which is the attribute of her sex. Under the section the culpable intention of the accused is the crux of the matter. The reaction of the woman is very relevant, but its absence is not always decisive.
 The respondent is punishable for the offence under the section because, by his act he outraged and intended to outrage whatever modesty the little victim was possessed of.
 [293 F; 294 B-C] Per Sarkar, C.J., (dissenting): Under the section the accused would be guilty of an offence if he assaults or uses criminal force "intending to outrage or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby outrage" the modesty of a woman.
 This intention or knowledge is the ingredient of the offence and not the woman's feelings or reaction. The test therefore. would be whether a reasonable man will think that the act of the offender was intended to or was known to be likely to outrage the modesty of the woman. [288 B, F].
 In the present case, there could be no question of the accused having intended to outrage the modesty of the child or having known that his act was likely to have that result, because, though the victim is a "woman" under the Penal Code, no reasonable man would say that a female child of that age was possessed of womanly modesty.
