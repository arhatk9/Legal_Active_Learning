 Appellant was a Clerk in the Treasury at Ludhiana., He filed a suit for three different reliefs to which only one that now survives is regarding the order withholding his increment for one year with cumulative effect. On 10-11-61 he was charged sheeted on the ground that he was disobedient to his superior and negligent in the discharge of his duties and a few specific instances of his carelessness and negligence were mentioned in the chargesheet. Thereafter the appellant submitted his explanation and a personal hearing was also given to him by the authorities. The appellant com- plained that he was not given any opportunity to adduce any evidence in defence and no prosecution witnesses were examined in his presence. The contentions of the appellant are that (i) by the failure to give him a copy of the report of the Treasury Officer who made a local inquiry, and taking it into consideration behind his back, be has been pre- judiced and (ii) Rule 8 of the Punjab Civil Services (Punishment and Appeal) Rules 1952 has been contravened.
 Rule 8 provides, inter alia, that no order for censure, withholding of increments, recovery from pay of any pecuniary loss to the Govt., shall be passed imposing a penalty on a Govt. Servant, unless he has been given to make,- and such representation has been taken into consideration. Dismissing the appeal.
 
HELD : (i) Under Rule 8 of the Punjab Civil Service (Punishment and Appeal) Rules 1952, the only requirement is that the officer concerned should be given an adequate opportunity of making any representation that he may desire to make. There is no provision for examination of witnesses, cross examination of witnesses and furnishing a copy of the report of the enquiry officer etc. He need not be told about the punishment which is sought to be imposed on him, either at the time the chargesheet was served on him or at any other stage. In the present case, these was, no failure to follow the relevant rules, which only require that the officer concerned should have an opportunity of making a representation in respect of the charges made against him and the officer concerned had an opportunity to make a representation and his representation was considered by the authorities in taking disciplinary action against him.
 (ii The rules of natural justice have also not been violated in the present case. The requirements of the rules of natural justice are :-(a) the person accused should know the nature of the accusation made; (b) that he should be given an opportunity to state his case; and (iii) that the tribunal should act in good faith Byrne & another v.
 Kinematograph Rentery Society Ltd., [1958] A.E.R. 579, referred, to. [646 A-B] 638 (iii)In any proceedings even by a domestic tribunal, the rules of natural justice would have to be observed; but the principles to be applied would depend upon the circumstances of each case.
 (iv)In the present case, the principle of natural justice had not been violated because the appellant was not given an opportunity to make a representation. in respect of the Treasury Officer's report. When the authorities wanted a local enquiry to be made, it was with a view to check up with records the representation made by the appellant. The report does not add one single instance more than what is already found in the allegations. If the report had contained any material extraneous to the charges against the appellant then only he could be said to have been prejudiced. The report merely sets up the evidence in support of the allegation,,;. Therefore. the appellant has not been prejudiced by the Treasurv Officer's report being taken into consideration before the order of punishment was passed against the petitoner. [646 H; 647 A-B]
