 The Labour Court, Delhi, made an award framing gratuity scheme, one of the provisions being that on the termination of service by the company, the workmen shall be entitled to half a month's basic salary or wage for each year of completed service as gratuity. The respondent who was retrenched had received compensation under S. 25F of the Industrial Disputes Act made an application under s. 33C of the Act claiming the gratuity in accordance with the scheme in addition to the retrenchment compensation already received. The contention of the appellant was that the gratuity which the respondent claims was in essence the same thing as compensation for the retrenchment and to allow gratuity in addition to the retrenchment compensation under s. 25F would be to give double benefit for the same event, i. e., retrenchment :
 Held, that whether retrenched workmen can claim the benefit of a gratuity scheme in addition to the retrenchment compen- sation would depend on the construction of the material terms of 509 the scheme considered in the light of s. 25F of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The reasonable conclusion from the present scheme is that the gratuity that could be claimed under the award was intended to be in addition to the retrenchment compensation and not in lieu thereof. The respondent was entitled to such gratuity even though he had already received payment of compensation for retrenchment in accordance with the provisions of S. 25F of the Act.
