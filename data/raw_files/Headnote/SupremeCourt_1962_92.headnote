 The Central Government under s.5 of the Provident Funds Act, 1952, published a Scheme under the Act for the establishments of the Provident Fund. Paragraph 2(f) (iii) of the Scheme defined "Excluded Employees" meaning employees employed by or through a contractor. Section 6 of the Act and paras. 30 to 32 of the scheme provided for the employer making contribution to the fund and the combined effect of s.6 and paras. 30 to 32 of the Scheme is that the contribution to the Provident Fund is to be 12-1/2% of the basic wages and dearness allowance, that is to be borne equally by the employer and the employee and that the employer is to a the whole or it, half on his account, and the other half on account of the employee and he is to recouple himself by deducting it from the wages of the employee. Paragraph 26 of the Scheme provided that every employee in a factory or establishment other than excluded employee shall be regarded to become a member of the fund if he has completed one years continuous service.
 The Government by Notification No. S.R.O. 351 dated January 15, 1958, amended Para. 2(f)(iii) of the Scheme, whereby.
 all employees employed by contractor who were directly connected with any manufacturing process carried out in a factory or establishment became entitled to the benefit by the Act. Another Notification No. G. R. E. 1457 dated December 2, 1960 repeated the said para. 2(f)(iii) added a new para. 73A. This amendment had the effect of abolishing the distinction between the workmen employed by the contractors who were directly connected with the manufac- turing process in the factory or establishment, and those who were not so connected all of whom became entitled to the 838 benefit of the Scheme. The authorities issued notice on the petitioner to comply with the changes introduced by the amendments.
 The petitioner filed petition under Art.32 of the Constitu- tion challenging the validity of the two notifications as unreasonable restrictions and not falling within Art. 19(6) and that they should be struck down as infringing Art.
 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.
 Held, that the Notification dated January 15. 1958 and December 21, 1960 are unconstitutional and void.
 Section 6(1) of the Act is to make the employer liable only for a moiety of the provident fund and while the scheme of 1952 is well designed to carry out this intentions in its application to workmen directly employed, by reasons of the combined operation of paras. 30 and 32, it breaks down in its extension to contract labour by reason of the inapplicability of para. 32. It operates unfairly and harashly on persons who employ contract labour and it further results in discrimination between those who employ contract labour and those who employ direct labour. The scheme therefore cannot be said to be reasonable and must be struck down as not falling within the protection afforded by. Art. 19(6).
