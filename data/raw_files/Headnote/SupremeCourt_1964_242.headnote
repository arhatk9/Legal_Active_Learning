 The assessee, a limited company carrying on the business of manufacturing textile goods, tiles and other commodities, at Kanpur, applied for registration under s. 7 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, and requested that certain goods be specified in its certificate of registration for the purpose of getting benefit under s. 8(1) of the Act. According to s. 8(3)(b) of the Act read with r. 13 framed under the Act the assessee could get the aforesaid benefit in respect of goods which were "intended for use in the manufacture or processing of goods for sale". The Sales Tax Officer at first accepted the assessee's claim in respect of all the goods as requested by the assessee but later on directed that certain goods, namely, "drawing material, photographic material, building materials including lime and cement (except cement used in manufacture of tiles for resale), electricals, iron and steel, and coal", be deleted from the assessee's certificate of registration. Against this order the assessee filed a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution. The High Court, dismissing the petition, held that drawing materials, photographic materials, colour, chemicals, electricals machinery and building materials such as cement and lime were not comprehended in the expression "in the manufacture or processing of goods for sale" within the meaning of s. 8(3) (b) read with r. 13. The assessee appealed to this Court.
 
HELD : It was not open to the High Court to expand the scope of the petition challenging the correctness of the order of the Sales Tax Officer, and to deal with matters which were never in issue or to decide that other categories of goods (colour, chemicals, machinery etc.), which the Sales Tax Officer had not ordered to be deleted, did not fall within the terms of s. 8 (3) (b) read with r. 13. [903 E] Where any particular process is so integrally connected with the ultimate production of goods that but for that process, manufacture or processing of goods would be impossible or commercially inexpedient, goods required in that process would fall within the expression "in the manufacture of goods". For goods to answer that description, it is not necessary that they must of necessity be goods which are used as "ingredient or commodity in the creation of goods", or which are "directly and actually needed for turning out or making of the goods." [905 F-G] Applying the above test, drawing and photographic materials used for the making of designs for cloth to be manufactured by the company, and electrical equipment necessary for the production of goods e.g., humidifiers, exhaust fans etc., are which qualify for special treatment under s. 8(1). But electrical equipment which is not directly connected with the process 901 of manufacture such as fans, coolers, air-conditioning units, and building material including lime and cement not required in the manufacture of tiles for sale, would not fall under that category. [907 F-G; 908 A-B) Indian Copper Corporation Ltd. v. Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Bihar and Others relied on.
