 The appellant filed a suit on a duly completed policy of fire insurance and an unstamped letter of cover in respect of the same kind of insurance, issued by the respondent, to recover from it the loss suffered as a result of the destruction of the insured goods by fire. The respondent admitted liability on the policy but with regard to the letter of cover it contended that the letter was not admissible evidence for want of stamp.
 Held : Per Sarkar and Shah JJ. (i) A letter of cover no doubt contains a contract of insurance but it is not a policy of insurance and cannot be admitted in evidence as such under s. 35 of the Stamp Act.
 The Citizens Insurance Co. of Canada v. William Parsons, 7 A.C. 96.
 (ii) The proper construction of the General Exemption in Art. 47 of schedule 1 of the Stamp Act is that a letter of cover is not exempt from duty only when it is used for compelling the delivery of the policy mentioned in it. If it is used for any other purpose it is not exempted. When it is not so exempt it is an instrument chargeable with duty under s. 3 of the Stamp Act and admissible 1048 on evidence on payment of the requisite duty and penalty under 35 of the Act.
 Per Raghubar Dayal J. (dissenting):- Section 35 contemplates letters of cover to bear the necessary stamp at the time of execution and that any subsequent affixing of requisite stamp on an unstamped letter of cover will not make it a document which can be used for any purpose including the basing of a claim. Theproviso to the General Exception cannot be construed to mean that subsequent to the execution of a letter of cover anyplace standing to gain thereby may just put the requisite stamp on it and thereafter use it for enforcing any claim for any purpose.
