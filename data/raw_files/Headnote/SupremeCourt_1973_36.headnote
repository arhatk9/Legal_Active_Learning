 A partition suit between K and his brothers was compromised on July 4, 1947 and different schedules were prepared for the property ,allotted to the sharers. However none of the parties to the compromise produced the necessary stamp paper as directed by the Court, and no decree was drawn up by the Court. The present suit was filed by the successors-in- interest of K. for possession of certain property which under the aforesaid compromise had fallen to the share of K.
 Defendants 1 and 2 contended that K while he was alive executed a hukumanama in their favour and they were put in possession of the plaint property as lessees, and so they were entitled to retain possession. They further contended that the suit was barred by limitation and also by section 47 of the Civil Procedure Code. The Trial Court decreed the suit. The decree was confirmed in appeal. In second appeal the High Court held that the plaintiff should have paid stamp fee and got the decree drawn up in the partition suit and executed it- and go the suit was barred by sec. 47 of Civil Procedure Code. The Court further held that since the plaint property had vested in the Bihar Government under the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1959 the plaintiffs were not entitle to maintain the suit. The High Court accordingly allowed the appeal and dismissed the suit. In appeal by special leave to this Court two questions that arose for consideration were : (1) whether the suit was barred by section 47 of the Civil Procedure Code and (2) whether under the provisions of the Reforms Act the plaint property had vested in the Government and therefore the plaintiffs were incompetentto maintain the suit.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) It was clear from the compromise petition thatthe defendants were permitted to occupy the plaint property untilthe structure which was constructed in the property was removed by them. They no doubt remained in physical possession but that was not with any intention to possess the property for themselves, but because they were permitted to remain in possess-ion until the structure constructed by them was removed. The only right which they claimed in the written statement was that they were tenants under K by virtue of the. hukumnama executed by him in their favour. At no time they asserted or claimed any right to remain in possession otherwise than as tenant. 'Their case that K put them in possession was found against them by the Trial as well as the First Appellate Court. But that would not in any way affect the permissive nature of their possession after the compromise. Therefore it must be held that K was in constructive possession of the property after the compromise and the suit for recovery of khas possession was not barred by section 47 of the Civil Procedure Code.
 [565CE] 563 (ii)The High Court wrongly took the View that since K was not in possession of the property at the time the property vested in the State he was not entitled to retain possession of the plaint property under s. 5 of the Bihar Land Reforms Act 1959, as a tenant under the State free of rent. There was no dispute that the plaint property answered the description of a homestead in s. 5 of the Act. The constructive possession of K was sufficient to enable him to retain possession as tenant under the section. In other words on the date of vesting of the property in the Government, K was, for the purpose of s. 5 in possession of the plaint property. Whereas s.6 speaks of khas possession section 5 speaks only of possession. On the date of vesting of the plaint property in the State K was in possession for the purpose of s. 5 and he became a tenant under the State free of rent. Accordingly the suit for recovery of possession was maintainable. [565H]
