 The now defunct Municipal Committee of Delhi resolved in November 1957 that a graduate allowance should be paid to its graduate clerks in the junior grade. The Municipal Committee was replaced by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi under Act 66 of 1957 and the Commissioner of the Corporation admitted the claim only of those graduate junior grade clerks who were granted permission to pursue higher studies before July 1954. The petitioners who were other clerical employees serving the Corporation moved the Supreme Court by a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution alleging that the order of the Commissioner was discriminatory because there was no- rational basis for excluding them from the benefits of the resolution. The respondents contended that the Chief Commissioner of Delhi by his order dated October 30, 1956, passed under s. 232 of the Punjab Municipal Act (3 of 1911), had prohibited the granting of such special pays or other pecuniary benefits and so, the impugned order being itself without jurisdiction the petitioners could not complain of being discriminated against.
 
HELD : The Order of the Chief Commissioner 'was perfectly legal and in view of that Order it was not open to the Committee to sanction the payment of any allowance to any of its employees in November 1957. The resolution being without jurisdiction, the Commissioner of the Corporation could not treat it as a basis for sanctioning the graduate allowance to a graduate employee. The order of the Com- missioner being thus illegal, no question of discrimination arises and the petition should be dismissed. [359 B-D].
 By virtue of the provisions of the Delhi Laws Act 1912, Adaptation of Laws Order, 1950, and s. 3 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, the Chief Commissioner could make the order under s. 232 of the Punjab Municipal Act, 1911. He had two sources of power under a. 232 and s. 236 and was free to avail himself of either source. Section 232 certainly empowered him to prohibit the Committee from granting special pay or other pecuniary advantage to its employees when it was "about to" do so. When the doing of an act was so prohibited, the Committee ceased to have any power to do it and a resolution passed by it that such act may be done can have no legal validity. The precise meaning that should be given to the expression "about to" depends upon the context in which it is used, but there is no difficulty in the instant case because, the order itself mentions that it was made to appear to the Chief Commissioner that the Municipal Committee was "about to" grant special pay or other pecuniary benefits to some of its employees. Though no opportunity was given to the Committee as required 'by s. 235 of the Punjab Municipal Act, the Committee can acquiesce and waive such non-compliance, and since the section does not require that an opportunity should be given to the parties affected by 351 the Order of the Chief Commissioner, they are not entitled to say the Order is bad. Further, the section would be inapplicable in a case where the Order was passed by the Chief Commissioner himself. [354DG; 355A-C.. D-F; 357D-G;
