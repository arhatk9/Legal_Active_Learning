 The Rajasthan Sales Tax Act 1954 (State Act) by Sub- section (o) of section 2 defines "sale" to mean inter alia "any transfer of property in goods for cash or for deferred payment or for any other valuable consideration. Explanation (ii) of section 2(o) provides that "a transfer of property in goods shall be deemed to have been made within the State if it fulfils the requirements of sub-sec. (2) of s. 4 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 (Central Act). Sub-s.(s) of sec.2 defines "taxable turn over" to mean "that part" of turn over which remains after deducting therefrom the aggregate amount of the proceeds of sale of goods, which have been sold to persons outside the State for consumption outside the State. Sub-s.(1) of sec.4 of the Central Act provides that subject to the provisions contained in sec.3, when a sale or purchase is determined in accordance with sub-s.2 to take place inside a State, such sale or purchase shall be deemed to have taken place outside all other States. Sub-s.(2) lays down that a sale or purchase of goods shall be deemed to take place inside a State, if the goods are within the State in the case of specified or ascertained goods, at the time the contract of sale is made.
 The appellant-assessee, a registered dealer both under the provisions of the State Act and the Central Act, purchased poppy seeds against Declarations in Form No.
 S.T.17 furnished to the 1076 selling dealers. In the Declarations in Form No. S.T.17 it was stated that the assessee was purchasing the poppy seeds for the purpose of "resale within the State". The assessee, resold the poppy seeds to different buyers under contracts executed by and between the assessee and the buyers at Bhawani Mandi. Admittedly, when these contracts were made between the assessee and the buyers, the poppy seeds forming subject matter of the contracts were specific goods in deliverable condition situate in Bhawani Mandi and the property in the poppy seeds accordingly passed to the buyers under the contracts in Bhawani Mandi. While completing the assessment of the assessee to sales tax for the assessment years 1975-76 and 1976-77, the Commercial Tax Officer included the purchase price paid by the assessee for the poppy seeds in his taxable turn over under the provisions of second proviso to cl.4 of sub-s.(s) of s.2 of the State Act on the ground that the resales of the poppy seeds effected by the assessee were sales in the course of inter-State trade and commerce and were therefore not sales within the State and hence the poppy seeds purchased by the assessee were used for a purposed other than that mentioned in the Declarations.
 Aggrieved by the aforesaid order, the assessee preferred civil appeals Nos. 207 and 208 of 1983 by special leave directly to Supreme Court. The facts of these appeals are broadly similar to the facts of the other appeals comprised in this group. Counsel on behalf of the appellant contended (i) that thought it was true that the resales effected by it were sales in course of inter-State trade or commerce as defined in sub-s.(3) of the Central Act, they were still sales within the State in accordance with the principles formulated in sub-s.(2) of sec.4 of the Central Act; (ii) that the resale by it being sales in the course of inter-State trade or commerce, were not liable to be taxed by the State and could be taxed only by the Central Government under the Central Act but that did not deprive the resales of their character of sales within the State which character attached to them by reason of sub-s.(2) of sec.4 which was incorporated in the State Act by Explanation II to sub-s.(o) of sec.2 of the State Act and (iii) that what was incorporated in Explanation II to sub-s.(o) of sec.2 of the State Act was only sub-s.(o) of sec.2 of the State Act and not sub-s.(1) of sec.4 of the Central Act and therefore the opening words in sub-s.(1) of sec.4 had no impact on the provisions enacted in the Explanation. On the other hand, counsel for the respondent Revenue argued (1) that if on an application of the principles set out in sec.3 of the Central Act, a sale was a sale in the course of inter-State trade or Commerce, it could not possibly be regarded as a sale within the 1077 State and (2) that since the resales effected by the appellant-assessee were admittedly sales in the course of inter-State admittedly sales in the course of inter-State trade or commerce, they could not be said to be resales within the State as envisaged in the Declarations in From No.ST 17.
 Allowing the appeals, ^ 
 HELD : 1. It cannot be said that the assessee used the goods for a purpose other than that mentioned in the Declarations. The assessee resold the goods within the State as mentioned in the Declarations in Form No. ST.17 furnished by him to be selling dealers. The assessments made on each assessee to the extent that the assessments sought to include in the taxable turnover the purchase price paid by the assessee in respect of the goods purchased against Declarations in Form No. ST.17 furnished to the selling dealers are set aside. [1090 D-E] 
 2. There is, no antithesis between a sale in the course of inter-State trade or commerce and a sale inside the State. Even an inter-State sale must have a situs and the situs may be in one State or another. It does not involve any contradiction in saying that an inter-state sale or purchase is inside a State or outside it. The situs of a sale may fall for consideration from more than one point of view. It may require to be considered for the purpose of determining its exigibility to tax as also for other purposes such as the one arising in the present cases. Of course, a sale which is in the course of inter-State trade or commerce cannot be taxed by a State Legislature even if its situs is within the State, because the State Legislature has no legislative competence to impose tax on sale in the course of inter-State trade or commerce. That can be done only by Parliament. If therefore a question arises whether a sale is exigible to tax by the State Legislature, it may have to be considered whether it is a sale in the course of inter-State trade or commerce. The same sale in another context may have to be examined from a different point of view for determining where its situs lies and whether it is a sale inside the State or outside the State. There is therefore no incompatibility in the same sale being both a sale in the course of inter-State trade or commerce within the meaning of sec.3 of the Central Act as also a sale inside the State in accordance with the principles laid down in sub-s. 2 of sec.4 of the Central Act. [1086 D-H; 1087 A] 
 3. It is a recognised cannon of construction that an expression used in a rule, bye law or form issued in exercise of 1078 power conferred by a statute must, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context, have the same meaning as is assigned to it under the statute. The expression "resale within the State" in Form No. ST17 must therefore be read in the light of Explanation II to sub-s. (o) of sec.2 of the State Act which lays down as to when a sale shall be deemed to have been made within the State and this provision in the Explanation must govern the determination of what is "resalw within the State" within the meaning of that expression as used in Forom No. ST17. [1087 C-E] 3.(ii) Explanation II to sub-s.(o) of sec.2 of the State Act, enacts as to when a sale shall be deemed to be a sale within the State by reference to sub-s.(2) of sec.4 of the Central Act. It is only sub-s.(o) of sec.2 which is incorporated in Explanation II to sub-s.(o) of sec.2 of the State Act and the Court is called upon to consider as to what is the effect of such incorporation. The Court is not concerned with the interpretation of sub-s.(1) or sub-s.(2) of s.4 in the context of s.3 of the Central Act. The State Legislature could have very well reproduced the entire language of sub-s.(2) of sec.4 bodily in Explanation II to sub-s.(o) of sec.2 but it preferred to employ a simplar device by incorporating by reference the provisions of sub- s.(2) of sec.4 in Explanation II to sub-s.(o) of sec.2. The rule of incorporation is that when a subsequent Act amends an earlier one in such a way as to incorporate itself, or a part of itself, into the earlier, then the earlier Act must thereafter be read and construed (except where that would lead to a repugnancy, inconsistency or absurdity) as if the altered words had been written into the earlier Act with pen and ink and the old words scored out so that thereafter there is no need to refer to the amending Act at all.
 Therefore, Explanation II to sub-s.(o) of sec.2 must be interpreted as if sub-s.(2) of sec.4 were written out verbatim in the Explanation and once sub-s.(2) of sec.4 is written out in the Explanation, there is no occasion or need to refer to the Central Act from which this incorporation is made or to its purpose or context.

 In the instant case, at the time when the contracts of resale were made by the assessee, the goods were specific ascertained goods lying at Bhawani Mandi inside the State and if that be so, the resales affected by the assessee must be deemed to have taken place inside the State on the principles laid down in sub-s.(2) of sec.4 of the Central Act as incorporated in Explanation II to sub-s.(o) of sec.2 of the State Act. It did not make any difference to this position that the resales were sales in the course of inter- State trade or commerce. The only consequence of the resales being sales in the course of inter-State trade or commerce was that they were not taxable under the State Legislation.
 [1089 F-G] Ordinarily the Supreme Court does not entertain an appeal directly against an order made by an officer in the hierarchy, when there are other remedies by way of appeal or revision provided to an assessee under the statute. However, it would be futile to drive the assessee to the procedure of appeal and revision and then a Writ Petition to the High Court when the High Court in another case has already taken the view that when a resale is made by an assessee which is in the course of inter-State trade or commerce, it cannot be regarded as a resale within the State and hence such resale would constitute a breach of the Declaration given by the assessee to the selling dealer so as to attract of the applicability and the purchase price paid by the assessee would consequently be liable to be included in the taxable turnover of the assessee.
