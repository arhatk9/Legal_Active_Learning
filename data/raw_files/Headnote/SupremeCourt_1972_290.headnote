 Prior to 1926, the enrolment of legal practitioners as advocates of Chartered High Courts, was under the Letters Patent, and, in the case of other High Courts, under s. 41 of the 'Legal Practitioners Act, 1879. The Bar Councils Act was enacted in 1926. Under s. 8 of the Act, the High Court shall prepare and maintain a roll of advocates. A fee was payable to the Bar Council in the case of persons entitled as of right to practise in the High Court immediately before the date on which the section came into force and by others who were admitted as advocates under that Act, and, in respect of the entry on the roll of the High Court, a stamp duty was payable under art. 30 of the schedule to the Indian Stamp Act 1899. [1077 D-E: 1078 F] The Advocates Act, 1961, was enacted with the main objective of the integration of Bar into a single class of legal practitioners known as advocates and the prescription of uniform qualifications for the admission of such persons to the profession. The name of an advocate was entered in the common roll of advocates prepared and maintained by the Bar Council of India, which was to comprise of entries made in all State rolls and the names of advocates, entitled as of right to practise in the Supreme Court immediately before the appointed day, whose names were not entered in any State roll., Section 22 provides that a certificate of enrolment shall be issued by the State Bar Council to the advocate whose name is in the roll maintained by it, or by the Bar Council of India when his name is entered in the common roll without being entered in any State roll. Apart from fulfilling the qualifications and the conditions laid down by the Act and the rules framed under it, the advocate had to pay, under s. 24 (1) (f), an enrolment fee of-Rs. 250/to the State Bar Council. Under the Act, only that sum was payable; and even when an advocate desires to have his name transferred from one State roll to another he could get it done without payment of any additional fee. The Act repealed s. 8 of the Bar Councils Act. After the repeal of the relevant provisions of the Bar Councils Act, and the Legal Practitioners Act, relating to admission of advocates, art. 30 of the Indian Stamp Act, had become obsolute, but different States inserted provisions levying duty on the certificate of enrolment granted under s. 22 of the Advocates Act. By the Indian Stamp (U.P. Amendment) Act, 1970, the stamp duty payable was prescribed at Rs. 250.
 [1081 C-H; 1082 A-B] A writ petition challenging the provision made by the State Legislature imposing stamp duty on the certificate of enrolment to be issued by the State Bar Council as invalid and unconstitutional in view of the provision in the Advocates Act which prescribes a fee of Rs. 250/- only for enrolment as an advocate, was allowed by a single Judge of the High Court. In appeal, the Bench set aside the judgment.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 1074 
HELD : (1) The levy of stamp duty by mean s of the Stamp Amendment Act in the State of U.P. was not covered by any of the Entries in List I and hence the State was competent to levy the duty and prescribe the rate under Entry 44, List III and Entry 63 of List 11 in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. [1086 C] (a)So far as the persons entitled to practise before the Supreme Court or the High Court, the power to legislate in regard to them was carved out from the general power in Entry 26, List 111, relating to 'Legal, Medical and other professionS" and is made the exclusive field 'for Parliament, under Entries 77 and 78 in List I.. That is, Parliament has exclusive power to prescribe, inter alia, the qualifications and conditions on the fulfilment of which.
 persons would be entitled to practise before the Supreme Court or the High Court. Any fee which may be payable by such persons before they can claim to be entitled to practise would fall under Entry 96 of that List. [1083 D-H] O. N. Mohindroo v. The Bar Council of Delhi & Ors. [1968] INSC 2; [1968] 2 S.C.R. 709, followed.
 (b)Entry 44 of List III enables legislation with regard to the levy of stamp duty but the rates of Stamp Duty can be prescribed by Parliament only with regard to instruments failing under Entry 91, List 1, and by the State Legislature under Entry 63 of List 11. if the requirement of the payment of a stamp duty on the certificate of enrolment of an advocate is a condition precedent to the conferment on a person of the privilege of audience and representing suitors before the Supreme Court and the High Court, any legislation- relating to it would be within the competence of Parliament., If, however, it is purely a taxation measure then it would fall in Entry 44 of the Concurrent List, in which event, both Parliament and the State legislature would be competent to legislate for the levy of duty, although, it is only under Entry 63 of List II that rates can be prescribed by the State legislature. The scheme of the Entries in the various lists is that taxation is not intended to be comprised in the main subject in which it might, on an extended construction, be regarded as included but is treated as a distinct matter for the purpose of legislative competence. [1083 H; 1084 A-H] (c)The scheme of the Advocates Act, to have complete uniformity involved the question of the payment which an advocate had to make for getting a certificate with regard to his entry on the roll either of the State Bar Council or the common roll of the Bar Council of India. The fee prescribed for the purpose by the Act was Rs. 250.00. But Parliament, while enacting this provision, made no provision that in addition to the fee of Rs. 250/- the advocate shall not have to pay any stamp duty which is essentially in the nature of a tax on the certificate of enrolment to be issued by the State Bar Council or exempting the advocate from the payment of stamp duty on the certificate of enrolment, which Parliament could have done under Entry 44 of List III. [1085 C-H] (d)In the absence of any such provision the position is that although the Advocates Act relates to legal practitioners, in its pith and substance, it is an enactment dealing with qualifications, enrolment, right to practise and discipline of the advocates, coming under Entries 77 and 78 of List I. The fee of Rs. 250/- which an advocate must pay under s. 24 (1) (f) of the Act is covered by Entry 96 in List I which expressly relates to fees in respect of matters in that List. But the,. stamp. duty which is payable on the certificate of enrolment pertains to the domain of taxation and it is hardly possible to regard it as a condition which can be 107 5 prescribed under the entries in List I. The imposition of such a duty falls,in pith and substance, under Entry 44 of List III and the prescribing ofrates under Entry 63 of list II. [1085 G-H] M.P. V. Sundaramier & Co. v. The State of Andhra Pradesh

 (2)Once it is held that power to tax was within the competence of the State Legislature no question of repugnancy under Art. 254 of the Constitution could arise.
 A question of repugnancy can only arise in matters where both Parliament and State Legislature have legislative competence to pass laws, that is, when the legislative power is located in the Concurrent List. Moreover, in the present case, the provisions of Art. 254(2) have been complied with inasmuch as the assent of the President had been taken while enacting the impugned Amending Act.

 Earooqi, C.A. 1572 of 1968 dt, 17-3-72, followed.
 (3)There is no substance in the argument that the levy is discriminatory. Discrimination was stated to arise in two ways : (i) An advocate in one State has to pay only the enrolment fee of Rs. 250/ and no more, whereas, in Uttar Pradesh, he has to pay not only Rs. 250/- as enrolment fee but also a stamp duty as prescribed by the Stamp Amendment Act, and (ii) when an advocate whose name is borne on the roll of the Bar Council of a State, where no duty is leviable on the certificate of enrolment, wishes to get his name transferred to the roll of the Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh lie shall have to pay the duty prescribed by the Stamp Amendment Act, while no such duty is leviable if he wishes to have his name transferred to the roll of another State where he will not have to pay the duty. But Art. 14 can have no application where the sources of authority of the Parliamentary and State legislation are different. [1087 B-E] State of Madhya Pradesh v. G. C. Mandawar, [1955] 1 S.C.R.
