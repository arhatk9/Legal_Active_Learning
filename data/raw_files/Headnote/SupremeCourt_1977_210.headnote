 The appellant who carries on the business of hardware and pipe-fitting by purchasing the good-will and the tenancy rights of the shop along with the stock-in-trade, furniture, fixture etc. from the original tenant became the tenant in shop No. 1 on the ground floor of the suit building known as "Asghar Manzil" in Nagdevi Street Bombay, "predominantly a locality for the business of hardwares and pipe-fitting".
 The eviction suit filed by the respondent in the Small Causes Court on various grounds including bonafide and reasonable requirement was dismissed. The court held that greater hardship could be caused to the tenant, if the decree of ejectment was passed. An appeal against the said order having failed, the respondent moved the High Court Art. 227. The High Court allowed it interfering with the concurrent findings of facts and held that the landlord's requirement was reasonable and bonafide and there was no question of greater hardship to the tenant.
 Allowing the tenant's appeal by special leave the Court 
HELD: 1. The limitation of the Court while exercising power under Art. 227 of the Constitution is well settled.
 Power under Art. 227 is one of judicial superintendence and cannot be exercised to upset the conclusions of facts, how- ever, erroneous these may be. [799 B-C] Waryam Singh & Anr. v. Ammarnath and Anr., [1954] INSC 4; [1954] SCR 565;
 Nagendra Nath Bora and Anr. v. The Commissioner of Hills Division and Appeals, Assam and Ors.; [1958] INSC 6; [1958] S.C.R. 1240 and Bathutmal Raichand Oswal v. Laxmibai R. Tarta and Anr., [1975] 1 S.C.C. 858 reiterated.
 (2) It is possible that another Court may be able to take a different view of the matter by appreciating the evidence in a different manner, if it is determinedly chooses to do so.
 That will not be justice administered according the law to which Courts are committed notwithstanding dissertation in season and out of season, about philosophies. [800 B] (3) In the instant case, the High Court arrogated to itself the powers of a court of appeal which it did not possess under the law and has exceeded its jurisdiction under Art.
 227 of the Constitution. There was nothing so grossly wrong and unjust or shocking the Court'$ "conscience" that it was absolutely necessary in the interest of justice for the High Court to step in under Art. 227 of the Constitution, and interfere with the conclusions of facts. [800 C-D]
