 The two petitioners have been imprisoned for seven years in various prisons on the basis that they were implicated in several cases of 1971 and 1972. In their habeas corpus petition they impugned their continued detention in prison without trial.
 Allowing the petition, ^ HELD : The petitioners should be released forthwith.
 [1109E] (1) Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure empowers the magistrate to authorise the detention of an accused in such custody as he thinks fit for a term not exceeding 15 days in the whole. The section also provides that no magistrate shall authorise the detention of the accused person exceeding 90 days in grave cases and 60 days in lesser cases, and that on the expiry of the said period the accused shall be released on bail if he is prepared to and does furnish bail. [1108H] (2) Apart from mentioning the sections in the Penal Code by way of a passport into the prison house, there is no mention of any investigation of the cases, nor was a charge sheet laid before the court against either accused. Even the Magistracy have bidden farewell to their primary obligation.
 [1108E] (3) Although in these cases many years have passed the magistrates have been mechanically authorising repeated detentions unconscious of the provisions of law. [1109B]
