 The respondent was a firm dealing in securities and was charged to income-tax under the Income-tax Act (VII of 1918). It received certain sums of money as interest oil securities in the accounting years 1946 and 1947 (assessment years 194748 and 1948-49) respectively. It discontinued its business on 30th June 1947, and, for the assessment year 1948-49, claimed exemption from taxation under s. 25(3) of the Incometax Act (XI of 1922). The income-tax officer and the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, held that, the income fell under the bead 'interest on securities" under s. 8 and not under the head "profits and gains of business, profession or vocation" under s. 10 and that therefore, the respondent was not entitled to the exemption. The Appellate Tribunal reversed that order and the High Court (by a majority) confirmed the order of the Tribunal. The Commissioner of Income-tax appealed to the Supreme Court.
 Held: The appeal should be dismissed.
 When s. 25(3) of the Indian Income-tax Act (XI of 1922) enacts that "where any business, profession or vocation on which tax was at any time charged, it is intended that the tax was at any time charged on the owner of the business.
 If that condition be fulfilled in respect of the income of the business under the Indian Income-tax Act (VII of 1918), the owner will be entitled to get the benefit of the exemption under the section if the business is discontinued.
 The section in terms refers to tax charged on any business, that is, tax charged on any person In respect of all income earned by carrying on the business. There is no reason to restrict the condition of the applicability of the exemption only to income on which tax was payable under s. 10 of the Act under the head "Profits and gains of business, profession or vocation".
