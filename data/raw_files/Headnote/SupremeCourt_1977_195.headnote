 The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation published in the Karnataka Gazette dated May 16. 1974 a draft scheme for nationalisation of contract carriages in the State. under Chapter IV-A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939. Objections were preferred by some of the respondents, but the State Government and the Corporation dropped the idea of proceeding with the scheme without concluding the hearing.
 Later, on January 30, 1976 the State Government promulgated an ordinance followed by a number of notifications by which all contract carriages operating in Karnataka, and the permits specified in the notifications, vested in the State.
 Under Clause 20(1) of the Ordinance, the State Government transferred them to the Corporation which seized the vehicles and the relative permits. The High Court stayed the seizure of six vehicles operating tinder Inter State permits, and quashed some of the notifications, holding that the ordinance did not empower the acquisition of the vehicles not covered by valid contract permits. The ordinance was replaced by the Karnataka contract carriages (Acquisition) Act, 1976, published in the Karnataka Gazette dated March 12. 1976. The Act was made effective retrospectively from January 30. 1976. and everything done under the Ordinance was deemed to have been done trade the Act. Writ Petitions were filed by various contract carriage operators, fanciers and others including those who had successfully filed the earlier Writ Petitions. The High Court allowed the writ petitions, struck down the Act as unconstitutional, and quashed the notifications. (Judgment reported in K.Jayaraj Ballal and Ors. v. State of Karnataka and Ors. I.L.R. Karnataka 1976, Vol. 26, P. 1478).
 Allowing the appeals and upholding the constitutional validity of the Act on merits, the Court 
HELD : Per Untwatia, J. (Also on behalf of M. H. Be-,, C.J., V. Y. Chandrachud, and P. S. Kailasam, JJ.) 
1. Whether the law of ocquisition is for public purpose or not has to be gathered mainly from the statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act and its preamble. The matter has to be examined with reference to the various provisions of the Act its context and set up and then it has to be judged whether the acquisition is for a public purpose within the meaning of Article 31(2) and the law providing for such acquisition while establishing a Road Transport Corporation, the State Government is obliged to keep in mind primarily the public interest. The acquisition for the purpose of the Corporation was, therefore, in public interest. [648 C-E] H. H. Keshavananda Bharathi Sripadagalavaru v. State of Kerala [1973] Suppl. S.C.R. 1, Applied.
 642 The court observed :
 There may be many circumstances and facts to justify the acquisition of even a movable property for a public purpose.
 A particular commercial activity of the State may itself be for a public purpose. In a larger sense one can say that augmentation of the coffers of the State is also for a public purpose. Acquisition of property either movable or immovable, may in such a situation be for a public purpose.

 (2) The scheme for the compulsory acquisition may be for a part of the undertaking also and that would mean a part of the property of the under taking or a branch of the undertaking [651 F-G] (3) The amount payable for the acquired property either fixed by the legislature or determined on the basis of the principles engrafted in the law of acquisition cannot be wholly arbitrary and illusory. In some respects it may be inadequate but that cannot be a ground for challenge of the constitutionality of the law under Article 31(2). [653 B-C] H. H. Keshavananda Bharati Sripadagalavaru v.

 (4) The Karnataka Contract Carriages (Acquisition) Act, 1976 does not seek to legislate in regard to any Inter-State trade and commerce. In pith and substance it is an Act to provide for the acquisition of contract carriage, the Inter- State permits and the other properties situated in the State of Karnataka. Any incidental encroachment on the topic of Inter-State trade and commerce cannot invalidate the Act.

 (5) The acquisition of permits of the vehicles kept and registered in the State of Karnataka, in respect of which initially Inter-State Permits had been granted by the State, would be an acquisition of the permit operative within the territory of the State. Permits granted by one regional Authority and counter-signed by another Regional Authority either in the same state or in different states are really different permits rolled into one. The counter-signed portion of the permit is in substance and in effect a separate permit authorising the permit holder to ply the bus in another State, and cannot be acquired. Such an acquisition would fall within the extra-territorial operation of the law. The State Govt. on acquisition and the vesting of acquired permits, therefore, cannot transfer their counter-signed portions to the Road Transport Corpora- tion. Any particular vehicle which is kept and registered, or is plying, on an initial permit granted by another State, also could not be acquired under the Act and the notification issued, thereunder.

 (6) Section 4(3) of the Karnataka contract carriages (Acquisition) Act, 1976, is worded with the object of putting the challenge to the factum of public purpose beyond the pale of any attack. The use of the word "deemed" does not invariably and necessarily imply an introduction of a legal fiction, but it has to be read and understood in the context of the whole statute. [651 A-B] (7) In the absence of an agreement, the State Government shall appoint an arbitrator for fixing the amount payable in lieu of the acquired property. The arbitrator, reading section 6(1) of the Karnataka Contract Carriages (Acquisi- tion) Act, as a whole, is not obliged to fix the amount as specified in the Schedule, but he has to fix an amount which appears to him just and reasonable on the totality of the facts and circumstances keeping primarily in mind the amount mentioned in the Schedule occurring in Sec. 6(1). [657 E-F, 658 D-E] Saraswati Industrial Syndicate Ltd., etc. v. Union of India [1974] INSC 163; [1975], 1 S.C.R. 956, Illingworth v. Walnsley (1900) 2 Q.B.

 (8) The correct meaning of "acquisition cost", used in the Explanation in the light of Para 1 (1) of the Schedule of Sec. 6 (1) of the Karnataka Act, would mean, the cost of the chassis fixed by the manufacturers for their dealers to charge from the purchasers. The acquisition cost qua the purchaser is the price which he pays to the manufacturer's dealer from whom he purchases and not the manufacturer's actual cost of manufacturing the chassis. The acquisition cost of the body of a schedule would be the actual cost charged by the body builder. [659 B--C] Per Iyer. J. (Also on behalf of P. N. Bhagwati and Jaswant Singh, JJ.) (1) The purpose of a public body to run a public transport service for the benefit of the, people, operating it in a responsible manner through exercise of public power which is controlled and controllable by society through its organs like the legislature and, at times, even the court, is manifestly a public purpose. If the purpose subserves some public use or interest, or produces some public good or utility then everything considered for subserving such public purpose falls under the broad and expanding rubric.
 If the purpose is a private or nonpublic one, the mere fact that the hand that acquires or requires is Government or a public corporation, does not make the purpose automatically a public purpose. The acquisition of road transport undertakings by the State will undoubtedly be a public purpose, and it is a fallacy to deny the presence of public purpose merely because its satisfaction by readily available private purchase is possible.

 (2) The amount Payable when private property is taken by the State is a matter of legislative policy and not of judicial fixation. The 25th, Amendment of the Constitution, while restructuring Article 31 and bringing in Article 31C, has excluded judicial examination even of the principles of evaluation.The Court can only satisfy itself about the amount not being a monstrousor unprincipled undervalue.
 The payment may be substantially less thanthe 644 market value and the principles may not be all-inclusive, but the court can upset the taking only where the principles of computation are too arbitrary and illusory to be unconscionably shocking. The quantum of the amount or the reasonableness of the principles are out of bounds for the court. [680 B, 682 C, 685 A, C, G, H.] H. H. Kesavanand Bharati Sripadagalavaru v.

 (3) Article 39(b) fulfils the basic purpose of re- structuring the economic order and undertakes to distribute the entire material resources of the community, as best to subserve the common good. To exclude ownership of private resources from its coils, is to cipherise its very purpose of redistribution the socialist way. Article 39(b) is ample enough to rope in buses, as motor vehicles, are part of the material resources of the operators. Socially conscious economists will find little difficulty in treating nationalisation of transport as a distributive progress for the good of the community. [689 C-D, E-.F. 690 0] The Court observed :
 (1) The State symbolises, represents and acts for the good of society. Its concerns are the ways of meeting the wants of the community, directly or otherwise, and the public sector in our constitutional system, is a strategic tool in' the national plan for transformation from stark Poverty to social justice, transcending administrative and judicial allergies. [672 D-E] (2) Serious constitutional problems cannot be studied in a socioeconomic vacuum, since socio-cultural changes are the source of new values. Our emphasis is on abandoning formal legalistic or sterile logomachy in assessing the vires of statutes regulating vital economic areas, and adopting instead, a dynamic, goal-based approach to problems of constitutionality. Our nation has, as its dynamic doctrine, economic democracy sans which political democracy is chimerical. The Constitution ensouls such a value system in Parts III and IV and elsewhere, and the dialectics of social justice should not be missed if their synthesis is to influence State action and Court pronouncement. Illusory compensation, nexus doctrine and 'distributed to subserve the common good, should not reduce lofty constitutional considerations into hollow concepts. [666 F, 667 A] R. S. Cooper v.

 (3) Bills without sufficient study of their economic.
 project, occasionally result in incomprehensibility and incongruity of the law for the lay and the legal. A radicalisation of the methodology and, philosophy of legal drafting, and ability for the legislative manpower to express themselves in streamlined, simple, project-oriented fashion is, therefore, essential.

 (4) Sheer legalism cannot lightly upset legislative wisdom or efficiency while passing on the constitutionality of economic legislation based on national planning, public finance, private investments, cost accounting, policy decisions historical factors and a host of complex social variables. Raw realities like poverty id stark inequalities to abolish which, Article 31(2), 31C. 38 and 39 have been enacted, must inform legal interpretation. The Courts must be circumspect not to rush in where serious reflection will make them fear to tread, not to resort to adroit circumvention because of economic allergy to a particular policy.

 (5) Part IV of the Constitution, especially Article 39(b) and (c) is futuristic mandate to the State with the message of transformation of the economic and social order. Such change calls for collaborative effort from a the legal institutions of the system: the legislature, the judiciary and the administrative machinery. The Court and counsel have a justice constituency with economic overtones, the manifesto being the constitution designed to uphold the humanist values of life, liberty and the equal pursuit of happiness, material and spiritual.
