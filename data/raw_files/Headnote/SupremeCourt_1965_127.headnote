 The appellant was appointed Manager of two evacuee shops which vested in the Custodian of Evacuee Property. The appointment was made in 1952 under s. 10(2) (b) of the Administration of Evacuee Property Act, 1950, In 1956 the appellant was informed by letter Ex. p.8 written by the Custodian of Evacuee Property that a decision to allot the shops to him had been taken and that subsequently the shops would be sold to him. The letter was based on the orders of the Chief Settlement Commissioner in Ex. p. 5. However the said decision could not be implemented and in pursuance of orders from the Chief Settlement Commissioner the Deputy Custodian by Ex. p. 13 and proceedings Ex. p. 16 cancelled the appointment of the appellant as Manager and asked him to hand over possession of the shops. The appellant tiled a writ petition in the High Court praying that the order Ex.
 p. 13 and proceedings p. 16 be quashed, that the ion of the shops be given to him, and that the sale of the shops be stopped. The High Court granted the first two prayers but not the third. Both parties appealed to a Division Bench of the High Court which held against the appellant on all these counts. By certificate under Art,. 133(1) (a) he came to the Supreme Court.
 It was contended on behalf of the appellant : (1) that he was not lawfully removed from the management of the shops as the Deputy Custodian had no power to cancel an appointment, (2) that the order of removal in Ex. 13 and Ex. 16 was made by the Managing Officer cum Deputy Custodian of Evacuee property under the Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act 1954 which conferred no power on such an officer to cancel the appointment of the manager and (3) that by virtue of Ex. p. 5 and Ex. p. 8 the shops stood allotted to the appellant.
 
HELD:(i) Section 16 of the General Clauses Act provides that the power to ternunate is a necessary adjunct of the power of appointment and is exercised as an incident to or consequence of that power. The power of appointment conferred on the Custodian under s. 10(2) (b) of the 1950 Act confers by implication upon the Custodian the power to suspend or dismiss any person appointed. It is manifest that the management of the appellant with regard to the business concerns could be lawfully terminated by the Deputy Custodian by virtue of s. 10(2) (b) of the 1950 Act read with s. 16 of the General Clauses Act. [124 F-G] (ii)The order cancelling the appellant's appointment as manager could not be said to be invalid on the ground that it purported to have been made under the 1954 Act. The Act of 1950 was not repealed by the Act of 1954 and continued in force. Under s. 10(2) (b) of the 1950 Act the Deputy Custodian is the proper authority to cancel the appointment of a manager and the order of cancellation must therefore be held to be valid. The principle is that the act of public servant must be ascribed to an actual existing authority under which it would have validy rather than one under which it would be void.

 (iii) Even onthe assumption that the order of cancellation was illegal the appellant wasnot entitled to a writ from the High Court. Writs can be issued only toenforce the performance of statutory duties, not duties under a contract. The appointment of the appellant was under a con- tract [126 A-B] Commissioner of Income-tax Bombay Presidency and Aden v.
