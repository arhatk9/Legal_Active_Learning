 In connection with a dispute between the parties, the appellant submitted his objections for setting aside the arbitration award. The objection petition was filed within the period of limitation, but was returned as defective, in that the necessary stamps were not affixed, and the date of the verification of the petition was not entered. The defects were rectified, but the appellant refiled his objections late, due to his advocate's misconduct. The delay was caused by circumstances beyond the appellant's control, but the High Court refused to condone the delay.
 Allowing the appeal the Court, 
HELD : (1) There had not been any delay in preferring the objections. The delay, if any was in re-presentation of the objection petition after rectifying the defects, and the delay in re-presentation is not subject to the vigorous tests which are usually applied in excusing the delay in a petition under section 5 of the Limitation Act.

 (2)The delay is not due to any want of bona fides or care on the part of the appellant. but due to circumstances beyond his control. He cannot be held guilty of negligence so as to disentitle him to plead sufficient cause under section 5 of the Limitation Act. Section 149 of the Code of Civil Procedure confers ample power on the High Court to exercise its powers in order to do justice to a litigant where the failure is not due to any fault of his.
