 The Amritsar Improvement Trust by its resolution dated April 19, 1962 framed a development-cum-housing accommodation scheme under ss. 24, 25 and 28 of the Punjab Town Improvement Act 1922. After notice was issued under s. 36 of the Act several objections were received. the objections were rejected by the Improvement Trust. Thereafter the scheme was submitted to the government and sanctioned by it under s. 41. The High Court in writ petitions filed before it challenging the scheme held that the Improvement Trust had no power to include in a 'development scheme' areas outside the municipality for the purpose of development. In appeals to this Court against the judgment of the High Court, 
HELD : (i) The legislature has given specific names to the schemes to be prepared by the Improvement Trust. Hence when the Improvement Trust says that it has prepared 'a development scheme', it is not possible to hold that in fact it has prepared 'an expansion scheme'. The power conferred on the Improvement Trust is not a plenary power. It is a power that has to be exercised in accordance with the conditions laid down in the Act. If the Improvement Trust wanted to prepare 'at,. expansion scheme' it should have formed an opinion in the terms of s. 24(2) "that it is expedient and for the public advantage to promote and control the development of and to provide for the expansion of a municipality in a locality adjacent thereto within the local area of such trust". [391 H] From the resolutions passed by the improvement Trust it did not appear that it had formed any such opinion. Under these circumstances it was not possible to accept the contention of the appellants that as the resolutions of the Improvement Trust refer to s. 24 it could be concluded that the scheme prepared was 'an expansion scheme'. The resolutions of the Improvement Trust did not merely refer to s. 24. They also said that the scheme prepared was 'a development scheme' cum 'housing scheme'. It these resolutions were read as a whole it was clear that the Improvement Trust purported to Act under its power under P.. 24(1) which dealt with 'development scheme' and, s. 25 which dealt with 'housing accommodation scheme' and not under s. 24(2). [392 B-C] (ii) it is a well established principle that if an authority has a valid power to do a particular act, the fact that it purported to do that act under a provision of law which did not confer power to do that act, would not invalidate that act. But that rule was inapplicable to the facts of this particular case. [393 B.] 387 Before taking action under s. 24(2), the Improvement Trust had to form a particular opinion. The formation of that opinion was a condition precedent. Until the Improvement Trust forms that opinion it is incompetent to take action under that section. The Act has not conferred any blanket power on the Improvement Trust, to frame any scheme which it thought fit. That being so it was not possible to uphold the contention of the appellants that the impugned scheme could be traced to a valid power. [393 C-D] L. Hazari Mal Kuthiala v. Income-tax Officer, Special Circle Ambala Cantt. and Anr., 41 I.T.R. 12 and Hukumchand Mills Ltd. v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr.. 52 I.T.R. 583, distinguished.
 (iii) The schemes framed by the Improvement Trusts do not come into force automatically. They have to be sanctioned by the Government. Hence it is necessary for the government to know before sanctioning the scheme as to what the scheme is, so that it may examine whether that scheme is necessary or feasible. In the present case the government was informed that the scheme in question was 'a development-cum- housing accommodation scheme'. It approved the scheme. It cannot be said whether it would have sanctioned 'an expansion scheme'. The mere acceptance of the scheme by the Government did not alter the legal position. [393 B-F] (iv) The scheme was one and indivisible. It was not possible to hold that it was partly valid and partly invalid. It had to stand or fall as a whole. [394 A-B] The appeals must accordingly be dismissed.
