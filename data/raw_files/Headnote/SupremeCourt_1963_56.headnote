 A suit was filed in 1941 for the recovery of Rs. 50,000.
 The respondents prayed for the scaling down of the amount due from them under the Madras Agriculturists Relief Act, 1938, on the ground that they were agriculturists. The suit was compromised for Rs. 37,0001/- Some payments were also made.
 In 1949, another application was made by the respondents for the scaling down of the debt on the ground that they were agriculturists and hence were entitled to the benefits of the Act of 1938 as amended in 1948. The contention of the decree-holder was that the Amending Act was not applicable in view of the provisions of s. 16 (ii) of the Amending Act as the compromise decree had become final. Moreover, the earlier compromise decree operated as res indicate. Another contention was that the judgment-debtors were not agri- culturists as they were a joint Hindu family owning an estate for which a peshkash of more than Rs. 500/- was payable. The trial court held that the decree was liable to be scaled down in view of the provisions of the Amending Act. The matter was taken to the High Court in revision.
 The High Court directed the trial court to take evidence and submit its finding on the point whether the appellants were agriculturists or not. The finding of the trial court was that the judgment-debtors constituted a joint Hindu family which owned an estate for which peshkash of more than Rs.
 500/- was payable and hence were not agricultrists.
 The High Court came to the conclusion that the estat Was not held jointly but in definite shares. The peshkash in 311 respect of the two villages constituting an estate could not be aggregated. Under the circumstances, the peshkash paid by the individual judgment-debtors did not exceed Rs. 500/- and hence the judgment debtors were agriculturists. The High Court also held that the compromise decree could not be regarded as final for purposes of s. 16 (ii) of the Amending Act, and the principle of res judicata did not apply. It was also held that the judgment-debtors were entitled to have the decree scaled down. The appellants came to this Court by special leave.
 Held that the appeal had no merit and must fail. The judgment-debtors were agriculturits and the peshkash paid by them individually did not exceed Rs. 500/-. Hence they were entitled to get their debts scaled down.
 Held also, that all decrees which had been executed and satisfied before the commencement of the Amending Act in January, 1949, were unaffected by the Amending Act, but all decrees which were not final and which remained to be executed, either wholly or in part, were subject thereto.
 However, the decree-holder was not to be required to refund any sum which might have been paid or realized by him. No distinction was made between decrees passed after contest and decrees passed on compromise. Both kinds of decrees were amenable to the provisions of s. 19 (2) of the Act of 1938 and s. 16 (ii) of the Amending Act of 1948. The case was thus governed by s. 16 (iii) and not by s. 16 (ii).
 Held also, that although the conduct of the respondents in omitting to press the claim for reduction of the amount of the claim on the first occasion was significant, yet that did not constitute res judicata, either statutory or constructive. The compromise decree was not a decision by the Court. It was the acceptance by the Court of something to which the parties had agreed. The compromise decree merely set the seal of the court on the agreement between the parties and the court did not decide anything, A decision of the court was not implicit in the compromise.
 Only a decision by the court could be res judicata, whether it be statutory under s. II of the Code of Civil Procedure or constructive as a matter of public policy on which the entire doctrine rests. The earlier decision could not strictly be regarded as a matter which was "heard and finally decided". The decree might have created an estoppel by conduct between the parties but that had not been pleaded and tried at any time.
 Held also, that the Act of 1938 as amended in 1948 conferred upon the petty agriculturists the right to get their 312 debts scaled down in order to save them from the oppressive loans taken at usurious rates of interest.
