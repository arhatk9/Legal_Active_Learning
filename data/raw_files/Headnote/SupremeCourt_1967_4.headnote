 The respondent was compulsorily retired from. service under article 465A, note (1) of the U.P. Civil Service Regulation, after he had completed more than 25 years of qualifying service. The order of retirement stated that the respondent "head outlived his utility". The respondent challenged the order in the High Court. The High Court quashed the order. In appeal to this Court the appellant contended that the reason that the respondent had outlived his utility did not show that the order of compulsory retirement amounted to an order of dismissal or removal because in every case of compulsory retirement it was implied that the person had outlived his usefulness.
 HELD : There was no force in the contention.
 The test to be applied is : does the order of compulsory retirement cast an aspersion or attach a stigma to the officer when it purports to retire him compulsorily. In the present case the order did cast a stigma on the respondent.

 Two tests are derived from Shayam Lal's case : the first is whether the action is by Way of punishment and to find that out it is necessary that a charge or imputation against the officer is made the condition of the exercise of the power;
 the second is whether by compulsory retirement the officer is losing the benefit he has already earned as he does by dismissal or removal. if the first test is applied in this case it is quite clear that the charge or imputation that the respondent had outlived his utility" was made the condition of the exercise of the power.
