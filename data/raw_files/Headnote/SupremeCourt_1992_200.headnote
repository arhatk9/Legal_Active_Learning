 The petitioner, a life convict, having been sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life, for the offence under Section 302 Indian Penal Code, filed a Writ Petition before this Court challenging his continued detention in jail, and sought an order in the nature of habeas corpus, claiming that he has served more than the maximum sentence of imprisionment prescribed under law and should, therefore, be released. According to the petitioner, he had undergone about 13 years and six months actual imprisonment and total period of imprisonment including remissions came to more than 17 years, and since he had undergone more than 14 years, sentence including remissions, and the said sentence was got executed in jail custody in the form of rigorous imprisonment, the Government must be deemed to have commuted his sentence to 14 years, either under Section 55, Indian Penal Code, 1860 or Section 433 (b), Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, notwithstanding that no formal order in that behalf was made by the State Government and as such his continued detention in jail was illegal and he was entitled to be released forthwith. It was contended that the law laid down in Naib Singh v. State of Punjab & 899 Ors.[1983] INSC 44; , [1983] 2 SCC 454, needed reconsideration by a larger Bench.
 Dismissing the Writ Petition, this Court.
 
 HELD: 1.1. Admittedly, the petitioner's sentence has not been remitted fully nor commuted for imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years either under Section 55 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 or under Section 433 (b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 by the appropriate Government.
 Merely because the petitioner has undergone 13 1/2 years actual rigorous imprisonment and a total period of 17 years imprisonment, including remissions, the Government cannot be deemed to have commuted his sentence, either under Section 55 of the Indian Penal Code or Section 433 (b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In the absence of a specific order in this behalf by the appropriate Government, the petitioner is not entitled to be released. [900E-F, 901E] 1.2. It is the settled law that in view of Section 53- A, Indian Penal Code, 1860, inserted by the Amending Act of 1955, the sentence of imprisonment for life imposed on or after January 1, 1956 is executable in jails, that the nature of punishment required to be suffered under a sentence of `imprisonment for life' is rigorous imprisonment; that since Section 53 A (2), transportation for a term has been equated to rigorous imprisonment for the same term, by necessary implication the sentence of `transportation for life', now substituted by `imprisonment for life' by Section 53-A(1) which is awardable for more serious, or more grave or more heinous crimes must mean rigorous imprisonment for life, that is to say, it cannot be anything but rigorous; and that it is not necessary that, while passing the sentence of imprisonment for life a criminal court should clarify the exact nature of punishment intended to be inflicted on the accused. [902F-H, 903A-B, 901E] Naib Singh v. State of Punjab and others[1983] INSC 44; , [1983] 2 SCC 454, relied on.
 Kishori Lal v. Emperor, AIR 1945 PC 64 and Gopal Vinayak Godse v. State of Maharashtra, [1961] INSC 9; [1961] 3 SCR 440, referred to.
 1.3. The reasoning and conclusions given in Naib Singh's case are correct and there is no justification whatsoever to refer the points decided in that case to a larger Bench. [903F] 900
