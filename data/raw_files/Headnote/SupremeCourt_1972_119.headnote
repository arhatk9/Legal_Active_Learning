 The High Court allowed an appeal against acquittal and convicted three of the appellants under ss. 302 and 34, I.P.C., and the two others under ss. 307 and 34 J.P.C.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD: The High Court had noticed the correct principles to be observed in appeals from acquittals before reappraising the evidence in the case' The High Court, however, had not examined the evidence against each accused individually. The infirmities in the test identification parade of one of the accused, who was said to be unknown to the witnesses, from before (he was made to sit outside the Court where the identifying witnesses could see him; and the Magistrate who conducted the parade did not include in the parade other men who were bearded like the accused) made the evidence of identification unreliable. Hence, the accused was entitled' to the benefit of doubt. But, merely because the identity of one of the participants is doubtful, there is no rule that the others must be acquitted. The remaining accused persons, who were well-known to the eye witnesses, could be convicted, with the aid of s. 34, I.P.C., for the offences they committed,., [297E; 300 D-G; 301 GH; 302 D-E, G--H] Krishna Govind Patil v.
