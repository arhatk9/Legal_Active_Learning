 In August 1964, the States of Mysore and Andra Pradesh entered. into a reciprocal agreement to introduce stage carriage services on the inter-State route from Bellary, in Mysore, to Manthralaya in Andhra Pradesh, via Chintakunta, the border in Mysore State. By the Bellary scheme which was approved by the Mysore Government under s. 68-D of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 and which came into force in May,. 1964, it was provided that only the State Transport Undertakings will operate services on the route Bellary to Chintakunta to the complete: exclusion of other persons, except in regard to the portions of the interdistrict routes lying outside the limits of Bellary district. The existing, permit- holders of inter-state routes were allowed to operate such interState routes subject to the condition that their permit shall be rendered ineffective by the competent authority on the overlapping portion in.the Bellary district.
 In the present case, the Regional Transport Authority called for applications for the grant of a permit on the inter- State route in 1965 and the appellant was one of the applicants. The Mysore Revenue Appellant Tribunal, in appeal, granted the permit to the appellant with the condition that no passenger was to be picked up portion of the road overlapping the notified route, of is Bellary to Chintakunta). The High Court, in a not agree with the view of the Tribunal that even total exclusion from Bellary to Chintakunta border, issued in respect of the overlapping portion of the or set down on the the scheme (that writ petition, did under a scheme of a permit could be inter- State route by making that permit ineffective on that portion, and remanded the matter to the State Transport Authority for reconsideration in accordance with law.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD :(I) There is no scheme of nationalisation relating to the inter-State route from Bellary to Manthralaya and the Bellary scheme is confined only to the inter-State routes, one of which is the Bellary--Chintakunta route whose terminii were within the State. It could be 926 nationalised by the State of Mysore under the provisions of s.68-D even though that portion overlaps the inter-State route from Bellary to Manthralaya. [930 E-F; 931 C] B. H. Aswathanarayan Singh & Ors. v. State of Mysore & Ors., [1965] INSC 119; [1966] 1 S.C.R., 87, referred to.
 (2) Since the scheme did not deal with an inter-State route at all no question of the applicability of the proviso to S.68-D(3), which requires the previous approval of the Central Government arises. [930 D] (3) A scheme of nationalisation approved under s. 68-D would prevail over an inter-State agreement in respect of an inter-State route. [929 G-H; 930 A-B] T. N. Raghunatha Reddy v. Mysore State Transport Authority, [1970] INSC 40; [1970] 3 S. C. R. 780, followed.
 (4) In Thippeswamy's case (A I.R. 1972 S.C. 1674) it was held that according to the scheme all operators excepting those mentioned in the scheme are excluded from the nationalised routes. The only two exceptions were with regard to inter-district operators and the existing permit- holders on inter-State routes. Since the appellant did not fall within either of these two categories it was not possible to accede to the appellant's contention that because the scheme merely provides for partial ,exclusion it was open to the authorities concerned to issue a permit for the route overlapping the inter-state route. [929 E-G] Thippeswamy v. The Mysore Appellate Tribunal, [1972] INSC 143; A.I.R. 1972 S.C. 1674 followed.
 (5) In the application for stay filed along with the application for special leave it was stated that special leave had been granted in Thippeswamys case, but, by the time the petition for special leave came up for hearing the appeal in Thippeswamy's case had been dismissed. .But this fact was not mentioned to the Court. However, it was not a ,case for revocation of special leave, because, there was nothing to show that a reference was made to Thippeswamy's case, in arguments, when special leave was granted, [928 B- E]
