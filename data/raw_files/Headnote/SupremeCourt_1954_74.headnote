 The appellant G and the fourth respondent T were rival liquor contractors for the sale of a liquor contract for the year 1953-54 in the State of Mysore. The contract was auctioned by the Deputy Commissioner under the authority conferred upon him by the Mysore Excise Act, 1901. The appellant's bid was the highest and the contract was knocked down in his favour subject to formal confirmation by the, Deputy Commissioner. The fourth respondent was present at the auction but did not bid. Instead of that he went direct to the Excise Commissioner and made a higher offer. The Excise Commissioner cancelled the sale in favour of G and directed the Deputy Commissioner to take action under rule II. 10. The latter accepted T's tender. The appollant's application for a writ of mandamus was dismissed by the High Court but he was granted a certificate under article 133(L) of the Constitution.
 Held, (i) that the appollant's prayer for a writ of mandamus could not be granted as the Excise Commissioner exercised his authority (though a little irregularly because the matter did not reach him through the proper channel) and the cancellation of sale by him under the circumstances was proper.
 (ii)The subsequent action of the Deputy Commissioner in granting the contract to T was wrong because the arbitrary improvisation of an ad hoc procedure to meet the exigencies of a particular case adopted in the secrecy of an office cannot be accepted.
 (iii)What the Legislature has insisted on is that wherever there is a departure from the methods of auction and tender provided for in the Rules, the departure must be sanctioned by Government and must be "notified". The matter cannot be left to the arbitrary discretion of some lesser authority.
 (iv)The relief of a writ prayed for by the appellant to can.
 cel the contract given to T could not be granted in the present case as barely a fortnight was left for the contract to expire and the grant of a writ would therefore be ineffective end meaningless.
 306 The relevant sections of the Mysore Excise Act and the rules made thereunder &re given in the judgment.
