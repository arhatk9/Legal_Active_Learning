 The Inter-State Transport Commission issued directions under s. 63A (2) (c) of Motor Vehicles Act 1939 laying down that permits by the concerned authorities should be issued in a certain order of preference. The respondents who were applicants for permits for inter-State routes were adversely affected and in writ petitions under Art.. 226 of the Constitution challenged the competence of the Commission to issue binding directions under s. 63A(2) (c) to a subordinate authority in respect of the exercise of quasi- judicial functions. The High Court allowed the writ petitions. In appeal by the Commission to this Court.
 
HELD : It is important to notice that the Act has not conferred any power on the Commission to make Rules. In the absence of any power to enact subordinate legislation by way of rules the delegation of legislative power cannot be lightly inferred. The power to make rules has been expressly conferred on the Central Government under s.
 133(1) and is subject to procedural safeguards. [770 G] This Court in Naidu's case held that the Transport Authorities in dealing with applications for permits and assessing the respective or rival claims of the parties discharge quasi-judicial functions and their orders are quasi-judicial orders. it is therefore essential to fundamentals of fairplay in the administration of law that the decision of these Transport Authorities in the matter of grant of permits should not be clogged by directions indicating the orders of preference as happened in the present case. [771 D] When the Act itself in s. 55 provides preference to Cooperative Societies, as far as possible, it is not appropriate to hold that the Commission would have power to do the identical things, in the present case, the Commission did not rest merely with giving the first preference to Co- operative Societies. The Commission thereafter indicated the order of preference to Transport Cooperative Societies, Limited Companies, Registered firms and lastly to others..
 [771 F] It is apparent that the order of preference indicated in the garb of directions is an encroachment upon the judicial discretion of the Transport Authorities in the matter of grant of permits. [771 G] The power of the Inter-State Transport Commission under section 63A(2)(c) of the Act to issue directions is referable only to directions of executive and administrative nature., The Commission has no power to entrench upon the quasi-judicial functions of the Transport Authorities in the matter of grant of permits. The order of the High Court in quashing the direction must therefore be upheld. [772 A] 766 B. Rajagopala Naidu v. State Transport Appellate Tribunal
