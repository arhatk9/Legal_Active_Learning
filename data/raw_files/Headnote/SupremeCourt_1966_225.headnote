 Four issues, arising out of industrial disputes between the Management of Delhi Cloth Mills and Swatantra Bharat Mills (two units of the same company) and their workmen, were referred to the Industrial Tribunal. Issue 3 in the order of reference raised the question whether the strike at the Delhi Cloth Mills and the lockout declared by the Management were justified and legal; and issue 4, whether the, sit-down strike at the Swatantra Bharat Mills was justified and legal. As regards these issues the contention of the Management was that the issues were framed on the basis that there were strikes at the two units, and the only questions referred to the Tribunal for decision related to the legality of and justification for, the said strikes. As regards issue 1, relating to the calculation of the bonus table, the case of the Management was that there were settlements on various dates between the Management and the Unions of workmen, and in view of those settlements it was not open to the workmen to reopen the matter., The Tribunal overruled the pleas of the Management. It held that as the existence of the strikes was disputed by the workmen, it would be its duty and within its jurisdiction to decide whether there were strikes at the Mills at all; that in doing so, it would not be going beyond the scope and ambit of the reference; and that the parties would be at liberty to adduce evidence in confirmation or denial of the existence of the strikes. As regards issue 1, relating to bonus, the Tribunal held that if after taking evidence it was found that as a result of the settlements referred to by the Management, the claim was barred,, it would not be allowed.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) The basis of issues 3 and 4 was that there were strikes at the two units and a lock-out declared by the Management at one. On the issues as framed, it would not be open to the workmen to question the existence of the strikes or to the Management to deny the declaration of a lock-out.
 The parties could place before the Tribunal such facts as would show that the dispute referred was not an industrial dispute at all, or explain their conduct or their respective stands on the propriety and legality of the strikes and lock-out. But they could not be allowed to argue that the order of reference was wrongly worded and that the very basis of the order of reference was open to challenge.
 Therefore, the Tribunal had to examine issues 3 and 4 on the basis that there was a strike at the Delhi Cloth Mills and a sit-down strike at the Swatantra Bharat Mills, and that there was a lock-out declared with regard to the former as stated in the order of reference, and decide on the evidence adduced, whether the strikes and lock-out were justified and legal. [887 G-H; 892 F-H; 893 E-G] The Industrial Tribunal must confine its adjudication to the points of dispute referred and matters incidental thereto.
 It is not free to 883 enlarge the scope of the dispute referred to it but must confined its attention to the points specifically mentioned and anything which is "incidental' thereto. Something "incidental to a dispute" means something happening as a result of or in connection with the dispute or associated with the dispute. The dispute is the fundamental thing while something incidental thereto is an adjunct to it. It cannot Cut at the root of the main thin.- to which it is an adjunct.

 (2) The parties were not bound by any agreement with regard to the first issue and the Tribunal would have to take evidence to come to a finding on it. [897 D]
