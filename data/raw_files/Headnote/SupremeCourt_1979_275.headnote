 
 HELD : (per Tulzapurakar and Pathak, JJ.) (Krishna Iyer J. concurring) It is well-settled that a party is not entitled to seek a review of a judgment delivered by this Court merely for the purpose of a rehearing and a fresh decision in the case.
 Normally the principle is that a judgment pronounced by the Court is final and departure from that principle is justified only when circumstances of a substantial and compelling character make it necessary to do so. If the attention of the Court is not drawn to a material statutory provision during the original hearing the Court will review its judgment. The Court may also reopen its judgment if a manifest wrong has been done and it is necessary to pass an order to do full and effective justice. [656H] Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan [1964] INSC 246; [1965] 1 S.C.R. 933, 948; G. L. Gupta v. D. N. Mehta [1970] INSC 165; [1971] 3 S.C.R. 748, 760; O.
 N. Mahindroo v. Distt. Judge Delhi & Anr. [1971] 2 S.C.R.
 11, 27 referred to.
 Power to review its judgment has been conferred on the Supreme Court by Article 137 of the Constitution read with the provisions of a law made by Parliament or the rules made under Article 145. In a civil proceeding an application for review is entertained only on a ground mentioned in O.
 XLVII, Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure and in a criminal proceeding on the ground of an error apparent on the face of the record (Order XL r. 1, Supreme Court Rules 1966). Whatever be the nature of the proceedings a review proceeding cannot be equated with the original hearing of a case and the finality of the judgment delivered by the Court will not be reconsidered except "where a glaring omission or patent mistake or like grave error has crept in earlier by judicial fallibility." [657C-D] Chandra Kanta v. Sheikh Habib, [1975] INSC 78; [1975] 3 SCR 933 referred to.
 Apart from the fact that the material placed before the Court in the review petition was never brought to its notice when the appeals were heard, the judgment does not suffer from an error apparent on the face of the record. Such an error exists if of two or more views canvassed on the point it is possible to hold that the controversy could be said to admit of only one of them. If the view adopted by the Court in the original judgment is a possible view having regard to what the record states, it is difficult to hold that there is an error apparent on the face of the record. [657E-F] In the instant case the appellant prepared and served food both to residents in its hotel as well as to the casual customers who came to eat in the restaurant. In both cases it remained a supply and service of food not amounting to a sale. The facts alleged by the appellant were never disputed at any stage. No attempt 651 was made by the taxing authorites to enquire into the truth of the facts so accepted. It was in that factual context that this Court examined the question whether any liability to sales tax was attracted. The earlier judgment rested on that factual foundation and must be understood in that light. [658H] Krishna Iyer, J. (concurring) A case is decided on its particular conspectus of facts. When the facts materially vary the law selectively shifts its focus. The factual setting in which the decision in the judgment was founded becomes critical. The appeal proceeded on the admitted footing that the visitor to the restaurant who sat at the table and was served the dishes he desired, had no right to carry home what he wanted. The basic assumption was that victuals as such were not sold and the consideration was for the complex of activities which included eating and drinking. On these facts the conclusion arrived at was impeccable. [652G] If circumstances differ the decision too will be different. But no alternative situations were presented. If counsel defaults in the submission he cannot find fault with the Court for the decision. [653A]
