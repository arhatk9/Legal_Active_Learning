 By a lease commencing from January 1, 1939, for 12 years, a building in Calcutta was let to AB and under the terms of the lease, subletting or parting with possession without the previous consent of the landlord was prohibited. After the expiry of the period of the lease, AB continued in possession but on August 12, 1953, served a notice in writing upon the landlord of their intention to vacate the premises "on August 31, 1953 at 3.30 P.M." By a subsequent letter on August 26, 1953, AB informed the landlord that they did not intend to vacate the premises on August 31 -is originally intimated, and that their earlier notice be treated as cancelled. Although, in reply the landlord refused to agree to the withdrawal of the notice stating that he had already arranged to let the premises to another person, AB continued in possession and on May 7, 1954 sublet a part of the premises to the respondent. The landlord thereafter instituted a suit for ejectment against AB which was settled on March 28, 1955 by a consent decree whereupon AB handed over possession to the landlord of the por-tion of the premises in their own occupation. The landlord then sued the respondent for a decree for possession of the premises and mesne profits and a Single Judge of the High Court decreed the landlord's claim. The Division Bench allowed the appeal and dismissed the landlord's claim.
 
HELD : The appeal must be allowed and the decree passed by the Trial Court restored.
 (i)On the expiration of the period of notice dated August 12, 1953. the tenancy of AB stood determined. Once a notice is served determining the tenancy or showing -an intention to quit on the expiry of the period of notice, the tenancy is at an end, unless with the consent of the party to whom the notice is given, the tenancy is agreed to be treated is subsisting. [24C] Tayleur v. Wildin, (1867-68) L.R. 3 Ex. Cases 303; referred to.
 (ii)A notice which does not comply with the requirements of s. 106 of the Transfer of Property Act in that it does not expire at the end of the month of the tenancy, or the end of the year of the tenancy, as the case may be, or of which the duration is shorter than the duration contemplated by s.
 106, may still be accepted by the party served with the notice; and if that party accepts and net,, upon it, the party serving the notice will be estopped from denying its validity. The landlord's refusal to agree to the withdrawal of the notice since he had already agreed to 21 lease the premises to another person from September 1, clearly showed' that the offer to terminate the tenancy on August 31, 1953 was accepted by him and he had acted upon that offer. The tenants Was therefore determinated at 3.30 p.m. on August 31, 1953 on acceptance by the landlord of the notice dated August, 1953. [25A-C: F] There was no force in the contention that in order to determine a tenancy under the Transfer of property Act it the instance of the tenant. there must be actual delivery of the possession. That contention is contrary to the plan terms of s. 111 (h) of the Act. [25H] (iii) Considered in the light of the scheme and object of the Act the expression 'tenant' in cl. (e) of s. 12 (1) or in s. 13(2) must mean a contractual tenant alone and not a statutory tenant. The definition in s. 12(1) of the expression 'tenent' includes a statutory tenant, but the definition does not apply it' there is anything repugnant in the subject or context. Statutory tenant has no interest or estste in the permises4 Occupied by him, and it cannot be said that the legislaturw, without making an express provision to that effect, intended to invest him with power to induct into the premises in his Occupation a person who would be entitled 'to claim the right And interest of a contractual tenant.
