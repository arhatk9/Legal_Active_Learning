 The first appellant (the wife of the second appellant) alleged that she was the owner of certain property at Delhi.
 By an ex-parte order dated 25-11-1953, the Asstt. Custodian declared her as an evacuee and her property to be evacuee property. On appeal, the ex-parte order was set aside and the Asstt. Custodian was directed to decide on merits the appellant's case. By an order dated 11-1-1956 the Asstt.
 Custodian held that the first appellant was non-evacuee owner of the property. On 29-4-1964, a notice u/s. 27 of the Act was issued to the first appellant to show cause why the order dated 11-1-56 should not be revised. The .rounds for the notice were (i) that the first appellant had left for Pakistan in 1947, and it was fraudulently averred that she was a non-evacuee and was residing at Calcutta with the second appellant; and (ii) that in order to establish the first appellant's non-evacuee status, as well as to secure the release of the property, forged documents and perjured evidence were tendered before the Asstt. Custodian. The first appellant applied for cancellation of the show cause notice. On 1-2-1965, the Dy. Custodian General rejected the objections of the first appellant and authorised the Dy.
 Custodian to expedite recording of evidence and submission of report, The appellant filed a writ petition in the High Court for quashing the two orders dated 29-4-1964 and 1-2-1965 contending (i) that the order dated 11-1-56 had become final by virtue of See. 28 of the Act and it could not be re- opened; (ii) that fresh proceedings were barred under section 7A of the Act;. and (iii) that the proceedings u/s.
 27 of the Act were barred by limitation. The High Court rejected these contention.and dismissed the writ petition.
 on appeal by special leave to this Court, dismissing the appeal.
 
HELD : (i) The order dated 11-1-56 was not final and it could be re-opened. The power of revision u/s. 27 was not taken away by s. 28 of the Act. [768E] (ii) Sec. 7A of the Act did not constitute a bar to the issue of notice u/'s. 27. The bar in Sec. 7A is that no property shall be declared to be evacuee property on or after 7-5-54. The proviso to Sec. 7A is that nothing contained in the section shall apply to any property in respect of which Proceedings are pending on 7-5-54. When the ex-parte order dated 25-11-53 was set aside, the High Court held that the proceedings in respect of the property were pending on 7-5-54 and that is how an order was passed on 11-1-56 in favour of the first appellant. [768F-G] 767 (iii) The power u/s. 27 of the Act is not curtailed by any limitation of time. [768G-B] (iv) The order dated 29-4-1964 was validly made by the Custodian General. The relevant authorities have power to call for the record of any proceedings in which any Custodian has passed an order for the purposes of satisfying as to the legality or propriety of such an order. Since the order has been questioned by the authorities on the ground that the first appellant obtained the order fraudulently, and fraud is a question of fact, it is open to the first appellant to establish that she Obtained the order property.
 Certiorari will not lie as the authorities have jurisdiction to issue the notice. [769D-E]
