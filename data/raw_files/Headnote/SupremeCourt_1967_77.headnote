 Code of Civil Procedure (Act 5 of 1908), O. V. r. 20(1)- Scope of.
 Under s. 63 of the Income-tax Act a notice under the Act may be served as if it were a summons under the Civil Procedure Code. Order V, r. 20(1) of the Code prescribes two alternative methods of service when the summons- could not be served in the ordinary way, namely, (1) by affixing one copy of the summons in the court-house and another in a conspicuous part of the residential house or business premises of the party to be served; and (2) "in such other manner as the Court thinks fit". These words confer a discretion on the court to adopt any other manner of service and include a direction to affix a copy in such manner as to give notice to the person to be served, but without affixing a copy thereof in the court-house. [301A-B] Therefore, where proceedings under s. 34 of the Income-tax Act, 1922, were started against the assessee, a Hindu Undivided family, by issuing a notice, but the notice could not be served on its karta, and the Income-tax Officer ordered substituted service by directing the process server to affix the notice only at the address of the assessee and satisfied himself that the notice was affixed in a proper manner, it must be held that the notice was properly served on the assessee.
