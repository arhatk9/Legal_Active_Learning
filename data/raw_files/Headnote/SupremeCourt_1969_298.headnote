 The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation resolved to move the Government of Bombay State (then undivided) to acquire a pact of land belonging to the appellants for setting up a Samadhi of Mahatma Gandhi. The Commissioner of Ahmedabad Division acting under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, as amended by the Commissioners of Division Act, 1958 issued a notification under s. 4 of the former Act declaring that the land was likely to be required for a public purpose.
 Thereafter the State of Bombay was divided and city of Ahmedabad became part of the State of Gujarat. The notice under s. 6 of the Land Acquisition Act in respect of the appellants' land was issued by the Commissioner, Baroda Division of the State of Gujarat who by virtue of the Bombay Reorganisation Act, 1960 was the appropriate authority to do so. The appellants moved a petition in the High Court of Gujarat for a writ quashing the proceedings taken under the Land Acquisition Act and restraining the authorities from enforcing the notifications under ss. 4 and 6. The High Court rejected the petition. With certificate, an appeal was filed in this Court. The appellants contended : (i) that the Commissioners of Divisions Act, 1958 was ultra vires the legislature; (ii) that the Commissioner Baroda Division was incompetent to issue a notification under s. 6 without issuing a fresh notification under s. 4; (iii) that the notifications were defective because of noncompliance with ss. 77 and 78 of the Provincial Municipal Corporation Act, 1949 and because the purpose for which the acquisition was sought to be made was not a municipal purpose; (iv) that the notifications were unenfcteable because the "instrumentality" to carry out the purpose was not set out in the notifications; (v) that the Commissioner had not applied his mind to the evidence when issuing the notification under s. 6.
 
HELD : (i) Because of the decision of this Court in Arnod Rodericks Anr. the challenge to the vires of the Commissioners of Divisions Act, 1958 on the ground of excessive delegation of powers of the State Government and abdication of the functions of the Legislature, must fail.
 [912 6913 A] Arnold Rodricks & Anr. v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. [1966] 3 S.C.R. 885 followed and applied.
 (ii) The notification under s. 4 was issued by the Commissioner Ahmedabad Division who was competent to issue it as an officer of the 909 State of Bombay. The Commissioner of Baroda was competent to exercise the powers under the Commissioners of Divisions Act which continued to remain in force in the new State of Gujarat in respect of the Land Acquisition Act and he had on that account power to issue a notification under s. 6 of the Act. There was nothing in the Land Acquisition Act or the Commissioners of Divisions Act requiring that in order to invest the notification under s. 6 with validity, the Commissioner of the State of Gujarat had in the first instance to issue 'a notification under s. 4. [913 B-E] (iii) Exercise of power to move the State under s. 78 of the Provincial Municipal Corporation Act is not conditioned by a prior attempt at purchase by agreement in the manner laid down in s. 77. The opening Clause of s. 78 merely indicates an alternative and not a condition. Even if no attempt, is made under s. 77 to acquire the land by agreement.it is open to the Commissioner of the Municipal Corporation with the approval of the Standing Committee and subject to the other provisions of The Act, to move the Provincial Government to take steps for the acquisition of land [914 D-E] The notification under s. 4 of the Land Acquisition Act did not refer to any purpose of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation nor was the acquisition for a purpose for which the Commissioner was required by the provisions of the Provincial Municipal Corporation Act, 1949 to acquire the land. But since the land was required for setting up a memorial to Mahatma Gandhi who is held in universal veneration in this country, at a place associated with him, the purpose was a public purpose within the normal connotation of that expression as used in s. 4 of the Land Acquisition Act. That being so it was unnecessary to rely upon the extended meaning of the expression 'public purpose' as provided by s. 78(1) of the Provincial Municipal Corporation Act, 1949. [915 A-D] Whether the municipal funds if used for the public purpose of setting Lip of a memorial to Mahatma Gandhi would be lawfully utilised was not a matter within the periphery of the enquiry in the present appeal. [915 E] (iv) Failure to specify the instrumentality which is to execute the public purpose does not affect the validity of the notification either under s. 4 or under s. 6 of the Land Acquisition Act [916 A] Ramji Popathai v. Jamnadas Shah, (1969) Guj. L.R. 164, approved.
 Vishhnu Prasad Ramdas v Gohil & Ors. v. The State of Gujarat, [1970] 2 S.C.R. followed.
 (v) On the facts of the case he was no justification for the argument that the Commissioner Baroda Division did not apply his mind in issuing the notification under s. 6. [916 B]
