 The respondent workman was dismissed by his employer, the appellant, pending adjudication of an:industrial dispute, and without the permission of the Industrial Tribunal, relating to the discharge of 7 other employees working as apprentices under the appellant. The respondent raised a dispute before the Industrial Tribunal under S. 33A of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, and his case was that he was concerned in the dispute relating to the said 7 employees and gave evidence on their behalf and that his dismissal was solely due to the interest he took in their cause. The Tribunal found in his favour and passed an award directing his reinstatement. The appellant contended that the respondent was incompetent to raise the dispute under s. 33A of the Act. The question for decision, therefore, was one relating to the construction of s. 33(1)(a) of the Act:
 351 Held, that the expression " workmen concerned in such dis- pute " occurring in s. 33(1)(a) of the Industrial Disputes Act 1947, as amended by Act 36 of 1956, includes not merely such workmen as are directly or immediately concerned with the dispute, but also those on whose behalf the dispute is raised as well as those who, when the award is made, will be bound by it.
