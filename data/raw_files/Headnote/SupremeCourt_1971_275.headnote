 The registered office of the respondent company was at Calcutta. The respondent company was a registered dealer under the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1947. it issued cheques to the appellant-State for the amounts due towards sales tax for the years 1950-51, 1951-52 and 1952-53 on a Calcutta Bank and the cheques were encashed there. After paying the tax it appealed and the appellate authority heard the appeals at Calcutta and set aside the orders of assessment.
 Thereafter, the respondent filed an application the Superintendent of Sales Tax, Dhanbad, in Bihar, for refund of the tax paid by it. Since the request was not complied with, a suit was failed on the original side of the High Court of Calcutta. The respondent urged that a part of the cause of action arose at Calcutta, because, (1) the payments were made at Calcutta under a bona fide mistake of law that it was liable to pay sales tax; (2) its appeals were heard in Calcutta and the orders of the appellate authority were also received ,it Calcutta; and (3) its registered office was situate in Calcutta and it was ?tic duty of the debtor to find the creditor.
 The trial Judge held that the High Court at Calcutta had jurisdiction but on merits came to the conclusion that the respondent was not entitled to any relief. The Division Bench, on appeal, held that the respondent was entitled to the refund.
 Allowing the, appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) In view of Sales-tax Continuance Order, 1950 made by the President in exercise of his powers under the proviso to Art. 286(2) of the Constitution as the article then stood and s. 2 of the Sales Tax Laws Validation Act, 1956, the assessments for the periods from April 1, 1950 to March 31, 1951 and from April 1, 1951 to March 31, 1953 respectively were valid. Therefore the payments were not made under a bona fide mistake of law. 1987 C-H, 988 A-DI Sundaramier v. State of A.P. [1958] 1 S.C.R, 422, followed.
 (2) But the appellate authority had held that the assessments were not valid. 'This order of the appellate authority is not affected by s. 2 of the Sales Tax Laws Validation Act, because that section only validates assessments already made,, 'notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order a court, but not, 'notwithstanding an order made by an authority under the Sales Tax Act'. The validity of the order made by the appellate authority could not also be questioned by the appellant in a civil court in view of s. 23 of the Bihar Sales Tax Act. Therefore, as that assessment,,, made were set aside by the appellate authority, the respondent was entitled to the refund. [988 D-H] 983 (3) But the High Court at Calcutta had no jurisdiction. The fact that the plaintiff based his claim on three alternative grounds, for one of which alone (which however was not a tenable plea) a part of the cause of action can at best be said to have arisen in Calcutta, but not for others, cannot confer jurisdiction on the Calcutta High Court to try the suit on basis of grounds in respect of which no part of the cause of action arose in Calcutta. The cause of action within the contemplation of law is that which relates to a tenable plea. [990 D] (a) Since it could not be said that the payments were made under any mistaken impression of the, law, the fact that the cheques issued by the respondent were encashed at Calcutta did not afford any cause of action for filing the suit in Calcutta. [989 C] (b) (i) Assuming that the encashment of the cheques in Calcutta gave rise to a cause of action at Calcutta for a claim based on the ground that the payments were made on mistaken impression of law, that circumstance could not be said to give rise to a cause of action for the suit on the ground that the respondent was entitled to the refund of the amounts paid because of the order of the appellate authority. [989 D] (ii) In view of the Bihar Sales Tax Rules, 1949, an application for refund could have been made only to the Commissioner whose office was situate in Bihar. The refund could have been made only in accordance with those rules, and as per the rules, the amount could be refunded to a dealer only through one of the State-Government treasuries.
 Hence, the entire cause of action in respect of the claim for refund on the basis of the appellate authority's order arose only within the State of Bihar, and no part of that cause of action arose outside Bihar. [990 A-C] (c) For the same reasons no part of the, cause of action for claiming the amount on the basis of the doctrine that the debtor must seek his creditor could be said to have arisen outside Bihar..
