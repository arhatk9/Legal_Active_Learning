 On the death of two male members of a family which owned extensive properties in India and Ceylon, disputes arose between their widows and a suit was filed for partition- of the estate. When each of the two members died, the Estate Duty Authorities of Ceylon levied estate duty. The re- ceivers appointed in the partition suit paid the estate duties under protest and filed a suit questioning the validity of the duties. The suit -was dismissed by the trial Court but was decreed by the Supreme Court of Ceylon on appeal. In consequence of the decision of the Supreme Court of Ceylon, confirmed by the Judicial Committee, the Estate Duty Authorities had to refund the estate duty collected with interest thereon. The partition suit ended in a compromise and the assessee (the appellant's branch of the family) took one third share of the estate. For the assessment year 1958-59, the total income of the assessee was assessed and it included the amount received by the assessee as its share of the interest paid by the Estate Duty authorities of Ceylon. The assessee objected to the inclusion of that amount, but the Department, the Appellate Tribunal and the High Court on a reference, held against the assessee.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) The interest paid to the assessee under the decree of the Supreme Court of Ceylon on the amount of estate duty directed to be refunded was income liable to be taxed under the Indian Income-tax Act, and there is no warrant for treating the amount as a capital receipt being in the nature of damages for wrongful retention of money.
 The Supreme Court of Ceylon ordered the refund of the estate duty with legal interest thereon; under s. 192 of the Ceylon Ordinance II of 1889, and the expression "interest" in that section should be given its natural meaning.

 (2) The receipt was not of a casual or non-recurring nature (i) It is true that the assessee received the amount as a lump-sum payment. But that does not mean, that the receipt is not of a recurring nature. The interest was granted under the decree of the Court from the date of institution of the proceedings in the trial court and was calculated upon the footing that it accrued de die in diem and hence has the essential quality of recurrence which is sufficient to bring it within the scope of the Act. [971 F-H] (ii) A receipt of interest which is foreseen and anticipated cannot be regarded as casual even if it not likely to recur again. When the action was commenced it was well within the contemplation and anticipation of the receivers-plaintiffs that a successful termination of the action would not merely result in a decree for the estate duty illegally collected, but would also make the defendants liable to pay interest on that amount. [972 A-B] 966 (3) It is of the essence of the jurisdiction of the High Court under s. 66 of the Act, that in hearing a reference, it can decide only questions which are referred to it or arise out of the order of the Tribunal.
