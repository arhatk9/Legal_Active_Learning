 The appellant and six others were charged with the offence of entering into criminal conspiracy, with intent to defraud the Government of the duty payable on various contraband goods, etc. and thereby committing offences under s. 120B I.P.C.. read with 6. 167(81) of the Sea Customs Act 1878 and s. 5 of the Import and Exports Act 1947.
 The prosecution alleged that is a result of the criminal conspiracy twenty-four consignments of goods came from abroad and were received in Bombay and it is the case of the prosecution that it has in its possession 10 verladescheins (called as 'mate sheets' or receipts) which give the description of the contraband goods. Out of there 10 verladescheins, 2 relate to consignments of two firms for which the appellant held powers-of-Attorney.
 The Trial Magistrate held that 10 out of the 20 Verladescheins were inadmissible either under the Evidence Act or under the Commercial Documents Evidence Act 1939 and that 9 out of the 10 Verledescheins were admissible under s.
 10 of the Evidence Act. He also excluded some other letters and correspondence on the ground that they could not be said to have been written in furtherance of the conspiracy .
 On the basis of the evidence recorded, the Magistrate framed charges against the appellant and the co-accused.
 The prosecution as well as the appellant filed revision applications in the High Court. A single Judge of the High Court held that the Magistrate will have to consider afresh whether the documents, which he had admitted under 6. 32 or s. 10 of the Evidence Act were admissible or not and also consider whether it was necessary to frame additional charges.
 After this order, the Additional Chief Presidency Magistrate discharged the accused on the grounds that since no overt act was proved against the appellant and certain other accused no consideration can be inferred as against them.
 A Division Bench of the High Court allowed the revision petition filed by the prosecution and held that the Magistrate had no legal power to discharge the accused after framing the charge.
 In the appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that in passing the impugned order, the Magistrate was simply acting in consonance with the observations and implied directions contained in the order of the High Court.
 994 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: 1. From the scheme of the provisions contained in ss. 252 to 57 given in Chapter XXI of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898. it is clear that in a warrant case instituted otherwise on a police report, 'discharge' or 'acquittal of accused are distinct concepts applicable to different stages of the proceedings in the Court. The legal effect and incidents of `discharge' and 'acquittal' are also different. An order of discharge in a warrant case instituted on complaint can be made only after the process has been issued and before the charge is framed. A discharge without considering the evidence taken is illegal. If a prima facie case is made out the Magistrate must proceed under s. 254 and frame charge against the accused. The trial in a warrant cause starts with the framing of charge; prior to it the proceedings are only an inquiry. After the framing of charges if the accused pleads guilty, the Magistrate is required to proceed with the trial in the manner provided in s. 254 to 258 to a logical end. Once a charge is framed, the Magistrate has no power to cancel the charge and reverse the proceedings to the stage of s. 353 and discharge the accused. [1004 F-G, 1004H 1005 A-B] 
 2. After a charge is framed, the Magistrate has no power under the Code to discharge the accused. He can either acquit or convict the accused unless he decides to proceed under ss. 349 and 562 of the Code of 1898 (which corresponds to sections 325 and 360 of the Code of 1973).
 Exception where the prosecution must fail for want of a fundamental defect, such as want of sanction, an order of acquittal must be based upon a 'finding of not guilty' turning on the merits of the case and the appreciation of evidence at the conclusion of the trial. [1005 C-D] 
 3. If after framing charge the Magistrate whimsically, without appraising the evidence and without permitting the prosecution produce all its evidence, 'acquits' the accused, such an acquittal, without trial even if clothed as 'discharge' will be illegal. [1005 E] 
 4. In the instant case the Magistrate framing charges against the appellant. On the disposal of the revision application be arbitrarily deleted those charges and 'discharged' the accused without examining the remaining prosecution witnesses. [1005 F] 
 5. Assuming arguendo, the Magistrate's order of discharge was on order of 'acquittal' then also, it was manifestly illegal. It was not passed on merits, but without any trial, with consequent failure of Justice. The High Court has undoubtedly the power to interfere with such a patently illegal order in the exercise of its revisional jurisdiction under s. 439 and direct a retrial. Such retrial will not be barred by the provisions of s. 403 (of the Code of 1898), the earlier proceedings taken by the Magistrate being no trial at all and the order passed therein being neither a valid 'discharge' of the accused nor their acquittal as contemplated by s. 405(1).
