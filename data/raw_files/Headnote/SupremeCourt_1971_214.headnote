 Section 32(8) of the State Financial Corporation Act, 1961 provides "An order of attachment or sale of property under this section shall be carried into effect as far as practicable in the manner provided in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 for the attachment or sale of property in execution of a decree as if the Financial Corporation were the decree-holder". The appellant's properties which were mortaged under a registered deed to the Maharashtra State Financial Corporation were ordered to be sold by an order passed by the District Judge under s. 32(8) of the aforesaid Act. The High Court dismissed the appeal filed against the order of the, District Judge on the ground that no appeal lay. On merits also the appeal was dismissed summarily. In appeal to this Court by special leave, 
HELD : (i) The High Court erred in holding that no appeal lay.
 (a)There is no doubt that under the Code of Civil Procedure an order setting aside or refusing to set aside a sale in execution of a decree in appealable under O.. XLIII r. 1(j). It is difficult to understand why the scope of the language should be cut down by not including appeals pro- vided under the Code of Civil Procedure within the ambit of the words "in the manner provided in the Code of Civil Procedure". "Manner" means method of procedure and to provide for an appeal is to provide for a mode of procedure.
 The State Financial Corporation lends huge amounts and it could not be imagined that it was the intention of the Legislature to make the order of sale of property, passed by the District Judge, final and only subject to an appeal to the Supreme Court under Art. 136 of the Constitution. [354 H-355 B] The fact that an appeal to the High Court has been expressly provided in s. 32(9) could not lead to a different conclusion., The reason why an appeal has been expressly provided therein is that if there had been no specific provision in sub-s.. (9), no appeal would lie otherwise because it is not provided in sub-s. (5) or sub-s. (7) that the District Judge should proceedin the manner provided in the Code of Civil Procedure. [355 D] (b) On a correct reading of s. 32(11) it cannot be said that the Act confersjurisdiction on the District Judge as persona designata. [355 E-F] (c) The contention that the whole idea of the Act was to have expeditious execution as otherwise large funds of the State Financial Corporation would be locked up during execution proceedings could not be accepted. If this was the intention of the legislature it. would have expressly.
 provided that no appeal would lie against, an order made under sub-s. (8) of s. 32. [355 G] (ii) On the facts of the case the High Court was not justified in dismissing the appeal summarily. [356 A] 352
