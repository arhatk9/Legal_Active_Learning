 Section 40(2) of the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944 provides that no suit prosecution or other legal proceeding shall be instituted or anything done or ordered to be done under the Act after the expiration of six months from the accrual of the cause of action or, from the date of the act or order complained of. The respondents in the present appeals were prosecuted for violations of Central Excise Rules, punish-able under s. 9(b) and (d) of the Act and also under s. 420 read with section 511 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 109 of the Indian Penal Code. The High Court found that the prosecution in both the cases was barred by the rule of limitation in section 40 of the Act because the prosecutions were instituted subsequent to the expiry of six months from the date of the alleged offences.
 In appeals before this Court by special leave it was contended on behalf of the appellant that (i) the section applies only to government servants; (ii) the protection given to Government servants under the section is for actions done inadvertently or mistakenly, but not for acts done deliberately and maliciously; and (iii) the words "anything done or ordered to be done" under this Act in the section do not mean any act in violation of the provisions of the Act.
 
HELD (i) The provisions contained in section 40 of the Act show that the first sub-section speaks of bar of suits against the Central Government or any officer of the Central Government in respect of orders passed in good faith or act in good faith done or ordered to be done. The second sub- section of section 40 provides bar of limitation of time in respect of suits, prosecutions or other legal proceedings without any qualifying words as to persons against whom suit proceeding and prosecution shall be instituted. The contention of the appellant that subsection (2) is confined only against the Government officers is not warranted by the words of the statute and is repelled by reference to other comparable statutes which leave indicated in clear words when the statute contemplates bar of suits, proceedings or prosecution against Government servants only. The words in section 40(2) of the Act in the present case are of wide amplitude to apply to the prosecution which was commenced against respondents in the present case. [817H-818B] (ii) The contention that "anything done" would not include a malicious act or an act done in bad faith could not be accepted. Sub-section (2) of section 40 does not introduce the test of good faith in, relation to act done. Good faith is one of the aspects in section 40(1). The present appeals did not turn on sub-section (1) of section 40. [818D-E] 813 (iii) The decisions of this Court in the light of the definition of the word "act" in the General Clauses Act establish that non- compliance with the provisions of the statute by omitting to do what the Act enjoins will be "anything done or ordered to be done" under the Act. The complaint against the respondents was that they wanted to evade payment of duty. Evasion was by using and affixing cut and torn banderols. Books of account were not correctly maintained. There was shortage of banderol in stocks.
 Unbanderolled matches were found. These were all infraction of the provisions in respect of things done or ordered to be done under the Act. [820B] The High Court was therefore right in its conclusion that the prosecution was barred by the provisions of section 40 of the Act. [821D] Pritam Singh v.
