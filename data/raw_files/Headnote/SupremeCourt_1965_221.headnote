 Demands in respect of the payment of tax under s. 18A of the Income Tax Act were made against the respondent for two years, and the final installment for each of the two years, was outstanding on the respective valuation dates as defined under s. (q) of the Wealth Tax Act, 1957 The respondent claimed that the arrears of tax as determined as per notice under s. 18A constituted a debt, owned by it within the meaning of s. 2(m) of the Wealth Tax Act, as on the valuation date, and that the amounts should be allowed as deduction in determining its net wealth under the Wealth Tax Act. The Appellate Tribunal referred the question to the High Court and the High Court answered it in favour of the respondent.
 In appeal to this Court by the Commissioner of Wealth Tax, 
HELD : The High Court was right in answering the question in favour of the respondent.
 A debt is owed when an order is passed under s. 18A(1) and a notice of demand is sent. The amount mentioned in the notice begins to be owed till a new figure is substituted by the assessee under S. 18A(2). Till a new estimate is made by the assessee the amount is ascertained and there is a statutory liability on the assessee to pay the amount mentioned in the order under s. 18A(1) of the Income Tax Act. Since, on the valuation dates in the present appeals, the respondent had not taken any action under s. 18A(2), the amounts mentioned in the notices of demand were debts owed within s. 2(m) of the Wealth Tax Act on the valuation dates.
