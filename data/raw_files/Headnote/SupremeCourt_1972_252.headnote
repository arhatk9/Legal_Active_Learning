 The appellant assessee is a private limited Company dealing in furniture and also acts as an auctioneer. In respect of the sales effected by the appellant as auctioneer, it realised, during the year in question, in addition to the commission, Rs. 32,986/- as sales tax. This amount was credited separately in the books under the Sales Tax Collection Account. This sum was neither paid over to the ex-chequer nor was it refunded to the persons from it had been collected. For the year in question, the I.T.O. held that the sum of Rs. 32,986/- was a part of the appellant's income of the same nature as the commission received by it on the auction sales. The appellant relying on the decision of the Calcutta High Court, [1961] 12 S.T.C. 535 contended that as the State Government had legislative competence to include "auctioneer" in the definition of "dealer" in the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941, the amount in question was not a trade receipt liable to tax under Income Tax Act.
 The Appellate Asstt. Commissioner and the Appellate Tribunal held in favour of the appellant. However, a reference under Sec. 66(1) of the Indian Income Tax Act, was answered by the High Court against the appellant. Two questions were posed before this Court : (1) Whether the decision of the Calcutta High Court in [1961] 12 S.T.C. 535 was correct and (2) whether the answer to the reference by the High Court was right ? 
HELD : An auction sale in, view of the provisions of Sec. 4 read with 64 of the Sale of Goods Act would have to be considered to be a sale for the purpose of Sale of Goods Act. There is nothing in Entry 48 of List II of Schedule VII of the Government of India Act (corresponding to Entry 54 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution) which restricts the power of the Legislature in the matter of the imposition of the Sales Tax to the levy of such tax an the owner of the goods on whose behalf they are sold or the purchaser where the transaction is one of sale of goods.
 In view of the wide amplitude of the power of the State or provincial legislature to impose tax on transactions of sale of goods, it would be impermissible to read a restriction in entry 48 on the power of the State legislature as would prevent the State legislature from imposing, tax on an auctioneer who carries on the business of selling of goods and who has in customary course of business authority to sell goods belonging to the people. What is sought to be taxed is the transaction of the sale of goods. If there is a close and direct connection between the transaction of sale and the person made liable for the payment of tax as in the present case, the statutory provision providing for, such levy on 'sales tax would not 619 offend entry 48. As such, the definition of the word "Dealer" in explanation 2 of S. 2(c) of the Bengal Act cannot be deemed to be ultra vires. It Was within the competence of the provincial legislature to include within, he definition of the word "dealer" an auctioneer who carries on the business of selling of goods and who has in the customary course of business, authority to sell goods belonging to the principal.

 As the amount of sales tax was received by the appellant in its character as an auctioneer, the amount should be held to form part of its trading or business receipts. The appellant would, of course, be entitled to claim deduction of the amount as and when it pays to State Government. The fact that the appellant credited the amount received as sales tax under the head "Sales Tax Collection Account" would not make any natural difference. , It is the nature and the quality of the receipt and not he head under which it is entered in the account books that is decisive.
