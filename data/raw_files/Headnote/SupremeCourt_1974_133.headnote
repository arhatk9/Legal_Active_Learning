 Pursuant to an inspection report submitted by the Reserve Bank of India pointing out many irregularities in the working of a district Co-operative Central Bank, the State Government issued two notifications under s. 54 of the Mysore Co-operative Societies Act, 1959. By the first notification the Committee of Management of the Bank was superseded and by the second, another Committee was appointed in its place. The respondent, who was the President of the Bank, challenged the notifications as being ultra vires the Act and in violation of principles of natural justice. The High Court set aside the notifications, Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) The High Court rightly set aside the two notifications. The impeached orders suffered from two insurmountable infirmities. The entire Committee of Management had been superseded. The State Government did not take recourse to the provision under s. 30 of the Act to supersede the Management. Section 54 of the Act, which contemplates exercise of control over the conduct of business, does not confer any power to remove the President and Vice-President of the Bank. The word "control" suggests check, restraint or influence. Control is intended to regulate and hold in check and restrain from action. In the guise of exercising control the State had displaced the Committee of Management and substituted its own Committee.
 The State had indirectly intended to achieve what it was directly prohibited from doing under s. 54 of the Act.
 (2) The notification was in violation of principles of natural justice. Section 30 of the Act contemplates a notice where the State intends to supersede the Management.
 In utter defiance of the powers under the statute the Committee had been arbitrarily deprived of their right to manage the affairs of the society.
