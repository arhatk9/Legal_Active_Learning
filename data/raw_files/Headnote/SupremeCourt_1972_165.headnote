 Buildings and structures in which the respondents were carrying on their business were ordered to be demolished under s. 129 of the Jammu and Kashmir Municipal Act, Samvat 2008. Only 24 hours time was given to the respondent for dismantling the structures. The notices were never served upon the respondents but were affixed on the premises. The municipality demolished the properties. In writ petition filed by the respondents the High Court held that the orders passed by the appellants were illegal.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, HELD : Owing to the noncompliance with the provisions of ss.
 238 and 239 of the Act, the action taken by the municipality in the matter of demolition must be held to be entirely illegal and contrary to law. [811A-B] (1) Section 239 of the Act gives the procedure relating to authentication of service of a valid notice. Under sub-s.
 (i) every notice may be served in the manner provided for the service of summons in the C.P.C. so far as may be applicable. Even accepting the contention of the appellant that the respondents refused to accept the notices and that was the reason for affecting service by affixation, the provisions of O. 5, r. 9 of the Code were not complied with.
 No proof was adduced by way of an affidavit of the process server or any other officer regarding the attempts to serve the notices. Production by the respondents of the notices or admission that there was affixture did not dispense with compliance with the requirements of the statutory provisions contained in s.. 239 in the matter of service, of notices.
 [809F-G; 810A-C] (2) (a) Section 238 of the Act provide-& that when any notice under the Act requires any act to be done, for which no time is fixed by the Act, a reasonable time for doing the same shall be specified in the notice. Section 129 does not specify or fix any time for complying with the notice issued under that section. Therefore, a reasonable time for doing the acts required to be done by the notice had to be specified [809F; 810C D] (b) Section 129 also contemplates that the owner may be required either to remove the structure or to cause such repairs to be made to it as may be considered necessary for public safety. But, in the present case, no time was given for repairing and the owner or occupier of the Property was straight way required. to demolish the building or the structure. Considering that at no previous stage the officers of the municipality had formed the opinion that the Structures were in such a dangerous condition that they should he demolished, the drastic step of demolition directed to be taken in 24 hours, appears, on the face of it, to be harsh and unusual [810D-G] 2--L172Sup.CI/73 802 Therefore, the notices issued to the respondents did not comply with the provisions of s. 238 and the time granted was so short that it was not possible for the respondents either to comply with the notices or to take any effective steps in the matter of filing an appeal or revisions to the appropriate authorities. [810H] [The conclusions and observations of the High Court relating to collusion between various government officers for dispossessing the respondents from their properties and demolishing them and the mala fide nature of their action have not been dealt with by this Court in view of the decision regarding the illegality and invalidity of the demolition carried out pursuant to the notices issued under s. 129. Hence, the observations made by the High Court or the conclusions reached by it on all those other points would not be binding in any proceedings which may be initiated or taken or continued either by the respondents or the appellants under law [808H; 811B-C]
