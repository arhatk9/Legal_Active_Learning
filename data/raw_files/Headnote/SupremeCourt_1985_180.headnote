 Section 5(4) of the Punjab Municipal Act 1911 as it stood prior to the amendment prescribed: "When any local area has been included in a municipality under sub-section (3) of Section 5, this Act, and except as the State Government may otherwise by notification direct, all rules, bye-law, orders, directions aud powers made, issued or conferred under this Act and in force throughout the whole municipality at the time, shall apply to such area.
 By a notification dated August 10, 1965 issued under Section 5(3) of the Act, the area within which the factory of the appellant was situated was included within the municipality of Bhiwani. Thereafter, the-municipal Committee commenced to impose and collect octroi from the appellant in respect of the guar imported by the appellant into its factory within the extended municipal limits of Bhiwani from outside. The appellant filed a Writ Petition in the High Court for restraining the municipality from levying and collecting the octroi on the ground that when an area of any municipality was extended, there could be no automatic imposition of octroi which was in force within the limits of municipal area before such extension in that extended area unless the procedure prescribed by section 62 of the Act was complied with. In another writ petition, the Atlas Cycle Industries Ltd. also raised a similar contention before the High Court. The High Court dismissed both the writ Petitions by a common judgment on 18th May, 1970 holding that by virtue of section 5 (4) of the Act 811 taxes, octroi etc.
 which were being levied within the municipal limits before the extension of the 631 municipal limits came to be applicable automatically to the A extended area of the municipality. The Supreme Court in an appeal filed by the Atlas Cycle Industries Ltd., reversed the judgment of the High Court on August 11, 1971 holding that the notifications under the Act are the only authority and mandate for imposition and charge of tax, and since notifications are not made applicable to included areas under section 5(4) of the Act, the High Court was wrong in holding that the municipality was competent to levy and collect octroi from the appellant by virtue of the provisions contained in Section 5(4) of the Act.
 After the aforesaid decision in Atlas Cycle Industries Ltd., the Sate Legislature passed Punjab Municipal (Haryana Amendment & Validation) Act 1971. Section 2 of the Amending Act substituted the word "rules" in sub Section (4) of Section 5 of the Act by the words and sign "rules, notification" and further provided that those words and sign should be deemed always to have been substituted. By section 4 of the Amending A t the levy of octroi against and collection from the appellant and others within the extended limits of all the municipalities in Haryana were validated.
 Dismissing the Appeal, ^ 
 HELD: 1. lt is permissible for a legislature to overcome the effect of a decision of a Court setting aside the imposition of the tax by passing a suitable legislation amending the relevant provisions of the statue concerned with retrospective effect ant by validating assessments e earlier. [638 D-E] In the instant case, since the word 'notification has now been inserted in Section 5(4) of the Act with retrospective effect, the basis on which the decision in Atlas Cycle Industries Ltd. was rendered has been removed because the deficiency in section 5(4) noticed by the Supreme Court has been made good and the levy and collection of octroi have also been validated. The Amending Act satisfies the tests laid down by Supreme Court in Sh.
 Prithvi Cotton Mill case. The Amending Act, thus, neutralises the effect of the decision in Atlas Cycle Industries Ltd. which can no longer be relied upon after the amendment of the Act. The levy and collection of octroi in the area which was included within the municipal limits of Bhiwani with retrospective effect from August 10, 1985 in accordance with the notification issued earlier are, therefore no longer open to question.

 Shri Prithvi Cotton Mills Ltd. & Anr. v. Broach Borough Municipality & Ora. [1970] 1 S. C. B. 388 relied upon.
