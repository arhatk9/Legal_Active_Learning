 In the draft record of rights prepared under s. 44, West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act, 1953, the appellant was recorded, as a "raiyat" in respect of 1500 bighas of land.
 The respondent filed objections praying that the appellant be recorded as a tenure holder and the respondent as a lessee under him. The Settlement Officer held that the appellant was a permanent tenure holder and that the respondent was a temporary lessee for two years. On appeal the District judge affirmed these findings. Thereupon the appellant filed a petition under Art. 227 of the Constitution before the High Court and the High Court upheld the order of the Settlement Officer relating to the status of the appellant but reversed the portion in favour of the respondent. The appellant contended that the only party interested in challenging the status of the appellant was the Government and it not having done so the entry in the draft record of rights should not have been interfered with.
 The respondent contended that the High Court had no jurisdiction in a petition under Art. 227 to interfere with the concurrent findings of the Settlement Officer and of the District judge that the respondent was a temporary lessee.
 Held, that the respondent had raised an objection to the description of the status of the appellant in the record of rights and the Settlement Officer had jurisdiction to decide the question of the status of the appellant.
 Held, further, that the High Court was not justified in interfering with the findings of the Revenue authorities that the appellant was a temporary lessee. In a petition under Art. 227 the High Court was not sitting as a court of appeal; it could only consider whether the tribunals had overstepped 571 the limits of their jurisdiction and whether the findings were based on non material or were otherwise perverse. The orders of Nibar the revenue authorities did not suffer from any of these defects.
 Nagendra Nath Bora v. Commissioner, Hills Division,, Assam, [1958] INSC 6; [1958] S.C.R. 1240, relied on.
 The Settlement Officer was wrong in not maintaining any record of the oral evidence adduced before him. Though the Rules did not require the maintenance of record of the, oral evidence, it was implicit in the provision granting an appeal from the order of the Settlement Officer, that he should maintain some record of the oral evidence o that the right of appeal was not nullified.
