 During the relevant accounting year the respondents- assesseereceived a certain amount as dividend from a company. A part of the amount was paid out of the accumulated capital gains received by the company in the shape of Salamis and land acquisition compensation. Such capital gains were taken to the reserve fund and thereafter distributed as dividend. On the question of the taxability of that share of the dividend paid out of the capital gains in the hands of the company the Income-tax Officer held the same was taxable as "dividend." The Appellate Assistant Commissioner held that the amount could not be considered as "dividend" within the meaning of section, 2(6A) of the Income-tax Act, 1922, but the same was taxable as income in the hands of the assessee. The Tribunal confirmed the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. 'the High Court on reference answered in favour of the assessee.
 Dismissing the appeals, 
HELD: It is well-settled that in order to find out whether a receipt is a capital receipt or revenue receipt, it has to be seen what it is in the hands of the receiver and not its nature in the hands of the payer. In other words, the nature of the receipt is determined entirely by its character In the hands of the receiver and the source from which the payment is made has no bearing on the question. [417 G] The assessees Who were share-holders in the company were beneficially entitled to the capital of the company. The amount in question was not something earned by the company in the course of its business. Undoubtedly it was a capital receipt in the hands of the company but that by itself is not sufficient. It has to be seen whether it was a capital receipt in the hands of the assessee. Since the assessee had a beneficial interest in the sum when it was in the hands of the company, when that sum was distributed amongst the share-holders of the company, each of the share-holders took a share of the capital asset in which they were beneficially entitled. That being so, the receipt, in the present casement also be considered as capital receipt. The fact that those sums were distributed as "dividends" does not change the true nature of the receipt.
