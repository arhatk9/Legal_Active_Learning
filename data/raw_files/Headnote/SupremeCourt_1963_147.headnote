 The respondent had brought a suit in the court of the Sub- ordinate judge, Jalpaiguri for declaration of his title as the sole heir and successor to his father's impartible estate, which was taken possession of by his step-mother.
 That suit was on transfer pending in the High Court. Two other title suits were also pending in the High Court in which certain agnates were claiming as successors. The respondent moved an application before the District Judge, Jalpaiguri for the taking of security from the appellant under s. IV of the Bengal Wills and Intestacy Regulation V of 1799. The District Judge held that the application was barred under Art. 181 of the Indian Limitation Act and that s. IV of the Regulation had no application since it applied only where the deceased had left several heirs and not one.
 The High Court found in favour of the respondent on both the points and directed the District Judge to take security under s. IV. Section IV of the Regulation is as follows, "If there be more heirs than one to the estate of a person dying intestate, and they can agree amongst themselves in the appointment of a common manager, they are at liberty to take possession, and the Courts of justice are restricted from interference, without a regular complaint, as in the case of a single heir; but if the right of succession to the estate be disputed between several claimants, one or more of whom may have taken possession, the Judge, on a regular suit being preferred by the party out of possession, shall take good and sufficient security from the party or parties in possession for his or their compliance with the judgment that may be passed in the suit; or, in default of such security being given within a reasonable period, may give possession, until the suit may be determined, to the other claimant or claimants who may be able to give such security, declaring at the same time that such possession is not in any degree to affect the right of property at issue between the parties; but to be considered merely as an administration to the estate for the benefit of the heirs who may on investigation be found entitled to succeed thereto." Held (Per Hidayatullah, Dayal and Ayyangar JJ.) that the 70 Regulation was a piece of restrictive legislation and its provisions should be strictly construed.
 Each of the ss. II, III and IV of the Regulation, properly read and construed, was a complete code by itself and dealt with the different situations. Section II applied when the deceased died Deb leaving a will and naming an executor to manage the property, S.111 applied when the deceased died intestate leaving a single heir and s. IV applied when the deceased died intestate leaving more than one heir. The provisions of ss. III and IV were in no way inconsistent and it was not necessary to construe them together.
 Cohen v. S. E. Railway, (1877) 2 E. & D. 253, held inapplic- able.
 The second part of s. IV which provided for taking of security did not apply to a case such as the present where the deceased died intestate leaving only one heir entitled to the entire estate. It fell within the ambit of s. III of the Regulation.
 Since the courts have now ample powers under the Indian Succession Act, 1925, and the Code of Civil Procedure, these provisions of the Regulation are out of date and should be repealed.
 Per S. K. Das and Sarkar JJ -Section IV of the Regulation does not require an application for taking security and the court can act suo motu. Art. 181 is confined to applications under the Code of Civil Procedure and it can have no application to the present application as it is under s. IV of the Regulation and not under the Code. An application is not under the Code because the procedure there laid down has to be followed.

 The Court of the District judge is the proper forum where the application under s. IV can be made. In the absence of an order under s. 23 of the Bengal, Agra and Assam Civil Courts Act, 1887, the order contemplated by s. IV can be made only by a District Judge and it is not necessary that the suit mentioned in the section must be pending before him.

 There is no reason why the Resolution should provide differ- ently for cases of a single heir and cases of more than one heir and it does not do so. The words "if the right of succession to the estate is disputed between several claimants" in s. IV includes a case where a person dies leaving a single heir and several persons dispute each claiming to be that heir.
 separated by a semi-colon they cannot deal with two different states of affairs and that the latter part' must be controlled by the former.
 71 Neither does the word "but" between the two parts lead to that conclusion.
 The word 'heirs' in the second part of s. IV must include one heir.
 Section IV of the Regulation, therefore, applied to the case and the appellant could be called upon to furnish security.
 It was not correct to say that s. IV of the Regulation was impliedly repealed by ss. 192 to 195 of the Succession Act, 1925.
 The High Court had Jurisdiction in revision to set aside the order of the District Judge since he had failed to exercise his jurisdiction on a misinterpretation of the statute and erroneous view of limitation.
 Joy Chand Lal Babu v. Kamalaksha Choudhury. (1949) 76 I. A.

 But the power to take the security under s. IV of the Regulation is a discretionary power vested in the District Judge and the High Court was in error in directing him to do so.
