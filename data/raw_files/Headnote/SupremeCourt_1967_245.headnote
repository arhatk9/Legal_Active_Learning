 Out of the funds of a Hindu undivided family, 90 shares out of 300 shares of a company were purchased. After a few years the Karta of the family became a director of the company and was later appointed its Managing Director. The Income-tax Officer added the remuneration of the karta. for the assessment of the Hindu undivided family and on the basis of the decision of this Court in The C.I.T. West Bengal v. Kalu Babu Lai held that the remuneration was to be treated as income of the family. The assessee appealed unsuccessfully to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, but the Tribunal accepted the assessee's plea. On reference, the High Court answered in favour of the Revenue holding that its decision in C.I.T. Madras v. S. N. N. Sankaralinga Iyer was not authoritative this Court has subsequently impliedly overruled that decision in The C.1.T. West Bengal v. Kalu Babu Lal Chand and the later decision of this Court in M/s. Piyari Lal Adishwar Lal v. The C.I.T. Delhi was distingushable. In appeal, this Court- 
HELD : The remuneration of the Managing Director could not be treated as an accretion to the income of the joint family and taxed in its hands. The shares, in this case, were purchased by the joint family not with the object that the karta should become the Managing Director but in the ordinary course of investment. There was no real connection between the investment of joint family funds in the purchase of the shares and the appointment of karta as managing director of the company. Applying the doctrine of Hindu Law, the remuneration of the managing director was not earned by any detriment to the joint family assets [59H-60B.
 F] The present case did not fall within the principle of this Court's decision in C.I.T. West Bengal v. Kalu Babu Lal Chand but bore analogy to this Court's decision in M/s Piyare Lal Adishwar Lal v. The C.I.T. Delhi. The decision of the Madras High Court in C.I.T. Madras v. S. N. N.
 Sankaralinga Iyer w`s not implicitly over-ruled by this Court in C.I.T. West Bengal v. Kalu Babu Lal Chand but was distinguished. The facts in the present case are almost parallel to those in C.I.T. Madras v. S. N. N. Sankaralinga lyer. [60D-F] M/s. Piyare Lal Chand Adhishwar Lal v. The C.I.T., Delhi [1960] INSC 90; [1960] 3 S.C.R. 669, followed.
 The C.I.T. West Bengal v. Kalu Babu Lal chand [1959] INSC 89; [1960] 1 S.C.R. 320, distinguished.
 C.I.T. Madras v. S. N. N. Sankaralinga Iyer, 18 I.T.R, 194 referred 10.
