 The appellant and the respondent wore both members of the East India Jute and Hessian Exchange Ltd., *ad were bound by its rules -and regulations framed under s. 11 of the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act 74 of 1952 for regulating and controlling forward contracts in the jute trade. The appellant in August 1960 agreed to purchase and the respondent to sell 750 bales of Pakistan raw jute for delivery during October and/or November, 1960. According to the custom of the trade which was recognised by the bye- laws, the brokers sent a sold note on behalf of the respondent to the appellant, and issued a bought note on behalf of the appellant which was sent to the respondent.
 Differences arose between the parties in respect of the execution of the contract and the appellant referred a claim against the respondent to the Tribunal of Arbitration of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The respondent thereupon moved on the original side of the Calcutta High Court, a petition under s. 33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 challenging the existence and validity of the alleged arbitration agreement between the parties. The principal ground in 'support of the petition was that the terms of the bought and sold notes in respect of payment and otherwise did not tally, and on that account there was no concluded contract. In the affidavit filed by the appellant the genuineness of the sold note set up by the respondent was questioned. The High Court decided in favour of the respondent and the appellant by special leave came to this Court.
 
HELD : (i) The term as to payment is an important term of a written contract. The bought and the sold notes have the bye-laws to be in writing and in the prescribed form and if there be any discrepancy between the two i.e. the terms as to payment are specified in one note and not in the other, prima facie, there is no concluded contract. 1455 B-C] (ii) In view of the bye-laws of the Association which make it obligatory on the parties that the terms of the contract shall be in writing and that they shall be in the form prescribed, it could not be held that, apart from the terms of the bought and the sold notes which by custom of the market are issued, evidence may be led to- prove that the parties had agreed to certain terms not set out in the bought and sold notes. [456 El (iii) The bought note did not comply with bye law 7(c) in so far as the latter required a letter of authority to import Pakistan jute. In bye-law 8(b) two alternative methods of payment were provided; the bought note mentioned one of them, while , the sold note mentioned neither. In these circumstances, even if bye-laws 7(c) and 8(b) were read into the contract it could not be said that there was no discrepancy between the bought and the sold notes, The bought and sold notes as produced in Court could not be regarded as creating a binding contract.
 [457 F-458 C] 451 (iv) The question whether the sold note produced in Court Was genuine must 'be decided by the trial court after taking fresh evidence. (Case remanded to trial court for this purpose .) [458 D] Cowie & Ors. v. William Remfry and others, 3 M.I.A. 448, Durga Prosad Sureka & Ors. v. Bhaian Lall & Ors.
