 The respondent company carried on business of life and general insurance. In assessment proceedings for the year 1951-52, the Income-tax Officer held that the life insurance business and the general insurance business carried on by the company were 'distinct and separate' and the loss carried forward from the Previous year in respect of life insurance business could not be set off under s. 24(2) against the profit from the general insurance business. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the Tribunal confirmed the view of the Income-tax Officer. The Tribunal based its decision primarily on the provisions of the Income-tax Act which provided different methods of computation of the taxable income of life insurance business and of general insurance business. In reference the High Court decided in favour of the company, and the Revenue appealed. The test suggested on behalf of the Revenue for determining whether the two businesses were one business within the meaning of s. 24(2) was whether one of them could be closed without affecting the conduct of the other.
 
HELD : (i) The test suggested on behalf of the Revenue could not be accepted. If one business cannot conveniently be carried on after the closure of the other, there would be -a strong indication that the two business constitute "the same business", but no decisive inference may be drawn from the fact that after the closure of one business another may conveniently be carried on. [948 D] (ii) Whether two or more lines of business may be regarded as the "same business" or different business depends not upon the special methods prescribed by the Income-tax Act for computation of the taxable income, but upon the nature of the lines of business, the nature of their organisation, management, the source of the capital fund utilised, methods of book keeping and a host of other related circumstances which stamp the lines of business as same or distinct. [947 H] Scales v. George Thompson & Co. Ltd., 13 T.C. 89, 'referred to.
 (iii) In the present case there was little doubt that the two businesses constituted one composite business : the company was entitled to carry on the life insurance business and the general insurance business under its Memorandum of Association, and the business were attended to by the Branch Manager and the Agents without any distinction, there was one common administrative Organisation and the expenses incurred in connection with business both for administration and for heads of expenditure such -as salary of the staff, postage, staff welfare fund and general charges, were common. [948 B] The High Court was therefore fight in holding that the life insurance business and the general insurance business constituted the same business within the meaning of s. 24(2) of the Act.
