 The appellant, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), had a depot, comprising a pipeline terminal and LPG bottling plant, within the limits of Municipal Corporation, Jullundhar. The IOC transported various petroleum products to the depot through underground pipelines.
 The respondent Municipal Corporation raised a demand on the IOC for octroi. The IOC deposited the octroi duty but filed appeals before the appellate authority challenging the demand notice so far as it related to the petroleum products imported to the depot for export by the IOC therefrom to its dealers for the sale, use and consumption by persons other than IOC, outside the octroi limits. The appeals were dismissed.
 In the writ petition before the High Court the IOC, besides impugning the judgment of the appellate authority, challenged the validity of s.
 113 of the Punjab Municipal Corporation Act, 1976 authorising levy of octroi on articles and animals imported within the municipal limits of the respondent Corporation without any reference to the use, consumption or sale of the said goods, as being beyond the power of the state Legislature in view of entry 52 of List II of Schedule VII to the Constitution of India. It was contended that the Municipal Corporation could not impose and demand octroi duty on the petroleum products imported by the IOC to its depot for being exported at the risk of the IOC to its dealers at their sale points situated outside the area of the Municipal Corporation in as much as the petroleum products in such transactions only entered the area of the Municipal Corporation for the purpose of re-export to the place of business of its dealers and the property in such petroleum products passes to the dealers only at their premises outside the Municipal limits and not at the depot of the IOC and as such it could it could not be said that any transaction takes place within the municipal limits of the respondents for use, consumption or sale of the imported petroleum products and thus attract any octroi duty.
 The respondent contended that the transactions by the IOC were sale simplicitor at the depot within the municipal limits of the Corporation and the export of the goods to the premises of the dealers outside the octroi limits was of no consequence since the IOC received payment in advance as the sale proceeds from its various dealers and collected the local taxes etc. like the sale tax and MST from the dealers at its depot; that the IOC could not either in law or in equity retain the octroi duty so collected.
 The High Court held S. 113 of the Punjab Municipal Corporation Act, 1976 as intra vires, and upheld the levy and demands of octroi duty by the Municipal Corporation. It dismissed the writ petition holding that the property in the goods passed on to that dealers as and when the goods were laden in the turck/lorries and that the sale was complete at the depot of the IOC. The IOC filed the appeal by special leave.
 Allowing the appeal, this Court 
HELD: 1.1 Entry of goods within the local area for consumption use or sale therein is made taxable by the State Legislature on the authority of Entry 52 of List II of Schedule VII to the Constitution. The municipality deriving its power to tax from the state Legislature cannot have any authority more extensive than that of the state Legislature.
 Since the State Legislature under a legislation enacted in exercise of the powers conferred by Entry 52 of list II, is competent to levy a taxes only on the entry of goods for " consumption, use or sale" into a local area, the municipality cannot nuder such a legislation, have the power to levy tax in respect of goods brought into the local area for purposed other than consumption use or sale. Section 113 of the Act has therefore reasonably to be read subject to the same limitation as are contained in Entry 52 List II of Schedule VII.[69-E-G] 
1.2 The expression "imported into the city" in section 113, has to be interpreted as meaning "imported into the municipal limits for purposes of consumption, use or sale" only. Thus construed in the limited sense, section 113 of the Municipal Act is not ultra vires Entry 52 of List II of Schedule VII Interpreting the expression as meaning "imported into the city for any purpose and without any limitation, would amount to attributing to the legislature an intention to give a go-by to the restrictions contained in Entry 52 of List II. That is not permissible. [69-G-H; A- B] 
1.3 The High court was right in holding that the provisions of section 113 of the Municipal Act are not beyond the competence of the state Legislature and the same are to be read along with Entry 52 of List II of Schedule VII of the constitution. [70-D-E] 2.1. The transaction whereunder the petroleum products trans-ported to the depot of the IOC are meant for export from its depot inside the octroi limits to outside the municipal limits to its dealers for sale use and consumption by persons other than the IOC outside the octroi limits is a transaction of re-export and the appropriation of the goods does not take place at the depot but at the outlets of the dealers or the agents outside the municipal limits. The octroi duty is, therefore, not chargeable on such a transaction. The levy and collection of the octroi duty on such goods by the Municipal Corporation is, therefore, not justified. [76-G-H;77-A] Burmah-shell oil storage and Distributing Co. of India Ltd. Belgaum v. Belgaum Borough Municipality Belgaum, Air 1963 SC 906 and Municipal council, Jodhpur v. M/s Parekh Automobiles Ltd. and ors. [1990]1 SCC 367, relied on.
 2.2. The High court erred in not considering various clauses of the agreement or the affidavits filed by the IOC before the appellate authority or the categorical statement in the writ petition and rejoinder affidavit , showing that the risk till delivery of products to the dealers continues to remain with the IOC and the goods are re-exported at the risk of the IOC and not at the risk of the dealers; and that the property in the goods passed on to the dealers only on delivery of the products at their place of business and at no point of time prior thereto. This evidence had a material bearing on the case and deserved proper consideration and in the absence of any rebuttal should have been considered i n its correct perspective. The Municipal Corporation took no steps to produce any material to show that the delivery of the goods outside the municipal limits was not at the risk and responsibility of the IOC.[72-C-D, G;74-G-H; 75-A] 3.1. Since the IOC has collected the octroi duty from its dealers and agents who have in turn passed on the burden to the consumer, there is no equity in favour of the IOC to claim a refund of the same. [77-B-C] 
3.2 The appellant shall not be entitled to any refund of the octroi duty already deposited by it with the Municipal Corporation. The IOC shall not be liable to pay the octroi duty , in respect of such transaction in future only on the condition that it does not collect any octroi duty from its dealers or agents in respect of the re- exported goods at the time of their appropriation outside the municipal limits. Should the IOC collect any such octroi duty from its dealers or agents, it shall remain liable to deposit the same with the Municipal Corporation and shall not retain any such octroi duty for its own benefit.
