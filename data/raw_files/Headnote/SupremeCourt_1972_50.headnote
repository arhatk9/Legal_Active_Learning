 The forests of the appellants vested in the respondent-State as a result of the notification under the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act. 1950, and the Compensation Officer determined the basis of compensation.
 In appeal by the respondent the High Court held that the Compensation Officer in determining the compensation was wrong in arriving at the iverage annual income by adding the annual income, under s. 39(1) (e) (i) on the basis of a period of 25 years and the appraisement of the annual yield, under s. 39(1)(e)(ii), on the date of vesting.
 In appeals to this Court, 
HELD : (1) The High Court Was correct in holding that the average annual income from forest under s. 39(1)(e) of the Act could not be computed by arithmetical addition of the figures arrived at on the basis of cl. (i) and on the basis of cl. (ii). The section speaks of computation of average annual income from forest, (i) on the basis of income for a period of 20 to 40 agricultural years immediately preceding the date of vesting as the Compensation Officer may consider reasonable, and (ii) on the appraisement of the annual yield of the forest on the date of vesting. Under the first clause. the actual income derived from the forest for a number of years before the date of vesting as the Com- pensation Officer may consider reasonable is to be taken and the average calculated. Under the second clause the annual yield as on the date of vesting is to be appraised. This should be done, inter alia, by taking into consideration the number and age of trees, the area of cultivation and the produce. Therefore, the compensation officer has to compute the 'average annual income' by taking recourse to both the methods but not by adding the figures on the basis of cl.
 (i) and on the basis of cl. (ii) [435 D-H; 436 A-B] (2) The High Court rightly held that forest income was referable to price of the standing timber. Hence any income which the appellants derived by processing wood, was income in the nature of trade and would not be forest income. [436 E-G]
