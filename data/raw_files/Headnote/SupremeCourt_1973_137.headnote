 In execution of a decree, six houses of the judgment debtors were sold. in the sale proclamation, 3 houses were shown as one item, two bungalows as one item and the remaining house as another item. The valuation of each item in the proclamation was practically that given by the decree- holders. The Amin put up for sale the 3 houses comprised in one item as separate houses and the total amount realised from the sale of the 3 houses was 2-1/2 times the amount in the sale proclamation. The two bungalows were however sold as a single unit and purchased by the decree holders. After the sales, the judgment debtors applied for setting aside the sales on the ground of fraud and material irregularity in conducting them, and also complained of substantial injury. The execution court and the High Court, in appeal, dismissed the applications.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The 2 bungalows should be sold afresh after judicially considering and deciding the question whether they can be sold separately and what particulars should be inserted in the sale proclamation. [380C-D] (a)The object of O.21, r.66(2)(e), C.P.C., is that essential facts having a bearing on the question of value of the property and which would assist the purchaser in forming his own opinion on the value must be stated by the Court.
 The Court should normally state the valuation given by both the decree-holder as well as the judgment debtor where they have both valued the property and these do not appear fantastic. It may usefully state other material facts, such as the area of land, nature of the-rights in it, municipal assessment, actual rents realised, which could reasonably be expected to affect the valuation. What could be reasonably and usefully slated succinctly in a sale proclamation has to be determined on the facts of each particular case. it is not necessary for the execution court to state its own estimate; nor is it necessary for the execution court to order the insertion of a, judicially passed order in the sale proclamation itself, but, it should pass an order showing that it had applied its mind to the need for determining all the essential particulars, which would reasonably be looked for by a purchaser and which should be inserted in the sale proclamation. The order should show that the Court had considered the objection, if any, of the decree-holder or the judgment-debtor as the case may be, and the Court should not merely accept the ipse dixit of one side. [378C-H] In the present case, the judgment-debtors bad given their valuation and even applied for the appointment of a commissioner at their expense to report on matters affecting the value of the property, but, the execution court had practically accepted, as its own valuation, without indicating reasonable grounds for this preference, whatever the decree-holder had asserted about the value of the property. The area of the compound in which the two bungalows were situated was not mentioned in the sale proclamation, and though this land was nuzool leasehold land neither the unexpired period of lease nor rent were mentioned. It was 'not slated whether the bungalows would be sold as one or two items of property, though the judgment debtors asserted that they would fetch a much higher value if sold separately. The Court rejected the judgment debtors' figures by merely observing that they are exaggerated and practically accepted without hesitation, the figures of the decree-holders. But, the valuation was proved to be incorrect judged by the results of all the auction sales taken as a whole. [379D-H] Therefore, the execution court had not performed its duty fairly and reasonably. Hence. there was a material irregularity in conducting the sale.[1379 G] 373 Case law considered.
 [Whether decree-holders' conduct amounted to actual fraud practised on the Court, not decided]. [379D-F] (b)The result of the separate sales of the 3 houses comprised in one item was that when the sale prices were added up, they fetched a considerably higher price than that put upon the properties when lumped together in one lot.
 The High Court found that the sale of the two bungalows separately would probably have similarly fetched a higher price. Therefore, there is enough evidence to indicate that the judgment-debtors had suffered substantial injury in so far as the sale of the 2 bungalows is concerned. [380A-D]
