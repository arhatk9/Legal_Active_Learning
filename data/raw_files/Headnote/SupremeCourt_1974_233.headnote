 Goa, Daman and Diu, erstwhile Portuguese territories became a Union Territory of the Indian Union on December 19, 1961.
 The President of India, in exercise of the powers under Art.
 240 promulgated the Taxation Laws (Extension to Union Territories) Regulation II of 1963. By cl. 3 of the Regulation, the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961, was extended to the Union Territory. By cl. (4) the corresponding law in the Union Territory was repealed from April 1, 1963. Clause (7) provided that if any difficulty arose in giving effect in the Union Territory, to the provisions of any Act etc., the Central Government may, by general or special order give necessary directions for the removal of the difficulty..
 The petitioners were carrying on business in the Union Territory, where there was a Portuguese law relating to levy of tax, the scheme of which was entirely different from the Indian Act. Under that law, the net profits and gains were not calculated but a tax was levied at a certain percentage on the gross income or turnover of the business irrespective of whether the assessee made any profits or suffered losses.
 After the extension of the Indian Act. the petitioners were assessed under it from the assessment year 1964-65 onwards.
 The assessee was allowed depreciation of the assets used by him for his business. on the basis of the 'written down value' under s. 43(6)(b) read with s. 32 of the Income Tax Act.
 Section 32 adopts two methods in allowing depreciation. In the case of non-ocean going ships and buildings, machinery, plant or furniture, the prescribed percentage of depreciation is to be computed on the basis of the written down value of the asset. Section 43 (6) defines 'written down value' to mean (a) in the case of assets acquired in the previous year, the actual cost and (b) in the case of assets before the previous year, the actual cost less all depreciation actually allowed under the 1961-Act or under the 1922-Act or any Act repealed by that Act or under any executive orders. Where the asset was acquired in the previous year depreciation would be allowed at the prescribed rate on such cost, and in subsequent years, the depreciation would be calculated on the basis of actual cost less depreciation actually allowed.
 For the assessment year 1964-65, in assessing the petitioner, the written down value was taken as the actual cost of the assessee's assets since no depreciation was actually allowed to him earlier and the written down value was progressively reduced in the succeeding years by deducting the depreciation actually allowed in On Nov. 8, 1970, the Central Government, in purported exercise of its powers under cl. (7) of the Regulation, promulgated the Taxation Laws (Extension to Union Territories) (Removal of Difficulties) Order. It provided in cl. (3) that in making any assessment under the Income Tax Act, 1961, all depreciation actually allowed tinder the local laws shall be taken into account in computing the deductions, and in the proviso 2 to cl. (3), that, where in respect of any period no depreciation was actually allowed under the local law, depreciation for that period shall be calculated at the rate under the Indian Income Tax, 1961, or the 1922 Act or any Act repealed by that Act or under any executive orders issued when the Indian Income Tax Act, 1886, was in force, and the depreciation shall be deemed to be the depreciation actually allowed under the local law.
 In the light of proviso 2 to cl. (3) of the 1970 order, the assessment already made of the petitioner were sought to be revised, so that, the written down value of the 641 assets for calculating the depreciation allowance-even for the first time when the petitioners were assessed under the 1961-Act-would not be the actual cost of the assets, but a far lower sum with proportionate increase in the petitioner's liability to tax since the assessment year 1964-65.
 The petitioner therefore challenged the validity of Proviso 2 to Cl. (3) of the Taxation laws (Extension to Union Territories) (Removal of Difficulties) Order 1970.

HELD : Allowing the Petitions, The 2nd Proviso to cl. (3) of the 1970-Order is ultra vires the Central Government when exercising its powers under cl.
 (7) of Regulation III of 1963, and the Revenue is not entitled to levy tax on the basis of the depreciation allow- ance computed in accordance with the said Proviso. [659E-F] (1) To keep pace with the rapidly increasing responsibilities of a welfare democratic state, the legislature has to turn out a plethora of hurried legislation. It is well nigh impossible, especially when the legislature deals with socioeconomic activities of the State or extends existing Indian laws to territories freshly merged in the Indian Union, to foresee all the circumstances to deal with which a statute is enacted or to anticipate all the difficulties that might arise in its working due to peculiar local conditions. In order to obviate the necessity of approaching the legislature for removal of every difficulty however trivial, encountered in the en- forcement of the statute, the legislature invests the Executive with power to remove difficulties' for making the implementation of the statute effective by making minor adaptations and peripheral adjustments in the statute without touching its substance. [653D-H] (2) The existence or arising of a 'difficulty' is the sine qua non for the exercise of the power under cl. 7 of the 1963-Regulation. The 'difficulty' contemplated by the clause must be a difficulty arising in giving effect to the provisions of the Act and not a difficulty arising aliunde.
 Further, the Central Government can exercise the power under the clause only to the extent it is necessary for applying or giving effect to the Act and no further. It may slightly tinker with the Act to round off angularities and smoothen the joints or remove minor obscurities to make it workable, but it cannot change, disfigure or do violence to the basic structure and primary features of the Act. Under the guise of removing a difficulty, it cannot change the scheme and essential provisions of the Act. [653H654B] (3) The contention that but for the impugned proviso, the provisions of ss. 32 and 43 (6) (b) of 'the 1961-Act, on its extension to the Union Territory, could not be given effect to and applied to the petitioner must be rejected. There could be no difficulty in computing the 'written down value' under S. 43 (6) (b) of the assets that had been acquired by the petitioner before the previous year. Since no depreciation was, in fact, allowed to the petitioner in the past under the Portuguese law, in the first assessment under the Indian Act, the written down value would be the actual cost of the assets less nil. Thereafter, in each succeeding year, the depreciation actually allowed in the preceding year would be deducted causing yearly diminution of the written down value with consequent decrease in the de preciation allowed on that basis. This was exactly the manner in which the 'written down value' of the assets of the petitioner had been computed and depreciation allowed for the several assessment years from 1964-65 onwards, showing that there was no difficulty in applying the provisions. [655H-656D] (4) There is no basis for the argument that the impugned proviso brings about equality of treatment among the different assessees in India. Far from ensuring parity of treatment it puts the assessee in the Union territories in a worse position than the assessees in the rest of India. [656 D-F] Straw, Products Ltd. v. Income-tax Officer, Bhopal, [1967] INSC 238; [1968] 2, S.C.R. 1 followed.

 642 The phrase 'actually allowed' is limited to the depreciation actually taken into account or granted or given effect to and cannot be stretched to mean 'nationally allowed'. In this Union Territory, under the Portuguese law no depreciation was ever computed or actually allowed to the assessees. The impugned proviso. by replacing depreciation 'actually allowed' with depreciation 'deemed to have been allowed, by a fiction of law, even where no depreciation was at all allowed, in effect, attempts to change the fundamental scheme of the Indian Act in its application to the assessees in the Union Territory of Goa, Diu and Daman.
 [658B-E] (6) Under s. 32(2) of the Indian Income Tax Act an assessee is entitled to ,carry forward' unabsorbed depreciation in case of loss or inadequate profits, without any time limit.
 For ensuring this right to an assessee, assessments for ascertaining losses or insufficiency of profits of his business, since the acquisition and use of the assets by him, will have to be made. In the Union Territory of Goa etc., during the interregnums between Dec. 19, 1961, and April 1, 1963, there was no law authorising the levy of income tax. Even under the Portuguese law, the tax was in reality a 'turn over' tax irrespective of the assessee making profit or loss. Retrospective assessments for the purpose, going back to a period prior to 1963, could have been made under a law of Parliament but not under an execu- tive fiat. But, in the Indian Income Tax Act as extended to these territories, there is no provision for making assessment in respect of those past years. In the absence of such law, it is impossible to work the Proviso without riding rough shod over the rights of the assessees to have their unabsorbed depreciation relating to the pre-1963 period, carried forward. Therefore, a Goan assessee, who suffered losses and depreciation of his assets will never get the benefit of such carry forward, as no machinery exists for determining the inadequacy of profits or the factual of losses in those years. Viewed from this angle, the impugned proviso would, in the implementation of the Act, create difficulties rather than remove them. [659A-E] (Per Alagiriswami. J., dissenting).
 
HELD : Dismissing the petition, (1) The provision regarding written down value and allowance of depreciation under the Indian Income Tax law proceeds on the basis of depreciation allowed year by year with the result that the written down value goes down year after year aid similarly the depreciation. If, therefore, because there was no provision under the Income Tax law applying to the former Portuguese territories providing for depreciation the written down value of an asset is taken as the actual cost even after many years of its acquisition it would mean putting the assessees in those 'territories at an advantage compared to the assessees in the rest of India.
 More important, it would not accord with realities and would not be in accordance with the scheme of depreciation under the Indian Income-tax Act. A certain plant and machinery purchased 10 years earlier and now worth half its original value would be taken to be worth its original cost and depreciation allowed on that basis. It is, therefore, necessary to devise some method by which both the assessees in the Indian Territory and the erstwhile Portuguese territory could be put on the same footing and the normal scheme of depreciation under the Indian Income-tax Act made applicable to all. A similar problem arose in the case dealt with in Commissioner of Income Tax, Hyderabad v. Dewan Bahadur Ramgopal Mills Ltd. [1960] INSC 191; [1961] 2 S.C.R. 318 dealing with assessees in Hyderabad governed by the Hyderabad Income Tax Act before the Indian Income tax Act was extended to the Hyderabad area and the decision given therein is exactly to the point. [661D-H; 663H] (2) In that case, this Court held that if depreciation actually allowed under the. Hyderabad Income-tax Act alone was taken into account in computing the aggregate depreciation allowance and the written down value an anomalous result would follow, namely, depreciation allowance to be allowed to the assessee in the accounting year under the Indian Income Tax Act would be more than what was allowed in previous years under the Hyderabad Income-tax Act, that this would create a disparity and be against the scheme of the Indian Income tax Act, that it was therefore necessary to explain paragraph 2 of the Removal of Dif- ficulties Order, 1950, (considered to that case) to assimilate or harmonise the position regarding depreciation allowance. This is exactly what was proposed to be dead in the case of the former Portuguese territories by the impugned Order. [663B-H] 643 (3) The decision in Rajngopal Mills was considered in Straw Products Ltd. v. I.T.O. [1967] INSC 238; [1968] 2 SCR 1. It was not dissented from and by implication the decision in Ramgopal Mills is still good law. In the Straw Products case the court held that the order impugned in that case sought, in purported exercise of the removal of difficulties power, to remove a difficulty which had not arisen and that therefore it was unauthorised. The Court specifically did not think it necessary to determine to what extent, if any, it would be open to the Central Government by an Order issued in exercise of the power to remove difficulties to make pro- vision which is inconsistent with the provisions of the Indian Income tax Act, nor did it hold that the Order impugned in that case was inconsistent with the provision of the Indian Income-tax Act. It was therefore open to the Central Government, in exercise of its powers under cl. 7, to issue the, impugned order. [665B-G] (4) Under the scheme of the Indian Income tax Act, it was open to the assessee to carry forward the depreciation for any length of time if he had sustained any loss. It could not however, be contended by the assessee in the present case that it will now be very difficult, if not impossible, for the assessee to produce all the accounts of earlier years to show the losses which he had incurred, the depreciation he was entitled to and which he can carry forward. Assessees are expected to and would have maintained accounts at least for the purpose of the Income- tax Act, which was in force in the former Portuguese territories, though that Act was a simple one. What is necessary for working out the impugned order is to know whether there was a profit or a loss and as the cost of acquisition of the assets, in respect of which depreciation allowance is claimed, should also be available it should not be very difficult to calculate the depreciation and arrive at the written down value as on the date when the Indian Income-tax Act was extended to the former Portuguese territories. To accede to the claim of the assessee that the original value of the assets should be taken to be the written down value however long they might have been used means that they get an advantage not merely in the first year in which the Indian Income-tax Act was applied to those territories but to enjoy a continued advantage which will last is long as their assets last. [665G-666C] (5) The Order is given retrospective effect, but the Central Government has the power to make an order or give a direction so as to remove, the difficulty from the very beginning, and that is what the Order does. [666F-G] Ramgopal Mills Case, followed.
