 on their arrival at the airport from Muscat the Customs Authorities apprehended the petitioner and her husband (the detenu) and recovered 141 slabs of palladium (a precious metal) each slab weighing one ounce, concealed in different parts of their baggage. In his statement under section 108 of the Customs Act the detenu stated that he was smuggling the metal because of the huge profit involved in it and that he alone was responsible for the smuggling. He was detained under the provisions of section 3(1) of the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974 In a petition under article 32 of the Constitution filed by the detenu's wife it was contended on behalf of the detenu that: (I) arbitrary rejection of his request for legal representation before the Advisory Board caused serious prejudice to him; (2) as a result of the authority's refusal to give information on five out of six points asked for by the detenu he was deprived of the opportunity to make a proper representation; (3) there was no reason for detaining him on June 6, 1981 although he was apprehended on January 8, 1981 and this long 1029 delay had prejudiced his case: (4) on the facts and circumstances of the case although prosecution was the normal remedy he was unjustifiably detained under A the COFEPOSA Act; and (5) failure of the authorities to follow the guidelines framed by the Government rendered the detention mala fide and discriminatory.
 Dismissing the petition, ^ 
 HELD :1. Section 8(e) of the Act does not bar representation by a lawyer 1 but only lays down that the detenu cannot claim representation by a lawyer as of right.
 The Act has given the Board a discretion to permit or not to permit representation of the detenu by counsel according to necessity in a particular case. In the instant case after the rejection of the request the Board reviewed his case and gave its opinion on which alone the Government confirmed the detention. [1033 G] 2(a) When a document containing the grounds of detention is supplied to the detenu he is not entitled to know which part or parts of the grounds was or were taken into consideration by the detaining authority in detaining him. lt will be for the Court to judge whether the facts narrated constituted the grounds of detention or which facts might possibly enter and influence the detaining authority in coming to its subjective satisfaction. [1035 F-G] (b) The question whether or not import of palladium is prohibited is an information on a question of law and could have been obtained by the detenu from the relevant statutes, rules etc. The Government is not under any obligation to furnish him with legal information which is available from legal literature. The detaining authority is only required to comply with the requirements of article 22(S) of the Constitution. [1336 A-B] (c) The plea that the detenu did not know whether palladium was a precious metal is not a permissible plea on the ground of public policy. Any detenu may plead that he had no knowledge that gold or silver is a precious metal.
 That apart, the detenu in his statement before the Customs Authorities had stated that he purchased the metal from a dealer in precious metals and that he had smuggled it to make profit. Though not a prohibited article, it is a dutiable article. [1036 E-F] 
 3. In passing a detention order, the authorities concerned must have due regard to the object with which the order was passed. Delay simpliciter in passing an order of detention after an incident is not fatal to the detention.
 In certain cases delay may be unavoidable and reasonable.
 What is required by law is that the delay must be satisfactorily explained by the detaining authority. Neither has the detaining authority any liability to tell or satisfy the detenu as to the causes of delay. It should satisfy the Court that there was no infraction of the constitutional provisions. In the instant case eleven statements of the detenu and his wife were recorded on various dates between January 9, 1981 and April 7, 1981 and the order of detention had been issued after the completion of the investigation.
 [1037 C-D; 1038 A-B] 
 4. A prosecution or the absence of it is not an absolute bar to an order of H preventive detention. If the authority is satisfied that the offender has a tendency to violate laws there will be no bar to detain a person under the Preventive 1030 Detention Act in order to disable him to repeat such offences. What is required is that the detaining authority should satisfy the Court that it had in mind the question whether prosecution was sufficient in the circumstances or the case. In the instant case the detaining authority stated that the prosecution under the ordinary law was not sufficient for preventing the detenu from indulging in similar activities in future. [1039 B-D 5(a) The guidelines issued by the Government, were of a confidential nature and intended to guide the customs and the intelligence officials and have no force of law. There can be no valid complaint of discrimination in arresting and bringing to book a particular offender under the Customs Act or under any Preventive Detention Law. [1040 H] (b) The past conduct or antecedent history of a person can appropriately be taken into consideration in making a detention order. In the instant case the detenu admitted that he had a home in Bombay and business in Muscat; his passport showed that he was moving between India and Muscat;
 he smuggled palladium into India to make profit. The detaining authority was well within its jurisdiction in taking into consideration all these facts and subjectively coming to the satisfaction whether or not he would be repeating his activities.
 [104] C-D] 
 6. The High Court under article 226 and this Court either under article 32 or Article 136 of the Constitution do not sit in appeal on the orders of preventive detention.
 They have to see whether the formalities enjoined by article 22(S) have been complied with by the detaining authority and if that has been done the Court cannot examine the materials before it and find that the detaining authority should not have been satisfied on the materials before it and detained him under the Preventive Detention Act. That is the function of an appellate court. [1041 F-H]
