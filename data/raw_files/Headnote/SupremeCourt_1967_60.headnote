 An arbitration award in respect of certain disputes between the appellant and the respondents was filed in Court and notice of the filing served on the appellant on September 30, 1957. 'Me appellant filed an objection on November 3, 1957 attacking the validity of the award on various grounds.
 The respondents contended before the trial Court that the objection was in the nature of an application to set aside the award and contained grounds which fell under s. 30 of the Arbitration Act 10 of 1940; therefore, as the objection was filed more than 30 days after notice was served on the appellant., it was barred by limitation under Art. 158 of the Limitation Act No. 9 of 1908. The trial Court upheld the appellant's objection and an appeal to the High Court was dismissed.
 On appeal to this Court, 
HELD:Dismissing the appeal, The Arbitration Act contemplates making of an application to set aside an award on grounds mentioned in s. 30. This application must be made within 30 days of the date of service of notice as provided in Art. 158 of the Limitation Act. An objection petition in the nature of a written- statement may in appropriate cases be treated as such application provided it is filed within the period of limitation prescribed. Even if the court has the power to set aside an award suo motu that power cannot be used to set aside an award on grounds falling under s. 30, if taken in a petition filed more than 30 days after the service of notice, for in that case the limitation provided would be completely negatived.
