 Section 4(1)(c) of the Bihar Consolidation of Holdings and Prevention of Fragmentation Act, 1956 provides that upon the issue of a notification under section 3(1) of the Act every proceeding pending before any court or authority, whether of the first instance or of appeal shall, on an order being passed in that behalf by the Court or authority before whom such suit or proceeding is pending, stand abated. The proviso to the section enacts that such abatement shall be without prejudice to the rights of persons affected to agitate the right in dispute before the appropriate consolidation authorities in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The State Government issued a notification under section 3(1) of the Act.
 The plaintiffs' (appellants herein) suit for a declaration of their title and for recovery of possession of agricultural lands bearing khata Nos. 458 and 459 against defendants (respondents herein and three other defendants) was decreed by the trial court. Defendant No. 7 claimed interest in Khata No. 458 only while the other defendants 1 to 4 claimed interest in Khata No. 459. On appeal the Additional District Judge affirmed the decree of the trial court. Defendant No. 7 died when the first appeal was pending before the District Judge. Neither his legal representatives nor any one claiming under him were substituted nor was an appeal preferred by any of them to the High Court.
 Before the High Court the defendants 1 to 4 submitted that the work of consolidation of holdings in respect of the lands in dispute having been taken up by the concerned authorities consequent on the issue of a notification under section 3 of the Act the appeal would abate by virtue of the provisions of section 4 of the Act. Accepting the contention the High Court held that the appeal abated and set aside the judgment and decree of the courts below in respect of both Khatas 458 and 459.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellants-plaintiffs that (1) even if the second appeal abated in respect of Khata No. 459 the High Court could not set aside the judgment and decree of the trial court as well as of the first appellate court both of which became final and (2) in any event, on the 554 death of defendant No. 7 during the pendency of the first appeal, his legal representatives having not been substituted, his appeal abated and none of the present respondents had any interest in the property. Therefore, the High Court was in error in setting aside the decree of the trial court in so far as that property was concerned.
 Dismissing the appeal in part, ^ The effect of a notification issued under Section 3 of the Act bringing a land in dispute in a civil proceeding under a scheme of consolidation is that the proceedings pending in the civil court either at the stage of trial, appeal or revision would come to naught. The High Court was right in holding that the second appeal abated in respect of Khata No. 459 and that the judgment and decree of the trial court and the first appellate court stood abated along with those proceedings. [562 G-H] When a scheme of consolidation is undertaken, the Act provides for adjudicating of claims by the authorities under the Act. In order to permit them to pursue adjudication of rival claims unhampered by any proceedings in civil courts a wholesome provision is made that pending proceedings involving claims to land at whatever stage they might be, should abate. To avoid conflict between rival jurisdictions the Act provides that such proceedings should be examined exclusively by the authorities under the Act. Provision has been made for abatement of pending proceedings as well. [558 F-G] The concept of abatement known to civil law is that if a party to a proceeding dies either in the course of trial or appeal or revision and the right to sue survives, the heirs and legal representatives of the deceased party would have to be substituted, failure to do which would result in abatement of the proceedings. If a party to an appeal or revision dies and if the appeal or revision abates it will have no impact on the judgment, decree or order against which the appeal or revision is preferrers. Such judgment, decree or order under appeal or revision would become final.
 [559 B-D] But the abatement contemplated by section 4 of the Act is of a different kind. If the concept of abatement as understood in the Code of Civil Procedure is imported into this case, it would do irreparable harm to the parties. For example, if an appeal abates rendering either the judgment of the trial court or the judgment in the first appeal final and binding the consolidation authorities would also be bound by it and the party whose appeal or revision abated would lose the chance of persuading the appellate or revisional authority to accept its case which may result in interfering with or setting aside the judgment etc. in appeal. That this could not be the intention of section 4 is manifest from the proviso to clause (c) of section 4. By virtue of the proviso no one would stand to suffer on account of abatement because a special forum is carved out for adjudication of the rights of parties. [559 E-G] Ram Adhar Singh v.

 State of Bihar and Anr., A.I.R. 1980 SC 2051; referred to.
 555 The High Court was in error in holding that the judgment and decree in respect of Khata No. 458 also abated.
 Defendant No. 7 claimed separate, specific and exclusive right in respect of that Khata. On his death his legal representatives having not been substituted, his appeal abated. His legal representatives did not prefer an appeal to the High Court. The appellants' title in respect of Khata 458 therefore became established under the decree of the trial court. The abatement of the second appeal will have no impact on the appellants to Khata No. 458. [562 C-E]
