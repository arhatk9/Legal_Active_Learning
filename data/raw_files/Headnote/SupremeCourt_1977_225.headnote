 The appellant Company has a factory situated at Sanatnagar where asbestos sheets are manufactured. The Company has zonal sales offices in various cities. In the State of Andhra Pradesh they have such zonal offices at Vijayawada and Vizagapatnam. There are employed in the zonal office at Vijayawada who do the work of canvassing for the sale of products manufactured in the factory located at Sanatnagar.
 The appellant contended that the zonal offices are establishments and are not factories and, as such, do not fall within the scope of the Employees State Insurance Act, 1948. The High Court negatived the contention of the appellant.
 The appellant in an appeal by certificate granted by the High Court contended that the Act makes a distinction between a factory and an establishment and that the zonal offices and branch offices are in the nature of establishments and cannot be brought within the purview of factories. In order to bring an employee within the scope of the Act it was submitted he should not only be an employee within the meaning of section 2(9) of the Act but also he should be an employee of the factory as defined in section 2(12) of the Act. The scheme of the Act and particularly section 38, which is the charging it was sub- mitted section would indicate that the Act was intended to cover only employees in factories and employees who are connected with the work of the factory. The respondents supported the judgment of the High Court.
 Dismissing the appeal held :
 1.The object of the enactment is to provide for certain benefits to employees in case of sickness, maternity and employment injury and to make provision for certain other matters in relation thereto. Section 2_(9)' defines employee to mean any person employed for wages in or in connection with the work of a factory or establishment to which the Act applies and includes any person employed for wages on any work and includes factory or establishment or any part, department or branch thereof or with the purchase of raw materials for or the distribution or sale of the products of the factory or establishment. The latter part of the definition was added by the Amending Act 44 of 1966.

 2.The amendment was made for the purpose of covering cases which were held to be outside the scope of section 2(9) by the decisions of Bombay and Madras High Courts. The amended section includes any person employed for wages on any work connected with the administration of the factory or any part department or branch thereof or with the purchase of raw materials or for the distribution or sale of products of the factory. It is clear that the work connected with the administration of the factory, the purchase of raw materials and the distribution of sale of products are brought within the scope of the definition. [353 H, 354 A-B] 346 3.The court negatived the contention that only employees who are employed in the factory are required to be insured and not employees employed in connection with the work of the factory. The court held that employees employed for administrative purposes or for purchase of raw materials, or for sale of the finished goods if employed in connection with the work of the factory are Included within the definition of employees.
