 On receiving an offer from A for the purchase of a house belonging to B, Y who was looking after the house, cabled to B that there was an offer of Rs. 6,000 for the house. B sent a cable in reply on the 5th August, 1944, that he would not accept less than Rs. 10,000. Y conveyed this informa- tion to A on the 9th and on the 14th A wrote a letter to Y stating that he thereby confirmed the oral offer of Rs.
 10,000 that he had made to Y on the 11th. On the 26th Y cabled to B as follows: "Offered Rs. 10,000. May I sell".
 On the same day, W, another friend of B, with whom also B was in correspondence, sent an offer for Rs. 11,000 and B accepted it. A sued for specific performance alleging that B's cable of the 5th was a counter-offer and as he had accepted it on the 14th, there was a concluded contract for sale in his favour on that day.
 Held, that the cable sent by B on the 5th was a mere statement of the lowest price at which he would sell and contained no implied contract to sell at that price. A's letter of the 14th was under the circumstances only a fresh offer; and as B had not accepted it there was no concluded contract in favour of A.
 Harvey v. Facey [1803] A.C. 552 applied.
