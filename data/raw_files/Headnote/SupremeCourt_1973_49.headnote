 After the decision of this Court in Yadalam Lakshminarasimhiah Setty's case the President of India on June 9, 1969 promulgated the Central Sales Tax (Amendment) Ordinance 1969 with the object of superseding the effect of that decision and to bring to tax sales effected by every dealer in the course of inter State trade or commerce notwithstanding the fact that no tax could have been levied under the sales-tax law of the appropriate State if that sale had been an intra State sale. That provision was given retrospective effect but s. 10(1) of the Amendment Act provided that if during the relevant period dealer had not collected sales-tax on the ground that sales-tax was not leviable on the sale in question under the unamended Act 'he would not be liable to pay sales-tax under the amended Act.
 The burden of proving, however, that no sales-tax bad been collected was placed by s. 10(2) on the dealer. The Ordinance was replaced by the Central Sales Tax (Amendment) Act, 1969. After the Amendment Act came into force the sales-tax authorities sought to reopen under r. 38 of the Mysore Sales Tax Rules 1957 the assessments made on certain dealers on the ground that these assessments suffered from mistakes apparent on the record. In writ petitions filed by the dealers, the High Court of Mysore accepted their contention that the Sales Tax Officer had no jurisdiction to reassess the assessees as it was impermissible for him to receive any additional evidence with a view to decide the question whether the assessees had collected sales-tax on the turnover in question and consequently he could not take any assistance from rule 38. Allowing the appeals by special leave filed by the Revenue.
 
HELD : it is well settled that if a subsequent legislation is given retrospective effect and is deemed to have been in force at the time when the order to be rectified was made, then the law to be applied is the amended law. In other words, for finding out whether there is a mistake apparent on the record the authority has to look to the amended law and not to the law that was in force at the time the original order was made. [748H] Rule 38 of the Mysore Sales Tax Rules must be read with s.
 10 of the Amendment Act. if so read it is clear that the assessing authorities before reassessing the dealers should afford them the opportunity to satisfy them that they have not collected the tax. If the impact of s. 10 is ignored, as the High Court had done, then the assessments in question are liable to be reopened whether the assessees had collected tax or not. The assessees cannot have the benefit of s. 10(1) but not the burden of proof placed on them under s. 10(2). [746E] Yadalam Lakshminarasimhiah Setty and Sons v.
