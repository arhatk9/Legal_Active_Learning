 The assessees were the three shareholders of a private company. The company made profits in the calendar year 1947, but did not declare any dividend at the shareholders meeting held on December 4, 1948. The Income-tax Officer passed an order under s. 23 A (1) of the Income-tax Act whereby the income of the company was deemed to have been divided amongst the three shareholders. He issued notices to the assessees which were served on them on April 1, 1954.
 The assessees contended that the notices were served beyond the period of four years allowed by s. 34 (1) (b).
 Held, that the notices served under s. 34 (1) of the Act were beyond time and the Income-tax Officer had no jurisdic- tion to assess the assessees. Under s. 23A (1) the dividend was to be deemed to have been distributed not on June 30, 1949, by which date the company should have distributed the dividend, but on the date of the general meeting i.e., December, 4, 1948 within the accounting year 1948 and assessment year 210 1949-50. The notice was not served within four years from the end of the assessment year. It made no difference that under s. 23 A (1) an order could be passed at any time.
