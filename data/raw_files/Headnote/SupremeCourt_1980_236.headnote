 The prosecution alleged that when the deceased girl did not return home for quite some time from play her mother, alongwith two neighbouring women went in search of her.
 Believing that she might be in the appellant's house. they repeatedly knocked at the door which was locked from inside, but there was no response from within. At that moment P.W. 5 who lived next to the appellant's house, arrived on the scene. P.W. 5 climbed over the roof of his house, entered the appellant's house through the open court-yard and opened the front door. On entering the house, according to the prosecution, the three ladies saw the appellant lying on a cot in the court-yard with a cover pulled upto his face and the dead body of the child in the bath room, wrapped in a blanket. The mother lifted her dead child threw the blanket and ran home with the dead body. The girl's underpant was missing.
 The dead child had injuries on her person and her private parts were swollen. Postmortem examination of the dead body showed that the vagina of the child was lacerated and her hymen ruptured and that death occurred as a result of asphyxia. Examination of the appellant showed that there was a mark of dry semen on his underpant and marks of bruises over his left thigh. There was no smegma around the corona glandis and there was a small abrasion over the base of his glans-penis which had a bluish discolouration on it.
 The appellant pleaded that he knew nothing of the crime and that he was falsely implicated in the murder.
 The appellant was convicted and sentenced for offences under sections 376 and 302 I.P.C. by the trial court and the conviction and sentence had been confirmed by the High Court.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD : In a case of circumstantial evidence it is necessary for the Court to find whether the circumstances on which the prosecution relies are established by satisfactory evidence, often described as clear and cogent and whether the circumstances are of such a nature as to exclude every other hypothesis save the one that the appellant is guilty of the offences of which he is charged. In other words, the circumstances have to be of such a nature as to be consistent with the sole hypothesis that the accused is guilty of the crime imputed to him. [390 B-C] It is not necessary that in every case depending on circumstantial evidence, the whole of the law governing cases of circumstantial evidence should be set 385 out in the judgment. Legal principles are not magic incantations. Their importance lies more in their application to a given set of facts than in their recital in the judgment. The simple expectation is that the judgment must show that the finding of guilt if any has been reached after a proper and careful evaluation of circumstances in order to determine whether they are compatible with any other reasonable hypothesis. [395D-E] In the instant case the prosecution story that the appellant was not on good terms with his mother, brothers and wife, that he was living alone in the house and that on the day of occurrence the young school boys who were his tenants were not in the house and that, therefore, he was all alone is proved. That P.W. 5 climbed over the roof of his house, entered the appellant's house and opened the front door is also proved. [390H] But it is impossible to say that the appellant was in the house when P.W. 5 and the three ladies entered the house. None of the four persons made any attempt to elicit any information from the appellant about the presence of the dead body in the bath room though it was alleged that everyone saw him lying on a cot in the court yard. Even if the ladies would not exchange a single word with him, P.W. 5 would have instinctively enquired from him as to how the dead body of the child was lying in the bath room. P.W. 5 categorically stated that he had no talk with the appellant at all. His claim that he called out to the appellant to open the door but that he declined to do so was a clear improvement over what he narrated to the police immediately after the incident. [392A-H] Secondly the girl's father did not inform the police, either when he went to the police station for the first time or when he went there a second time to record the first information report, that the appellant was present in the house when the ladies entered it. In the statement made to the police immediately after the incident all that he stated was that the girl had died a mysterious death. The disclosure made by him to police in his complaint leaves no manner of doubt that the appellant was not present in his house at the time of the recovery of the dead body. In his cross-examination he admitted that his wife did not tell him that it was the appellant who killed their daughter and that the particular portion in the F.I.R. in which it was stated that his wife had told him that their daughter was killed by the appellant was not correctly recorded. [393A-B] Once the crucial link in the chain of circumstances that the appellant was in the house at the time when the dead body was discovered snaps the entire case would have to rest on slender tit bits. [394B] The course of contemporaneous and subsequent events strengthens the inference that the appellant was not in the house when the dead body was discovered. The police inspector who visited the house for making the panchnama of the scene of the offence did not state whether the house was open or locked when he and the punchas entered it. If the appellant's complicity in the crime was suspected, attempts would have been made to arrest him immediately. It is not known as to who arrested him and from where and in what circumstances. All that was stated was that the appellant was produced before him in the course of the day. [393D-F] It is improbable that the appellant would have kept the underpant of the child under his pillow while escaping from the house. The discovery of a blood 386 stain on the appellant's pant and of a dry stain of semen on his underpant are circumstances far too feeble to establish that the appellant raped or murdered the girl. Absence of smegma around the appellant's corona glandis would not necessarily establish that he had a recent intercourse nor do the other circumstances like bruises on the thigh establish his involvement in the crime. If the girl was raped she was raped without resistance. [394E-F] The argument of the prosecution that the total ignorance of the incident pleaded by the appellant is false and would itself furnish a link in the chain of caution is without substance because falsity of defence cannot take the place of proof of facts which the prosecution has to establish in order to succeed. A false plea can at best be considered as an additional circumstance if other circumstances point unfailingly to the guilt of the accused.
 [395A-B] The High Court was in error in saying that what the Court has to consider is whether the cumulative effect of the circumstances establishes the guilt of the accused beyond the "shadow of doubt". "Shadow of doubt" even in cases which depend on direct evidence is shadow of "reasonable' doubt. In its practical application the test which requires the exclusion of other alternative hypotheses is far more rigorous than the test of proof beyond reasonable doubt. Secondly, the High Court's view that such a person as the appellant could not be an asset to his wife and children and for that reason should be awarded the sentence of death is not correct because unfaithful husbands, unchaste wives and unruly children are not for that reason to be sentenced to death if they commit murders unconnected with the state of their equation with their family and friends. The passing of the sentence of death must elicit the greatest concern and solicitude of the Judge because, that is one sentence which cannot be recalled.
