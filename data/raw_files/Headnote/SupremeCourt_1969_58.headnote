 The members of a Hindu undivided family governed by the Marumakkattayam law, while remaining joint, had entered into an agreement for separate 'enjoyment of certain properties of the family by different members as permitted by their customary law. For the assessment year 1958-59 its karta, in the status of a Hindu undivided family, filed a return under the Expenditure-tax Act, 1957, of the expenditure incurred by him in respect of the property under his 'personal control and direct enjoyment'. The Expenditure- tax Officer added the expenditure incurred by the other members of the family in respect of properties set apart for their use and enjoyment as the expenditure of the Hindu undivided family under s. 3(1).
 On the question, whether s. 3 is violative of Art. 14 because, a Hindu undivided family governed by the Marumakkattayam law as to pay the tax at a higher rate by reason of the unit of taxation under the section being the Hindu undivided family there is an amalgamation of the ex- penditure of all the members of the family, whereas, a Mappilla family may pay tax at a lower rate since the members of a Mappilla undivided family governed by the Marumakkattayam law are liable to be taxed as 'individuals' under the section, 
HELD:The equal protection clause of the Constitution allows a large play to legislative discretion in the matter of classification. The power to classify may be exercised so as to adjust the system of taxation in all proper and reasonable ways : the Legislature may select persons, properties, transactions and objects, and apply' different methods and even rates of tax, if the Legislature does so reasonably and if the classification is rational. A taxing statute may contravene Art. 14 if it seeks to impose on the same class of property, persons, transactions or occupations similarly situate, an incidence of taxation which leads to obvious inequality, but, a taxing statute is not exposed to attack on the ground of discrimination merely because different rates of taxation are prescribed for different categories of persons, transactions, occupations or objects.
 The courts will not strike down an Act as denying the equal protection of laws Merely because other objects could have been, but are not, taxed by the Legislature. [832 H; 833 A- F] Though the law applicable to Hindu undivided families governed by the Marumakkattayam law and to the Mappilla tarwad in North Malabar has the same characteristics in two respects, namely, (a) tracing descent through females; and (b) community of interest and unity of possession in respect of the family property, the laws applicable to them in other respects differ widely. Initially a common system of law relating to family property of the tarwad was applicable to Hindus and Mappillas governed 828 by the Marumakkattayam law, but since the enactment of the Madras Marumakkattayam Act (22 of 1933) and other enactments governing Hindus, and the Mappilla Marumakkattayam Act (17 of 1939) governing the Mappillas, there are few points of similarity in property matters in the tarwads. The application of the Islamic laws of marriage and inheritance to the Mappillas has led to greater cleavage. The community of Mappillas governed by Marumakkattayam law is a small community, restricted only to the Northern area of Malabar district and is dwindling because of the impact of the Muslim law of inheritance applicable to sham obtained on partition. Parliament has been accustomed to treating a Hindu undivided family as a unit of taxation and to enacting tax laws making a distinction between a Hindu undivided family consisting of Hindus and undivided families of Mappillas. The long course of legislative history in matters of taxing income, wealth, gifts, capital gains'and business profits indicates that the Legislature regarded undivided Hindu families as a class to which the legislation may appropriately be applied. Even though the basic scheme of a Hindu undivided family governed by the Mitakshara law is different from that of a family governed by the Marumakkattayam law, a Hindu undivided family governed by the Marumakkattayam law fails within he expression 'Hindu undivided family. Therefore, Parliament, by making the Act applicable to Hindu families and not to Mappilla families governed by the Marumakkattayam law, has not attempted any obvious inequality or made any discrimination violative of Art. 14.
