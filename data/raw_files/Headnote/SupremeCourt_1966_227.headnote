 The assessee-companies, carried on business in Madurai and each had a branch at Pudukottai, a former native State.
 They hold majority share in a Bank which, too, had its head office at Madurai and branch at Pudukottai. T, who was a shareholder of the Bank, was the moving figure in the assessee-companies. The assessees borrowed moneys from the Madurai head office of the Bank on the security of fixed deposits made by the assessees' branches with the Pudukottai branch of the Bank. The loans were far in excess of the available profits at Pudukottai. The Income-tax Officer held that the borrowings in British India on the security of the fixed deposits made at Pudukottai amounted to constructive remittance of the profits by the branches of the assessee-companies to their Head Office in India within the meaning of s. 4 of the Income-tax Act, and this view the Appellate Assistant Commissioner upheld. The assessees appealed to the Trbunal which took note that the branch whether of the assessee of the Bank constituted only one unit, and the establishment of the branch of the Bank at Pudukottai was intended to help the financial operations of T in the concerns in which he was interested., and the Pudukottai branch of the Bank had transmitted funds deposited by the assessees for enabling the Madurai branch to advance loans at interest to the assessees and the transmission of the funds was made with the knowledge of assessees. The Tribunal held that the assessees were rightly assessed. In reference the High Court answered the question in favour of the assessees holding it was not established that there was any arrangement between the assessees and the Bank whether at Pudukottai or at Madurai for transference of moneys from Pudukottai branch to Madurai and the facts on record did not establish that there was any transfer of funds between Pudukottai and Madurai for the purpose of advancing moneys to the assessees, and the transactions represented ordinary banking transactions and there was nothing to show that the amounts placed in fixed deposits in the branch were intended to and were in fact transferred to head office for the purpose of lending them out to the depositor himself. In appeals by the Commis- sioner, this Court, 
HELD: The appeals must be allowed The High Court erred in law in interfering with the findings of the appellate Tribunal. In a reference the High Court must accept the findings of fact reached by the appellate Tribunal and it is for the party who applied for a reference to challenge those findings of fact first by an application under s. 66(1). If the party failed to file an application, under s. 66(1) expressly raising the question about the validity of the findings of fact, he is not entitled to urge before the High Court that the findings are vitiated for any reason. [938 H-939 B] India Cements Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras, 60, I.T.R. 52, relied on.
 935 In the context of the facts as found by the Tribunal, the entire transactions formed part of a basic arrangement or scheme between the creditor and the debtor that the money should be brought into British India after it was taken by the borrower outside the taxable territory. [940 B-C] Section 42 requires, in the first place, that money should have been lent at interest outside the taxable territory, in the second place, income, profits or gains should accrue or arise directly or indirectly from such money so lent at interest, and in the third place, that the money should be brought into the taxable territories in cash or in kind. If all these conditions are fulfilled, then the section lays down that the interest shall be deemed to be interest accruing or arising within the taxable territories. [939 D] The provision in s. 42(1), which brings within the scope of the charging section interest earned out of money lent outside, but brought into British India, was not ultra vires the Indian Legislature on the ground that it was extra- territorial in operation. [939 F] The section contemplates the bringing of money into British India with the knowledge of the lender and borrower and this gives rise to a real territorial connection. This knowledge must be an integral part of the transaction. [940 A] A. H. Wadia v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay 17 I.T.R. 63, approved.
 In certain exceptional cases the Court is entitled to lift the veil of corporate entity and pay regard to the economic realities behind the legal facade. For example, the Court has power to disregard the corporate entity if it is used for tax evasion or to circumvent tax obligation. [941 E] Devid Payne & Co. Ltd. in re, Young v.
