 In the course of conciliation proceedings under the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, a settlement was arrived at on June 29, 1973 between the management of the Security Paper Mill, Hoshangabad, the appellant and the SPM Employees Union, Hoshangabad. One of the terms of the settlement related to the incentive benefit entered into on behalf of the workmen and other non- operative officers and staff of the Security Paper Mill at Hoshangabad. When the above Settlement was in force the Government of India by its letter dated December 29, 1975 reduced the rate of group incentive benefit payable by restricting the entitlements of the non-operative officers and staff with effect from 1.1.76 to 25% of the rate applicable to industrial workmen for gazetted officers and to 50% in respect of non-gazetted industrial staff. When the said order was challenged, the Central Government Industrial Tribunal-cum-Labour Court held that the modification of the incentive benefit made by the Government of India was illegal. After that the management entered into an agreement with one of the trade unions named SPM Employees Union on April 11, 1979 reducing the rate of incentive benefit to 50% to the non-operative employees that is administrative staff, accounts staff, and paid the benefit accordingly. The said agreement was not entered into during the course of any 282 conciliation proceedings and in fact there were no conciliation proceedings pending at the time when the agreement was entered into. The respondents who belonged to the non-operative staff and who were not the members of the Union and parties to the agreement challenged the validity of the agreement before the Authority under the Payment of Wages Act on the basis of the Settlement of the year 1973.
 While allowing the claim for Rs. 1,93,357.85 and cost at the rate of Rs. 10 per worker, it did not, however, allow any compensation. In appeal, the Industrial Court affirmed the decision of the authority under the Payment of Wages Act but disallowed the costs at the rate of Rs. 10 per worker. Hence the appeal by special leave by the management alone.
 Dismissing the appeal, the Court, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The expression "settlement" defined in section 2(p) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 means a settlement arrived at in the course of conciliation proceeding and also includes a written agreement between employer and workmen arrived at otherwise than in conciliation proceeding where such agreement has been signed by the parties thereto in such manner as may be prescribed and a copy thereof has been sent to an officer authorised in this behalf by the appropriate Government and the Conciliation Officer. [286 G- H; 287 A] A distinction is made in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 between a settlement arrived at in the course of conciliation proceeding and a settlement arrived at by agreement between the employer and workman otherwise than in conciliation proceeding both as regards the procedure to be followed in the cases and as regards the persons on whom they are binding. If a settlement of the dispute or of any of the matters in dispute is arrived at in the course of the conciliation proceeding the Conciliation Officer shall send a report thereof to the appropriate Government or an officer authorised in that behalf by the appropriate Government together with a Memorandum of Settlement signed by the parties. Even though a Conciliation Officer is not competent to adjudicate upon the disputes between the management and its workmen he is expected to assist them to arrive at a fair and just settlement. He has to play the role of an adviser and friend of both the parties and should see that neither party takes undue 283 advantage of the situation. Any settlement arrived at should be a just and fair one. It is on account of this special feature of the settlement sub-section 3 of section 18 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 provides that a settlement arrived at in the course of conciliation proceedings under that Act shall be binding on (i) all parties to the industrial dispute, (ii) where a party referred to in clause (i) is an employer, his heirs, successors, or assigns in respect of the establishment to which the dispute relates and (iii) where a party referred to in clause (i) is comprised of workmen, all persons who were employed in the establishment of part. Law thus attaches importance and sanctity to a settlement arrived at in the course of a conciliation proceeding since it carries a presumption that it is just and fair and makes it binding on all the parties as well as the other workmen in the establishment or the part of it to which it relates. But in the case of a settlement not arrived at in the course of the conciliation proceedings it has to be in writing and signed by the parties in the prescribed manner and a copy thereof should be sent to the officer authorised by the appropriate government in this behalf and to the Conciliation Officer.
 Such a settlement arrived at by agreement between the employer and workmen otherwise than in the course of conciliation proceedings is binding only on the parties to the agreement as provided in section 18(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. Such a settlement is not binding on the other workmen who are not parties to the settlement. [287 A- H; 288 A-D] In the instant case, the agreement entered into on April 11, 1979 between the Management and SPM Employees Union is not binding on the respondents and therefore, cannot have the effect of depriving them of their right under the settlement dated June 29, 1983 as long as it is in operation since, (a) it is not shown that the SPM Employees Union which had entered into an agreement could represent the respondents and that the respondents were parties to it;
 (b) no plea of termination or bringing to an end in some manner known to law of the earlier agreement under section 19(2) was taken by the management; and (c) apart from the bare assertion that the agreement dated April 11, 1979 reducing the incentive benefit was fair and just and therefore it should not be interferred with, no material was placed by the management before the Authority under the Payment of Wages Act or the Industrial Court to show that the said agreement was fair and just.
