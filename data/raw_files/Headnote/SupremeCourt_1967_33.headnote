 The first respondent joined the service of the State Government in 1938. In 1961 the Govermment held an enquiry into her date of birth. She was then asked to show cause why a certain date should not be taken as her date of birth.
 The report of the enquiry officer was not disclosed, and the first respondent was not given an opportunity to meet the evidence used against her. The Government refixed the date of birth of the first respondent and ordered that she be compulsorily retired. The first respondent then filed a writ petition in the High Court which was allowed.
 The State appealed It was contended on behalf of the appellant State that (i) the High Court in dealing with a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution ought not to have proceeded to determine disputed questions of fact, (ii) & order refixing the date of birth of the respondent was an administrative order and the High Court had no power to sit in appeal over the decision of the State authorities.
 
HELD : (i) Under Art. 226 of the Constitution the High Court is not precluded from entering upon a decision on questions of fact raised by the petition. Where an enquiry into complicated questions of fact arises in a petition, the High curt may in appropriate cases decline to enter upon the enquiry and may refer the party claiming relief to a suit.
 But the question is one of discretion and not of the jurisdiction of the Court. No interference with the exercise of the discretion of the High Court in the present case was called for. [627 G] (ii)Even an administrative order which involves civil consequences must be made consistently with the rules of natural justice. The person concerned must be informed of the case of the State and the evidence in support thereof and must be given a fair opportunity to meet the case before an adverse decision is taken. In the present case no such steps were admittedly taken; the High Court was therefore right in setting aside the order of the State. [630 G]
