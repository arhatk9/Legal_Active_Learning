 The assessee was a spinning mill. It opened a fair price shop to provide an amenity to its workmen so that commodities may be made available to them at fair prices.
 For the assessment year 1960-61 the assessing authority under the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1959, included in the assessee's turnover the sale value of groceries sold in the fair price shop. The Tribunal held in favour of the assessee and the High Court, on reference, found that the assessee was not carrying on 'business' within the meaning of the Act in the fair price shop and confirmed the orders.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended that the Second Amendment Act. 1964, substituted a new definition of 'business' in the Act, which, read with s. 9 of the Act, had retrospective effect.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : Validation of tax which has been declared to be illegal may be done only if the ground of illegality or invalidity are capable of being removed and are in fact removed. The Legislature can give its own meaning and interpretation of law under which the tax was collected and by legislative flat make the new meaning binding upon the courts. [399 C-D] But in the present case, none of the methods for validating a tax has been adopted. Although the definition of 'business' was amended it was not made retrospective by the usual words that it should be deemed to have been always substituted nor was any other language employed to show that the substantive provision was being amended retrospectively.
 On the contrary, the definition of the word 'business' was amended only prospectively. In the absence of retrospective effect being given to the definition, s. 9 was of no avail to the Revenue. [399 E-G] State of Tamil Nadu v. M. Rayappa Gounder, A.I.R. 1971 S.C.
