 The petitioner was detained under s. 3 of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971. 'The grounds communicated to him were, (1) that on 28-1-1973 at about 4.30 p.m., he. as a direct purchasing agent of the Food Corporation of India sold out 4 quintals of paddy from the stock held in the account of the Food Corporation of India to three persons and by such clandestine deal hindered the procurement of paddy and thereby acted in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community; and (2) that on the same day at about 10.30 p.m.
 a stock of about 12 quintals of paddy was found in his godown and that he failed to justify the possession and that by such surreptitious business as a direct purchasing agent he impeded the progress of procurement of 'paddy and thereby acted in a manner resupplies and services essential to the community.
 In a petition under Art. 32, challenging the detention, 
HELD : (1) There was clear violation of Art. 22(5) as no adequate opportunity had been afforded to the petitioner to make a proper representation, because, the grounds are vague and uncertain and it is not reasonably possible for the detenu to make an effective representation against the order of detention. [22F-G] With reference to the first ground it is not clear whether the three persons mentioned in the ground were authorised purchasers or not. The ground described the transaction as a clandestine deal, but it is not shown how the transaction can be so described without any particulars to justify such an observation. Similarly, no definite particulars are disclosed even to prima facie justify the observation that the finding of paddy in his possession was surreptitious business. [23C-E] (2) The petitioner submitted a long representation to the Government. But it could not be said that on that account that he fully understood the import of the allegations mentioned in the grounds. The validity of the impugned order cannot be decided in the light of the representation made by the petitioner. He might have given the representation because an F.I.R. was filed against him for prosecuting him under s. 7 of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, referring to the second ground of detention and he might have come to know the details in the course of the prosecution. In a case of preventive detention it is absolutely necessary to communicate the grounds of detention to the detenu in clear and ambiguous terms giving such particulars as will facilitate making of an effective representation that the order is unfounded. It is exceedingly important, in the interest of liberty of the citizen that the minimum requirements of law are strictly comPlied with and the detaining authority applies its mind in a proper manner at the time of passing the order.
 [22G.23C, F] (3) The order of the High Court dismissing the petition of the petitioner under s. 491, Criminal Procedure Code, 1898, would not operate at res Judicata in an application before this Court under Art. 32.. [23G]
