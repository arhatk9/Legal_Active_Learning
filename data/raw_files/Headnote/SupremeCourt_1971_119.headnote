 An application for the reduction of the decretal amount of a decree passed under the U.P. Encumbered Estates Act, 1934, filed by the respondents under s. 4 of the U.P. Zamindars' Debt Reduction Act, 1953, was rejected by the Special Judge acting under 1953-Act, on the ground that unless and until the decree charged the mortgaged property no reduction of debt could be ordered under the 1953-Act. The appeal to the High Court was dismissed. The 1953-Act was amended by the U.P. Zamindars' Debt Reduction (Amendment) Act, 1962, by deleting the words 'charged under the decree' from the section. Thereafter, the judgment debtor filed an application for review in the High Court, and the High Court set aside the order of the Special Judge, and remanded the matter.
 On the questions: (1) whether the section as amended could be invoked by the respondents, and (2)-whether the High Court could grant the application, 
HELD: (1) The Amendment Act provided that the amendment took effect as if the amendment had been in force on all material dates, that is, the words 'charged under the decree' in s. 4(2) of 1953-Act were never there. The consequence is that the only statutory requirement is whether the mortgaged property consists of an estate which has been acquired under the provisions of the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950. In the present case, the decree related to a secured debt and the mortgaged property consisted of an estate which had been acquired under the provisions of Abolition Act, and therefore, the section could be invoked.

 (2) It was not a case where, when the High Court decided the matter, it applied the law as it stood and there was a subsequent change of law, which would not be a ground for review. [438E-F] (a) The law in s. 4 of the 1953-Act as amended was not a subsequent law, but a law which was there from the inception of the Act. The deeming provision makes it fully effective from the date when the 1953-Act came into force. The result is that the High Court in the first instance should have applied the law as it always stood and not having done so it would be an error on the face of the record. [438F-H] (b) Moreover, s. 4 of the 1953-Act confers power on the Court to apply the law notwithstanding any provision contained in the Civil Procedure Code. It is a special legislation conferring rights and reliefs within 28-1 S.C. India/71 434 a specially created jurisdiction and, it is the substance and not the form that would be decisive, in such a case.
 [439 C-D] (c) The Special Judge could not have ordered the application after it was affirmed by the High Court in the first instance, and therefore, the respondents rightly applied to the High Court. [438H; 439A] Rajah Kotagir Venkata Subbamma Rao v. Rajah Vellanki, 27 I.A. 197, referred to.
