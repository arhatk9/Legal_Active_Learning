 The appellant State Government gave on a contract to a contractor the work of construction of a building. The contractor in turn gave that work on sub-contract to a firm K & Co. and the respondent, was looking after the construction work on behalf of the firm. Upon an application made to the Deputy Engineer, Ahmedabad, the contractor was allotted 100 bags of cement for construction work. This cement was sold by the Government to the contractor and delivered to the respondent for and on behalf of the contractor. After taking delivery of the cement, the respondent delivered only part Of it to the construction site and the balance was diverted and stocked on account of K & Co. On these facts and the appellant's complaint, the respondent was prosecuted for breach of trust under s. 409 of the Indian Penal Code. The respondent's case was that in anticipation of allotment of cement to the contractor, K & Co. had utilized some of their own cement and therefore the cement liveries to them was on account of a quantity already used by them for, the contractor. The Trial Court disbelieved this version and convicted the respondent. The High Court, however, allowed an appeal and acquitted the respondent.
 On appeal to this Court 
HELD : Dismissing the appeal : The prosecution had failed to prove contrustment to the respondent.
 The expression "entrustment" carries with it the implication that the person handing over any property or on whose behalf that property is handed over to another, continues to be its owner. Further the person handing over the property must have confidence in the person taking the property so is to create a fiduciary relationship between them. A mere transaction of sale cannot amount to an entrustment. [41 1 B-c] Although the Government had sold the cement in question to the contractor solely for the purpose of being used in connection with the construction work, that circumstance did not make the transaction in question anything other than a sale. After the delivery of the cement, the Government had neither any right nor dominion over it. If the purchaser or its representative had failed to comply with the requirements of law relating to the cement control, he should have been prosecuted for the same. It could not be held that there was any breach of trust. [411 C-D] Velji Raghvaji Patel v. State of Maharashtra, [1965] 2 SC.R.
