 The appellants were tried for murder and causing grievous hurt. They were acquitted by the Trial Court. The High Court however, relying on two of the witnesses produced by the prosecution, convicted them. In appeal by special leave to this Court it was contended that in reversing the verdict of acquittal the High Court had acted outside its jurisdiction under S. 41.7 Criminal Procedure Code and had not observed the principles laid down by this Court.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : It is well settled that the High Court in appeal under s. 417 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has full power to review at large the evidence upon which the order of acquittal was founded and to reach the conclusion that upon the evidence the order of acquittal should be reversed.
 No limitation should be placed on that power unless it be found expressly stated in the Code, but in exercising the power conferred by the Code and before reaching its conclusion upon fact the High Court should give proper weight and consideration to such matters as (1) the views of the trial judge as to the credibility of the witnesses; (2) the presumption of innocence in favour of the Accused, a presumption certainly not weakened by the fact that he has been acquitted at his trial; (3) the right of the accused to the benefit of any doubt, and (4) the slowness of an appellate court in disturbing a finding of fact arrived at by a judge who had the advantage of seeing the witness.
