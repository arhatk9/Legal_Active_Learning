 Two accused were charged with an offence under s. 302 read with s. 34 I.P.C. The victim had four lathi injuries on his head-two fatal and two simple. One of the accused was acquitted. On the question whether the other could be convicted for an offence under s. 302 simpliciter without establishing that he had caused at least one of the major injuries, 
HELD : As a result of the acquittal of one of the two accused, the common intention was not proved. In such a case it could not be postulated that the other accused alone caused all the four injuries and the prosecution must establish the exact nature of the injury caused by him In the absence of such evidence, he must be given the benefit of doubt with respect to the offence under s. 302, but may be convicted for the offence of causing grevious hurt under s. 325 [453 H; 454 A-D, C]
