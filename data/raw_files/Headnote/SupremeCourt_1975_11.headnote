 The validity of the equation of posts of graduate teachers allotted to the new State of Mysore constituted under the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, was challenged. The new State of Mysore was formed comprising the territories of th- e existing States of Mysore, Coorg, and parts of existing States of Hyderabad, Madras and Bombay. The graduate teachers in each of the 5 integrating areas were divided into two grades a lower grade and a higher grade as given below :
 ------------------------------------------------------------ integrating area Lower Grade Higher Grade ------------------------------------------------------------- Mysore Rs.60-150 Rs. 130-200 Coorg Rs.80-220 Rs. 100-300 Bombay Rs.70-200 Rs. 210-300 Madras Rs.85-175 Rs. 165-245 Hyderabad Rs.130-190 Rs. 154-275 ------------------------------------------------------------- On the constitution of the various new States the question of equation of.' posts, absorption of service personnel in the equated posts and the determination of inter se seniority cropped UP. A meeting of the Chief Secretaries of these States was held at Delhi in May, 1956, at the invitation of the Central Government. The following decisions were taken at that meeting :
 "It was agreed that in determining the equation of posts, the following factors should be borne in mind :- (i) the nature and duties of a post;
 (ii) the responsibilities and powers exercised by the officer holding a post; the extent of territorial or other charge held or responsibilities discharged (iii) the minimum qualifications. if any, prescribed for recruitment to the post;
 (iv) the salary of the post.
 It was agreed that in determining relative seniority as between two persons holding posts declared equivalent to each other, and drawn from different, States the following points should be taken into account :- (i) length of continuous service, whether temporary or permanent, in a particular grade;
 this should exclude periods for Chemical an appointment is held in a purely stop-gap or fortuitous arrangement 307 (ii) age of the person; other factors being equal for instance, seniority may be determined on the basis of age.
 It was also agreed that as far as possible, the inter se seniority of officers drawn from the same State should not be disturbed.
 In February, 1958, the provisional inter-State list of teachers in the graduate tutorial cadre for new Mysore State was prepared. This list was prepared on the basis that the posts of ex-Hyderabad teachers in the grade of Rs. 154-275 were equated with those of ex-Mysore teachers in the grade of Rs. 130-200, while the posts of ex-Coorg teachers in the grade of Rs. 100-300 were equated with those of ex-Mysore teachers in the grade of Rs. 60-150. The Coorg teachers irk the grade of Rs. 100-300 were dissatisfied with the equation of their posts with those of ex-Mysore teachers in the grade of Rs. 60-150. They, therefore, filed a Writ Petition in the High Court of Mysore.
 One of the contentions of the petitioners was upheld by the High Court in the year 1964 and the State Government was directed to prepare a provisional inter-State seniority list of teacher's in the graduate tutorial cadre. Pursuant to seniority list in July, 1964. Thereafter a final inter- State, seniority list of teachers in the graduate tutorial cadre was prepared in December, 1966, which was different from provisional list prepared in 1964. In the final seniority list the equation of posts was different from the one proposed in the provisional inter-State seniority list.
 The ex-Hyderabad and Coorg teachers filed a petition in the High Court of Mysore for quashing 'and setting aside the equation of posts on which the final inter-State seniority was based. The High Court by its judgment delivered in 1969 allowed the writ petition on the ground that the seniority list was prepared without giving any opportunity to ex- Hyderabad teachers, and that vitiated the equation of posts.
 After considering the representations filed by all the teachers concerned a provisional inter-State seniority list was published in November, 1969. Though the claim of the ex-Hyderabad teachers was not accepted in to, they were satisfied with the decision of the Central Government contained in the provisional list published in 1970. The ex-Coorg teachers were dissatisfied and, therefore, they made representations complaining against the decision of the Central Government. In December, 1971, the final Inter- State seniority list was published. The final list varied the equation to the disadvantage of the ex-Hyderabad teachers as compared to the provisional list. The ex- Hyderabad teachers and ex-Coorg teachers therefore, filed the present petition in this Court.
 It was contended before this Court by the ex-Hyderabad teachers (1) Equation of posts in the final list different from the provisional list made by the Central Government was without giving any opportunity to the Hyderabad teachers to make a proper representation and was in violation of the principles of natural justice.
 (2) The Central Government failed to take into account the 4 factors decided upon at the Chief Secretaries Conference.
 (3) The equation of posts made by the Central Government was based on erroneous assumptions and irrelevant considerations and disclosed non-application of mind to the material and relevant facts.
 
HELD : The Power to determine equation of posts belongs to the Central Government under section 115(5) of the States Reorganisation Act and this power must be exercised by the Central Government after giving an opportunity to the allocated Government servant to make representations in regard to this matter. The Central Government is bound to have regard to the 4 factors decided upon at the Conference of the Chief Secretaries held in May, 1956 in determining equation of Posts.,-It is not open to the court to consider whether the equation of posts made by the Central Government is right or wrong if those 4 factors have been properly taken into account. What the court can scrutinise is only whether the 4 factors agreed upon at the Chief Secretaries Conference have been properly taken into account. If the court finds that one 308 ,or more of these 4 factors have been ignored the court can strike down the equation of posts made by the Central Government. The Court can also interfere if it finds that the decision of the Central Government in regard to the equation of posts is mafafide or without application of mind. The Court may also intervene if it comes to the conclusion that the decision of the Central Government is based on irrelevant considerations or wrong assumptions or that it is so irrational or perverse that no reasonable person properly instructed and taking into account relevant factors could possibly arrive at it. [316H-317E] 
HELD FURTHER : The ex-Hyderabad teachers, did make representation after the judgment of the High Court delivered in 1969 and the Government took those representations into consideration before making the final list. It is not possible to say that the decision was taken by the Central Government without giving an opportunity to the ex-Hyderabad teachers to make a proper representation or that there was any violation of the principles of natural justice. [319D-G] 
HELD FURTHER :-The final seniority list does not give the reasons which weighed with the Central Government in making the equation of posts. However, in the counter-affidavit filed in this Court on behalf of the Government reasons have been disclosed why the equation of posts was done in the manner given in the final list. The Central Government in determining equation of posts omitted to take into account the relevant considerations and failed to apply the criteria of the first and second factors decided at the Chief Secretaries meeting. The Central Govt. did not compare the post of ex-Hyderabad teachers in the grade of Rs. 154-275 and the ex-Bombay, ex-Madras and ex-Mysore teachers in the higher grades on the basis of the criteria of the first and second factors. The Central Government also ignored altogether the fourth factor, namely. the salary of the post. The equation had to be done by reference to the four criteria laid down in the Conference of the Chief Secretaries. It was immaterial whether the grades which were sought to be equated were initial recruitment grades or promotional grades. There was no requirement either of law or of principle that one initial recruitment grade could be equated only with another initial recruitment grade or that one promotional grade could be equated with only another promotional grade. Even factually the Central Government was not right in saying that the ex-Hyderabad grade of Rs.
 154-275 was not a promotional grade but an initial recruitment grade for trained graduates. [319H320B; 321H;
 323F-G; 324 E-G; 326C-G] 
HELD FURTHER: The Central Government failed to take into account an important and relevant consideration, namely, that of the qualifications required for recruitment to the posts sought to be equated. At any given point of time, there was always a large number of untrained graduates the ex-Mysore grade of Rs. 60-150 whereas in ex-Hyderabad all teachers in the grade of Rs. 150-275 were trained graduates.
 [329 E-F] 
HELD FURTHER: The equation of posts made by the Central Government is illegal and invalid in so far as it relates to the posts of ex-Hyderabad teachers in the grade of Rs. 154- 275. The final seniority list is also set aside to the extent it relates to the posts of ex-Hyderabad teachers in the grade of Rs. 154-275 and the Central Government is directed to make fresh equation of posts after taking into account all relevant facts having material bearing on the question and in the light of the observations contained in the judgment. [329H-330E] 
HELD FURTHER. The case of ex-Coorg teachers stands on the same footing as that of ex-Hyderabad teachers in some material respects. The Central Government failed to take into account the four criteria laid down in the Chief Secre- taries Conference. The Central Government also proceeded on an erroneous basis. These infirmities vitiated the equation of posts. The equation of posts of ex-Coorg teachers in the grade of Rs. 100-300 are therefore quashed and set aside the Central Government is directed to make fresh equation of posts and after taking into account all relevant facts having material bearing on the question and n the light of the observations contained in the judgment.
