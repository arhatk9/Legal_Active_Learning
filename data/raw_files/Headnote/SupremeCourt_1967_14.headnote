 The police investigated into a complaint against the appellant and others, accepted the appellant's plea of alibi and filed a charge sheet against the others for offences, under ss. 302, 201 and 149 I.P.C., before the Sub-Divisional Magistrate. The Magistrate recorded that the appellant was discharged -and transferred the case for enquiry to another Magistrate, who, after examining two witnesses, ordered the issue of a non-bailable warrant against the appellant, for proceeding against him along with the other accused under s.
 207-A Cr. P.C. The order was confirmed by the Sessions Court and High Court.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD:(1) There could be no discharge of the appellant when he was not included as an accused in the charge-sheet submitted by the police. [426 C] (2)The appellant could be proceeded against along with the other accused under S. 207-A Cr.P.C. [426 B] The Sub-divisional Magistrate had taken cognizance of the offence upon the written report of the police, that is, under s. 190(1)(b), Cr. P.C Therefore, the proceeding was instituted under s. 207(a) and not under s. 207(b) Cr.P.C.
 The cognizance, however, was of the offence only and not of the offenders. Having taken cognizance of the offence, he had to find out who the real offenders were, and if he came to the conclusion that apart from the persons sent up by the police some other persons were involved. It was his duty to proceed against those persons also. The summoning of the appellant as an additional accused was part of the proceeding initiated by his taking cognizance of the offence. [427 B-C, 4Z8 C-D] Pravin Chandra Mody v. State of A.P. [1964] INSC 275; [1965] 1 S.C.R. 269, followed.
