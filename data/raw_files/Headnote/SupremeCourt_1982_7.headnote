 Molasses, the basic raw-material for the manufacture of lingo-sulphite, basic refractories, steel plants, cement factories, carbon black plants and many other important industries and also used for distillation, has become a valuable commodity on account of its multi-use. The preservation, distribution and prices of the molasses were, therefore, controlled by the Uttar Pradesh Sheera Niyantran Adhiniyam, 1964 (U.P. Act 24 of 1964) and also the rules made thereunder called Uttar Pradesh Sheera Niyantran Niyamavali, 1974. Section 8 of tho Act authorised the Controller to direct the occupier of any sugar factory to sell and supply in tho prescribed manner such quantity of molasses to such persons as may be specified in the order and the occupier shall notwithstanding any contract comply with the order. Section 10 provided that the occupier of a sugar factory shall sell molasses in respect of which an order under section 8 has been made at a price not exceeding that prescribed in the schedule attached to section 10.
 United Commercial Syndicate, Allahabad is the purchasing agent of M/s. Lingo Sulphite Corporation and M/s.
 Audubon Trading and Export Corporation of Allahabad and Calcutta, entered into an agreement with the U.P. State Sugar Corporation Ltd. whereunder the latter agreed to sell 28,300 quintals of molasses of 1977-78 production at the statutory price of Rs. 9 per quintal and duties etc.
 provided the former agreed to pay the total amount of Rs. 3 lacs being the total cost of molasses as estimated at the said statutory price. It was further stipulated that in case the said price was not valid in law, The United Commercial Syndicate will have to pay the price at the rate of Rs. 25- 10 por quintal inclusive of administrative charges and other taxes and duties etc. as agreed to by the Syndicate. A sum of Rs. 2 lacs had been paid in pursuance of the agreement and the balance of Rs: I lac was to be paid at the earliest.
 The Sugar Corporation however sought to calculate the price of the molasses in question at the rate of Rs. 25-10 per quintal on the ground that the molasses agreed upon was not covered by an order under section 8. Syndicate filed two petitions in the High Court of Allahabad for a writ of mandamus or any other 67 appropriate writ or direction declaring that Corporation was not entitled to charge the price for tho molasses in excess of the price fixed by the Act, namely, Rs. 9 per quintal.
 Tho High Court by its order dated 21st October, 1979 dismissed the petitions in limine. Hence the appeal by special leave by the Syndicate and the writ petition by tho principal M/s. Lingo Sulphite Corporation.
 Dismissing tho appeal and tho writ petition, tho Court, ^ 
 HELD: 1. Sections 3 to 8 and 10 of tho Adhiniyam and Niyamavali 12,13, 22, 23 and 24 make it clear that the occupier of a sugar factory can sell molasses to a person specified in the order of the Controller at the controlled price. The occupier of every sugar factory has to give an estimate of the molasses to be produced in tho sugar factory as also the estimate of requirement of molasses for distillation and industrial purposes. If there is any surplus after meeting the requirements of the persons in whose favour there is an order of the Controller, the same will be released in favour of tho occupier. [71 H, 72 A-B] 
 2. Section 10 makes it clear that the occupier of a sugar factory is obliged to sell molasses at the price not exceeding that prescribed in the schedule only in respect of which an order under section 8 has been made. But sub-clause (2) of rule 22 authorises the Controller to release any stock of molasses in favour of an occupier of a sugar factory only when the same is not required for distilleries or for other purposes of industrial development. If a certain quantity of molasses has been released in favour of tho occupier, because the same was not required for distilleries or for other purposes of industrial development, it is open to the occupier to sell that quantity of molasses in free market to any person at a price prevalent in tho market. Section 10 of tho Act requires an occupier of a sugar factory to sell molasses at a price not exceeding that prescribed in the schedule only in respect of which an order under section 8 has been made. No limitation or fetter has been put on the occupier of a sugar factory to sell molasses which was released in his favour. It was, therefore, open to the occupier to sell the molasses released in his favour at the free market price. [73 B-E] 
 3. The classification made with regard to molasses covered under rule 22(1) or rule 22(2) is a reasonable classification. [73 B-E] 
 4. The Syndicate entered into an agreement with the Corporation and agreed to pay the price of the molasses at the rate of Rs. 25-10 per quintal. Having entered into such an agreement with its eyes wide open it cannot now turn turtle and contend that it was liable to pay only at the rate of Rs. 9 per quintal. tho statutory price. [73 P-G] 
 5. It is true that the parties cannot be allowed to contract themselves out of law. It is not the law that no molasses released in favour of the occupier of the sugar factory could be sold at a price higher than the controlled one. The controlled price was applicable only to the molasses for which an order had been passed by the Controller in favour of a specified person either for the purpose of distillation or for other industrial purposes.
 But so far as the molasses released i n favour of the occupier of a sugar factory is concerned, there is no requirement of the law that the occupier should sell it only at the controlled price [73 G-H, 74 A-B] 68 
 6. The terms of the agreement between the parties entitles the Corporation for administrative charges. [74 B- C]
