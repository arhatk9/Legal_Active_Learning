 On the death of her husband, certain cultivatory lands devolved on a Hindu widow. She became a bhumidhar on the enactment of the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act of 1951. Thereafter she gifted the lands to respondents 1 and 2. On her death, the appellants. who were reversioners to her husband's estate filed a suit claiming that the widow had only a life-estate in the bhumidhari lands, and therefore. the gift which was to enure beyond her life time was incompetent. The suit was dismissed. Dismissing the appeal, this Court, 
HELD : There is nothing in the Act which indicates that when a female who inherits the rights of a bhumidhar, under s.
 171 or s. 172 or a. 172A, any residuary interest remains vested in any other person. Under the Act she is the owner of the property : the entire estate is vested in her.
 Absence of testamentary power in a female bhumidhar qua her holding is reconcilable with devolution upon the heirs of the female bhumidhar, and an absolute title during her life time. That is clearly illustrated by the nature of the interest which the heirs of the classes referred to in 9.
 172(2)(a) (ii) hold. [774 H, 776 B]
