 The Wage Board constituted by the Central Government in 1963 under s. 9 of the Working Journalists (,Condition of service) and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 45 of 1955 defined "calligraphist" as- an "artist who performs. journalistic work and. also calligraphs matters." Artist", according tar the Wage Board "is a person who prepares for publication ,drawing, layouts, maps graphs or other similar embellishment, illustrations of any kind or r-realive art.
 He may do some or all of these functions' " Calligraphists were included among working journalists by the Wage Board.
 -The respondents who were Katibs in the employment of the appellant claimed' that they were "calligraphists" and therefore working journalists and as such entitled to the wages recommended by the Wage Board. The industrial dispute in, this connection was decided by the Labour Court in favour of the respondents. The decision of the Labour Court was challenged by the appellant in this Court under Art. 136 of the Constitution. It was urged on behalf of the appellant inter alia that the respondents did not satisfy the definition of 'Working Journalist' in s. 2(f) of the Act under which two conditions must be satisfied namely, (1) He must be a person whose principal avocation is that of a journalist; and (2) He must be employed as such, or in relation to any establishment as specified in the definition.
 
HELD : (i) To come within the definition of "Calligraphist" three conditions have to be satisfied by the employer; (1) He must be an Artist; (2) He should perform journalistic work; (3) He should also calligraph matters. [444 E] The evidence established, and the appellant had conceded before the Labour Court, that Katibs calligraph matter. The evidence also established that Katibs prepare for publication drawing, layouts and other similar embellishments. The Labour Court's finding that the Respondents were artists as defined by the Wage Board was correct. [445 D--E] The Katibs according to the evidence, make corrections in the drafts furnished to them by the Editor. They even sometimes substitute words, compress and enlarge the matters according to, the availability of space and sometimes edit.
 They also correct mistakes in the matter sent to them. All this clearly went to establish that in the course of their duties the respondents performed journalistic work.. [448 D] Thus Katibs are Artists who perform journalistic work. and who also calligraph matters. Accordingly they satisfy the definition of 'calligraphist' as per the Wage Board Recommendations and they are 'working .journalists under s.
 2(f) of the Act. Therefore the Labour Court was right in holding that they were entitled to the higher scale of wages recommended by the Wage Board for calligraphist and accepted by the Central Government. [449 A-B] 439 (ii) The contention of the appellant that the respondents did, not satisfy the definition of working journalist in s.
 2(f) could not be accepted. When once the Wage Board has given the definition of a Calligraphist and included persons coming under that category in the definition of a working journalist' the, only test to be applied will be whether the person concerned satisfied the requirements of the definition given by the Wage Board. Under the conditions on which special leave was- granted in the present case it was no longer open to the appellant to question the jurisdiction of the Wage Board when it included calligraphists in the definition of 'working journalist'. [446 G] Further, in the case of the Management of Express Newspaper Ltd. v. B. Soinayajulu and others, this Court while dealing with a provision substantially similar to s. 2(f) clearly defined avocation as one's calling or profession. it has been further laid down therein that when a journalist is in full time employment, there is no difficulty in holding what his principal avocation is. Again dealing with the requirement of being employed as such', which also accured in s. 2(f), it is laid down that the requirement of employment is necessary to create a relationship of employer and employee between the journalist and the newspaper establishment. It is laid down that the definition will he satisfied if the journalist is in exclusive employ of a newspaper establishment, in which case his principal avocation will be that of a journalist and he can be considered to be employed as such. In the present case there was no controversy that the katibs were full time employees and there was the relationship of master and servant. The tests laid down in this case were therefore also satisfied. [447 C- F] The Management of Express Newspapers Ltd. V. B. Soinayajulu and others[1963] INSC 106; , [1964] 3 S.C.,R. 100 applied.
 Newspapers (Private) Ltd, and another v. The Union of India and others, [1959] S.C.R. 12 referred to.
