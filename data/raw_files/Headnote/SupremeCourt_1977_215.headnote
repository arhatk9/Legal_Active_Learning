 A charge-sheet against the appellant and two others, was filed before the Special Judge Delhi u/s. 120-B I.P.C. read with ss. 161 and 165-A, I.P.C. and s. 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. Earlier, at the Investigation stage, the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Delhi, had granted pardon to, an approver u/s. 337(1) Cr. P.C., 1898. :Me appellant applied for getting the Proceeding quashed, but his application was dismissed, first by the Special Judge, and thereafter by the High Court u/Art. 227 of the Constitution and s. 482. Cr.P.C.. 1898.
 The appellant contended before this Court, that, on the grant of such a, pardon, the application of a. 8(1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1952 ceases for the reason that on the charge sheet being tiled before a Magistrate, the accused can have the approver's evidence at the trial tested against his statement before the Magistrate, while he is denied this opportunity where the charge sheet is filed before the Special Judge, thus rendering s. 8(1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act if applied to such a case discriminatory, and violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution.
 Dismissing the appeal the Court, 
HELD : (1) Section 337 (2-B), under which the Magistrate is required to send the case for trial to the Special Judge.
 after examining the approver, does not in any way affect the jurisdiction of the Special Judge. By enacting sub-section (2B) in-1955, if the legislature sought to curb the power given to, the Special Judge by s. 8(1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1952, it would have expressed its intention clearly. [177 B-C] (2)The fact that the approver's evidence cannot be tested against any previous statement does not make any material difference to the detriment of the accused, transgressing Article 14 of the Constitution. The Special Judge, in any case, will have to apply the well established tests for the appreciation of the accomplice's evidence. The mere availability of two procedures would not justify the quashing of a provision as being violative of Art. 14, unless there is substantial and qualitative difference between the two procedures so that one is really and substantially more drastic and prejudicial than the other.
