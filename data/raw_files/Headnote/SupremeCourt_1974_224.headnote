 The Indian Sugar Mills Association is a trade union registered under the Trade Unions Act, 1926. Its objects are, inter alia, to promote and protect the trade, commerce and industries of India and in particular the trade, commerce and industries connected with sugar, to encourage friendly feeling and good relations amongst the sugar mills in general and the members in particular and also between producers of sugar and cane growers, distributors of sugar and other dealing with sugar mills and connected with sugar industries, to regulate terms and conditions of employment in the mills and factories, to promote good relations between the employers and the employees, to adjust controversies between members of the Association, and to establish just and equitable principles in trade and impose restrictive conditions on the conduct of sugar trade and business. Rule 4(a) of the Association Provides that the income and property of the Association shall be applied solely towards the promotion of the Association and no portion thereof shall be paid by way of dividend bonus or otherwise to the members of the Association. Rule 64 provides that the profits of the Association shall be applied in such a manner as the Committee may think fit provided that no distribution of profits amongst members will be made without a resolution of the General Meeting of the Association. It was claimed on behalf of the Association that the business it carried on was in the nature of property held under trust or legal obligation to apply the income for charitable purposes within the meaning of cl. (1) sub-section (3) of section 4 of the Income Tax Act, 1922 and therefore was exempted from tax. The income tax authorities and the tribunal rejected the claim. On reference the High Court answered in favour of the assessee.
 The High Court held that the primary objects of the Association were objects of general public utility and that the Association was under a legal obligation to hold the income it derived from the business for charitable purposes.
 It was of the view that section. 4 (3 )(1) was of wider amplitude than what was known as religious or charitable purposes in English law and a purpose of general public utility had to be ascertained with reference to conceptions prevailing in our country.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) In the present case no conflict arises between the English and the Indian concept of charitable purposes.
 (ii) The exemption under s. 4(3)(1) can be claimed if the income is held wholly for religious or charitable purposes;
 this requirement is satisfied if the primary purpose is religious or charitable and the other purposes, not by them- selves religious or charitable are ancillary and serve to achieve the main purpose.

 (iii) Under Rule 64 the Committee of the Association might decide to apportion the entire profits amongst the members of the Association leaving nothing to be applied towards charitable objects. Rule 64 introduces an element of private gain which is inconsistent with the object of general public utility. It is not possible to hold that all the objects of the Association are charitable. It cannot also be held that the primary purpose of the association is charitable and other objects are ancillary or incidental.
 Some of the stated objects of the Association cannot be treated as primary and others in apparent conflict with them as of no 606 effect. It is not therefore possible to agree that the Association held the income derived from its business wholly for charitable purposes.

But the rule of construction of deeds and wills that in case of repugnancy the first words in a deed and the last words in a will shall prevail, is not applicable to the rules and regulations of a registered trade union in order to find out its real object.
