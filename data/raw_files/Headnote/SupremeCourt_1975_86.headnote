 The respondent, a dealer, was assessed in July, 1948. In January, 1960, the Sales Tax Officer wrote a letter to the Sales Tax Commissioner pointing out a mistake which had crept in the order of assessment. In April 1960, the Commissioner filed a Revision Application under s. 10 of the Act. Section 10(3) and s. 10(3-B) read as under :
 "(3)(i) The Revising Authority (or an Additional Revising Authority) may, for the purposes of satisfying itself as to the legality or propriety of any order made by any appellate or assessing authority under this Act, in its discretion, call for and examine, either on its own motion or on the application of the Commissioner of Sales Tax or the persons aggrieved, the record of such order as it thinks fit :
 Provided that no such application shall be entertained in any case where an appeal lay against the order, but was not preferred.
 (3-B) The Application under sub-section (3) shall be made within one year from the date of service of the order complained of but the Revising Authority may on proof of sufficient cause entertain an application within a further period of six months." The assessee contended before the Revisional Authority that the revision was time-barred inasmuch as it had been filed much beyond the period of limitation specified in s. 10(3- B). The Revenue contended that the starting point for limitation was January, 1960 when the Commissioner received the intimation of the assessment order and that since the revision had been filed within one year from that intimation, it was within time. The Revisional Authority accepted the contention of the assessee and dismissed the application as time barred. On a reference the High Court answered the questions against the Revenue and in favour of the assessee.
 On appeal by Special Leave it was contended before this Court by the Revenue :
 (1) Sub-section (3-B) does not provide any starting point of limitation in the ease of a revision filed by the Commissioner.
 (2) In any case, the starting point of limitation is the date of service of the order on the Commissioner or the dealer, as the case may be.
 On the other hand, the assessee contended that the starting point of limitation for a revision application whether filed by the dealer or the Commissioner is the date on which the order of assessment is served on the dealer.

HELD : The contention of the Revenue that there is no limitation for a revision application filed by the Commissioner, is not correct. Sub-section (3-B) prescribes a period of limitation for every revision-application, whe- ther filed by the Commissioner or the dealer (assessee), and the starting point of limitation is the date of the service of the order on the revision-applicant. [64E] (2) For the purpose of sub-section (3-B) service of the order complained of means something subsequent to and distinct from the mere making of the order. It implies formal communication of the order after it has been passed, on the revision application. [64A] (3) Since the revision application in the instant case was filed by the Commissioner within one year of the communication of the assessment order, it was within time.
 [66B] (4)The difficulty in construing the unhappy language of the statute was felt in the year 1960 and even earlier, and has given rise to this protracted litigation extending over fifteen years. It is desirable that the Legislature should amend the statute and make its intent clear. In any event, it should make a statutory provision requiring the Sales Tax Officer to send forthwith a copy of every assessment order made by him to the Commissioner for information. [66F-G]
