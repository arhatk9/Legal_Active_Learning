 After making all allowances and deductions, the income of the assesses company was finally assessed for the years 1949-50 881 and 1950-51 at Rs. 3,423 and Rs. 3,312 respectively. The assesses company had declared dividends of Rs. 46,024 and Rs. 56,326 for the above two years. Though no profits were brought forward from the previous years, the income-tax officer applied the proviso to para. B of Part 1 of the Third and First Schedules of the Finance Act, 1949 and 195o, assessed the difference in each year to additional income- tax and charged income-tax at the rate of annas 5 in the rupee on the amounts for the two assessment years. The High Court held that though excess dividends were, in fact, paid, the absence of profits from previous years rendered the Finance Act unworkable in this case.
 The question was if the second proviso to para. B read with the explanation which sets out the manner of calculation of the tax applied and whether it was the intention of the Finance Act to levy the additional income-tax on the excess dividends even if there were no profits brought forward from preceding year or years :
 Held, that the second proviso to para. B of Part 1 of the first schedule of the Finance Act, 1950, which corresponds to the corresponding paragraph of the Finance Act, 1949, introduces a fiction which postulates that there should be undistributed profit of one or more years immediately preceding the previous year, that such undistributed profits should be sufficient to cover the amount of excess dividend actually paid out in the year under assessment, and that the undistributed profits should not have been taken likewise to cover an excess dividend of any other previous year. The excess dividends have first to be connected with the profits of the preceding years and then the tax borne on those profits has to be found out, and tax is then payable at an enhanced rate and amounts to the difference between the tax actually borne by the profits and that demandable under the paragraph. Where there are no profits of any preceding year or years, the fiction wholly fails and the method of calculation, equally so.
 Held, further, that the income-tax law seeks to put in the net certain class of income, and can only successfully do so, if it frames a provision appropriate to that end. If the law fails and the taxpayer cannot be brought within its letter, no question of unjustness as such, arises.
