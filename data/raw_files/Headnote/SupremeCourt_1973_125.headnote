 Appellants brought this suit against the present respondent for possession of certain Bhumidhari plots. The plots had been purchased in the name of the appellant's uncle. After the death of the uncle who died is sunless, the plots were recorded in the name of his widow. The widow died in 1948.
 The appellants as the next reversions claimed title to the plots. The respondent contended that the suit was barred by limitation.
 The courts below were unanimously of the opinion that the plaintiffs had title to the property and the defendant had none. The learned Munsiff however dismissed the suits as being barred by limitation. In appeal, the learned Addi- tional Civil Judge reversed the finding and decreed the--suit. In second appeal the High Court was of the view that the period of limitation was not the one which was prescribed under the Limitation Act, but the one which was provided in Appendix 2 of the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Rules, 1952, which was 2 years from 1-7-1952.
 Since the suit was filed on 5-9-1955, it was barred by limitation.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) Sections 209 and 331 of U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act 1951, when read together, showed that a suit, like the present one, had to be filed in a Special Court created under the Act within a period of limitation specially prescribed under the Rules made under the Act, and the jurisdiction of the ordinary Civil Courts to entertain the suit was absolutely barred.
 [292C] Since the Civil Court which entertained the suit suffered from an inherent lack of jurisdiction because of special provisions of the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act 1951, the present appeal filed by the appellants had to be dismissed. [293B]
