 The suit lands belonged to a Hindu Deity. In 1851 the then Archaka and de facto trustee of the temple arranged with P the great grandfather of the first defendant, that the latter would supply one fourth seer of gingili oil every day to the temple and instead of receiving the price of the oil would enjoy the income of the lands. The arrangement was reduced into writing. The first defendant and his predecessors continued in possession of the lands under this arrangement. The arrangement was put an end to by notices dated December 6, 1948 and August 31, 1949 issued by the plaintiff's Advocate to the first defendant. The second defendant was a lessee to the suit lands under the first defendant. In their written statements the defendants denied that plaintiff was a trustee of the deity or had a right to sue on its behalf. Various other defences including that of adverse possession were taken up. The trial court held : (1) The suit lands belonged to the deity, (2) the arrangement of 1851 amounted to a permanent lease of the lands by the then Archaka and de facto trustee of the temple to the ancestor of the first defendant on condition of his supplying one fourth seer of gingili oil every day to the temple and (3) the first defendant and his predecessors in interest had acquired title to the lands by adverse possession burdened with this condition. On these findings the trial court dismissed the suit. The decree was confirmed by the High Court on appeal. Without expressing any opinion on the first two questions the High Court agreed with the finding of the trial court of the question of adverse possession. The plaintiff and two other persons appealed to this Court by special leave.
 The following questions arose for decision : (1) Was the deity the owner of the suit lands? (2) If so, what rights were acquired by the ancestor of the first defendant under the arrangement of 1851 and (3) Had P and his successors-in- interest acquired title by adverse possession subject to the burden of supplying oil every day? 
HELD : (i) On an examination of the documentary evidence produced by both sides it was clear that the deity was the owner of the lands. [836 D] (ii) The claim of the defendants that by the sanad dated November 10, 1851 the lands were conveyed to P subject to the burden of supplying oil for evening lighting purposes could not be accepted. Had the properties been conveyed by the Sanad to P, he and his successors would have been entered in the village accounts as the inamdars and the pattas in respect of the suit lands would have been issued to them. But all along the deity was shown as the registered inamdar and the relevant pattas were issued 832 to the deity and not the plaintiff, or his successors. In spite of a notice served by the plaintiff the defendants had rim produced the sanad. Their explanation that it was not in their possession could not be accepted. [836 E] (iii) Nor could it be accepted that under the Sanad dated November 10, 1851, P and his successors-in-interest acquired a right of permanent tenancy. Had the origin of the tenancy been not known an inference could fairly have been drawn from the facts that the tenancy was permanent. Having regard to the long lapse of time it could have been presumed that the permanent tenancy was granted for legal necessity.
 But in the present case the origin of the tenancy was known.
 The tenancy was granted by the Sanad dated November 10, 1851. Only the Sanad could show what interest was granted by it. The defendants had deliberately withheld this document, and therefore every presumption had to be made against them to their disadvantage consistent with the facts. It could therefore be presumed that the document if produced would have shown that the tenancy was not permanent. Considering all these facts it was clear that the Sanad granted to P was a lease of the suit lands from year to year in consideration of his rendering one fourth seer of gingili oil every day to the temple. [837 A; 838 E] (iv) The Manager of the temple in 1851 had ample power in the course of the management to grant a lease from year to year. The lease was binding on the temple. It continued of its own force till terminated by notice in 1949. The possession of the tenants during the continuancy of the tenancy was therefore not adverse to the to the temple.

Baluswami Ayyar, (1921)L.R. 48 I.A.302 Moreover having regard to s. 116 of the Indian Evidence Act, during the continuance of the tenancy the defendants as tenants could not be permitted to deny the title of the deity at the beginning of the tenancy. [839 E] (v) Nor could the defendants be allowed to claim adverse possession from 1929 onwards on the basis of the adverse notice given by them to the Hindu Religious Endowments Board. The tenant cannot acquire by prescription a permanent right of occupancy in derogation of the landlord's title by mere assertion of such a right, to the knowledge of the landlord.

 (vi)The present suit was one by a landlord to recover possession from a tenant and was governed by Art. 139. The tenancy was determined in 1949 and the suit being instituted on November 1, 1954 was well within time. The defendants could not be said to acquired title 'o the lands by adverse possession. [841 B-C] (vii) Art. 134-B of the Indian Limitation Act does not apply to a suit for recovery of a property where the property his been lawfully transferred by a previous manager, aid the transfer remains effective after his death, resignation or removal. Tne transfer contemplated by Art. 134-B is an unauthorised and illegal transfer by the previous, manager.
