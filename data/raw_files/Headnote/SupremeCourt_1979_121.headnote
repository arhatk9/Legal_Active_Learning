 The Provident Fund Act 1952 as originally enacted provided for the institution of compulsory provident fund for employees in factories and other establishments. Under s. 4 of the Act the Central Government framed the Employees Provident Fund Scheme, 1952 and s. 6 of the Act enjoined on every employer to make contributions to the Fund. Section 14 of the Act provided penalties for breach of the provisions of the Act viz., failure to pay contributions, failure to submit necessary returns etc., and the penalties extended to various terms of imprisonment extending upto 6 months or with fine upto Rs. 1000/-.
 The Act was amended by Parliament by Act XVI of 1971 and it was re-entitled as the "Employees Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952". The amending Act inserted s. 6A in the Act for the establishment of the Family Pension Fund, and in exercise of its powers the Central Government created the Family Pension Scheme, 1971 and para 9 of the Scheme created a Family Pension Fund and provided that from and out of contribution payable by the employer and employees in each month under s. 6 of the Act, a part of the contribution shall be remitted by the employer to the Family Pension Fund.
 The authorities noticed in the working of the Act and the Scheme that an employer could delay payment of provident fund dues without any additional financial liability, amended the Act and inserted s. 14B for recovery of damages on the amount of arrears, the object and purpose being to authorise the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner to impose exemplary punitive damages and thereby to prevent the employers from making the defaults. Section 14B as originally enacted provided, for imposition of such damages 'not exceeding twenty five per cent on the amount of arrears.' This, however, did not prove sufficiently deterrent and the employers were still making defaults in making contributions to the provident fund and in the meanwhile utilising both their own contribution as well as the employees' contributions in their business.
 62 The National Commission on Labour, recommended that in order to check the growth of arrears, penalties for default in payment of provident fund dues should be more stringent and that the default should be made cognizable. This view was endorsed by the Estimates Committee in its 116th Report to the Parliament. Accordingly, the Act was further amended by Act No. 40 of 1973, and the words "twenty five per cent" were omitted from s. 14B and the words "not exceeding the amount of arrears" were substituted.
 The employer a chemical industry failed to deposit the amount of Provident Fund and Family Pension Scheme dues with the Provident Fund Commissioner. The Regional Provident Fund Commissioner after issuing a show-cause notice to the employer, imposed a penalty which was equivalent to the amount payable by the petitioner company and this penalty came to nearly Rupees one lakh.
 The employer pleaded before the Provident Fund Commissioner that disputes between the partners of the firm, power cut of 60% necessitating purchase of generating set on loan basis leading to loss were the difficulties in making the contributions in time and these were circumstances beyond their control. The Regional Provident Fund Commissioner after affording the petitioner the opportunity of a hearing, by a reasoned order, considered in detail each of the grounds taken in mitigation of the default and came to the conclusion that none of the grounds alleged furnished a legal justification for the delay in making contributions in time and held that the petitioner had failed to carry out their obligations to contribute to the Fund and no convincing case having been made out to justify the delay in making the deposits and being 'habitual defaulters', their case should be severely dealt with and held that it was a fit case for imposition of punitive damages to ensure due compliance of the provisions of the Act.
 In the writ petition to this Court it was contended on behalf of the petitioners (i) that s. 14B of the Act is violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution as it confers unguided, uncontrolled, and arbitrary powers on the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner, (ii) s. 14B deals with the power to recover damages and the damages imposed must have co-relation with the loss suffered as a result of delayed payment, (iii) the period of arrears varies from less than one month to more than 12 months and therefore the imposition of damages at the flat rate of 100% for all the defaults irrespective of their duration is not only capricious but arbitrary; (iv) the absence of provision of appeal leaves the defaulter-employer with no remedy and (v) s. 14B of the Act has not authorised levy of any penal damages i.e. the penalty or fine but deals with the power to recover the damages.
 Dismissing the petition, ^ HELD : Per Krishna Iyer, J.
 
 1. The Act a social security measure is a humane homage the State pays to Arts. 39 and 41 of the Constitution. The viability of the project depends on the employer duly deducting the workers' contribution from their wages, adding his own little and promptly depositing the same. The mechanics of the system will suffer paralysis of the employer fails to perform his function. The dynamics of this beneficial statute derive its locomotive power from the funds regularly flowing into the statutory till. [69 B-C] 63 
 2. If the stream of contributions were frozen by employers' defaults after due deduction for the wages and diversion for their own purposes the scheme would be damnified by traumatic starvation of the Fund. [69D] 
 3. 'Damages' have a wider socially semantic connotation than pecuniary loss of interest on non-payment when a social welfare scheme suffers mayhem on account of the injury. Law expands concepts to embrace social needs so as to become functionally effectual. [69E] 
 4. The power to affect citizen's rights, especially by way of punitive impost or damages for wrong doing, is quasi- judicial in character even if exercised by executive echelons. This Court has underscored the importance of injecting the norms of natural justice when statutory functionaries affect the rights of a person. [71A] 
 5. (i) The imposition of damages on a party after statutory hearing is quasi-judicial direction. This Court has impressed the requirements of natural justice on such jurisdiction and one such desideratum is spelling out reasons for the order made, in other words, a speaking order. The inscrutable face of a sphinx is ordinarily incongruous with a judicial or quasi-judicial performance.
 [71E] (ii) An imperative of s. 14B is that the Commissioner shall give reasons for his order imposing damages on an employer. Such a guarantee ensures rational action by the officer, because reasons imply relevant reasons, not capricious ink and the need for cogency rivets the officer's mind to the pertinent material on record. Moreover, once reasons are set down, the order readily exposes itself to the writ jurisdiction of the court under Art. 226 so that perversity, illiteracy, extraneous influence, malafides and other blatant infirmities straight get caught and corrected.
 [71F-G] 
 6. A high official hears and decides. The maximum harm is pecuniary liability limited by the statute. The writ jurisdiction is ready to review glaring errors. Under such circumstances the needs of the factual situation and the legal milieu are such that the absence of appellate review in no way militates against the justice and reasonableness of the provision. The argument of arbitrariness on this score is untenable. The section is not bad, though action under the section can be challenged in writ jurisdiction when infirmities which attract such jurisdiction vitiate the order. [71 E-F] 
 7. The argument that absent detailed guidelines, the law is void, is not tenable. What is not explicit may still be implicit. What is not articulated at length may be spun out from a single phrase. What is not transparent in particularised provisions may be immanent in the preamble, scheme, purpose or subject-matter of the Act. What is real is not only the gross but also the subtle. Such a perspective dispels the submission that s. 14B is bad as uncircumscribed and over-broad. [72H-73A] 
 8. The word 'damages' under s. 14B has a wealth of implications and limitations, sufficient to serve as guideline in fixing the impost. The conceptual limitations of 'damages' serve as guideline and barricade the exercise.
 The Commissioner cannot award anything more than or unrelated to 'damages'. Nor can he go beyond 100% of the amount defaulted. Such limitations without further guidelines are not uncommon in taxing laws to penalise defaults and suppressions. [73B, H, 74A] 64 C.I.T., M.P. v. Radhakrishan, [1978] INSC 202; [1979] 2 SCC 249; P. N.
 Kaushal v. Union of India, etc.[1978] INSC 136; , [1978] 3 SCC 558; referred to.
 
 9. The expression 'damages' is neither vague nor over- wide. Its precise import in a given context is not difficult to discern. A plurality of variants stemming out of a core concept is seen in such words as actual damages, civil damages, compensatory damages, consequential damages, contingent damages, continuing damages, double damages, excessive damages, exemplary damages, general damages, irreparable damages, pecuniary damages, prospective damages, special damages, speculative damages, substantial damages, unliquidated damages. But the essentials are (a) detriment to one by the wrong doing of another, (b) reparation awarded to the injured through legal remedies and (c) its quantum being determined by the dual components of pecuniary compensation for the loss suffered and often not always a punitive addition as a deterrent-cum-denunciation by the law. [74 B-D] 
 10. 'Exemplary damages' are damages on an increased scale, awarded to the plaintiff over and above what will barely compensate him for his property loss, where the wrong done to him was aggravated by circumstances of violence, oppression, malice, fraud or wanton and wicked conduct on the part of the defendant and are intended to solace the plaintiff for mental anguish laceration of his feelings, shame, degradation or other aggravations of the original wrong, or else to punish the defendant for his evil behaviour or to make an example of him, for which reason they are also called "punitive" or "punitory" damages or "vindictive" damages, and (vulgarly) "smart-money". [74E-F] 
 11. The power conferred to award damages is delimited by the content and contour of the concept itself and if the Court finds the Commissioner travelling beyond, the blow will fall. Section 14B is therefore good for these reasons.
 [74G] 
 12. A policy oriented interpretation when a welfare legislation falls for determination, especially in the context of a developing country, is sanctioned by principle and precedent and is implicit in Art. 37 of the Constitution, since the judicial branch is, in a sense, part of the State. So it is reasonable to assign to 'damages' a larger, fulfilling meaning. [75E] 
 14. The composite idea of 'damages' includes more than pecuniary compensation. Moreover, the injured party is the Board of trustees who administer the Fund. That Fund not merely loses the interest consequent on the nonpayment but receives a shock in that its scarce resources are further famished by employers' default. There is great social injury to the scheme when employers default in number. So the lash of the law is delivered when its object is frustrated. More denunciatory is the fact that the employer makes deductions from the poor wages of the workers and diverts even those sums for his private purposes by failing to make prompt remittances. Thus default in contributions is compounded by 'embezzlement, as it were. Naturally, damages will take an exemplary character and inflict a heavy blow on the shady defaulter. [75F-G] 
 15. The damages are levied under the Act and the Authority levying damages is created by Act and is responsible for the collection of contributions and damages for the Fund. It is not possible to dichotomise and hold that the contributions go into the Provident Fund but the rest of the damages go 65 into the general revenues. This is not a fine under the criminal law. Nor is it recovery on behalf of the Government of amounts under a general statute for purposes of revenue.
 A special statute creating a special fund, empowers special officers to recover specially designated contributions and special damages for default. The entire sum belongs to the fund except perhaps the administrative charges which are usually separately indicated. It is wrong therefore to credit the damages into the general revenues. To that extent it is a breach of the statutory scheme and a deprivation of what belongs to the workers' Provident Fund. If any State is diverting the damages under the Act into its own coffers, it is improper. [76G-77B] 
 16. 'Damages' as imposed by s. 14B, includes a punitive sum quantified according to the circumstances of the case.
 In 'exemplary damages' this aggravating element is prominent. Constitutionally speaking such a penal levy included in damages is perfectly within the area of implied powers and the legislature may, while enforcing collections, legitimately and reasonably provide for recovery of additional sums in the shape of penalty so as to see that avoidance is obviated. Such a penal levy can take the form of damages. [75H-76B] Per Sen, J. 1. Section 14B of the Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 was enacted to deter the employers and to thwart them from making defaults in carrying out their statutory obligations to make payments to the Provident Fund. The object and purpose of the Section is to authorise the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner to impose exemplary or punitive damages and thereby to prevent employees from making defaults. The intention in increasing the quantum of damages. namely, "not exceeding the amount of arrears" is to invest the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner with power to impose such damages so that the employer would not find it profitable to make defaults in making payments. [82D-G] 
 2. The word "damages" in Section 14B of the Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 cannot be read in isolation nor can section 14B be read out of context. The word has to be given its true meaning in consonance with the objects and purposes of the Legislation.
 It must take its colour and content from its context. The woed 'damages' in section 14B, in the context in which it appears, means penal damages i.e. a penalty and not merely actual loss to the beneficiaries. Otherwise the very object of the Legislation would be frustrated. [87D] 
 3. The imposition of damages under section 14B serves a two-fold purpose. It results in damnification and also serves as a deterrent. The predominent object is to penalise, so that an employer may be thwarted or deterred from making any further defaults. [87E] The expression "damages" accruing in Section 14B is, in substance, a penalty imposed on the employer for the breach of the statutory obligation. The object of imposition of penalty u/s 14B is not merely "to provide compensation for the employees". The imposition of damages u/s 14B serves both the purposes. It is meant to penalise defaulting employer as also to provide reparation for the amount of loss suffered by the employees. It is not only a warning to employers in general not to commit a breach of the statutory requirement of section 6 of the Act, but at the same time it is meant to provide compensation 66 or redress to the beneficiaries i.e. to recompense the employees for the loss sustained by them. The damages need not bear any relationship to the loss which is caused to the beneficiaries under the scheme. [87F-G] 
 4. Each word, phrase or sentence must be considered in the light of the general purpose of the Act itself. A bare mechanical interpretation of the words devoid of concept or purpose will reduce most of legislation to futility. It is a salutary rule well established that the intention of the legislature must be found by reading the statute as a whole.
 [89E] The word "damages" in section 14B is related to the word "default". The words used in section 14B are "default in the payment of contribution" and, therefore the word "default" must be construed in the light of Para 36 of the Employees' Provident Fund Scheme, 1952, which provides that the payment of contribution has got to be made by the 15th of the following month and, therefore, the word "default" in section 14B must mean "failure in performance" or "failure to act". At the same time the imposition of damages u/s 14B is to provide reparation for the amount of loss suffered by employees. And this is in accord with the intent and purpose of the legislation. [87H-88B] 
 5. In assessing the damages, the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner is not only bound to take into account the loss to the beneficiaries, but also the default by the employer in making his contributions, which occasioned the infliction of damages. The entire amount of damages awarded under section 14B, except for the amount relatable to administrative charges, must necessarily be transferred to the Employees' Provident Fund and the Family Pension Fund.
 The employees would get damages commensurate with their loss i.e. the amount of interest on delayed payments, but the remaining amount would go to augment the 'Fund' constituted under section 5, for implementing the scheme of the Act.
 [89G-90A] 
 6. Section 14B of the Act does not confer unguided or uncontrolled discretion upon the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner to impose such damages "as he may think fit", and, is, therefore, not violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. [83G] It cannot be said that there are no guidelines provided for fixing the quantum of damages. The guidelines are provided in the Act and its various provisions, particularly in the word "damages" the liability for which under Section 14B arises on the 'making of default". The word "damages" in Section 14B lays down sufficient guidelines for the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner to levy damages. [83G-84B] 
 7. The power of Regional Provident Fund Commissioner to impose damages under section 14B is quasi-judicial function.
 It must be exercised after notice to the defaulter and after giving him a reasonable opportunity of being heard. The discretion to award damages could be exercised within the limits fixed by the statute, by taking into consideration various factors, namely, the number of defaults, the period of delay, the frequency of defaults and the amount involved.
 Having regard to the punitive nature of the power exercisable under Section 14B and the consequences that ensue therefrom, an order under Section 14B must be a "speaking order" containing the reasons in support of it.

 8. Mere absence of provision for an appeal in the Employees Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 does not imply that the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner, is invested with arbitrary or uncontrolled power, without any guidelines. [85B] The conferral of power to award damages under section 14B is to ensure the success of the measure. It is dependent on existence of certain facts, there has to be an objective determination, not subjective. [85C] The Regional Provident Fund Commissioner has not only to apply his mind to the requirements of Section 14B but is cast with the duty of making a speaking order after conforming to the rules of natural justice. [85C] The absence of a provision for appeal or revision can be of no consequence. Where the discretion to apply the provisions of a particular statute is left with the Government or one of the highest officers, it will be presumed that the discretion vested in such a high authority will not be abused. The Government or such authority is in a position to have all the relevant and necessary information in relation to each kind of establishment, the nature of defaults made by the employer and the necessity to decide whether the damages to be imposed should be exemplary or not. When the power has to be exercised by one of the highest officers, the fact that no appeal has been provided for "is a matter of no moment". There is always a presumption that public officials would discharge, their duties honestly and in accordance with the rules of law.

 9. In the instant case, the petitioners are guilty of suppressio veri for deliberate concealment of facts pertaining to the earlier defaults and the attendant levy of damages under s. 14B. The petitioners instead of making their contributions, deliberately made willful defaults on one pretext or another and have been utilising the amounts deducted from the wages of their employees, including their own contributions as well as administrative charges, in running their business. Therefore, this was pre-eminently a fit case for imposition of punitive damages to ensure due compliance of the provisions of the Act. [79F, G, 80C]
