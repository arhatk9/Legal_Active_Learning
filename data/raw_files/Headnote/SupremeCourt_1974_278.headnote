 The appellant was the Inamdar and respondent no. 1 was the tenant of the suit land when the Hyderabad Abolition of Inams and Cash Grants Act, 1954 was made applicable to the suit 'land. By virtue of the said Abolition Act, the appellants Inam was abolished and it vested in the State.
 Before the Inam was abolished. the appellant terminated the tenancy of first respondent by a notice and filed a proceeding for eviction of the tenant Under the Tenancy Act.
 The said application was rejected by the Naib Tahsildar before, the Inam was abolished. However, after the Inam was abolisbed on an appeal the Deputy Collector allowed the appellant to resume the suit land. The Revenue Tribunal allowed the revision of respondent No. 1 on the ground that after the abolition and vesting of the appellant's Inam, the first respondent as a tenant in possession acquired all the rights of an occupant tinder the Act. During the proceedings under the Inam Abolition Act, the appellant contended that the respondent no. 1 did not become the occupant of the land. The Tahsildar decided that respondent no. 1 was a tenant in possession and, therefore, acquired the rights of an occupant. The appellant filed an appeal before the State Government under the Abolition Act against the said decision of the Tahsildar. The State Government dismissed the said appeal without passing a speaking order and without giving a personal hearing to the appellant. The appellant filed a writ petition against the said order of the State Government which was dismissed- by the High Court. The appellant filed a writ petition against the said judgment. of the Bombay High Court. It was contended before this Court, (i) that the State Government was not justified 'in rejecting the appellant's statutory appeal without giving him a hearing and without passing any reasoned order. (ii) that the inam in question was a service Inam and hence in view of the provision of Law contained in section 102A(c) of the Tenancy Act the said Act was not applicable to the land in question;
 respondent no.1 could therefore never be a tenant of the land. (iii) that the proceedings initiated by the appellant for resumption of land under the Tenancy Act were all ultra vires and without jurisdiction, there being no relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties under the Tenancy Act. Jurisdiction could not be conferred by an erroneous stand of the appellant that the first respondent was his tenant. (iv) In any view of the matter the tenancy was terminated by service of a notice under s. 44 and the filing of the application under s. 32(2) of the Tenancy Act, against respondent no. 1. He was. therefore, not a tenant in possession of the land on 1-7-1960 the date of vesting of the Inam. (v) The High Court has committed an error in holding that its judgment in Special Petition No. 1881 of 1962 operated as res-Judicata on the question of respondent no. 1 acquiring the eight of an occupant under section 6(1) of tile Abolition of Inams Act.
 
HELD : (1) It was not necessary for the State Government to give a personal hearing to the appellant or his representative. When in order is 100 liable to be challenged under Arts. 226 and 227 of the Constitution, courts insist that an appeal ought to be disposed of by a speaking order giving reasons in its support. It may not be possible in all cases to say that a non-speaking order is bad or invalid. On the facts of the case, the High Court rightly did not set aside the order of the State Government and remit back the appellant's appeal on that ground. No determination or adjudication of facts was involved. [103A-D] (2) Mere service of the notice terminating the tenancy and filing an application for possession does not bring an end to the tenancy. Until and unless the possession was directed to be delivered to the land holder' the tenant continued in possession as a tenant. The decision of the full bench of Bombay High Court-reported in 67 Bombay Law Reporter 521 doubted. [104-F-G; 105-A-B] (3) The appellant all along contended that the Inam was not a service Inam. The said contention is contrary to the case of the appellant throughout. [103-F] (4) The appellant cannot contend that respondent no. 1 is not a tenant. The appellant all along treated respondent no. 1 as a tenant. The appellant did not even assert in the Statement of case or the additional grounds that respondent no. 1 is not a tenant. Respondent no. 1 was in cultivating possession and was paying rent to the appellant.
 It could not be in any capacity other than a tenant. [103H- 104B] (5) The High Court rightly held that issue as to whether respondent no. 1 acquired the right as an occupant or not was barred on the principles of res judicata in view of the decision of the High Court in the earlier petition, [105-E]
