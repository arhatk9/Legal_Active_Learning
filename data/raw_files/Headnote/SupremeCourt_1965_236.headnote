 The assessee, an investment company, was assessed to income- tax on its dividend income under s. 12 of the Income Tax Act. On reference the High Court held : "it cannot 'be suggested in this case that the assessee investment company had no business of any kind. It certainly had one but when it held shares on which dividends were received tax has to be computed under s. 12 and the assessee cannot say .that this being its main activity the income received was its 'business income' under s. 10". In appeal to this Court the assessee contended that when a company is formed for the purpose of acquiring shares and making investments and generally undertaking financial and commercial obligations and transactions and operations of all kinds, the dividend income must be computed under s. 101 of Income-tax Act, because the company was formed expressly for the purpose of carrying on business and holding shares in the course of it.
 
HELD : The High Court rightly answered the question against the assessee.
 On principle, before dividends on shares can be assessed under s. 10, the assessee, be it an individual or a company or any other entity, must carry on business in respect of shares; that is to say, the assessee must deal in those shares. If an individual person invests in shares for the purpose of earning dividend he is not carrying on a business. The only way he can come under s. 10 is by converting the shares into stock-in-trade, i.e. by carrying on business of dealing in Stock and shares. [478 E-F] The very fact that a company is incorporated to carry on investment does not show that the company is carrying on business. [478 G] Lakshminarayan Rani Gopal & Son Ltd. v. Government of Hyderabad, 25 I.T.R. 449, relied upon.
 , Apart from showing mere investment, no facts have been brought out in this case to show that the company was in any way carrying on business in respect of shares. Its position was in no way different from an individual merely buying shares with a view to holding them for the purpose of earning dividends. [479 B-C]
