 In 1958, an agreement was entered into between the appellant company and its employees, with reference to certain demands made by the latter The agreement was in force for 5 years.
 In 1963, after the expiry of the period, the employees asked for a revision of the matters dealt with by the agreement.
 The Industrial Tribunal to which the industrial dispute was referred held by its award that : (1) the scales of pay and dearness allowance should be increased and that the employees should be pulled up to fit into the revised scales of pay taking into account their length of service; (2) on the question of gratuity, that 5 years of completed and confirmed service was the qualifying period, even in the case of retirement or resignation or termination of service of an employee; and (3) privilege leave should be allowed up to 30 days in a year with accumulation up to 90 days, and sick leave to the extent of 15 days for each year of service up to 3 months on full pay, and thereafter, three months on half pay.
 In appeal to this Court 
HELD: (1) The question regarding revision must be examined on the merits of each individual case. It could not be said that the Tribunal should not have upset the 1958 agreement because enough time had not elapsed since the date of that agreement. In 1958, the company was incurring losses and it was only in 1962 that its prospects had improved. The pay and dearness allowance of the workmen as a result of the award should be comparable to the pay and dearness allowance of those workmen working in other comparable concerns; and, the financial burden Should without any difficulty, be met by the company in view of its improved working.

 Taking into consideration the fact, that the wage scales and dearness allowance were low even as compared to those in comparable concerns and the established,' financial capacity "of the employer, since 1962, to bear the burden, the -award of the Tribunal on the question of adjustment of the workmen into the new scales was justified. -Unless the length of service of the workmen was taken into consideration great hardship -would be inflicted on the existing workmen compared to the salary and dearness allowance which new workers would get. By fitting the workers in the new scales of pay taking into account their length of service, the com- pany would be rehabilitating them to a certain extent even though they may have suffered in the past on account of the inadequacy of the scales of pay and dearness allowance.

 (2)In considering the problem of financial burden imposed by a gratuity scheme on the employer there are two approaches :
 (i) to capitalize the burden on the actuarial basis which would show theoretically that the burden would be very heavy; and (ii) to look at the scheme in its practical aspect and find out how many employees retire every year on the average. It is the practical approach that should be taken into account in industrial adjudication and on that basis, the burden would not be beyond the financial capacity of the company. [608 F-G] Wenger & Co. v. Their Workmen, [1963] Supp. 2 S.C.R. 862, followed However, a workman should not be entitled to any gratuity on resignation or retirement, after five years of completed and confirmed service, and the period should be raised to ten years. Otherwise, the workmen may. leave one concern after another after putting the short minimum service qualifying for gratuity. Also, a workman, who was dismissed for misconduct, should be entitled to receive gratuity only after completion of 15 years of service on the ground that the gratuity is a reward for long and meritorious service, and further that, in cases where the misconduct for which the workman was dismissed entailed financial loss to the company, the company would be entitled to recover the loss from the amount. of gratuity payable.

 (3)Taking into consideration the leave available to employees in other concerns in the region the leave rules as fixed in the award, should be modified to the extent that the privilege leave would be allowable at the rate of 30 days for each completed year of service with a right to accumulate the same up to 60 days; and sick leave at the rate of 15 days per year with full pay with right to accumulate the same up to 3 months. [612 G] Rai Bahadur Diwan Badri Das v. Industrial Tribunal, Punjab, (1962] 11 L.L.J, (S.C.), followed.
 The contention that the Tribunal could not direct that the employees should have leave in excess of the limits specified in the West Bengal Shops and Establishments Act, 1963, could not be accepted. The employees were enjoying leave at a rate which exceeded the limits prescribed by that Act, and s. 24 of the Act provided that the Act would not affect a privilege to which an employee was entitled on the date of the commencement of the Act.
