 The petitioner who was a,-registered dealer under the Orissa Sales Tax Act, 1947, was carrying on the business of purchasing and reselling castor seeds, etc., in the State of Orissa. Under a declaration given by him for the purpose of obtaining his registration certificate the goods purchased by him in Orissa were to be resold in that State. He purchased certain commodities inside the State but in contravention of his declaration sold, the goods to dealers outside the State. The Sales Tax Officer included in the taxable turnover of the petitioner the purchase made by him inside the State in accordance with s. 5(2)(a)(II) of the Act. The contention of the petitioner was that the purchase was in course of inter-State trade and was exempted under Art. 286(2) of the Constitution of India.
 Held, that the transaction of sale which has been taxed was wholly inside the State of Orissa and was distinct and sepa- rate from the sale made by the purchaser to dealers outside the State. The former transaction was taxable under s.
 5(2)(a)(II) of the Act while the latter was exempted under Art. 286(2) of the Constitution.

 In order that a sale or purchase might be inter-State, it is essential that there must be transport of goods from one State 315 to another under the contract of sale or purchase. A purchase made inside a State, for sale outside the State cannot itself be held to be in the course of inter-State trade and the imposition of tax thereon is not repugnant to Art. 286(2) of the Constitution.
