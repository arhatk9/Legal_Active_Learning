 The Indian Foreign Service Branch 'B' was constitued in 1956. The statutory rules Indian Foreign Service Branch (Recruitment, Cadre, Seniority and Promotion) Rules, 1964 came into force from May 6, 1964. Commencing from the advent of the Rules, recruitment from three sources were made (i) direct recruitment on the result of a competitive examination held by the Union Public Service Commission, (ii) substantive appointment of persons included in the selective list promoted on the basis of a limited competitive examination held by the U.P.S.C. and (iii) Promotion on the basis of seniority.
 Rule 13 provided for recruitment to posts in the integrated Grades II and III of the General cadre, and that temporary vacancies shall be filled by appointment of persons included in the select list. Rule 21 laid down a general provision for fixing of seniority, while sub-rule (4) thereof, provided that persons promoted or recruited on the basis of an earlier selection or recruitment, shall be senior to those promoted or recruited on the basis of an earlier 432 selection or recruitment, shall be senior to those promoted or recruited on the basis of a subsequent selection or recruitment. Rule 22 to 24 provided for seniority inter-se of direct recruits, and seniority inter-se of officers promoted to a grade on the recommendations of a departmental promotion committee. Rule 25 provided for seniority inter-se of the officers appointed to a grade from different sources.
 By a notification dated February 12, 1975, Rule 13 was amended to provide that recruitment to the three different sources of integrated Grades II and III to be: (i) 1/6th of the substantive vacancies to be filled in by direct recruitment, (ii) 33 1/3 % of the remaining 5/6 of the vacancies to be filled on the basis of results of the limited competitive examination, and (iii) the remaining vacancies to be filled in by promotion on the basis of seniority.
 The petitioners in the Writ Petitions were selected by the Union Public Service Commission according to the merits obtained at the examination of Assistants conducted for the purpose for appointment to the post, and allocated to the Ministry of External Affairs. After the initial constitution of the service in 1956, they were offered an option whether they would like to join the I.F.S. Branch 'B' in grade IV.
 They opted and were inducted into the service Later they were promoted between 1976 and 1979 from grade IV to the integrated grades II and III . The Government of India published a seniority list of the integrated grades II and III as on June 25, 1979 and before objections taken by the petitioners to the seniority list were dealt with, another seniority list was published on June 30 1983.
 The petitioners assailed the aforesaid seniority lists as violative of the constitutionally guaranteed equality of opportunity in the matter of public service in as much as direct recruits who came into the service long after the departmental promotees were regularly promoted have been assigned seniority over the earlier promoted departmental promotees. It was further contended, that the seniority list of June 30, 1983 was objectionable as it leaves blank spaces for future recruits either as direct recruits or by limited departmental examination and who are yet to come into the service to be placed over promotees like the petitioners who were already in service for a long time. The seniority lists having been drawn up on the principles of quota-rota and on the facts of the case and the relevant rules were violative of Articles 14 and 16.
 The writ petitions were contested by the Central Governments contending that the seniority lists were drawn up in accordance with the principles governing seniority in the grade as per Rule 25, and that were recruitment to a service was from more than one source and each source was assigned a quota of vacancies, the seniority was to be determined according to rota keeping in view the available vacancies to each source While departmental promotion is made after the Departmental Promotion Committee makes recommendations recruitment through examination is time consuming there is a time gap between publication of results and joining of candidates and it is therefore not practically possible to strictly adhere to the quota in any particular year. The Administration 433 Overcame this difficulty by rotation of vacancies ensuring that over a period of ; time the required quota was fully met. Blank spaces were left in the seniority list for giving seniority to persons who have still not joined service and are likely to join at an uncertain date. This process would not push down the seniority of the petitioners as they would occupy the same serial No. in the seniority list.
 When the Writ Petitions were being heard, Respondent No. 26 appeared and contested the claim of the petitioners contending that all Assistants in Grade IV who put in the required number of years of service were eligible for participating in the limited departmental examination, promotions based on the result of such an examination would therefore not be violative of Art. 14 Delay in holding of the examination cannot work to the disadvantage of those who had taken the examination and qualified for promotion and therefore they should be accommodated in the vacancies which had come into existence and where available for the quota from the date the vacancies came into existence. The two seniority lists were consequently valid and in consonance with the statutory rules.
 Allowing the Writ Petitions, ^ 
 HELD: (1) The impugned seniority lists challenged by the petitioners have been drawn up in violation of the provisions of Arts. 14 and 16 of the Constitution and therefore they are quashed. The first respondent is directed to draw up fresh seniority list. All promotions granted since the filing of the petitions must be readjusted. [460B- C] In the instant case, direct recruitment had not been made for years. Limited competitive examination had also not been held for years. Promotions from the select list had been presumably in excess of the quota but the promotees were appointed to substantive vacancies in the service and had been holding the posts as in the case of the petitioners for over 6 to 8 years. The promotions were not styled as temporary, adhoc or stop gap. The impugned seniority lists were drawn up by rotating vacancies for each source, and if no recruitment was made from that source in a given year, the place in the list available to that source was kept open and a later recruit at any distance of time from that source would be assigned that place over persons who were already recruited from other sources and would be working in substantive vacancies. The direct recruit thus scores a march over a promotee. The seniority list is consequently violative of Articles 14 and 16 and therefore deserves to be quashed. [453E; C-D] (2) Once the promotees were promoted regularly to substantive vacancies even if temporary unless there was a chance of their demotion to the lower cadre, there continuous officiation confers on them an advantage of being senior to the later recruits under Rule 21 (4). If by the enormous departure or by the power to relax, the quota rule was not adhered to, the rota rule 434 for inter-se seniority as prescribed in Rule 25(i)(ii) cannot be given effect, In the absence of any other valid principle of seniority it is well established that continuous officiation in the cadre, grade or service will provide a valid principle of seniority. The seniority lists having not been prepared on this principle are liable to be quashed and set aside. [459G-H; 460A] (3) Where recruitment to a service or a cadre is from more than one source, the controlling authority can prescribe quota for each source. where the quota is prescribed, a rule of seniority by rotating the vacancies can be a valid rule for seniority. However if the rule of seniority is inextricably inter twined with the quota rule and there is enormous deviation from the quota rule, it would be unjust, inequitous and unfair to give effect to the rota rule.

 (4) What is known in service Jurisprudence as seniority according to continuous officiation in the cadre from the grade has been statutorily recognised in Rule 21(4). This is in tune with fairplay and justice and ensures equality as mandated by Art. 16. [454E] (5) A block of recruits in a given year coming from three independent sources may be integrated inter-se according to quota and rota. The block in a subsequent year would be always junior to the bloc of recruits in the earlier years. This is how Rules 21(4) and 25(i) (ii) can be harmoniously read and it is unquestionable that they operate in two different situations and both have to be given effect to. [455A-B] (6) Rule 29(A) confers power to relax any of the provisions of the 1964 Rules and this also comprehends Rule 13(1) which prescribes quota. When the power to relax any of the provisions is exercised, the Controlling Authority must be of the opinion that it is necessary of expedient so to do for reasons to be recorded in writing. Failure to record reasons will not invalidate the exercise of power. Once the power to relax a mandatory rule exists and action in derogation of the rule has been repeatedly taken year after year, it would be a permissible inference that the action was taken in relaxation of the rule for which the power exists.
