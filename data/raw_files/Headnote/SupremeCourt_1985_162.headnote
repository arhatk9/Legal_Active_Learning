 Under section 133-A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 the State Government may for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of the Act establish a motor vehicles department and appoint as officers thereof such as it thinks fit. Under Rule 10:2 of the Punjab Motor Vehicles Rules, 1940 (as in force in the State of Haryana) as it stood prior to March 16, 1973, under class II, the State Government had appointed and empowered (a) Secretaries, Regional Transport Authorities; (b) Extra Assistant Transport Controller (Operation); and (c) Extra Assistant Transport Controller (Traffic) with police powers exercisable by Deputy Superintendent of Police under the Act. There are several powers, like in sections 129. 129-A of the Act, which a Police Officer may exercise under the Act and the rules made thereunder against persons who are carrying on the business of providing motor transport facilities.
 The appellant in the Civil Appeal and the petitioners in the Writ Petitions carry on their business of motor transport in the State of Haryana. All the motor vehicles operators are required to comply with the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder. Non-compliance with many of those provisions would result in prosecution and those who are found guilty are liable to be punished. The Haryana Roadways is a department of the State of Haryana. It also carries on the business of providing passenger transport facilities in competition with the appellant and the petitioners herein. It owns a fleet of motor vehicles for the purpose of its business. The Haryana Roadways 331 is also subject to the various provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder. The General Manager of Haryana Roadways is principally responsible for the proper administration of the Haryana Roadways.
 By a notification dated March 16, 1973 called the Punjab Motor Vehicles (Haryana First Amendment) Act Rules, 1973, the General Manager Haryana Roadways was conferred with the powers exercisable by a Deputy Superintendent of Police by virtue of the addition of clause (d) in Rule 10:2 of the Punjab Motor Vehicles Rules, 1940.
 The appellant in C.A. No. 2890/85 filed a writ petition No. 1770/78 on the file of the Punjab and Haryana High Court challenging the said conferral of power upon the General Manager, which was dismissed in limine and has come in appeal by way of Special Leave. The writ petitioners under Article 32 also contend: (i) the appointment of the General Manager, Haryana Roadways, who is himself responsible for the proper management of the activities of the Haryana Roadways and its prosperity and profitability and who is carrying on business in competition with other private operators as an officer who can exercise the powers of the Deputy Superintendent of Police under the Act is violative under Article 19 (1)(g) of the Constitution and it is otherwise contrary to the object and spirit of the Act; and (ii) that the General Manager, Haryana Roadways would not be able to discharge his functions satisfactorily in the interests of the general public since as being himself under a duty to comply with the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder in respect of the motor vehicles of the Haryana Roadways cannot be expected to discharge the functions of checking, inspection, search and seizure regarding the motor vehicles belonging to the Haryana Roadways and to take appropriate steps to prosecute the officers of his own department wo are not complying with the provisions of the Act.
 Allowing the appeal and the petitions, the Court ^ 
 HELD: 1.1. The Notification dated March 16, 1973 called the Punjab Motor Vehicles (Haryana First Amendment) Rules, 1973 by which the General Manager, Haryana Roadways was conferred the powers exercisable by a Deputy Superintendent of Police under the Act is invalid. [338 D-E] 
 1.2 The appointment of the General Manager, Haryana Roadways who is directly responsible for running its motor vehicles as one of the officers who can exercise the powers of a 332 Deputy Superintendent of Police under the Act imposes an unreasonable restriction on the fundamental right of the private motor vehicles operators and is therefore violative of Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. [337 G-H] 
 1.3 The powers of stopping the motor vehicles and the powers of inspection, search, seizure and detention exercised under the Act are serious restrictions on the fundamental right of the operators of motor vehicles guaranteed under Article 19(1) (g) of the Constitution.
 These powers can be considered as reasonable restrictions only when they are exercised properly in the interests of the general public. They should be reasonable both from the substantive as well as the procedural standpoint. Such powers should, therefore be entrusted to a person who is expected to exercise them fairly and without bias. [337 A-B] The General Manager of Haryana Roadways who is a rival in business to the private operators of motor vehicles in the State and is intimately connected with the running of motor vehicles cannot be expected to discharge his duties in a fair and reasonable manner. An unobstructed operation of the motor vehicles by private owners operating along the same route or routes would naturally affect the earnings of the Haryana Roadways. Therefore, there is every likelihood of his being over-zealous in discharging his duties of stopping a vehicle and in searching, seizing and detaining motor vehicles belonging to others and at the same time excessively lenient in the case of vehicles belonging to his own department. If in discharging his duties in the case of vehicles belonging to others he fails to give due regard to the interests of the owners thereof he would be violating their fundamental right to carry on business in a reasonable way. If he is too lenient in inspecting the vehicles belonging to his own department, the interests of the travelling public at large would be in peril. In both the cases there is a conflict between his duty on the one hand and his interest on the other. Moreover administration must be rooted in confidence and that confidence is destroyed when people begin to think that the officer concerned is biased. This is not a case which is governed by the rule of necessity. As It is, there are many other officers who are entrusted with the powers of the police officers under the Act. And, therefore, there is no necessity to appoint the General Manager of Haryana Roadways also to exercise the said powers. Further the appointment is not in the interests of the general public since large number of motor vehicles owned by the Haryana Roadways would not be subject to inspection and checking 333 by an independent agency. The legislature could not have intended while enacting section 133-A of the Act that a person who was himself directly responsible for the proper running of the motor vehicles according to law could be appointed as the inspecting and investigating officer by the State Government for the purpose of enforcing the Act.
