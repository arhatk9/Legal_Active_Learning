 The Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission (in short PSC) Invited applications for vacancies in the cadre of Deputy Executive Engineers in different services, to be filled by direct recruitment. Pursuant to the said advertisement both graduates and post graduates applied, for, the posts and were subjected to a written test and those who qualifying marks, were called for oral test/interview.
 The PSC on an Interpretation of Rule 4 of the A.P. Engineers Service Rules and following the decision of the High Court of A.P. in Writ petition No. 2568 of 1982 decided by Wagner, J. on March 14, 1986 treated the Post Graduates as a class and gave them preferential treatment by selecting the post-graduates first who secured more than the qualifying marks in the open category and since sufficient number of post-graduates were available, no graduate was selected. In the case of reserved categories also post-graduates to the extent they were available were selected and in the case of non-availability of post-graduates, graduates were selected for appointment to the posts in question.
 The validity of the recruitment and the procedure followed by the A.P.P.S.C. were challenged before the Andhra Pradesh Administrative Tribunal. The Tribunal upon hearing the application, took a view contrary to the one taken by the learned single Judge of the High Court in W.P. No. 2568 of 1982 and quashed the select list.
 In appeal to this court, 
HELD: 1.01. Rule 4 prescribes the qualification for appointment to certain posts including the post of Deputy Executive Engineer by direct recruitment, promotion or transfer. Note forms part of the said rule.
 436 Before the insertion of the second part to Note I by GOMs No.1 180 of 1983, the instructions contained in the Memo of 13th October, 1978 provided guidance in the matter of grant of preference to post-graduates for entry by promotion to the post of Deputy Executive Engineer. The subject clause of the memo undoubtedly refers to preference to be granted to post-graduates in the matter of promotion and the use of the expression 'seniority' in paragraph 2 thereof is undoubtedly indicative of the fact that its application was limited to laying down guidelines for application of the preference clause found in Note 1 to the rule in the matter of promotion. [446F-H] 1.02. 'There can be no question of arranging post- graduates according to seniority where they are seeking appointment by direct recruitment In that case the list would have to be prepared on the basis of merit and not seniority. Therefore, the use of the expression 'promotion' in the subject clause and the expression 'seniority' in paragraph 2 of the memo is indicative of the fact that the instructions concerned appointment by promotion. In paragraph 2 it is said that candidates with post-graduate qualification will be arranged in the order of their seniority and they shall be considered first and only after such a list is considered, the case of ordinary graduates shall be considered and selection made on merit and ability.
 Paragraph 3 then says that the expression 'preference shall be given' used in Note 1 means that other things being equal, holders of post-graduate qualifications will be given preference and after that the claims of less qualified candidates would be considered for appointment. The use of the word after in both the paragraphs is significant and is indicative of the manner in which the preference clause is to be worked out. [447C-E] 1.03.It is indeed true that under paragraph 2 of the memo it was directed that 'the list of eligible candidates with post-graduation qualification shall be first considered.....
 and only after such a list is considered'; others will be considered, albeit on the basis of merit and ability. The language of this paragraph leaves no manner of doubt that the turn of ordinary graduates for consideration came only after the list of eligible post-graduates was settled. The order in which the cases of post-graduates and ordinary graduates will be considered is made clear in this paragraph. But paragraph 3 of the Memo says that the expression 'preference shall be given' occurring in Note 1 would mean that, other things e.g. passing of prescribed tests, maintaining merit, suitability, fitness, etc., being equal, 437 preference shall be given to holders of post-graduate qualifications. The latter part of this paragraph adds 'after giving the said preference', the claims of less qualified candidates would be considered. This would that after a comparative study is undertaken those post-graduates who are found entitled to preference would be first promoted and thereafter cases of less qualified candidates would be considered. [447H, 448A-C] 1.04. In the present case also the zone of consideration was narrowed by eliminating candidates who did not succeed In the qualifying test and out of those who succeeded in the qualifying test and secured the minimum marks after interview were considered and thereafter In the process of selection the preference rule was applied by first choosing the postgraduates and thereafter the graduates. We have already pointed out above that classification on the basis of higher educational qualification with a view to achieving improvement in administrative performance is not abhorrent to Articles 14/16 of the Constitution. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the view taken by the learned Single Judge of the High Court on a true interpretation of the relevant rule in the context of the historical background was a plausible view and should commend acceptance as it would advance the cause of efficiency in a highly technical service.
