 The National Power Transmission Corporation (NPTC) was incorporated on 23rd October, 1989. Governments of India issued instructions regarding transfer of assets and employees from other generating organisations to NPTC. The National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) also issued a circular in conformity with the Government's instructions.
 The respondent-association filed a writ petition in the Delhi High Court, challenging the instructions and the circular. Based on the under taking given by the Attorney General the Division Bench f the High Court passed an interim order directing that the NPTC should not recruit persons from any source other than NTPC and if it recruits employees from other Corporation, it should pay equal pay for equal work i.e. in case the employees recruited from other Corporation get higher emoluments doing the same nature of work then the employees recruited from NTPC should also be paid the same higher emoluments. NPTC filed an appeal in this court challenging the interim order on the ground that having regard to the scope of the writ petition and the relief sought, the High Court erred in passing the interim order.
 Allowing the appeal, this court, 235 
HELD : The terms and conditions of service of employees of National Thermal Power Corporation were protected in the instructions issued by the Government of India and the circular issued by the National Thermal Power Corporation as also in the undertaking given by the learned Attorney General. The employees of National Thermal Power Corporation on transfer-absorption were not to suffer any detriment as regards the terms and conditions of service enjoyed by them before their transfer-absorption. No irreparable injury was going to be caused to the employees of National Thermal Power Corporation if the impugned direction was not given. In fact the said direction militated against the observation made by Division Bench of the High Court. The High Court at the interlocutory stage should not have given the direction that if the employees of other Corporations other than National Thermal Power Corporation receive higher emoluments, the employees of National Thermal Power Corporation should also be entitled to the same. Accordingly, the direction given by the high court is set aside. [241G-H, 242A-C] State of Andhra Pradesh & Ors. v. G. Sreenivasa Rao & Ors., [1989] INSC 87; [1989] 2 SCC 290, referred to.
