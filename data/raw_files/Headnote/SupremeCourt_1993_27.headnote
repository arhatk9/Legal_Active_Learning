 The appellants, employees of the first respondent-Bank, who were initially in the employment of a Limited Bank, which ceased to exist with effect from 1.1.1960 and became a subsidiary bank in the wake of State Bank of India (Subsidiary Bank) Act, 1959, were made to retire before attaining the age of 58 years on different dates, but upon completing 30 years of actual service, in exercise of powers under Regulation 19(1) of the State Bank of Indore (Officers) Service Regulations, 1979. .The Writ Petitions flied by the appellants challenging their retirement on the basis of the Regulations were dismissed by the High Court.
 In the appeals before this Court on behalf of the appellants, it was contended that their retirement age of 58 years was statutorily protected under Section 11(1) of the Act as a 'tenure' and since there existed no provision in the Act for retiring an officer on completion of 30 years of 209 service, the Regulation providing so, was an exercise of excessive delegation of legislative powers, and was violative of Article 14 of the Constitution, that the Regulations which were the progeny of Section 63(1) of the Act, could in no event, be inconsistent with the Act and the Rules made thereunder, that since the date of superannuation was fixed at 58 years for employees/officers who could claim protection of Section 11, Regulation 19 providing another alternative for effecting retirement upon the completion of 30 years of service, even though 58 years had not been attained, subject to its occurring first, was an onslaught on that statutory protection, that on the plain language of Section 11 of the Act, the security of 'tenure' protected in the first part of the provision was not liable to change as the word 'tenure' was significantly missing in the later part whereunder change is postulated, and therefore, 'tenure' of service could in no event be altered by any change, revision or alteration by the corresponding new bank, that Regulation 19 could not apply in the case of the appellants as existing officers, and that when retirement age at 58 was the consistent policy for public employment, its curtailment by the alternative of 30 years service, if happening earlier, was discriminatory and violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.
 Dismissing the appeals, this Court, 
 HELD : 1.1. What is protected under Section 11 (1) of the State Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks) Act, 1959 is the right of the employee of the corresponding new bank to hold office or service therein on the same tenure, at the same remuneration and upon the same terms and conditions and with the same rights and privileges as to bonus, gratuity and other matters, as he would have held the same on the appointed day, if the undertaking of the existing bank had not been transferred to and vested, In the corresponding new bank. That state of affairs is to last unless and until the services of the employee In that bank are terminated or until his removal, or other terms and conditions of service are revised or altered by the corresponding new bank under, or in 'pursuance of any law, or in accordance with any provision which, for the time being, governs his service.
 [215C-D] 1.2. The legislature in enacting Section 11(1) of the Act cannot be attributed the fault of tautology to have used the word 'tenure' as explanatory of the expression 'terms and conditions of service, or Inclusive 210 of it. Even if it is assumed that there was total protection of fixed tenure offices or services, unalterable under the second part of the provision, fixation of age of superannuation cannot be said to fix a tenure of office or service. [215G-H, 216A] 1.3. In the instant case, the appellants have nowhere ever set up a case that they hold tenure posts or their services were tenurial, or have pleaded that they had any fixity of tenure of a specified duration on laid down In their contract of service. Rather, throughout they have claimed to have joined service in the lower rungs of the banking service and to have risen to the posts of officers by the time they were asked to retire. Therefore, providing for the date of retirement is not to fix a 'tenure' as retirement, as ordinary incidence of service. [215F] 1A. In service jurisprudence the word 'tenure' has acquired a legal sense or connotation which may mean a fixed term during which an office is held. [215E] 1.5. The purpose of the Act, as spelt out from the Preamble of the Act, is to provide for formation of subsidiary banks for the State Bank of India and for the Constitution, management and control of subsidiary banks so formed and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. Section 63 empowers the State Bank of India to frame Regulations for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of the Act. One such purpose is to lay down conditions and limitations subject to which the subsidiary banks may appoint officers, advisers and other employees and fix their remuneration and other terms and conditions of service. Co-relating the enabling provisions under Section 63 and Regulation 19 framed thereunder, the terms and conditions so laid thereunder would definitely go to alter or revise the conditions of service of the existing officers as contemplated in the second part of Section 11. The manner in which such power is exercised is nowhere arbitrary because the State Bank of India is hedged on the one side to seek approval of the Reserve Bank of India and the Act and the Rules made thereunder on the other, when making Regula- tions in respect of the subsidiary banks. The policy of providing a retirement rule such as one in Regulation 19, is reflective of a policy and It is uniform for all employees existing and joining in future, for all subsidiary banks uniformly. Conditions of service under Section 11 were protected till revised or altered in accordance with law.
 It cannot, therefore, be held 211 that Regulation 19 cannot apply in the case of appellants, as existing officers. [216C-F, B] 1.6. It Is not correct to say that the Regulations are ultra vires the Act, being exercise of excessive delegation.
 The power to frame Regulations State Bank of India, which has to work out the policy of retirement uniformally to sub- serve the interests of the subsidiary banks. The so called protection In Section 11 is not absolute but conditional to change by the same intendment of the legislature.The provision In the Regulation in question for maintaining the age of retirement of 58 years as before but in the same breath permitting retirement on the completion of 30 years of service, whichever occurs earlier, Is in keeping with the policy of reckoning a stated number of years of office attaining the crest, whereafter inevitably is the descent, justifying retirement In this context 30 years period of active service is not a small period for gainful employment, or an arbitrary exercise to withhold the right to hold an office beyond 30 years, having not attained 58 years of age.

 2. The bank nationalisation and creation of subsidiary banks of the nationalised banks have a history of their own.
 The employees of the two are rationally differentiated on the basis of policy. The employees of the subsidiary banks cannot claim equation with the employees of the nationalised banks to be retiring at the age of 58 years, on the basis that the employees of the nationalised banks are not retirable on completion of 30 years of service.
