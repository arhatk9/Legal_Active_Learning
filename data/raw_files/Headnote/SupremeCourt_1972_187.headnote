 The respondents are the owners of a stone quarry in Bombay.
 Under Regulation 3 of the Indian Metalliferrous Mines Regulations 1926, an owner, agent or manager of a mine is required to forward to the District Magistrate and to the Chief Inspector, annual returns in respect of the preceding year in the forms prescribed on or before the 21st January in each year. Under Section 66 of the Mines Act 1952, a person omitting to furnish the returns is liable to pay a fine which may extend to Rs. 1,000/-.
 The respondents failed to furnish to the Chief Inspector the annual returns for the year 1959, by the 21st January, 1960 even after warning from the Chief Inspector. A complaint, was filed in the Court of the Magistrate, Dhanbad, on April 12, 1961. Two questions were agitated before the trial Court, the High Court, and also before this Court. (1) That Dhanbad Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the complaint and (2) that the complaint was barred by limitation under s.
 79 of the Mines Act 1952, which provided that no Court shall take cognizance of ,in offence under the Act unless a complaint was made within six months from the date of the offence. The explanation to the section provided that if the offence in question was a continuing offence, the period of limitation shall be computed with reference to every part of the time during which the said offence continued.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) The failure to furnish, the annual returns by January 21, in the succeeding year, is undoubtedly an offence punishable under s. 66 of the Mines Act. A complaint has to be filed under s. 79, within 6 months from the date of the offence; but as regards the question whether the offence was covered by s. 79 or whether it was a continuing offence, covered by the Explanation thereto, it was held that a continuing offence is one which is susceptible of continuance and is distinguishable from the one which is committed once and for all. The distinction between the two kinds of offences is between an act or omission which constitutes an offence once and for all and an act or omission which continues, and therefore, constitutes a fresh offence every time or occasion on which it Continues. In the case of a continuing offence, there is thus the ingredient of continuance of the offence which is absent in the case of an offence which takes place. when an act or omission is committed once and for all.

Emperor v. Karsandoz, A.I.R. Bom. 326, referred to.
 (ii) Regulation 3 read with s. 66 of the Mines Act, makes failure to furnish annual returns for the preceding year by the 21st of January of the succeeding year, an offence.
 The language of Regulation 3 clearly ,indicates that a mine owner, or his agent, would be liable to penalty, if 1005 he fails to furnish the returns on or before January 21 of the succeeding year. The infringement, in the present case, therefore, occurs on January 21 of the relevant year and is complete on the owner failing to furnish the annual returns by that day. The Regulation does not lay down that the owner would be guilty of an offence if he continues to carry on the mine without furnishing the returns or that the offence continues if the requirement of Regulation 3 is not complied with. In other words, Regulation 3 does not render a continued disobedience or non-compliance of it by itself an offence. Therefore, the complaint was time barred 'as the offence in question fell within the substantive part of s. 79 of the Act and of under the Explanation attached to it and in view of the second question. The first question regarding jurisdiction required no answers. [1009C]
