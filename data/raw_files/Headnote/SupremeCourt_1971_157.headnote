 When the appellant came to know that transfer applications had been filed in respect of certain cases on his file he recorded orders on the order sheets of the cases making serious allegations against the District Magistrate before whom the transfer applications were pending to the effect that ,the latter was attempting to interfere with the course of justice in the proceedings connected with the cases. The Additional District Magistrate, who heard the transfer applications sent a report for initiation of proceedings against the appellant for having committed forgery in the order-sheets. On a complaint by the District Prosecutor the appellant was committed to the sessions to take trial under ss. 167, 466 and 471 Penal Code. 'The appellant filed applications questioning the legality of the trial on the :grounds that the mandatory pro-visions of ss. 195 and 476 of the Code ,of Criminal Procedure were not complied with.
 These were rejected by the Sessions Judge. Revisions to the High Court were also dismissed, In appeal to this Court it was contended : (i) the authority to file the complaint against the appellant was the Court to which the appellant was subordinate at the material time as is mandatory under s. 195(1)(b) and (c) and, therefore, cognizance could not be taken of the complaint filed by the District Prosecutor; and (ii) there was violation of the mandatory provisions of s.
 476 of the Code, inasmuch as the complaint was not filed by ,the Additional District Magistrate.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD:(i) The High Court has, after analysis and very elaborate ,consideration, come to the conclusion that the charge framed under s. 167 of the Penal Code is justified.
 Therefore, the contention that with a view 'to evading the bar of cl. (b) of s. 195(1) the prosecution adopted the device of not charging the appellant under s. 193, Penal Code, cannot be accepted. As the charge has been framed under s. 167, the bar under s. 195(1)(b) and (c) has no application. [782F, G.] (ii)The offence under s. 466, Penal Code, is not covered by cls. (b) ,or (c) of s. 195(1). Therefore s. 195 does not operate as a bar in respect of this offence. [783A] (iii)Though s. 471 of the Code is taken in by cl. (c) of s. 195(1), for the clause to operate as a bar to taking cognizance of an offence under s. 471 it is essential that the offence must be alleged to have been committed "by a party to any proceeding in any Court". Merely on the basis that the applications for transfer of certain cases pending before the appellant had been filed making allegations against the appellant will not make the 778 appellant a party to those proceedings. He was functioning as Magistrate and had no personnel interest in the outcome of the transfer applications. Therefore, cl. (c) of s.
 195(1) also does not bar the jurisdiction of the magistrate to take cognizance of the offence under s. 471 of the Code.
 [783B, G] (iv)Because s. 195(i) (b) or (c) does not apply to the case of the' appellant section 476 of the Code does not come into the picture. Even otherwise, the section does not apply for the reason that the order of the I Additional District Magistrate clearly shows that all the findings recorded' against the appellant were only reasons for transferring the cases from the file of the appellant; the Additional District Magistrate himself had not taken any action as contemplated under s. 476 of the Code.
