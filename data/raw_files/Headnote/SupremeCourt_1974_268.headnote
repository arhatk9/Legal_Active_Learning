 The appellant firm sued for amounts as due to indemnify it under S. 222 of the Contract Act, on the strength of payments said to have been made by the firm to third parties on behalf of the respondents who were alleged to have directed the appellant to enter into 'Badla' transactions for them. These transactions are contracts for speculation in rise and fall of price of groundnut and oil seeds purchased only notionally without any intention to actually deliver them to the purchasers. In such a transaction, the purchaser is not at all expected to make a demand for actual delivery of goods ostensibly sold.
 Confirming the judgment of the High Court, held that, having regard to the objects 'of the prohibition imposed by the Central Government on forward contracts on groundnut seeds and oil-seeds in the interest of general public, so that supply at reasonable rates of those essential commodities is not jeopardised; the absolute terms of the prohibition; the penalties imposed for its infringement; and the careful manner in which only those contracts which are for actual.
 delivery and supply to bona fide purchasers are excluded from the prohibition;, the contracts were tainted with unlawfulness of their object and are forbidden by law, and hence are struck by the provisions of s. 23 of the Contract Act. [19B-D; 20 D-E] (1) If an agreement is merely collateral to another or constitutes an aid facilitating the carrying out of the object of the other agreement which, though void, is not in itself prohibited within meaning of s. 23, it may be enforced as a collateral agreement. If, on the other hand, it is part of a mechanism meant to defeat what the law has actually prohibited, the courts will not countenance a claim based upon the agreement, because, it will be tainted with an illegality of the object sought to be achieved which is hit by the section. The object of an agreement cannot be said to be forbidden or unlawful merely because the agreement results in what is known as a 'void contract'. A void agreement when coupled with other facts, may become part of transaction which creates legal rights, but this is no so if the object is prohibited or 'mal in se'. [12D-G] (2) The question whether the parties through whom the appellant actually alleged carrying out the contracts set up between himself and defendants, could themselves be regarded as Principals or agents of the appellants, will be im- material if the objects of the contracts are found to be tained with the kind of illegality which is struck by s. 23 of the Contract Act. Again, the mere fact that the contracts were entered into at Kurnool in the State of Andhra Pradesh would also not make any difference in principle if the object of the contracts which were to be carried out at Bombay were of such a kind as to be hit by the section. [13A-C] (3) The contracts between the appellant and the respondents are not wagering contracts, though each Party knew that their object was to indulge in speculation. [10C-D] Bhagwandas Parasram v. Burjori Ruttomji Bomanji 45 I.A. 29, 33, referred to.
 (4) But, the forward contracts violated the provisions of two Orders issued under s. 2(2) of the Bombay Forward Contracts Control Act, 1947. [16A-B] 2L379Sup.CT/75 2 (5) Moreover, s. 17 of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946, kept alive the provisions of the Oil- seeds (Forward Contracts Prohibition) Order, 1943. The Central Act is enacted for the control of production, supply and distribution of essential commodities and covers food stuffs, Under s. 2(c) of the Act food stuffs include edible oil-seeds and oils, and s. 7(2) makes the contravention of any Order under s. 3, relating to food stuffs a crime and punishable with imprisonment. [16E; 17A-D] (6) The Central Government has issued a notification under s, 5 of the Oil-seeds (Forward Contracts Prohibition) Order but the two conditions imposed for excluding contracts relating the groundnuts are not satisfied in the ,present case, They are (a) the contracts must be in respect of specified qualities or types, and (b) must be for specific deliveries aid are not transferable to 3rd parties. The word 'and' cannot be read as 'or' and both conditions must be satisfied. The contracts, in the instant case, set up by the appellant, were not and could not have been for actual delivery because they were only 'Badla' transactions. If the contracts were not for genuine or actual delivery but only for speculation on differences in prices the condition for the exclusion of the contracts from the Purview of the control Order, which contemplates actually intended delivery,would not be satisfied. The contracts were, therefore, prohibited under the provisions of the Essential Supplies Act, 1946 read with Central Order of 1943, and hence the contracts were not merely void but illegal in the sense that their objects are forbidden. [18F-19B] (7) A claim for indemnification under s. 222, Contract Act, is only maintainable if the acts, which the agent is employed to do, are lawful. Agreements to commit criminal acts are expressly and specifically excluded by s. 224 from the scope of any right to an indemnity. The provisions of the Order of 1943 are applicable throughout India are not confined to forward contracts entered into or meant to be carried out in any particular part of India and their violation is a crime, The objects of the contracts set up by the appellants cannot be carried out by merely entering into them outside Bombay or engaging third parties as sub-agents or in any other capacity to execute them. [20C-D] (8) The High Court rightly relied on those decisions holding agreements ,collateral to prohibited contracts to be also unenforceable, because, the taint attaches to them which makes them also contrary to public policy. Such ;agreements fall within the class of cases mentioned in Gherulal Parakh v. Merhadeodas Maiya & Ors. [1959] INSC 28; [1959] (2) Suppl. S.C.R. 406, where harmful results of permitting the contracts, in terms of injury to the public at large, are evident and indisputable. [19G-H] ARGUMENTS:
 For the Appellants: (1) The only contested point which survives in the appeal is whether the plaintiffs acted lawfully when they-entered into contracts with the firms of P.W. 2 and P.W. 3 on behalf of the defendants.
 (2) In considering the above question it is important to notice that the ,firms of P.W. 2 and P.W. 3 were themselves the commission agents of the plaintiffs in these transactions. The findings of both the lower courts are (a) that the plaintiffs were the commission agents of the defendants for the said transaction; (b) that the plaintiffs acting as principals (i.e. without disclosing their position as agents of the defendants) employed the firms of P.W. 2 and P.W. 3 as commission agents to carry out the transactions and (c) the firms of P.W. 2 and P.W. 3 acting as principals entered into the transactions with the firms of P.W. 1.
 (3) These being the relevant facts, the question is whether the contracts between the plaintiffs on the one hand and firms of P.W. 2 and P.W. 3 on the other were unlawful by virtue of (a) Bombay Act III of 1865, (b) the Bombay Forward Contracts Control Act. being Act LXIV of 1947 and (c) the Oil 'Seeds (Forward Contract Prohibition) Order, 1943.
 3 (4) The contracts between the plaintiffs and firms of P.W.
 2 and P.W. 3 were not unlawful under the 1865 Bombay Act for the following reasons :- (a) The plaintiffs did not enter into any agreements "by way of wager" (in the words of section _30 of the Contract Act) with the firms of P.W. 2 and P.W. 3 as they had nothing to gain or to lose by the _rise or fall of the forward market rates of oil seeds. A wagering contract requires that the gain of one party to the contract should be the loss of the other party thereto (vide 45 I-A, 29; 39 Bom.
 L.R. 1083; 1879 Q.B.D. 685; Pollock & Mulla's Indian Contract and Specific Relief Acts, page 313; Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th Edition Vol. 1 para 809). By the same test, the principal contracts between the firms of P.W. 2-3 and the firm of P.W. I were also not wagering contracts. The fact is that the defendants indulged in speculative transactions through the agency of the plaintiffs, but it is well settled that speculative transactions do not by themselves result in wagering agreements. The courts below erroneously held, merely from the fact that no deliveries were given or taken, that the transactions were by way of wager. The lower courts failed to realise that when one party to the transactions (defendants in this case) is interested in speculating on market fluctuations, he cancels One contract by a cross contract, with the result that no delivery takes place, although both the contracts are for delivery, Since there were no wagers in the present case, the Bombay 1865 Act has no application.
 (b) The 1865 Bombay Act does not contain any punitive provision. It merely declares certain agreements to be void. Even supposing the agreements between the plaintiffs and the firms of P.W. 2-3 were for wager (which they clearly were not), they would merely be void and not unlawful by virtue of the Bombay Act. Even in that case_ the plaintiffs as agents are entitled to recover their dues from the defendants, as held by this Hon'ble Court in Gherumal Parakh's case [1959] Supp. 2 S.C.R. 406. Obviously the Bombay 1865 Act was not operative in the region where the contracts between the Plaintiffs and defendants took place, (5) The contracts between the plaintiffs and the firms of P.W. 2-3 were not unlawful under the Bombay Forward Contracts Control Act No. LXIV of 1947 for the following reasons :- (a) Even the principal contracts between the firms of P.W.
 2-3 and the firm of P.W. 1 were not unlawful under s. 8 of the Act. The contracts did not violate clause 1(a) of s. 8 of the said Act, because the defendants failed to point out any bye-law of the Bombay Oil Seeds Exchange Ltd. which ren- dered agreements made in contravention thereof unlawful (vide 59 Bom, L.R. 4). The agreement also did not contravene clause 1 (b) of s. 8 since one of contracting parties, namely the firm of P.W. 1 was a member of the Bombay Oil Seeds Exchange Ltd. (vide page 32 line 21 and page 55 line 26.) (b) In any case, the transactions between the plaintiffs on the one hand, and the firms of P.W. 2-3 on the other, were as between principal and agent, and since these transactions did not Come under the definition of forward contracts, they were not affected by the provisions of the '1947 Bombay Act.
 (6) The transactions between the plaintiffs and the firms of P.W. 2-3 were not unlawful under the Oil Seeds (Forward Contract Prohibition) Order. 1943 read with the Notification issued thereunder (page 285 of the paper book) for the following reasons :- (a) The contracts between the firms of P.W. 2-3 and the firm of P.W. 1 Were "forward contracts" as defined by clause 2(ii) of the 1943 Order, but not the agency contracts between the plaintiffs on the one band and the firm, of P.W.
 2-3 on the other. These latter contracts were therefore not affected by the 1943 order and were not unlawful. As deposed to by the plaintiffs' Partner P.W. 4 (Paper book page 83 line 11), the plaintiffs had never authorised the firms of P.W. 2-3 to enter with any illegal contracts. The Badla transactions, which the plaintiffs had authorised the firms of P.W. 2-3 to 4 enter into, could have been brought about by P.W. 2-3 without infringing the conditions laid down in the Notifications issued under the 1943 Order. The two conditions in the Notifications were that the contracts should be for specific delivery and that the deliveries thereunder should not be transferable to third parties.
 There is nothing in the nature of Badla transactions which requires that they should not be for specific delivery or that the deliveries thereunder should be transferable.
 Since it was open to the firms of P.W. 2-3 to carry out the instructions of the plaintiffs in a lawful manner, the act of the plaintiffs in entering into the contracts with the firms of P.W. 2-3 was not an "unlawful Act" within the meaning of s. 222 of the Contract Act and the plaintiffs are therefore entitled to be indemnified by the defendants.
 (b) The High Court was, with respect, wrong in differing from the trial court which held that the contracts between the firms of P.W. 2-3 and the firm of P.W. I were for specific delivery. In the case of Badla transactions, the mere fact that no deliveries actually take place should not lead to the inference that the contracts were not for specific delivery. Both the cross contracts in Badla transactions are for specific delivery, but no delivery takes Place because the later contract cancels the effect of the earlier one. This is clear from the evidence of P.W. 2 from 'pages 39 to 43, were the witness gives details of specific delivery contracts for the purchase of 400 tons of groundnut of a particular date (vaida), subsequent cross contracts for the sale of 400 tons of groundnut of the same vaida, and contemporaneous contracts for the purchase of 400 tons of groundnut of the next vaida. Each of these contracts were for specific delivery. On the' other question of transferability, however, both the courts below, have held that the deliveries under these contracts, were not made nontransferable. To that extent the contracts between the firms of P.W. 2-3 and P.W. 1 may come under the mischief of the 1943 Order. It was, however, open to the firms of P.W. 2-3 to carry out the instructions of the plaintiffs in a lawful manner.
 (c) Having entered into lawful contracts with the firms of P.W. 2 and 3, the plaintiffs were justified in paying the losses incurred in these transactions. It was no part of the duty of the plaintiffs to go to Bombay and find out whether there was any lacuna in the contracts between the firms of P.W. 2-3 and the firm of P.W. 1 so as to enable the plaintiffs to avoid paying the dues of the firms of P.W. 2-3 (vide Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th Edn. Vol. 1 paras 808 and 809; also s. 223 Contract Act.) (d) S. 224 of the Contract Act has no application to the facts of the present case, because the plaintiffs did not commit any criminal act in entering into contracts with the firms of P.W. 2-3 while carrying out the instructions of the defendants.
 (e) After the issue of the notifications on 31st May, 1943, the provisions of the 1943 Order were no more prohibitory.
 The provisions were only regulatory.
 For the Respondents 
1. Concurrent Findings of the Courts Below 1.1. There are concurrent findings of the High Court and the trial court, holding inter alia, (a) that the suit contracts between the plaintiffs and the defendants would defeat the provisions of law or are prohibited by law and would thus become unenforceable under s. 23 of the Indian Contract Act;
 (b) that the suit contracts are in the nature of wagering contracts and are not capable of enforcement;
 (c) hat the plaintiffs are not entitled to indemnification from the defendants under s. 222 of the Contract Act.
 5 
2. S. 23 of the Contract Act 2.1. The suit agreements fall within the ambit of s. 23 of the Contract Act in that they are (a) forbidden by law and (b) if permitted they would defeat the provisions of law.
 2.2. The suit contracts have as their 'object' or 'consideration' (mentioned in s. 23 of the Contract Act) the doing of something which is forbidden under the Central Order of 1943 or under the relevant Bombay Act of 1947.
 2.3. No question of extra-territoriality of the Bombay Acts would arise in view of the fact that although the Bombay Acts would apply only to Bombay State, nevertheless, the Agreements between the parties was with the sole object of breaking the said law. The,, terms 'object' 'consideration', 'forbidden by law' and 'defeat the provisions of any law', under s. 23 of the Contract Act on a true and proper construction operate in respect of any law and there is no requirement in the said section that such a law must be enforced at the place where such an agreement to break the said law was entered into. It is enough to attract the provisions of s. 23 that the Agreement is entered into with the object of defeating a law and it is not an additional requirement that such law which is sought to be defeated should be in force at the spot or the place where the agreement is entered into. If the contrary interpretation urged by the plaintiffs is accepted, it would lead to a perpetuation of a device to defeat the provisions of law. To take an instance, supposing there is a law of prohibition of intoxicating liquor in force in Delhi, and if two people want to enter into an agreement to break that law against manufacturing and selling such liquor and make the agreement enforceable, all that they need do is to step across the border into Haryana little beyond Palam Airport, enter into an agreement and cross back to Delhi and still make an agreement enforceable in the Haryana Courts. Such an interpretation would not be in consonance with the tenor of s. 23 of the Contract Act.
 2.4. Even if the suit agreement between the plaintiffs and defendants were independent agreements, they would be hit by s. 23. As a matter of fact, the said agreement between the plaintiffs and P.Ws. 2, 3 and 4, in Bombay and only in that sense have been termed collateral and such 'collateral' agreements would equally come within the ambit of s. 23.
 2.5. The illegality of the agreement would also arise by being devoid of any consideration on law since P.W. 4 was under no lawful obligation to Pay the moneys to P.W. 2 and 3 in respect of the said agreement nor were P.W. 2 and 3 under a legal obligation to pay moneys to P.W. 1.
 3. Forward Contract Prohibited by law, :
 3.1. The suit transancts, as concurrently held by the Courts below, are forward contracts, prohibited by the Central Order of 1943 and the Bombay Act of 1947. Both the Courts below have also found that transacts are not exempted under the notifications of exemption since the transactions were admittedly of transferable nature (as admitted by P.W. 1 himself).
 3.2. In finding the legality of the suit transants and the plea of exemption in respect of them. what is relevant is whether the transactions generally are transferable (as.
 admitted by P.W. 1) and not whether each transaction was in fact transferred or not.
 4. Indemnification under v. 222 of Contract Act:
 4.1. The suit agreements are in the nature of an employment of the plaintiffs by the defendants and of P.W. 2 and 3 by P.W. 1 and to do acts which are criminal according to the concerned laws in view of the fact that such offences render the concerned person liable to fine or improsnment. By rea- 6 sons of S. 222 of the Contract Act, the defendants are not liable in law to indemnify the plaintiffs against the consequences of the said criminal acts for violating the concerned laws.
 4.2. S. 222 of the Contract Act requires that the defendants should indemnify P.W. 4 only if the said P.W. 4 was bound to make payment for the illegal agreements to P.W.s. 2 and 3.
 P.W. 4 was not so bound and therefore the defendants were not liable to indemnify P.W. 4. Since the agreement of agency was null and void, unlawful and illegal and was further devoid of consideration, it cannot form a legal and valid basis for the indemnification claim.
 4.3. The agreement of agency in this case cannot be disassociated from the consideration or the object of the agreement within the meaning of S. 23 of the Contract Act in deciding whether the said agreement of agency is null and void, unlawful and illegal.
 4.4. The agreements for the sale and purchase of oil seeds in Bombay are in fact between the defendants (represented by P.W. 4) and P.Ws. 2 and 3. The transactions between P.Ws. 2 and 3 on the one hand and P.W. 1 on the other do not militate against the fact of the illegal agreements between P.W. 4 on one side and P.Ws. 2 and 3 on the other, acting towards each other as principals on either side. P.W. 4 paid P.Ws. 2 and 3 on the basis that P.Ws. 2 and 3 are the principals with whom he was dealing as a principal himself, that P.Ws. 2 and 3 and P.W. 4 himself were commission agents does not affect this fact. This fact of their having acted as principals is a finding on an issue given by the High Court and the trial court.
 4.5. If P.W. 2 and 3 were not the principal Parties to the illegal agreements P.W. 4 had no justification at all to pay them in respect of the said agreements and to claim indemnification from the defendants under S. 222.
 4.6. There is no implication of extra territorial jurisdiction in either the Bombay legislature or in the Bombay Courts involved in the plea of the defendants. The agreements between the defendants (acting through P.W. 4) and P.Ws. 2 and 3 (or even P.W. 4) are agreements to which the Bombay Law applies and the lawful enforceability of which agreement in the Bombay State must be established before P.W. 4 can call upon the defendants to indemnify him for payments made in the Bombay state in respect of the said agreements. The payments are even otherwise invalid under the laws relating to sale and purchase of oil seeds in India.
 5. Wagering Contracts :
 5.1. The four sets of agreements (a) between P.W. 4 and PW.
 2, (b) between P.W. 4 and P.W. 3. (c) between P.W. 2 and P.W. 1 and (d) between P.W. 3 and P.W. 1 for the purchase and sale of groundnut and castor seed were contracts as between principal and Principal and amounted to wagering contracts prohibited and rendered null and 'void, unlawful and illegal by Bombay Act III of 1865.
 5.2. The law in Bombay State relating to wagers and the law in India relating to prohibition of sale and purchase of oil seeds cannot be circumvented by the agreements referred to in paragraphs above being made between agents of principals and instead of principals themselves. Qui facit per alium facit per se. A person might not do by means of another what he is prohibited from doing himself.
 5.3. A wagering contract does not cease to be one by the intervention of commission agents. or by a principal or his agent entering into such a contract with another agent or that agent's principal.
 5.4. The decision in [1959] Supp. 2 S.C.R. 406 and [1954] INSC 63; [1955] 1 S.C.R. 439 do not apply to this case because firstly they do not deal with prohibited 7 forward contracts in Bombay or elsewhere and secondly they do not involve violation of the law of wagering contracts to the State of Bombay under Bombay Act III of 1965.
 5.5. It is to be further noticed that the suit transactions do not conform to the requirements of bye law 123 concerned because there were neither no contracts notes at all or in a few cases (in which there were contract notes) they were not in conformity with the prescribed forms.
 5.6. The duty of courts in Kurnool to prevent the circumvention and violation of Bombay law cannot be less than the duty of British courts to prevent circumvention and violation of foreign law when the foreign law is no repug- nant to British law and when the foreign country is a friendly country.
 6. 'Badla' Transactions :
 6.1. 'Badla' automatically involves two or more forward contracts.
