 The petitioners who were convicted by the Andhra Pradesh High Court for the offences u/ss. 148, 302, 302J 149 I.P.C., in an appeal by the state against their acquittal, surrendered themselves to curial custody as required under Order XXI of the Supreme Court Rules 1966, before preferring the statutory appeal u/s 2(c) of the Supreme Court (Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction) Act 28 of 1970 r/w S. 379 Crl. P. C. 1973. They were on bail at the trial and appellate stages and were also on parole after their surrender pursuant to the High Court Judgment.
 Allowing their bail petition the Court, 
HELD : 1. The issue of "Bail or Jail"-at the pretrial or post-conviction stage-although largely hinging on judicial discretion, is one of liberty, justice, public safety and burden of the public treasury, all of which insist that a developed jurisprudence of bail is integral to a socially sensitized judicial process. [372 G] 2.Personal liberty of an accused or convict is fundamental, suffering lawful eclipse only in terms of "procedure established by law". The last four words' of Art. 21 are the life of that human right. [373 A] 3.The significance and sweep of Art. 21 make the deprivation of liberty, ,ephemeral or enduring, a matter of grave concern and permissible only when the law authorising it is reasonable, even handed and geared to the goals of community good and State necessity spelt out in Art. 19.
 Reasonableness postulates intelligent care and predicates that deprivation of freedom by refusal of bail is not for punitive purpose but for the bifocal interests of justice to the individual involved and society affected. [376 D-E] 4.All deprivation of liberty is validated by social defense and individual correction along an anti criminal direction. Public justice is central to the whole of bail law fleeing justice must be forbidden but punitive harshness should be minimised. Restorative devices to redeem the man, even through community service, meditating drill, study classes or other resources should be innovated, and playing foul with public peace by tampering with evidence, intimidating witnesses or committing offences while on judicially sanctioned "free enterprise" should be provided against. No seeker of justice shall play confidence tricks on the court or community. Conditions may be hung around bail orders not to cripple but to protect. Such is the holistic jurisdiction and humanistic orientation invoked by the judicial discretion correlated to the values of our constitution.[376 H, 377 A] 5.The principal rule to guide release on bail should be to secure the presenceof the applicant who seeks to be liberated, to take judgment and serve sentence in the event of the court punishing him with imprisonment. In this perspective, relevance of considerations is regulated by their nexus with the likely absence of the applicant for fear of a severe sentence. [375 C-D] 6.The vital considerations are :-(a) The nature of charge, the nature of the evidence and, the punishment to which the party may be liable, if convicted, or conviction is confirmed. When the crime charged is of the highest 11-1114SCI/77 372 magnitude and the punishment of it assigned by law is of extreme severity, the court may reasonably presume, some evidence warranting that no amount of bail would secure the presence of the convict at the stage of judgment, should he be enlarged; (b) whether the cause of justice would be thwarted by him who seeks the benignant jurisdiction of the court to be freed for the time being (c) Antecedents of the man and socio-geographical circumstances; and whether the petitoner's record shows him to be a habitual offender; (d) when a person, charged with a grave offence has been acquitted at a stage, the intermediate acquittal has pertinence to a bail plea when the appeal before this court pends. The ground for denial of provisional release, becomes weaker when a fair finding of innocence has been recorded by one court; (e) Whether the accused's safety may be more in prison than in the vengeful village where feuds have provoked the violent offence and (f) the period in prison already spent and the prospect of delay in the appeal being heard and disposed of. [374 G-H. 375 D, E, H, 376 A, B, C,E, V, 377 B-H] 7.Courts should soberly size up Police exaggerations of prospective misconduct of the accused, if enlarged, lest danger of excesses and injustice creep subtly into the discretionary curial technique. Bad record and police prediction of criminal prospects to invalidate the bail plea are admissible in principle but shall not stampede the court into a complacement refusal. [377 D-E] 8.To answer the test of reasonableness, subject to the need for securing the presence of the bail applicant the court must also weigh the contrary factors viz. (i) the better chances which a man on bail has to prepare or present his case that are remanded in custody, (ii) promotion of public justice, (iii) the considerable public expense in keeping in custody where no danger of disappearance or disturbance can arise and (iv) the deplorable condition, verging on the inhuman of our sub-jails. [376 E-G] 9.In the instant case, in view of the circumstances that (a) the petitioners were free when on bail during the trial and free when on parole by the state, (b) they did not abuse the trust reposed by the court or the State during the said periods, (c) they were acquitted by the trial court (d) four other fellow accused were enlarged on bail (e) they have suffered imprisonment around a year and (f) a reasonable prediction of the time of the hearing of the appeal may take the court to a few years ahead, the court directed the petitioners to be enlarged on bail on terms.
