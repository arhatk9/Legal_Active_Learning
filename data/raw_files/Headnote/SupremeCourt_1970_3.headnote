 A notification stating that the respondent's lands were needed for prospecting coal, was issued under s. 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. No objection under s. 5A of the Act was made by the respondent. Thereafter the Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition and Development) Act, 1957, came into force. Under s. 28 of the 1957-Act, all notifications and objections made under the Land Acquisition Act were deemed to be notifications and objections under the 1957-Act.
 Section 7 of 1957-Act requires the issue of a notification before acquisition under s. 9(1) of that Act. In the present case, the Central Government acquired a certain area on behalf of the appellant under s. 9 of the 1957-Act, from the area notified under s. 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act without issuing the s. 7 notification. The respondent challenged the acquisition by a writ petition and the High Court allowed it. While the appeal against the judgment of the High Court was pending in this Court, the 1957-Act was amended by the Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition and Development) Amendment Act, 1969. The consequences of the amendments introduced by the Amendment Act are that if no objection had been preferred under s. 5A of the Land Acquisition Act within the period specified, then it shall be deemed that a notification under s. 7 of the Act 1957-Act has been issued; that no objection to the acquisition of the land under s. 8 of the 1957-Act has been preferred; and that the Government could therefore make the acquisition under s.
 9 of the 1957Act. Also, the effect of a decision of a court was removed as if the amended Act was in force at all material time.
 
HELD : Legislation making obligatory notifications fictional may not be proper, but since Parliament was competent to make such fictions, the acquisition could not be questioned.
