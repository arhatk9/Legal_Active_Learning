 By s. 378 of the Indian Penal Code: " Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession of any person without that person's consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to commit theft ".
 P and the appellant were cadets on training in the Indian Air Force Academy, jodhpur, but P had been discharged on the ground of misconduct, and on the day of the incident the appellant was due for a local flight in a Dakota as part of his training as a Navigator. With the help of P, who knew flying, he took off another type of aircraft, Harvard H.T.
 822, without authorisation, and on the same day they force- landed at a place in Pakistan. Some days later they contacted the authorities in the Indian High Commission and on their way to India they were arrested at jodhpur and prosecuted for the theft of the aircraft. It was contended for the appellant that as a cadet under training he was entitled to take an aircraft on flight and therefore there was an implied consent to the "moving" of the aircraft within the meaning of s. 378 of the Indian Penal Code, and consequently there could be no dishonest intention, much less such an intention at the time when the flight was started, so as to constitute theft. It was found that the purpose for which the flight was undertaken was to go to Pakistan with a view to seeking employment there.
 Held, that as the flight was unauthorised there could be no consent, and as it was unlawful at the outset, in the circumstances of the case, and the appellant obtained a temporary use of the aircraft for his own purposes and deprived the Government of its use, there was a dishonest intention, and consequently the flight constituted a theft of the aircraft.
 A temporary retention of property by a person wrongfully gaining thereby or a temporary keeping out of property from the person legally entitled thereto, may amount to theft under S. 378 of the-Indian Penal Code, and in this respect the offence differs from "larceny" in English Law which contemplates permanent gain or less.
