 Item 1 of Schedule 1 of the Bihar Essential Commodities Act- other than Foodgrains-Prices and Stocks (Display and Control) Order, 1967, refers to 'component parts and accessories of automobiles'. On the basis that there was a failure on the part of the firm of the respondents to display the price list and stock position of motor tyres in their shop, the respondents were prosecuted for the offence of contravention of cls. 3, 4, and 5 of the Order. The High Court in revision quashed the prosecution on the basis that the item did not refer to tyres and tubes of motor cars.
 After the judgment, an item was introduced in Schedule 11 of the Order relating to tyres and tubes of cars etc.
 Dismissing the appeal filed with a certificate of fitness under Art. 134(1)(c) of the Constitution, 
HELD : (1) Assuming from a broad point of view that tyres and tubes of motor cars may be considered to be covered by the expression component parts and accessories of automobiles" when construed in its widest import, a comparison of the scheduled items of the Order with the items in the various notifications issued by the State Government and the Central Government shows that it was not intended by the draftsman to extend the Order, as in force in May 1969, when the firm of the respondents was inspected, to cover tyres and tubes of motor cars. [941C-F] (2) According to the fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence which reflects fair play, a dealer must know with reasonable certainty and must have a fair warning as to what his obligation is, and what act of commission or omission on his part would constitute a criminal offence, Unless the dealers are in a position to know with certainty that 'tyres and tubes of motor cars' are included in the Schedule items, of which the price list and the stock position ought to be displayed in a conspicuous part of their business premises, they cannot be held guilty in a criminal court of an offence under the Essential Commodities Act for the violation of any such mandate. In the present case, the Order does not unambiguously specify 'tyres and tubes of motor cars' as a Scheduled item.[941F-H] (3) The word 'certify' in Art. 134(1)(c) is a strong word postulating the exercise of judicial discretion in determining if the question requiring decision by this Court involves a matter of principle or a substantial question of law of great general importance. Such certificate is not to be given as a matter of course on the mere ground that the impugned decision is considered to be erroneous. There must be exceptional or special circumstances like infringement of essential principles of justice, or some difficult question of law of great public or private importance. it is not to be granted so as to convert this Court into an ordinary court of fur- 12-L797Sup.CI/73 938 ther appeal. In the present case, after the issue of the Notification including 'tyres and tubes of motor cars' in the Schedule to the Order there is no doubt that the Order is comprehensive enough to take within its fold tyres and tubes of motorcars; and the effect of the present decision would be confined only to the prosecution of the respondents There is no material on record suggesting that the decision by this Court of the question posed is likely to govern any case other than the one in hand relating to the acquittal of the respondents.
