 On the success of a suit filed in 1951 by the appellant he obtained actual physical possession of a land in 1963 by evicting the respondents with police help. The respondents trespassed on the land after two weeks from 'their ejectment. and they were found making preparations for construction of bamboo structures. The respondents were convicted under s. 441/447 I.P.C. by the Magistrate, and the conviction was affirmed by the Sessions Judge. But the High Court, on a revision acquitted the respondents as it was of the view that the appellant was not in actual possession of the property and that the complainant must not only be in actual possession but also be present at the time of the trespass so as to bring the offence undeR s. 441/447 I.P.C.
 In appeal this Court, 
HELD :-The High Court was in error in holding that the appellant was not in actual possession of the property. The land in dispute was lying vacant after the appellant obtained possession and the actual possession must be of the appellant. Further the law does not Require that the intention must be to annoy a person who is actually present at the time of the trespass.
 On the facts of this case there could not be any doubt that the intention of the respondents was to annoy the appellant who was in possession of the case land. There could have been no hope on the part of the respondents that they would be able to stay in possession of the land. After twelve years of litigation the appellant was able to obtain Possession, and only after two weeks after that day the respondents chose to trespass and start construction. Any other dominant intention could not be found which prompted the trespass. [427C, F] Mathuri and OtherS v. State of Punjab, [1963] INSC 247; [1964] 5 S.C.R. 916;
