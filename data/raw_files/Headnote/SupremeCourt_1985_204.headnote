 Shakuntala and Srinivas have four sons Subhash, Laxman, Vinod and Ram Avtar and two daughters. They ordinarily live at Barot about 50 miles from Delhi alongwith their two daughters. Subhash and his wife Madhu (DW5), are school teachers at Delhi and have two minor children. Sometime in May or June, 1979 these brothers came to live in ground floor flat No. 9B of the Janata flats in Ashok Vihar area.
 They purchased the First Floor Flat No. 9D previously occupied by Deven Dass and his wife Ishwari 899 Devi (PW4) in 1980 and on their request Deven Dass moved over to Flat No. 28D in the same area in September October'80. On February 16, 1980 Laxman Kumar was married to Sudha, the deceased and they lived in one of the rooms in flat No. 9B. Sudha was in the family way and was expecting to deliver a child towards the end of the first week of December, 1980.
 A little after 9 p.m. on December 1, 1980, on hearing a lady's voice crying "Bachao Bachao" (Save O Save) from flat No. 9B, the neighbours like Jaspal Singh (PW1) Satish Chopra (PW2) and Ishwari Devi (PW4) ran to the flat and Tarsem Jain (PW5) who was near about also came there. PW1 saw Laxman standing at the entrance door and attempting to close it while Subhash was standing with his hand on the latch of the door which opened to the courtyard. PW1 and others who had collected there forced their way inside and saw Sudha in a standing position but aflame. They attempted to extinguish the fire first by pulling out the saree from the body of the lady, put a gunny bag lying nearby on the burning body and later wrapped her up with a blanket brought by PW 2 Satish Chopra. When, after extinguishing the fire, they brought Sudha to the room where Shakuntala mother-in-law was standing, Sudha made a statement to the effect that it was her mother-in-law who had set her fire after pouring kerosene on her body. Soon a taxi was brought and the respondents accused took Sudha for treatment to the Hindu Rao Hospital. While being shifted to the taxi, Sudha made another statement to the same effect as to the authorship of the crime. Again, when on the way they picked up Gayatri, one of the sisters of Sudha and PW3 and her husband, she repeated the allegation against her mother-in-law on seeing her sister PW3 in the taxi. At the suggestion of PW3 Sudha was taken to St. Stephen's hospital where Sudha was being looked after for her pre-maternity care. The witnesses on their own, believing that Sudha was being taken to Hindu Rao Hospital, went there and waited for some time but when they found that Sudha was not being brought there, they returned to their residences. However, soon after the distress cry for help, a telephone message to the police Control Room with telephone No. 100, that a lady had been set on fire was conveyed and on this First Information having been duly monitored to the mobile police van around the area in question, PW 17 was deputed to look into the matter.
 Learning that Sudha was shifted to the hospital, PW 17 reached the hospital straightway for investigation. At the hospital a written declaration is said to have been made which was proved and relied on by the defence. Sudha died in the early hours of December 2, 1980.
 900 After due investigation the respondents were prosecuted on a charge of murder. There is no eye witness to testify to the act of setting fire to Sudha which is the prosecution case, or to the factum that of Sudha's saree catching fire accidentally as alleged by the defence. At the trial, the prosecution has sought to rely upon the oral testimony of witnesses who ran to the spot soon after he ring the cries of deceased, the three statements made by her to the various witnesses implicating the accused persons as the perpetrators of the crime, the conduct of the accused persons as deposed to by the witnesses when the deceased clothes were aflame, the alleged torture of the deceased for some time preceding the occurrence over demand for cash and goods in kind, and other circumstances available on record and examined as many as 21 witnesses.
 According to the defence version the deceased, while trying to lit the kerosine stove for heating up milk for one of the children of Subhash who was feeling hungry had her saree lit up by the stove fire which led to the incident;
 that Laxman her husband was away as he had accompanied the deceased sister up to the bus stand, that Subhash and Shakuntala did take reasonable care to put out the fire. To prove this defence they examined PW1, the doctor at the hospital, DW2 (same as PW 18) Record Keeper of the hospital, DW 3 a neighbour, DW4 the taxi driver and DW5 wife of Subhash and also relied on certain documents.
 The trial Judge accepted the prosecution version, namely; (i) the authorship of the crime; (ii) the relationship of the deceased with Laxman and members of his family having become strained on account of demands for more dowry and therefore their decision to do away with her before the child was born; and (iii) the factum of failure on the part of the accused persons to take appropriate steps to save the deceased while the fire was put out by the neighbours PWs 1, 2, 4 and 5. Accepting the charges and convicting the respondents of murder, he was of the view that the appropriate punishment to be meted was death. He accordingly sentenced all the respondents to death and as required by law, referred the matter to the High Court of Delhi for confirmation of the death sentence. The respondents challenged their conviction by preferring an appeal.
 The reference and the appeal were taken up together for hearing by the High Court. The High Court differed from the trial Judge on almost every aspect of the testimony of the prosecution witnesses, excepting the presence of PWs 1, 2, & 5 and their role 901 in extinguishing the fire, accepted the defence version, and discharged the reference and allowed the appeal. The respondents were, therefore, acquitted. Hence the State appeal No. 93 of 1984 and the Indian Federation of Woman Lawyers appeal No. 94 of 1984.
 Giving the benefit of doubt to the accused Subhash and when maintaining the conviction of Shakuntala & Laxman for the offence of murder under section 302 I.P.C. recorded by the Sessions Judge, allowing the appeal in part by altering the sentence of death into one of life imprisonment, the Court, ^ 
 HELD: 1.1 The scope of an appeal against acquittal and the scope of the Supreme Court's jurisdiction to interfere in Such a matter are well settled. There is not difference between an appeal against conviction and an appeal against acquittal except that when dealing with an appeal against acquittal the Court keeps in view the position that the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused has been fortified by acquittal and if the view adopted by the High Court in a reasonable one and the conclusion reached by it had its grounds well set on the materials on record. [929 A- D] 
 1.2 Once evidence has been read and the Supreme Court has proceeded to review the entire material, there is indeed not limitation in law in exercise of the jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution for the matter of making a just decision. [929 D-E] 1.3 In the instant case, on the evidence it is clear:
 (i) that the relationship of the deceased with the members of the husbands' family had become strained and the had been subjected to physical as well as mental torture for some time before the incident; The physical torture was the outcome of indifference to her health and the mental torture was on account of demand of dowry; (ii) that the deceased had not lighted the kerosene stove that evening and her wearing apparel had not caught fire accidently but kerosene had been sprinkled on her clothes and she had been brought into the open space where fire was lit to her clothes; (iii) that he deceased died not as an outcome of an accidental fire but on account of a designed move on the part of the members of the family of the accused persons to put an end to her life; and (iv) that the husband and mother-in-law or the deceased are responsible for the killing of the deceased by setting her on fire and therefore committed the Offence of murder and are liable to be convicted for the offence punishable under section 302 I.P.C., while the brother-in- law Subhash is 902 entitled to the benefit of doubt, his case being on the border line.

 2.1 The cause of any person being found aflame with fire could always be either of the three alternatives, namely, (a) suicide/self immolation; (b) accidental fire;
 and (c) "being put on fire by someone". In the instant case:
 (i) the deceased having been burnt is not in dispute; (ii) the plea of suicide has not been advanced either by the prosecution or by the defence. Suicide as the reason of death has rightly not been pressed into service in as much the deceased, in spite of the fact that she had been suffering physically without any assistance at the advanced stage of her pregnancy, was getting prepared to play the role of mother; (iii) the defence plea of accidental fire has to be rejected by taking judicial notice of the facts (a) the kerosene stove was in the open space (b) there was a gas stove in the kitchen and the same was in order but there was no evidence why the gas stove was not used (c) around 9 p.m. of December it would be unbearably cold outside the house in Delhi. To work the kerosene stove would take sometime and if milk for the crying child was immediately necessary, the kerosene stove would not be the proper heating medium. On the other hand, the gas stove would have served the purpose better. Not much of gas was likely to be consumed for heating the milk, nor even for heating up the food for brother-in-law Subhash; (d) the deceased did not have any warm clothings on her person and had only a nylon saree. Being pregnant lady at an advanced stage she was expected to keep properly robed to avert getting ill from exposure to cold, and therefore, it is not likely that she would have ventured going out to operate the kerosene stove;
 (e) the deceased being in an advance stage of pregnancy would have found it difficult to squat on the floor itself;
 and (f) it would be natural human conduct for the deceased to have gone to the gas stove in preference to the kerosene stove. Once the explanation and the defence story of accidental fire has been discarded and there being no plea of suicide, the prosecution story that fire was set to the saree of the deceased is the only other way in which she must have been burnt. [909 B,E-F, 912 E,G-H, 913 A-D] 
 3. A dying declaration envoys almost a sacrosanct status as a piece of evidence as it comes from mouth of a person who is about to die and at that stage of life he is not likely to make a 903 false statement. Ordinarily a document as valuable as a dying declaration is supposed to be fool proof and is to incorporate the particulars which it is supposed to contain.
 Conviction cannot be based purely on oral dying declarations, despite earlier cases of conviction solely based thereon. However, oral dying declarations cannot be totally rejected and the name can be used as corroborative material. In the instant case, the alleged written dying declarations cannot be accepted because the explanation of PW 17, the police officer who recorded the dying declaration himself contrary to the Delhi Police rules as to why he was not looking for a Magistrate or a near relation but getting lt endorsed by the doctor as "attested the recorded statement and without indicating the time of the statement and without the signature of the deceased who was an educated person is unconvincing and not reliable: Equally no reliance can be made on the oral statements made by the deceased until corroborated with other evidence.

 4. In a suitable case of bride burning, death sentence may not be improper. However, in the instant case the Trial Judge had thought it proper to impose the punishment of death but the High Court acquitted all the accused. In the fact situation following the acquittal in the hands of-the High Court and the time lag of two years since the respondents were acquitted must be taken into consideration while imposing a proper punishment. In the instant case the Court awarded sentence of imprisonment for life for the accused. [931 A-C] OBSERVATION (It is the obligation of every Court to find out the truth and act according to law once the truth is discovered.
 In that search for truth obviously the Court has to function within the bounds set by law and act on the evidence placed before it. What happens outside the Court room when the Court is busy in its process of adjudication is indeed irrelevant and unless a proper cushion is provided to keep the proceedings within the court room dissociated from the heat generated outside the court room either through the news media or through flutter in the public mind, the cause of justice is bound to suffer. Mankind has shifted from the 904 state of nature towards a civilized society and it is no longer the physical power of a litigating individual or the might of the ruler nor even the opinion of the majority that takes away the liberty of a citizen by convicting him and making him suffer a sentence of imprisonment. Award of punishment following conviction at a trial in a system wedded to rule of law is the outcome of cool deliberation in the court room after adequate hearing to afforded to the parties, accusations are brought against the accused, the prosecutor is given an opportunity of supporting the charge and the accused is equally given an opportunity of meeting the accusations by establishing his innocence. It is the outcome of cool deliberations and the screening of the martial by the informed mint of the Judge that leads to determination of the lis. If the cushion is lost ant the Court room is allowed to vibrate with the heat generated outside it, the adjudicatory process suffers and the search for truth is stifled.)
