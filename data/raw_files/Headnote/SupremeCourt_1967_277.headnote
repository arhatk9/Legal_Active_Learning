 The respondent was a registered dealer. For the four quarters of 1958-59, it submitted returns of turnover from its inter-State sale transactions. Though the proceedings relate to levy of Central sales tax the tax was liable to be assessed and recovered in the present case, under the Madhya Bharat Sales Tax Act, 1950. The Assessing Authority issued a notice on September 17, 1962 under s. 8(2) of the Act, calling upon, the respondent to show cause why the transactions should not be taxed at the full rate. The respondent then filed a wait petition in the High Court contending that since the assessment was not completed with- in three years from the last day of the year of assessment as provided by s. 10 of the Act, the Authority had no power to continue the proceeding. The High Court allowed the petition.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : Where a dealer has not the prescribed return 0 is turnover at all, it would be a case of 'escaped assessment' and the proceeding for assessment must be commenced in respect of that, turnover within the period of three years prescribed by s. 10. Similarly, if a proceeding for assessment was completed and it was then found that any turnover had escaped assessment the proceeding for bringing to tax that turnover must be commenced within three years next succeeding, the yew to which the tax relates. But, where a return has been filed by the dealer under s. 7, as in the present case the proceeding for assessment commences and remains pending until it is determined by a final order of assessment. Therefore, a notice under a. 8 (2) is only a step in the proceeding for completing the assessment. Since the Act contains no provision that the proceeding shall be completed within any fixed period, the Assessing Authority is entitled to complete the proceeding without any restriction as to time and the bar of s. 10 is not attracted to the proceedings.
