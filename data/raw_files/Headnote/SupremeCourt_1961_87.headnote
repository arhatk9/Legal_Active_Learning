 The Assistant Custodian, Giridih, passed an order holding that the properties of the appellant were not evacuee properties. The Custodian, acting under S. 26(1) of the Administration of Evacuee Property Act, 1950, called for the records of the case, and after hearing the appellant dropped the proceedings. Subsequently, the Assistant Custodian, Head-quarters, Patna, filed an appeal before the Custodian under S. 24(1)(a) of the Act, against the order of the Assistant Custodian, Giridih. In appeal the Custodian declared the shares of the brothers of the appellant in the property to be evacuee property and referred the matter for separation of their shares. The appellant contended that no appeal lay under S. 24(1)(a) at the instance of the Assistant Custodian, Head-quarters.
 Held, that the appeal filed by the Assistant Custodian, Headquarters was incompetent. The Assistant Custodian, Headquarters, was not a 'person aggrieved' within the meaning of S. 24 of the Act, by the order of the Assistant Custodian, Giridih, and he could not prefer an appeal.
