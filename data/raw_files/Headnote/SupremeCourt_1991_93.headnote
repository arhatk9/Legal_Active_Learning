 The appellants in Civil Appeal No. 1643 of 1991, who were promoted as Executive Engineers on officiating basis in 1971-72 in the Haryana Service of Engineers Class I, P.W.D.
 (Public Health Branch) challenged before the High Court the promotion, by grant of relaxation of probation, and confirmation, as Executive Engineer, and subsequent promotion as Superintending Engineer, of the respondent, who was appointed as Assistant Executive Engineer, in the Class I Junior Scale in 1977, by direct recruitment. The High Court held that the appellants were not members of the service till they were appointed substantively to the cadre posts and, therefore, they had no locus standi to challenge the promotions. Hence the appeal.
 One of the appellants had also filed a Writ Petition before this Court challenging the respondent's promotion, and the State Government's power to grant relaxation and fixation of seniority.
 In the connected appeal the respondent, who was appointed by direct recruitment as Assistant Executive Engineer in the Class I Junior Scale in1965 filed a Writ Petition before the High Court challenging the confirmation of the appellants, who were promoted on officiating basis as Executive Engineers in the Senior Scale in 1962-64 and were confirmed in 1977-79. Quashing the confirmations of the appellants, the High Court held that promotions and confirmations of the appellants were in excess of their 50% quota and directed the State Government to refix their seniority afresh. Hence the appeal.
 On behalf of the appellants, it was contended that the moment the appellants were promoted, though officiating in regular vacancies as Executive Engineers they should be deemed to be members of the 222 service from the date of their initial officiating promotion, and their seniority determined retrospectively with effect from their due dates, counting their continuous length of service towards the seniority.
 Disposing of Civil Appeal No. 1643 of 1991 and Writ Petition No. 6311 of 1982 and dismissing Civil,l Appeal No.2316 of 1986, this Court, 
 HELD: 1. Under Rule 2(12)(a) only a direct recruit appointed to the cadre post, though on probation, is a member of the service from the date of appointment by operation of the main part of Rule 2(12) (a) read with Rule 2(1) to a cadre post within the meaning of Rule 2(3). The inclusive definition in Rule 2(2)(a) is applicable only to a `direct appointee' i.e., Asstt. Executive Engineer, under Rule 2(7) and put on probation, officiating in a ex-cadre post as contemplated in para 11 of Appendix `A' but having successfully completed his probation and awaits appointment to a cadre post. The promotee Class II officers are not direct recruits as per Rule 2(7) but are officiating as Executive Engineers. Hence they would not become members of the service, as declared by Rule 2(7), but become members of the service only after they are appointed substantively to a cadre post. [227H, 228A-B] 
 2.1 Sub-rule (2) of Rule 5 prescribed a quota for promotees at 50% and 50% to the direct recruits and by appointment by promotion to the cadre posts of Executive Engineers and above. The proviso is a built-in relaxation which empowers the State Government to promote Class II officers as Executive Engineers in excess of their 50% quota. The promotion of Class II officers in excess of 50% quota would be illegal or irregular in the teeth of the mandatory language of Rule 5(2). However, with a view to have smooth functioning of the administration this power of relaxation was given as a breathing facility. The moment a direct recruit is available, the promotee shall give place in him. [228C-D] 
 2.2 Appointment by promotion made an ex-cadre post or to any cadre post in an officiating capacity from the list prepared in accordance with procedure prescribed under Rule 8 would remain temporary till the promotee officer is confirmed in a cadre post, on satisfactory completion of probation, under Rule 11(4). [228F] 
 3.1 On a conjoint reading of all the relevant rules, a promotee holding a cadre post on an officiating basis as an Executive Engineer or above, within the quota, would be eligible to be considered for appointment in a substantive capacity to a cadre post. His seniority shall be 223 determined with effect from the date of his initial promotion to a cadre post, unless he is reverted or there is break in service or from the date of continuous officiation either in the ex-cadre or cadre post. [228G] 
 3.2 If a promotee Class II officer holds the cadre post within the quota of direct recruit, his period of service from the date of initial promotion till the date of availability of a cadre post is rendered for. A direct recruit, though promoted later steals a march over the promotee and gets the right to consideration and if found fit gets promotion within his 50% quota and thereby becomes senior to the officiating promotee. [229E] 
 3.3 Rule 2(12) is neither arbitrary nor creates invidious discrimination offending Articles 14 and 16, Direct recruits get seniority from the date of appointment as Asstt. Executive Engineer, it is unalterable. But promotee's seniority is variable by operation of Rules 8(11) 
 
 3.4 Since the respondent in Civil Appeal No.1643/91 is a direct recruit, his seniority as Executive Engineer, shall be with effect from the date of this initial appointment as Asstt. Executive Engineer, as contemplated by Rules 12(3) and (5). Similarly, seniority of the respondent in Civil Appeal No.2316/86 would be determined with effect from 1.1.1966. Their seniority is unalterable and they are eligible for promotion within 50% quota of cadre post as Executive Engineer, superintending Engineer and Chief Engineer respectively, counting the seniority with effect from their respective years of allotment. The appellants shall be considered for appointment to a substantive vacancy against a cadre post within their 50% quota of the promotees and their seniority would be counted next below the immediate senior promotee of the same year of junior most promotee of the preceding year of allotment either officiating or confirmed, in accordance with sub-rules (6) and (7) of Rule 12 and Rules 8(11) & 11(4). The year of allotment is accordingly, alterable. [227B-D] 
 3.5 The State Government should determine the cadre strength of the Service under the rules, consider the cases of the appellants and the two contesting respondents for promotion to the senior posts within their respective quota of 50% and make appointment, if found eligible and fit for promotion.
