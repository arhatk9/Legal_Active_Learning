 The assessee and his father filed separate returns for the year 1946-47 and the father also filed a return as Karta of the Hindu undivided family in which the income was declared as nil on the ground that the Hindu undivided family had ceased to exist. On March 15, 1951, the Income-tax Officer amalgamated the incomes of the assessee and his father and assessed them on the total income as the income of a Hindu undivided family but he did not make any assessment of the assessee as an individual. On appeal by the father the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, on March 20, 1953, held that there was no Hindu undivided family, set aside that assessment and directed a reassessment of the assessee and his father as individuals. Thereupon the Income-tax Officer, by order dated November 27, 1953, assessed the assessee as an individual.
 149 The assessce contended that the assessment not having been made within four years of the year 1946-47 i.e. by March 31, 1951, was barred by s. 34(3) of the Income-tax Act, 1922, The Appellate Tribunal held that the assessment was not barred, but, at the instance of the assessee, it referred to the High Court the question whether the assessment was validly made. The High Court answered the reference in favour of the assessee. The appellant contended that the assessment was within time as it was saved by the second proviso to s. 34(3) as amended by the Amending Act, 1953 and that the assessment was validated by s. 31 of the Amending Act, 1953.
 Held (per Das, Kapur and Sarkar, JJ., Hidayatullah and Dayal, JJ., dissenting) that the assessment not having been made within the time prescribed by s. 34(3), was barred.
 S. C. Prashar, Income-tax Officer v. Vasantsen Dwarkadas, [1964] Vol. 1 S. C. R. 29, relied on.
 Per Das and Kapur, JJ.-The second proviso to s. 34(3) which came into force on April 1, 1952, did not revive the power to assess which had become barred. Further, the appellant could not rely upon s. 31 of the Amending Act of 1953, as this question was not covered by the question referred to the High Court.
 Per Sarkar, J.-The second proviso to s. 34 (3) as amended in 1953, in so far as it affected persons other than assessees was void as violating Art. 14 of the Constitution. The proviso sought to save assessments in respect of assessees and those against whom assessments were made in consequence of orders made under s. 31 in the assessment cases of those assessees but not those of other tax evaders. The classification made was without any intelligible differentia having a rational connection with the object of the statute.
 Per Hidayatullah and Dayal, JJ.-The assessments were valid and were saved by the second proviso to s. 34(3) as amended in 1953 and by s. 31 of the Amending Act of'1953. The Court was bound to take notice of s. 31 of the Amending Act of 1953 even though it was not mentioned in the order of reference and in the judgment of the High Court Section 31 of the Amending Act was clearly applicable to the case as admittedly the proceedings commenced after September 8, 1948. Further the second proviso to s. 34(3) as amended in 1953 was not discriminatory and did not offend Art. 14 of the Constitution. A law relating to tax evasion cannot lay down a 150 uniform system applicable to all kinds of defaulters. The class which falls within this proviso for which there is no limit of time within which the assessment is to be made and the class which falls 'outside the proviso for which there is a limit of 4 years or 8 years, arc two distinct classes.
 The different treatment arises under different circumstances.
