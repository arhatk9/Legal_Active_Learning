 The respondents were manufacturers of utensils. They first prepared the alloys known as kansi & brass. These were then turned into, billets which were rolled into uncut circles by the agents of the respondents. The uncut circles were trimmed by the respondents and after further work on them were converted into utensils. Under item Z6A(2) of the First Schedule to the Central Excises and Salt Act 1 of 1944 excise duty was leviable inter alia on circles in, any form or size. The Union of India imposed excise duty at the stage when the uncut circles were prepared on the view that these were manufactured circles in any form or size within the meaning of the aforesaid item 26A. The respondents filed a suit to challenge the levy. They contended that (i) only trimmed circles and not uncut circles were circles within the meaning of the item and (ii) that the uncut circles had not undergone any such changes as could be held to amount to manufacture. The suit was decreed by the trial court and the decree was upheld by the first appellate court and the High Court. With special leave the Union of India appealed to this Court. Al owing the appeal 
HELD : (i) Item 26A clearly mentions the manufactures amongst others of circles in any from or size. The argument that only trimmed circles can be treated as circles and as finished product for purposes of' item 26A could not be accepted because that item itself envisages excise duty being levied on circles in any form or size. Uncut circles are certainly circles in any form or size. There is nothing in item 26A from which an inference can be drawn that the intention of the legislature was to tax trimmed circles and not uncut circles. Further no evidence had been led to show that in the commercial community these uncut circles are not known as circles. [939 B-G] (ii) In item 26A the legislature has laid down that excise duty shall be leviable on billets at a lower rate and on manufactures of circles at a higher rate. The provision itself makes it clear that the legislature was aware that billets are converted into circles. and it was decided that excise duty should be, leviable at all stages. When the legislature used the word manufacture' in connection with circles after having taken account of the fact that billets were already subjected to excise duty, it is obvious that the process, by which the billets were converted into circles was held by the legislature to amount to manufacture. The word. manufacture' is defined in s.2(f) of the Act as including any process incidental or ancillary- to the Completion of a manufactured product. The rolling of a billet into a circle is certainly a process in the course of completion of the manufactured product viz. circle-. [941 F-H] 937 So far as the respondents were concerned they started the process of manufacture of utensils by initially taking metals in crude form as raw materials. Two different kinds of materials in each case were mixed together to prepare alloys of kansi & brass. These alloys were then brought into the form of billets and later on the billets were rolled into circles. It could not be contended that the whole of this process could not be described as manufacture of circles. [942 C-D] Union of India. v. Delhi Cloth & General Mills, [1963] Supp.
