 The appellant in the appeal was convicted under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, and sentenced to life imprisonment by the High Court reversing the acquittal of the Trial Court.
 The Prosecution alleged that deceased was married to the son of the accused in the year 1972, and that there were frequent quarrels between the appellant-mother-in-law and the deceased-daughter-in-law. On one occasion, on account of a quarrel the daughter-in -law went away to her parents' house and on the assurance of her father-in-law that nothing would go wrong, the deceased was sent to the house of the accused. The accused, the deceased and her husband were all living in the same house. Even after the return, there used to be quarrels between the accused and the deceased. The accused developed a profound dislike for the deceased.
 On the night of 7th May,1977,at about midnight, the deceased was sleeping all alone in the `osri' of the House.
 The accused went there,poured kerosene on her person,and as the deceased got up, the accused lit the fire and left the `osri'. The deceased shouted for help and hearing her shouts, her husband and other collected there and the fire was extinguished. She was removed to the hospital in the cart. In the cart, she told some witnesses that her mother- in-law had burnt her. later on. she was 198 taken to the Government hospital in a taxi in a burnt condition. The police constable on duty informed the Taluka police station and the Head Constable made an entry in the police station diary, and another Head Constable went to the hospital and recorded the statement of the deceased in the early hours. In that statement, she stated that her mother- in-law had burnt her. The Head Constable wrote a `yadi' for a dying declaration to the Executive Magistrate who reached the hospital at about 7.00 A.M. on 18.5.1977, and recorded the dying declaration Ex.29. In this declaration also, the deceased stated that she was burnt by the accused. The Police sub-Inspector who took up the investigations, went to the scene of occurrence, made the panchnama of the scene of occurrence and recorded the statement of witnesses. He also recorded a statement of the deceased on 19.5.1977. In that also, the deceased stated that she was burnt by her mother-in-law. The sub-Inspector arrested the accused on 18.5.1977. The deceased succumbed to the injuries on 20.5.1977. On completing the necessary investigations, the accused was charge-sheeted and committed before the Session Judge.
 The Sessions Judge came to the conclusion that the deceased might have committed suicide, that it was also probable that someone else might have burnt her alive, because she had a grievance against her mother-in-law she implicated her in dying declaration. The dying declarations, hence could not be accepted having regard to this inherent infirmity. On these findings it was held that the prosecution had failed to prove that the deceased was burnt alive by the accused, and the accused was acquitted.
 The State appealed to the High Court, and a Division Bench considered the circumstances under which the dying declarations were recorded. It found that the dying declaration Ex.24 clearly showed as to how the occurrence had taken place. The second dying declaration Ex.29 was recorded in a question and answer form that there was no scope for tutoring the deceased for giving any statement which would involve the accused, and that at that time, the deceased was all right and she was in a position to give the dying declaration. The third dying declaration was made to the deceased's father who was a truthful witness and clearly establishes that there was no scope of parents tutoring the deceased in any way. The findings of the Trial Court it was held could not be accepted with reference to the various aspects like enmity between the mother-in-law and the deceased, the failure of the deceased to narrate the incident to her 199 husband, and was not prepared to believe that the deceased attempted to commit suicide and only for revenge involved the accused falsely. In the result, the order of acquittal was set aside, the accused was held guilty of the offence of murder and was convicted under Section 302 I.P.C and sentenced to imprisonment for life. It was, however, recommended that the Government consider the case favourably on the aspect of remission of sentence under Section 432 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
 In the appeal to this Court, it was contended on behalf of the appellant that the High Court was not justified in convicting the accused purely on the dying declarations which bristle with many contradictions and improve from stage to stage, and that having regard to the fact that the relationship between the mother-in-law and the daughter-in-law,was far from cordial the deceased had every motive to implicate the mother-in-law. It was also contended that the appellant was 58 years of age and that having spent more than a decade in jail,the appeal calls for interference on the ground of sentence.
 Dismissing the appeal, and upholding the conviction and sentence, this Court 
 HELD 1. The situation in which a man is on death bed is so solemn and serene when he is dying the grave position in which he is placed, is the reason in law to accept the veracity of his statement. It is for this reason the requirements of oath and cross-examination and dispensed with. Besides, should the dying declaration be excluded it will result in mis-carriage of justice because the victim being generally the only eye witness in a serious crime, the exclusion of the statement would leave the Court without a scrap of evidence. [205E] 
 2. Though a dying declaration is entitled to great weight, it is worthwhile to note that the accused has no power of cross-examination. Such a power is essential for eliciting the truth as an obligation of oath could be. This is the reason the Court also insists that the dying declaration should be of such a nature as to inspire full confidence of the Court in the correctness. [205F] 
 3. The Court has to be on guard that the statement of the deceased was not as a result of either tutoring or a product of imagination. The Court must be further satisfied that the deceased was in a fit state of mind 200 after a clear opportunity to observe and identify the assailants. [205G] 4.Once the Court is satisfied that the declaration was true and voluntary. undoubtedly, it can base its conviction without any further corroboration. It cannot be laid down as an absolute rule of law that the dying declaration cannot form the sole basis of conviction unless it is corroborated.
 The rule requiring corroboration is merely a rule of prudence. [205H] 
 5. If the plurality of dying declarations could be held to be truthworthy and reliable, they have to be accepted.
 [207E] In the instant case there four dying declarations. The fist dying declaration is Ex. 24 recorded by a Head Constable who wrote down the statement as deposed by the deceased. At that time, the deceased was conscious. The second dying declaration is Ex. 29 and was recorded by the Taluka Magistrate in question and answer form. There was no possibility of the deceased being tutored, prompted as to utter falsehood, so as to implicate the accused, It is also clear when she made the statement, she was in a fit mental condition. The third oral dying declaration was made by the deceased to her father who has impressed the High Court as a truthful witness. The fourth dying declaration Ex.34 recorded by the police sub-inspector has been rightly rejected by the High Court. The High Court was fully justified in accepting the dying declarations because they answer every test which is required to be accepted for such acceptance.
 [207E, H;208 D, E,G] In the instant case, the theory of suicide has been rightly rejected by the Court. A tender lass after only five years of married life with and affectionate husband and a young daughter to foster could not have resorted to that rash act merely because there were quarrels between her and her mother-in-law. In every house it is proverbial that such quarrels do take place. It is impossible to contend that the deceased was so much frustrated in life so as to commit suicide. [208H-209D] 
 6. It would be a traversity of justice if sympathy is shown when such a cruel act is committed. it is rather strange that the mother-in-law who herself is a woman should resort to killing another woman. It is hard to fathom as to why even the "mother" in her did not make her feel. It is tragic ,deep rancour should envelop her reason and drown her finer feelings. The 201 language of deterrance must speak in that it may be a conscious reminder to the society. Undue sympathy would be harmful to the cause of justice. It may even undermine the confidence in the efficacy of law. [209C-D] 
 7. Merely because the accused has spent more than a decade in jail is no justification to show any leniency.
