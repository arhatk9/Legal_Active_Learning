 The appellant was a firm consisting of six partners and the partnership was constituted under a document dated March 20, 1959, the business of the partnership having already commenced from October 1, 1958. The partnership was registered under the Indian Partnership Act 1932 on or about August 11, 1959. For the assessment year 1959-60 corresponding to the previous year ending March 31, 1959 the appellant filed an application for registration under s.
 26A of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922. The Income-tax Officer by his order dated September 28, 1960 declined to grant registration on the ground that there was no .
 relationship of partners inter se created under the partnership deed. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner upheld the order of the Income-tax Officer. The Tribunal held that there was agreement to share profits between partners and each of the partners could act as agent of all and therefore the requirements of partnership were fully satisfied. In the reference the High Court held that cls.
 8, 9 and 16 of the deed showed that the management as well as the control of business was entirely left in the hands of the first partner and that the other partners were on to serve under his directions and further they had no authority to ac cept any business except with the consent of the first partner nor could they raise any loan or pledge the firm's interest. On this reasoning the High Court came to the conclusion that there was no relationship of partners created under the partnership deed and as the essential element of agency was lacking the appellant was not eligible to be granted registration under s. 26A.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (i) The mere nomenclature given to a document is by itself not sufficient to hold that the document in question is one of partnership. Two essential conditions to be satisfied are (1).that there should be an agreement to share profits as well as. the losses of the business and (2) the business must he carried on by all or any of them acting for all within the meaning of the definition of partnership under s. 4 of the partnership Act. The fact that the exclusive power to control by agreement of the parties is vested in one partner or the further circumstance that only one partner can operate the bank account or borrow on behalf of the firm are not destructive of the theory of partnership provided the two essential conditions mentioned earlier are satisfied. [1050 F-G] (ii)Under the partnership deed in question the relationship which had been brought into existence between the six parties was a relationship of partners who had agreed to share profits and losses of the, business carried on by all or any of them acting for all and it satisfied the defini- tion of partnership under s. 4 of the Partnership Act.
 There was sharing 1035 of the profits or losses of the business by the partners in the ratio of the proportion mentioned in cl. 5. That clause read with other clauses clearly showed that the first condition namely of all persons agreeing to share profits or losses was satisfied. Even on the basis that the entire control or management of the business was vested in Party No. 1 and that parties 2 to 6 were working partners who had to work under his directions, from all the other %circumstances it was clear that the conduct of business by Party No. 1 was done by him acting for all the partners.
 There was no indication to the contrary in the partnership deed. Therefore even without anything more it was clear that as the partnership business was carried on by Party No.
 1 acting for all, the second condition of agency was also satisfied. This idea was further reinforced by cl. 16 of the deed which provided that the firm's affairs were to be carried on for mutual benefits. [1051 C-F] (iii)The High Court was wrong in holding that cl. 9 of the deed under which parties 2 to 6 had no right to raise loans for and on behalf of the firm or pledge the firm's interest was destructive of the element of partnership. No doubt under s. 18 of the Partnership Act a partner is the agent of the firm for the business of the firm. But that section itself clearly says, that it is subject to the provisions of the Act. It is open to the parties under s.
 11 to enter into an agreement regarding their mutual rights and duties as partners of the firm. Further if the ingredi- ents of partnership referred to in s. 4 of the Act are found to exist there is no escape from the conclusion that a partnership has come into existence. So far as the outside world was concerned, so long as parties 2 to 6 were held out as partners of the firm, as had been done under the partnership deed their acts would bind the partnership. The provision in cl. 9 was only an inter se arrangement entered into by the partners in and by which the working partners had agreed not to raise loans or pledge the firms interest.
 [1052 A-E] (iv)The provisions of s. 14 of the Act could not sustain the argument that cl. 9 of the deed negatived the theory of agency. Section 14 itself clearly shows that the provisions contained therein are subject to the contract between the parties. [1052 G-H] In the result, the appeal must be allowed.
