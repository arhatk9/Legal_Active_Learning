 Under the Central Provinces Excise Act, 1915 (which was the Act applicable to the State of Madhya Pradesh) the excise authorities granted licences for selling foreign liquor under a system of fee per bottle. From the year 1964-65 the State Government decided that licences for foreign liquor should be disposed of by public auction The appellants unsuccessfully challenged before the High Court the authority of the State to hold public auctions for grant of licences for foreign liquor. In 1964 the Act was amended, as a result of which the State could grant leases in respect of both country and foreign liquor. By a notification the State Government declared that it would grant foreign liquor licences by public auction. Similarly the impugned Act of Kerala State places restrictions on the manufacture. sale, import and export of liquor. The appellants in the Madhya Pradesh case and the petitioners in the Kerala case have questioned the constitutional validity of the restrictions on the ground that they deprive them of the fundamental right to carry on trade in liquor. It was contended that the right to trade in liquor was not declared by the legislature to be a monopoly of the State to exclude trade in liquor from the operation of Art. 19(1)(g) as a fundamental right to trade.
 Dismissing the appeals and writ petitions 
HELD : 1(a) The State has exclusive right or privilege of `manufacturing and selling liquor. The State grants such right or privilege in the shape of a licence or a lease.
 The State has power to hold public auction for grant of such right or privilege and accept payment of money in consideration of grant of lease. [872-B] (b) The State legislature is authorised to make a provision for public auction by reason of the power contained in Entry 8, List II of the Constitution. That entry empowers the State Government to legislate with regard to intoxicating liquor, that is to say, production, manufacture, possession.
 transport, purchase and sale of intoxicating liquor. [865-F] (2) (a) There are three principal reasons to hold that there is no fundamental right of citizens to carry on trade or to do business in liquor. First, there is the police power of the State to enforce public morality, to prohibit trades in noxious or dangerous goods. Second. there is power of the State to enforce an absolute prohibition of manufacture or sale of intoxicating liquors. Article 47 states that the State shall endeavour to bring about prohibition of the consumption, except for medical purposes, of intoxicating drinks and drugs which are injurious to health. Third, the history of excise law in India shows that the State has the exclusive right or privilege of manufacture or sale of liquor. [868E-F] (b) Trade in liquor has historically stood on a different footing from other trades. Restrictions which are not permissible with other ides are lawful and reasonable so far as the trade in liquor is concerned. That is why even prohibition of the trade in liquor is not only permissible but is also reasonable The reasons are public morality public interest and harmful and dangerous character of the liquor. The State possesses the right of complete control over all aspects of intoxicants viz.,, manufacture, collection. sale and consumption. The State has exclusive right to manufacture and sell liquor and to sell the said right in order to raise revenue. [871D-E] 862 (c) The nature of the trade is such that the State confers right to vend liquor by farming out either in auction or on private treaty. Rental is the consideration for the privilege granted by the Government for manufacturing or vending liquor. Rental is neither a tax nor an excise dirty. Rental is the consideration for the agreement for grant of privilege by the Government. [871F] (d) The grant of a lease either by public auction or for a sum is a regulation pertaining to liquor. One of the purposes of regulation is to raise revenue. Revenue is collected by the grant of contracts to carry on trade in liquor. These contracts are sold by auction. The grantee is given licence on payment of auction price. [872A] Krishna Kumar Narula etc. v. The State of Jammu and Kashmir and Ors. [1967] 3 S.R. 50; Coovarjee B. Bharucha v.
