 The assessee, a public limited company, incurred legal expenses for representing its case before the Income-tax Investigation Commission, ?he proceeding before the Commission was a statutory proceeding with a view to collecting materials for more taxation. The expenses were claimed by the assessee as a deduction under s.10(2)(xv) of the Income tax Act, 1922. The Income tax Officer, Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the Tribunal disallowed the claim, but the High Court, on reference, held in favour of the assessee.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD: The expression 'for the purpose of the business' in s. 10(2)(xv) is wider than the expression 'for the purpose of earning profits'. The former covers, not only the running of the business or its administration but also measures for the preservation of the business and protection of its assets and property. The test under the section therefore is whether the expenses were actually and honestly incurred for the preservation and protection of the assessee's business from any process or proceedings which might have resulted in the reduction of its income and profits. [286 G-H, 288D] The earning of profits and the payment of taxes are not isolated and independent activities of a business, but are continuous and take place from year to year during the whole period for which the business continues. If the assessee takes any steps for reducing its liability to tax which result in more funds being left for the purpose of carrying on the business there is always a possibility of higher profits. Therefore, expenditure which was incurred by the assessee in opposing a coercive governmental action, with the object of saving taxation and safeguarding business,, was justified by commercial expediency and was, hence, allowable under s.10(2)(xv) of the Act.
