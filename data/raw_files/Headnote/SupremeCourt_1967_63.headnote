 The Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service Rules, 1955, provided that recruitment to the Higher Judicial Service had to be made by the Governor from out of the lists of eligible candidates sent up by the High Court but prepared by a Selection Committee of the High Court consisting of the Chief Justice, the Administrative Judge and another Judge of the High Court nominated by the Chief Justice. When recruitments to the posts of Civil and Additional Sessions Judge were made in accordance with this procedure they were challenged on the ground that the Rules contravened Art. 233 of the Constitution. The High Court upheld the validity of the Rules and the appointments made thereunder. In this Court it was contended that (i) the Rules were ultra vires Art. 233, and (ii) the post of a Civil and Additional Sessions Judge is not included in the definition of a "District Judge" in Article 236 and therefore the appointments were not validated by Article 233A introduced by the Constitution (Twentieth Amendment) Act, 1966.
 Held : The Rules contravened Article 233 and therefore the appointments were illegal; but the appointments were validated by Article 233A.
 (i) Consultation as provided in Art. 233 is consultation with the High Court -and not with any other authority such as the Selection Committee appointed under the Rules. The Committee, though composed of Judges of the High Court, is not the High Court. The only function entrusted to the High Court under the Rules is to transmit the lists prepared by the Committee and there is nothing in the Rules empowering the High Court, before submitting the lists to vary those lists if the High Court were to disagree with the Committee.
 [190 A-C] Chandra Mohan v. State of Uttar Pradesh, [1967] 1 S.C.R. 77, followed (ii) When a Civil Judge is appointed as an Additional Sessions Judge, which is precisely what has happened in the instant case, such an appointment is made in exercise of the powers conferred by s. 9 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
 The Civil Judge exercises the powers of an additional Sessions Judge not because he is a Civil Judge but because he is appointed as an Additional Sessions Judge. The two posts, therefore, cannot be said to have been clubbed together. So, when a person appointed as a Civil Judge is also intended to work as an Additional Sessions Judge an 187 appointment has to be made under s. 9 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as an Additional Sessions Judge. Such an appointment has to be considered as an appointment falling under the definition of "District Judge" within the meaning of Art. 236. Therefore Article 233 and the Rajasthan higher Judicial Service Rules 1955 apply to such a post and not Article 234 or the Rajasthan Judicial Service Rules, 1955. [195 E-H]
