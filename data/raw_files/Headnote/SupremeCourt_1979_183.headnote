 The petitioner is a senior member of the Indian Foreign Service and complains that she had been denied promotion to Grade I of the Indian Foreign Service on the grounds that (i) there is a long standing practice of hostile discrimination against women (ii) had to give an undertaking at the time of joining the foreign service that if she were to get married, she would resign from the service (iii) had to face the consequences of being a woman and thus suffered discrimination and (iv) the members of the appointment committee of the Union cabinet and respondent No. 2 are basically prejudiced against women as a group. The petitioner has further challenged two rules namely rule 8(2) of Indian Foreign Service (Conduct and Discipline) Rules 1961 and Rule 18(4) of the Indian Foreign Service (Recruitment, Cadre Seniority and Promotion) Rules 1961, which in short states that a woman member of the service shall obtain permission in writing of the Government before marriage and the woman member may be required to resign any time after marriage if the Government is satisfied that her family and domestic commitments will hamper her duties as a member of the service and under the second rule no married woman shall be entitled as of right to be appointed to the service. The petitioner's remaining grievance is that during the interval of some months between her first evaluation and the second, some officers junior to her, have gone above her and her career would be affected.

 HELD : That sex prejudice against the Indian womenhood pervades the service rules even a third of a century after Freedom. There is some basis for the charge of bias in the rules and this makes the ominous indifference of the executive to bring about the banishment of discrimination in the heritage of service rules. If high officials lose hopes of equal justice under the rules, the legal lot of the little Indian, already priced out of the expensive judicial market, is best left to guess. This disturbing thought induces the making of a few observations about the two impugned rules which appear prima facie, discriminatory against the female of the species in public service and have surprisingly survived so long, presumably, because servants of Government are afraid to challenge unconstitutional rule making by the Administration. [669 E-H] Discrimination against women, is found in Rule 8(2). If a woman member shall obtain the permission of Government before the marriage, the same risk is run by Government if a male member contracts a marriage. If the family and domestic commitments of a woman member of the service is likely to come in the way of efficient discharge of duties, a similar situation may well arise in the case of a male member. In these days of nuclear families, intercontinental marriages and unconventional behaviour, one fails to under- 669 stand, the naked bias against the gentler of the species.
 Rule 18(4) is in defiance of Art. 16. If a married man has a right, a married woman, other things being equal, stands on no worse footing. Freedom is indivisible, so is justice.
 That our founding faith enshrined in Art. 14 and 16 should have been tragically ignored vis-a-vis half of India's humanity, viz., our women is a sad reflection on the distance between Constitution in the book and Law in action.
 And if the Executive as the surrogate of Parliament, makes rules in the teeth of Part III, especially when high political office, even diplomatic assignment, has been filled by women, the inference of die-hard allergy to gender parity is inevitable. As Rule 18(4) has been deleted in November, 1973, and rule 8(2) is on its way to oblivion as its deletion is being gazetted, there is no need to scrutinize or strike down these rules. The petitioner has, after the institution of this proceeding, been promoted and where justice has been done, further probe is otiose. [671 B-D, E-G, 672 C] The Court directed the respondent to review the petitioner's case with particular focus on seniority vis-a- vis those junior to her who have been promoted in the interval of some months. It was further impressed upon the respondent the need to overhaul all service rules to remove the stains of sex discrimination, without waiting for ad-hoc inspiration from Writ Petitions or gender charity.
