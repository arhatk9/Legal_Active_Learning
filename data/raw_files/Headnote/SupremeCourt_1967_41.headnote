 The appellant company manufactured trucks, bus chasis etc.
 in Bihar State. Some of the goods so manufactured were sent to the stockyards maintained by the company in various States outside Bihar. The goods in the said stockyards, according to the company, had not been appropriated to any contract and remained the property of the company.
 Therefore. in proceedings for the assessment of Sales Tax before the Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Jamshedpur the company contended that the sales effected from these stockyards were taxable neither under the Bihar Sales Tax Act,, nor under the Central Sales Tax Act. The contention was rejected by the Assistant Commissioner who demanded Rs. 1,73,84,273 as tax. The company thereupon filed a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution questioning the jurisdiction of the Taxing Authority. The High Court refused to give relief because ,adequate alternative remedies under the taxing statute were available and had not been exhausted and dismissed the petition in limine. By special leave the company appealed.
 
HELD : The jurisdiction of the High Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution cannot be a substitute for the ordinary remedies at law. Nor is its exercise desirable if facts have to be found on evidence. But there are exceptions.
 One such exception is when action is being taken under an invalid law or arbitrarily without the sanction of law. In such a case the High Court may interfere to avoid hardship to a party. which will be unavoidable if the quick and more efficacious remedy envisaged by the article were not allowed to be invoked. As the appeals required payment of tax at least in part the High Court ought to have taken jurisdiction in this case at least to issue a rule nisi to see what the Assistant Commissioner had to say.
