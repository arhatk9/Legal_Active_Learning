 The respondents were appointed temporarily to respective posts and at the time of their appointment the posts were also temporary. Sometime after, their appointments, though temporary, were declared to be in substantive capacity within the meaning of the order of the Governor regarding, Fundamental Rule 26(d) of the Financial Hand Book Volume III, Part 11, with retrospective effect from the date of their first appointment. These posts alongwith other temporary posts, were subsequently made permanent. However, the government did not consider the question of confirmation of the individual officers in these posts, the respondents' services were terminated by one month's notice as provided in the rule for termination of the services of a government servant in temporary service. The respondents filed writ petitions challenging the orders of termination of their services. The High Court allowed these petitions. Setting aside the Orders of the High Court and dismissing the writ petitions, 
HELD : Fundamental Rule 26(d) and the Order of the Governor clearly show that they merely dealt with leave and increment and the order has nothing to do with the nature of the appointment. That order did not convert the appointments of temporary government servants either into permanent appointments or into temporary appointment in substantive capacity in permanent posts. For purposes other 'than those mentioned in the order their appointments continue to be temporary. The High Court proceeded on the erroneous reasoning that as the respondents were holding their posts in a substantive capacity though temporarily, they must be held to have been holding those permanent posts in a substantive capacity. [405 C] (ii) A temporary government servant does not become Permanent unless he gets that capacity either under some rule or he is declared or appointed by the government as a permanent government servant. At the time of the conversion of the temporary post,, into permanent posts the government did not consider the question of confirmation of the officers holding those posts. And no rule has been shown under which the respondents can be considered as having been appointed either permanently or in a substantive capacity to permanent posts. [405 G] State of U.P. v. Abdul Khalik, C. As Nos 782 & 783/66 decided on April 30, 1969, applied.
