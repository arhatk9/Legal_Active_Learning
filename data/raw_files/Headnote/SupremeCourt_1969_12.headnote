 The respondent's election to the U.P. Legislative Assembly in February, 1967, was challenged by the appellant in an election petition ,on various grounds including allegations of corrupt practices. The respondent raised two preliminary objections before the High Court namely, (i) the petition was not maintainable as it was not properly presented; and (ii) the petition ceased to be maintainable as a result of dissolution of the U.P. Legislative Assembly by virtue of the President's proclamation of April 15, 1968, under article 356 (1) of the Constitution issued during the pendency of the election petition before the High Court.
 These preliminary objections were rejected by the High Court, which also dismissed the petition on the merits.
 On an appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (i) The High Court was right in holding that the requirements of law as to the presentation of a petition were fully satisfied as the election petition was presented to the Registry by an Advocate's Clerk in the presence of the petitioner. The petitioner in substance, though not in form, himself presented the petition. (ii) There was no force in the contention that the petition had become infructuous in view of the dissolution of the Legislative Assembly. [418H] The question for consideration was not only the validity of the election but also the allegation of corrupt practices which, if established, would involve the respondent incurring certain electoral disqualifications.
 It is clear from the provisions of Chapters III and IV of Part VI of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, that the contest in an election petition is really between the constituency and the person or persons complained of. Once the machinery of the Act is moved by a candidate or an elector, the carriage of the case does not entirely rest with the petitioner. The reason for these provisions is to ensure to the extent possible that the persons who offend the election law, are not allowed to avoid the consequences of their misdeeds. [421G] .
 The law relating to withdrawal and abatement of election petitions is exhaustively dealt with in Chapter IV of Part VI of the Act. In deciding whether a petition has abated or not it was not possible to travel outside the provisions contained in that Chapter. The Act does not provide for the abatement of an election petition either when the returned candidate whose election is challenged resigns or when the assembly is dissolved.
