 Respondents 1 to 3 executed in 1940 a usufructury mortgage, of their land in favour of the appellant and certain others.
 The liability under the mortgage was a joint liability and under the terms of the deed each one of the mortgagors was liable for the entire debt due under the mortgage. The respondents claiming to be 'debtors' under the Saurashtra Agricultural Debtors' Relief Act 1954 prayed for a scaling down of their debts. The Debt adjustment Board and the appellate court held that the respondents were not 'debtors' under s. 2(6)(i) of the Act as their total liability ex- ceeded Rs. 25,000 and therefore they were not entitled to the benefit claimed. A learned Single Judge of the High Court however held that in computing the debts due from the respondents each one of them should be held liable only for one-third of the mortgage debt and in that event the total debt due from each would not exceed Rs. 25,000. The I Judge in his judgment also considered the question as to how far a Single Judge of a High Court is bound by earlier decisions of the Court.
 
HELD: (i) A Single Judge of a High Court is ordinarily bound to accept as correct judgments of courts of co- ordinate jurisdiction, of Division Benches and Full Benches of his Court. [762 D] Tribhovandas Purshottamdas Thakkar v. Ratilal Motilal Patel, [1967] INSC 200; A.I.R. 1968 S.C. 372, reaffirmed.
 (ii) There could be no dispute that under the Transfer of Property Act each of the respondents must be held to be liable for the entire mortgage debt. There was nothing in the special provisions of the Saurashtra Act which would justify a departure from the said rule. The High Court therefore erred in treating the respondents as 'debtors' under that Act. [763 A-F] V. Ramaswami Ayyangar v. T. N. V. Kailasa Thavar, [1951] S.C.R. 292, distinguished.

 L. R. 1007, approved.
 (iii) While applying the provisions of the Saurashtra Act with the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act or the Contract Act in certain cases some difficulty may arise.
 All these difficulties can be resolved by reasonably interpreting the relevant provisions of the Act. [764 C]
