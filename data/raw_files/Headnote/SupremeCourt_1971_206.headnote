 In 1958, there was a partition in the family of the respondent by a registered partition deed. In January 1960, it was conceded on behalf of the Agricultural Income-tax Officer, before the High Court, that the respondent was liable to be taxed only as an 'individual', that is, it was conceded that the respondent's family was a divided family.
 Various attempts made by the Department thereafter, to assess the respondent as Karta of his family were set aside by the High Court, and the respondent and other members of his quondam family were assessed as 'individuals' till 1964.
 In 1965, notice was again issued to the respondent with respect to the assessment year 1961-62 for assessing him as the karta of his family, and the respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court. The Department contended that in view of the amendment of s. 29 of the Travancore-Cochin Agricultural Income-tax Act, 1950, by Act 12 of 1964, it was permissible for the Department to reassess the respondent as the Karta of the family as no decision that the respondents family was a divided family had been rendered by the Agricultural Income-tax Officer and the family must hence be deemed to be an undivided family. The High Court held in favour of the assessee.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD: (1) The amended s. 29 was given retrospective effect from April 1, 1958; but it is only a machinery section. It is attracted to an assessment proceeding only if one of the two conditions prescribed in sub. s. (1) is established, namely, either the family in question was being assessed as an undivided family in the previous assessment year, or, that the family was being assessed for the first time. The deeming provision contained in s. 29(3) can have application only in cases where one or the other conditions prescribed by s. 29(1) is satisfied and not otherwise.
 [303F-G; 307F-H] In the present case, every attempt made by the assessing authority to assess the quondam family of the respondent was set aside by the High Court and the department had not only not assessed that family as an undivided family, but had assessed the individual members of the family as divided members. That is, the question whether the family was divided or not had been gone into and decided. It cannot also be said that the family was 'hitherto assessed as a Hindu undivided family'. [307H; 308A-B] 299 (2) The expression 'which (meaning family) is being assessed for the first time as a Hindu undivided family' presupposes the existence of the family. Section 29(1) does not permit the assessing authority to create a family by re- joining the divided parties or otherwise. If the family has ceased to exist even before the assessment proceeding started then there can be no family which is being, assessed to tax for the first time. [308-F] In the present case, the family sought to be taxed was 'non- existing' in the concerned previous years and hence could not be considered as a Hindu undivided family 'being assessed for the first time'. Therefore,' the 'deeming' provision in s. 29(3) could not be applied. [308G-H] Additional Income-tax Officer, Cuddapah v. A. Thimmarya 55 I.T.R. 666(S.C.), referred to.
