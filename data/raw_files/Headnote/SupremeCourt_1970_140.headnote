 The petitioner a Pakistani national, who had entered India illegally was detained for the purpose of expelling him from India. Instead of making any representation against the detention order, he challenged his detention by filing a writ of habeas corpus in this Court. This Court directed rule nisi. The state revoked the order of detention and ordered the deportation of the petitioner from India under section 3(2) of the Foreigners Act read with the Ministry of Home Affairs Notification issued under S.O. 590 dated April 9, 1958. Dismissing the petition, this Court.-- 
HELD : (i) The petitioner was a foreigner as defined in the Foreigners Act and not being a citizen, he was clearly not entitled to any fundamental right guaranteed by Article 19 of the Constitution. His entry into this country was also without any right, he had thus no right to remain within the territories of India. The order of the deportation was consistent with the order of detention which was also made with the object of expelling him from India. The order of his release, if made by this Court, would, not only result in his presence in a part of India in contravention of the statutory provisions but would in addition render it somewhat difficult for the authorities to enforce compliance with the order of his expulsion. In these circumstances, the restraint on his personal liberty for the purpose of taking him to the border in order to expel him from India in accordance with the statutory provisions could by no means be considered to be an illegal custody justifying an order of release by this Court. [639 B-C, 644 H] (ii) Habeas corpus, though a writ of right, is not a writ of course. Its scope has grown to achieve its purpose, of protecting individuals 'against erosion of the right to be free from wrongful restraint on their rightful liberty.
 But, when, as in the present, case, the, petitioner has no right to move about freely in this country without a proper legal sanction, the restraint exercised on him for expelling him 'from India could not be construed on the facts and circumstances of this case to amount to his custody being illegal so as to require this Court to direct his immediate release. The constitutional protection against illegal deprivation of personal liberty construed in a practical way cannot entitle non-citizens like the petitioner to remain in India contrary to the provisions of the law governing foreigners. [645 D] (iii) The notification dated April 19, 1958 was a complete answer to the petitioner's contention that it was the Central Government alone which could make a lawful order of deportation under s. 3(2)(c) of the Foreigners Act. Under the said rectifications the State was entrusted with the functions of the Central Government under s. 3(2) of the Foreigners Act. [641 G] 638 State of Punjab v. Ajaib Singli, [1952] INSC 57; [1953] S.C.R. 254; State of U.P. V. Abdul Samad, A.I.R. 1968 S.C, 1506 followed.
