 Certain properties were sold by sale-deed dated 15th December 1952. The vendors, of whom the respondent was one, had equitably mortgaged these properties with the Chartered Bank of India. In order to pay off the mortgage debt to the Bank the vendors entered into a contract with M/s. Oil Corporation of India Ltd. for the sale of the mortgaged property consisting of lands, buildings plants, machinery, shares, goodwill etc., for a sum of Rs. 5,55,000. The Chartered Bank agreed to release from its charge the properties to be conveyed to the vendees provided a sum of Rs. 500,000 was paid to it. The vendees agreed to pay the said Bank a sum of Rs. 4,89,000 while the vendors agreed to pay Rs. 1 1,000 to make up the balance. In pursuance of this agreement the vendors handed over the possession of the plant and machinery of the two factories to the vendees, who paid Rs. 3,89,000 to the said Bank before the date on which the sale-deed was executed, and Rs. 100,000 after the execution of the deed. The Stamp duty was paid only on the last mentioned sum. In a reference under s. 57 of the Indian Stamp Act the High Court held that the Stamp Duty was correctly paid. The Board of Revenue U.P. appealed to the Supreme Court by special leave.
 It was contended on behalf of the appellant, relying on the explanation to s. 24 of the Act that the duty was payable not only on Rs. 100,000 as actually paid but also on the rest of the sale price.
 
HELD : (i) From the Explanation to s. 24 it is plain that it is only the unpaid mortgage money that it deemed to be part of the consideration. If the mortgage money has been paid off by the date of the conveyance the explanation does not require it to be added to the consideration. The phrase 'subject to the mortgage or other encumbrance' qualifies the word 'sale' and not the word 'property'. [274 B-E] In the present case the sum of Rs. 3,89,000 having been paid before the conveyance was not liable to duty. [274 G] (ii)If mortgage money has been paid off by the vendee before the date of the sale, as part of the consideration, it would be included in the amount leviable with stamp duty under Act 
23. But in the present case Art. 23 did not apply because neither the sum of Rs. 3,89,000 paid by the vendee before the sale nor the sum of Rs. 11,000 paid by the vendor after the sale, was shown to be consideration for immovable pro- perty. [275 D]
