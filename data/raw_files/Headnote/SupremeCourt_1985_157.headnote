 The appellant No. 1, A Sreenivasa Pai, executed a Settlement Deed in Malayalam language on 12th December, 1932 transferring two plots of land with some buildings and out houses at Quilon in favour of his mother-in-law Padmavathi Ammal. The 1st appellant's father-in-law died in the year 1932. His brother-in-law, V. Sreenivasa Pai died in the year 1935. After the death of mother-in-law in 1951, her daughter-in-law/respondent (wife of V. Sreenivasa Pai) filed a suit for possession of the aforesaid properties on the ground that under the Settlement Deed, her mother-in-law, Padmavathi Ammal had been conferred only a life estate and the properties had been given absolutely to V. Sreenivasa Pai to enjoy them after the life time of Padmavathi Ammal.
 It was further pleaded that on the death of Padmavathi Ammal who was only a life estate holder, the properties devolved on the respondent who was the sole heir of V. Sreenivasa Pai. On the other hand, the appellant pleaded that Padmavathi Ammal had been conferred absolute title in respect of the aforesaid properties and on her death the said properties being Streedhana properties of Padmavathi Ammal had devolved on her daughter Lakshmi Ammal, the wife of the 1st appellant i.e. appellant No.2.
 The trial court dismissed the suit. But, on appeal the High Court reversed the judgment of the trial court holding that the respondent was entitled to the properties on the ground that under the Settlement Deed Padmavathi Ammal had been conferred a life estate only in the properties settled under the document in question and that V. Sreenivasa Pai, the husband of the respondent - Saraswathi Ammal alias G.Kamala Bai had been conferred an absolute estate in those properties to be enjoyed by him after the death of Padmavathi Ammal.
 123 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: 1. In construing a document, whether in English or in any Indian Language, the fundamental rule to be adopted is to ascertain the intention from the words employed in it. The surrounding circumstances may be considered for the purpose of ascertaining the intended meaning of those words, specially when there is some ambiguity in the words used in the document. [128 B-C] 
 2. In the instant case, it is clear from the portions of the Settlement Deed that A. Sreenivasa Pai desired to give the properties mentioned in the said deed to V.
 Sreenivasa Pai absolutely subject to the life interest conferred on Padmavathi Ammal. It may also be noted that V.
 Sreenivasa Pai admittedly was not an apparent heir to the properties of Padmavathi Ammal on the date of the document as her daughter Lakshmi Ammal was alive on that date. If A.
 Sreenivasa Pai intended that his wife S. Lakshmi Ammal should succeed to the properties transferred under the settlement deed after the death of Padmavathi Ammal, he would have stated in the document that the properties should, on her death, go to her heirs but on the other hand he stated "I hereby agree that you, and after you, your son, and his descendants from generation to generation for all time may hold the properties and enjoy the same from this day onwards." These words clearly point out that A.
 Sreenivasa Pai never intended that the properties transferred under the deed of settlement should, on the death of Padmavathi Ammal, go to her heir at law. Having regard to the recitals in the document and the circumstances in which it came to be executed, there is no doubt that the above words of disposition conferring title on V. Sreenivasa Pai do not constitute a subordinate clause in the deed. It is difficult to agree that these words have been used in the document merely as a defeasance clause attached to the absolute estate conveyed in favour of Padmavathi Ammal. Nor do these words appear to create a different mode of succession to the absolute estate of Padmavathi Ammal after her death. They treat V. Sreenivasa Pai as a direct beneficiary under the deed itself. [128 F-H, 129 A-D] 3. The document read as a whole leaves no doubt that V.
 Sreenivasa Pai was given under it the absolute estate in the properties subject to the life estate created in favour of Padmavathi Ammal. The object of executing the settlement deed was obviously to confer the benefit on the family of V.
 Sreenivasa Pai which was in distress and not that Padmavathi Ammal should alone be benefited. The document conferred, as observed by the 124 High Court, a vested interest in favour of V. Sreenivasa Pai but his right to enjoy the property only was however postponed to the death of Padmavathi Ammal. Since V.
 Sreenivasa Pai had acquired a vested right in the properties on December 12, 1932 i.e., the date of the settlement deed it could not be defeated by his death before he obtained possession. His widow Saraswathi Ammal alias G.Kamala Bai being his sole heir was, therefore, entitled to the said properties on the termination of the life estate of Padmavathi Ammal.
