 Section 11(1) of the Special Courts Act, 1979 provides that "notwithstanding anything in the Code of Criminal Procedure an appeal shall lie as of right from any judgment, sentence or order, not being interlocutory order, of a Special Court to the Supreme Court both on facts and law." Sub-section (2) provides that "except as aforesaid no appeal or revision shall lie to any court from any judgment, sentence or order of a Special Court." The Special Judge appointed under the Special Courts Act, 1979 directed a charge to be framed against the appellant under section 120B I.P.C. read with section 5(1)(d) and section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. At the stage of hearing, a preliminary objection as to the maintainability of the appeal was raised on behalf of the State on the ground that the order impugned being purely an interlocutory order within the meaning of section 11(1) of the Act no appeal lay to this Court.
 On behalf of the appellant it was contended that the term "interlocutory order" has been used in the same sense as has been used in section 397(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the same construction placed by this Court on the expression should apply in interpreting this expression, particularly when the Act does not give any remedy to the accused.
 Per S. Murtaza Fazal Ali and Sen, JJ.
 The order passed by the Special Judge was an interlocutory order and the appeal filed against that order in this Court is not maintainable. [434 Ap 1(a) The expression interlocutory order in section 11(1) has been used in the natural sense and not in a special or in the wider sense in which lt is used in section 397(2) of the Code. [433 G] (b) on a true construction of section 11(1) and taking into consideration the natural meaning of the expression interlocutory order there can be no doubt that the order framing charges against the appellant under the Act was merely n interlocutory order which neither terminated the proceeding nor finally decided the right of the parties.
 Taking ib natural meaning and applying the 381 non-obstante clause the position is that the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure are expressly excluded by the non-obstante clause and, therefore, section 397(2) of the Code cannot be called into aid for holding that the order impugned is not an interlocutory order. [433 B-C] (c) The term "interlocutory order" used in section 397(2) of the Code relates to various stages of the trial, namely inquiry, trial or any other proceeding. The object seems to be to cut down tho delays in stages through which a criminal case passes before it culminates in an acquittal, discharge or conviction. Having regard to the very large ambit and range of the Code the expression interlocutory order would have to be given a broad meaning so as to achieve the object of the Code without disturbing or interfering with the fairness of the trial. [392 A-C] (d) In Amar Nath v. The State of Haryana, although this Court held that an order summoning an accused was not an interlocutory order being a matter of moment which decided an important aspect of the trial it was, in a sense, a final order which could be revised by the Sessions Judge or the High Court under section 397 of the Code. In the circumstances of that case this Court held that such an order could not be said to be purely an interlocutory order.
 [394 D] D] Amar Nath & Ors. v. State of Haryana & ors. [1977] INSC 153; [1978] 1 SCR 222, approved. D (e) In Madhu Limaye v. State of Maharashtra this Court held that an order framing a charge was not an interlocutory order and, therefore, a revision against such an order was competent before the Sheepish Judge or the High Court. But in the circumstances of this case the order was not merely interlocutory order but partook the nature of a final order or at any rate an intermediate order so as to be taken out of the bar contained in section 397(2) of he Code of Criminal Procedure. [395 H; 396 H] Madhu Limaye v. The State of Maharashtra, [1978] 1 SCR 749 approved.
 (f) The term interlocutory order used in the Code of Criminal Procedure has to be given a very liberal construction in favour of the accused in order to ensure complete fairness of the trial because the bar contained in section 397(3) of the Code would apply to a variety of cases coming up before the courts not only being offences under the Penal Code but under numerous Acts. If the right of revision was to be barred the provision containing the bar must be confined within the four corners of the spirit and the letter of the law. But the same cannot be said of the Special Courts Act which is meant to cover only specified number of crimes and criminals and the objective to be attained was quick dispatch and speedy disposal of cases.
 [398 D-F] G State of Karnataka v. L. Munniswamy & ors. [1977] INSC 75; [1977] 3 SCR 113; Parmeshwari Devi v. State & Anr [1976] INSC 297; [1977] 2 SCR 160, held inapplicable.
 
 2. The heart and soul of the Special Courts Act being speedy disposal of cases, the provisions of the Act must be interpreted so as to eliminate all possible delay or means of adopting dilatory tactics by plugging every possible loop-hole in the Act. It could not have been intended by Parliament that, while the Criminal Procedure Code gives a right of revision against an order which, though not purely interlocutory, is either intermediate or quasi-final, the Act 382 would provide a full-fledged appeal against such an order. It is mainly for the purpose of avoiding flooding of this Court with appeals against the orders Of the Special Court framing the charges that a non-obstante clause was put in section 11 to bar appeals against any interlocutory order whether it is intermediate or quasi-final. The Act applies only to a specified number of cases which fulfil the conditions contained in it and in view of its special features the liberty of the subject has been fully safeguarded by providing a three-tier system. [408 B-F] 
 3. The non-obstante clause in section 11 excludes an appeal from any interlocutory orders of a Special Court because such an exclusion is fully consistent with the object of the Act. Since the non-obstante clause expressly excludes. the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure section 397(2) of the Code cannot be invoked because that would frustrate the very object which section. 11 seeks to subserve. [409 F-G] 
 4. When the Act excludes the Code then it obviously excludes an appeal against any type of interlocutory order.
 The absence of revision is more than compensated by giving the accused a right of appeal against any judgment or order of the Special Judge as of right and on facts and law.
 Secondly the trail is held by a sitting Judge of the High Court who would have the power of revision if he was sitting in a High Court. Therefore it muse be presumed that whenever a Special Judge passes any interlocutory order or an intermediate. Order like framing of charges. he would do so only with full and complete application of his mind and considering the various principles and guidelines indicated by this Court. It would not be in keeping with the dignity decorum and status of the Special Judge to provide for an appeal even against such an order which he is supposed to pass with full application of mind and due deliberation.

 5. (a) The non-obstante clause has the effect of overriding and excluding the provision of the Code. [411 D] Aswini Kumar Ghosh & Anr. v. Arabinda Bose & Anr.
 [1952] INSC 50; [1953] SCR 1, referred to.
 (b) The term interlocutory is to be understood and taken to mean the converse of the term "final order". The essential attribute of an interlocutory order is that it merely decides some point or matter essential to the progress of the suit or collateral to the issue sought but is not a final decision or judgment on the matter under issue. An intermediate order is one which is made between.
 the commencement of an action and the entry of the judgment.
 [412 C, 414 D-E] Madhu Limaye v. The State of Maharashtra, [1978] 1 SCR 749 referred to.
 (c) An order framing a charge being interlocutory falls squarely within the ordinary and natural meaning of the term "interlocutory order" as used in section 11(1) of the Act.

 6. A conspectus of the decisions of this Court establishes the following propositions: (i) an order which does not determine the right of the parties but only one aspect of the suit or the trial is an interlocutory order (ii) the concept of interlocutory order has to be explained in contra-distinction to a final order. If an order is not a final order it would be an interlocutory order. (iii) one of the tests generally accepted by Courts is to see if the order is decided one way it may terminate the proceedings but if decided the other way the proceedings would continue because the term interlocutory order in the Code of Criminal Procedure has been used in a much wider sense so as to include even intermediate or quasi-final orders. (iv) an order passed by the Special Court discharging the accused would undoubtedly be a final order inasmuch as it finally decides the rights of the parties and puts an end to the controversy and thereby terminates the entire proceedings before the Court so that nothing is left to be done by the Court thereafter. (v) Even if an Act does not permit an appeal against an interlocutory order the accused is not left without any remedy because in suitable cases the accused can always move this Court under Article 136 even against an order framing charges against him. Thus it cannot be said that by not allowing an appeal against an order framing charges the Act works serious injustice to the accused. [4241] In the instant case the order framing charges against the accused is purely an interlocutory order as it does not terminate the proceedings but the trial goes on until it culminates in acquittal or conviction. [425 B-C] 
 7. The argument that a statute which gives a right of appeal should be liberally construed in favour of the accused so as not to deprive him of the right of appeal has no force because in the instant case the right of appeal is expressly excluded by providing that no appeal shall lie against an interlocutory order. Even by stretching the language of the section no right of appeal can be inferred when no such right has been conferred. The non-obstante clause cannot be construed to contain a right of appeal even against an interlocutory order. [432 G-H] Desai, J. concurring.
 
 1. The order framing a charge is an interlocutory order within the meaning of section 11(1) of the Act and an appeal against such an order is incompetent in view of the provisions contained in section 11(2) and therefore. the preliminary objection must be upheld. [468 E] 
 2. Interlocutory orders passed by a court disposing of ancillary disputes in the course of a judicial proceeding are steps taken by the court towards the final adjudication and for assisting the parties in the prosecution of their cases. They regulate the procedure only and do not affect any right or liability of the parties. An order does not cease to be an interlocutory order merely because it disposes of a certain aspect of the controversy between the parties. The test of finality is whether the order finally disposes of the right of the parties. The finality must be a finality in relation to the suit. If after the order the suit is still a live suit and the rights of the parties are still to be determined, no appeal lies against it under section 109A of the Code. Even if the order decides an important and even a vital issue in the case but leaves the suit alive Fl and provides for its trial in the ordinary way it would still not be a final order. Another test is that the decision whichever way it is given if it finally disposes 384 of the matter in dispute it is final. The decision, if given in one way it will finally dispose of the matter in dispute, but if given in another it will allow the action to go on it is not final but interlocutory.

Dominion of India and Others [1949-50] FCR, 842; Salter Rex & Co. v. Ghosh R [1971] 2 W.B.D. 597 referred to.
 
 3. In the context of section 397(2) read with section 482 of the Code this Court, with a view to providing a judicial umbrella of active supervision tor reaching possible correctable injustice by activist attitudes and pragmatic interpretation found a third class of orders neither interlocutory nor final but intermediate and therefore outside the bar of section 397(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. But the test remained unaltered that every interlocutory order, merely because it disposes of an aspect in the course of a pending proceeding even adversely affecting a party for the time being would not be something other than interlocutory. To be specific the earlier test is not departed from but the power of supervision sought to be constructed, was widened by ascertaining a third class of orders namely, intermediate orders which are neither interlocutory nor final. 1462 B-D] Amar Nath & Ors. v. Stole of Haryana & Ors. [1978] I S.C.R. 222; Mohan Lal Magan Lal Thacker v. State of Gujarat [1967] INSC 304; [1968] 2 S.C.R. 685; Madhu Limaye v. The State of Maharahtra [1978] 1 S.C.R. 749: Parmeshwari Devi v. State & Anr. [1976] INSC 297; [1977] 2 S.C R. 160 referred to.
 
 4. (a) There is no force in the contention that framing of a charge concludes an enquiry anterior to it and that it is likely to result in the deprivation of the liberty of the accused because he is asked to face the trial. 1463 Cl (b) The framing of a charge is an intimation to the accused of what precise offence or what allegations of facts he is called upon to meet. Its object is to warn an accused of the case he is to answer. The order framing a charge would be an intermediate order and not an interlocutory order. In the course of a trial of a civil or criminal proceeding there can be no stage where an order can be made without bringing to bear on the subject an active judicial mind and judicially determining the dispute. Any such dispute if mechanically disposed of may warrant interference. Therefore emphasis was laid on the court expecting it to seriously apply its mind at the stage of framing a charge. It does not make tho order framing a charge anything other than an interlocutory order. [463 G;
 464 F-G] B. N. Srikantiah & Ors. v. The State of Mysore [1958] INSC 41; [1959] S.C.R. 496 at 503; State of Karnataka v. L. Muni Swami & Ors. [1977] INSC 75; [1977] 3 S.C.R. 113 and Century Spinning and Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra A.I.R. 1972 S.C. 545, referred to.
 (c) If framing a charge is an interlocutory order, excluding the non-obstante clause, no appeal would lie against such an order under section 11 of the Act because there is a specific provision under section 11(2) that except as provided in section 11(1) no appeal or revision shall lie to any court from any judgment, sentence or order cf Special Court. [465 D-E] 385 (d) It is well settled that there is no inherent or common law right of A appeal in a subject and appeal is the creature of statute. Therefore the right to appeal can be enjoyed only within the strictly demarcated limits conferring such right of appeal. [465 E] In the instant case the order under challenge being one passed by tho Special Court set up under the Act an appeal from such an order would only be competent if it squarely falls within section 11(1). Therefore there is no gain- saying the fact that if the order sought to be appealed against is an interlocutory order excluding tho non-obstante clause by the main provision of section 11(1) the present appeal would be incompetent. [465 D] 
 5. The substantive provision of section 11 ( 1 ) while providing for an appeal against any judgment sentence or order made by a Special; Court circumscribed the right to appeal against the orders by excluding therefrom orders which are interlocutory. [466 D] 
 6. When the non-obstante clause provides for "not- withstanding anything in the Code" the expression as per grammatical construction would mean that something contained in the Code is to be excluded while examining the scope and content of the substantive provision of section 11(1). There is nothing in the Code providing for an appeal against an interlocutory order. While enacting the Act the Parliament was conscious of appeals and revisions under the Code and that is manifest from the language in section 11(2) of the Act. If there was no provision in the Code providing for an appeal against any interlocutory order in any proceeding under the Code it is inconceivable that such a wider jurisdiction of appeal was sought to be enacted under the substantive provision of section 11 (1), [467 B-Cl 
 7. The paramount object in enacting the Special Courts Act was to bring the prosecutions to a speedy termination and commission of offences should be judicially determined with the utmost dispatch. This being the objective of the Act construction of its provisions must receive such interpretation as would facilitate the achieving of the object underlying it and not frustrating it. That would stand thwarted if against every interlocutory order an appeal to the highest court as a matter of right both of law and fact can be filed. [467 E] 
 8. The argument that there is unfairness in the procedure is utterly unreal because the trial is by a sitting judge of the High Court to be appointed with the concurrence of the Chief Justice of India. The Special Court would always be amenable to the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 136. [468 B] 
 9. There is no substance in the contention that in narrowly interpreting the, expression "interlocutory order" in section 11(1) door may not be thrown open for introduction of a procedure lacking in fairness and likely to result in the deprivation of personal liberty. [468 D] Singhal J. (dissenting).
 1. The impugned order is not an interlocutory order.
 The accused is entitled as of right to prefer an appeal.
 [452 G] H 
 2. Section 9 of the Act provides that a Special Court could in the trial of cases falling within its jurisdiction follow the procedure prescribed by the Code 386 of Criminal Procedure for the trial of warrant cases before a Magistrate. Section 239 is a valuable provision to The advantage of the accused because it envisages a careful and objective consideration by the Judge whether the charge against the accused is groundless or whether there is ground for presuming that he has committed an offence. Similarly when an order for the framing of a charge under section 240 is passed it amounts to a. decision that the accused is not entitled to discharge under section 239, that there is ground for presuming that he has committed an offence triable under Chapter XIX and that he should be called upon to plead guilty of it. Therefore, an order for framing of the charge is a serious matter for the accused. [434 H; 435 F-H] 
 3. Section 9 of the Special Courts Act does not provide that an appeal against the order of the Special Court shall be heard and decided according to the procedure laid down in the Code. Section 11 which deals with appeals starts with a non-obstante clause. Neither section 11 nor any other section states that the Code shall apply to the hearing of an appeal. At any rate the Code has no application in so far as the right of appeal and the form of appeal are concerned.
 [436 C & E] 
 4. lt is true that there is no right of appeal against an interlocutory order under section 11 of the Act. The clear propositions laid down by this Court on the meaning of the words "final" and "interlocutory" are (i) that an order may be "final" for one purpose and "interlocutory" for another and (ii) that an order may be final as to a part and interlocutory as to a part. The meaning of the two words has to be determined in relation to the particular purpose For which it is required to be given. [436 G; 438 G] Mohan Lal Magan Lal Thaker v. State of Gujarat, [1967] INSC 304; [1968] 2 SCR 685 referred to.
 (iii) An order may also be conclusive with reference to the stage at which it is made.
 Parameswari Devi v. State [1976] INSC 297; [1977] 2 S.C.R. 160 referred to.
 (iv) The expression 'interlocutory order has been used in section 397(2) of the Code in a restricted sense. It denotes orders of a purely interim or temporary nature which do not decide or touch the important rights or liabilities of the parties and that any order which substantively affects the rights of the accused is not an interlocutory order. [441 A-B] Amar Nath and others v. State of Haryana and others [1976] 1 S.C.R. 222 referred to.
 On this reasoning the order for the framing of a charge against the accused in this case cannot be said to be an interlocutory order. [442 A] (v) An order rejecting the plea of the accused on a point which, when accepted, will conclude a particular proceeding is surely not an interlocutory order within the meaning of section 397(2) of the Code. [444 A] 
 5. The revisional power of the Court concerned under section 397(1) of the Code will be rendered nugatory if the plea that an order framing or directing the framing of a.
 charge against an accused is an interlocutory order and is therefore beyond the reach of that sub-section by virtue of sub-section (2) is accepted. The nature of that order cannot be determined merely with reference to the eventuality that the accused may ultimately be acquitted on the completion of the trial. There is no reason why section 397 should be so narrowly 387 construed and why the real nature of the order framing the charge should be taken to be merely interlocutory order beyond the reach of the revisional power conferred on the Court concerned under section 397 when it cannot be denied that if the contention of the accused against the order framing the charge against him were allowed, that would, by itself, have concluded the proceeding against him. The object cf section 397(1) of the Code is to provide relief to the aggrieved party where it is deserved, only if the order complained of is not of an interlocutory nature. Section 11 of the Act is in that respect quite similar B: in purpose and content to section 397 of the Code and there is no reason why the same meaning and effect should not be given to it. [444 C-F] S. Kuppuswami Rao v. The King [1947] F.C.R. 180; Mohd.
 Amin Bros. v. Dominion of India [1949) F.C.R. held inapplicable.
 
 6. The purpose of an appeal which is in the nature of a judicial examination of a decision by the higher court of a decision of an inferior court is to rectify any possible error in the order under appeal. In that sense the revisional jurisdiction is regarded as a part and parcel of the appellate jurisdiction. Statutes pertaining to a right of appeal should be liberally construed and any doubt regarding that right should be resolved in favour of the right. [445 H] 
 7. Section 11 of the Act gives a right of appeal against "any order" of a Special Court and not merely from its "final order". It is well settled that the Dr use of the words 'any order ' in Article 136, along with the other difference of language, had "greatly widened' the scope of Article 136 in regard to the appeal thereunder. Section 11 of the Act not only grants that remedy in the case of "any order" but allows it as a matter of right whereas the remedy under Article 136 is in terms discretionary. Section 11 takes care to state categorically that the appeal thereunder shall relate both to the facts and the law. lt is, therefore, a liberal and beneficial provision in favour of the aggrieved party and excels the Remedy under section 397 of the Code. [446 D; F-G] 
 8. The correct way of interpreting a provision of law with a non-obstante clause is to first ascertain what the enacting part of the section provides according to the natural and ordinary meaning and the non-obstante clause is to be understood as operating to set aside as no longer valid anything contained in the relevant existing laws which is inconsistent with the new enactment. [447 B-C] Aswini Kumar and another v. Arabinda Bose and another [1952] INSC 50; [1953] S.C.R. 1.
 
 9. The revisional power under the Code is discretionary and is not available to an aggrieved party as of right. The remedy by way of a revision petition has been hedged round with certain limitations and restrictions, whereas section 11 ensures a right of appeal "both on facts and on law '.
 What section 11 does is to do away with the power of revision under the Code (sub-section 2) and to substitute for it an unlimited right of appeal against any judgment, sentence or order of she Special Court so long as the impugned order is not of an interlocutory nature. The aggrieved party has really lost nothing to which it would have been entitled under the Code for Section 397(2) also specifically states that the power of revision conferred by sub-section ( I ) shall not be exercise(l in relation to an interlocutory order. The net effect of the non-obstante clause. therefore. is to widen the remedy available under the Code. [447 H; 448 A-B] 
 10. While under the Code two correctional remedies are open to the aggrieved party-one by way of an appeal and other by way of petition for revision 388 which however is a remedy within the discretion of the High Court or the Sessions Judge-section 11 of the Act makes any and every judgment, sentence or order appealable so long as the order is not of an interlocutory nature. In respect of an interlocutory order, however, no remedy by way of appeal or revision is permissible under the Code and the position in that respect is not worse under section 11 of the Act.
 The right of appeal under section 11 is, therefore, wider than the appellate and revisional remedies provided by the Code. [448 G-H] In the instant case the decision which the Judge took in making the impugned order clearly dealt with at least one important stage and aspect of the case against the accused finally and once for all. That order clearly put him to full course of trial and there is no reason why it should not be treated as "any order" against which he is entitled to appeal under section 11 of the Act and why it should be considered to be a merely interlocutory order. [450 B-C] 
 11. An order framing a charge affects a person's liberties substantially and it is the duty of the Court to consider judicially whether the material warrants the framing of the charge. [451 B] 
 12. The question whether an order is final or interlocutory is not to be determined merely from the character of the proceeding in which it is entered but from the character of the relief granted or refused [451 H]
