 On 12.6.1958, the respondent joined Indian Railway Stores Service as Class I officer. He was promoted as District Controller of Stores in 1974, as Additional Controller of Stores in 1980 and as Controller of Stores in 1982.
 Respondent was served a major penalty charge-sheet dated 5.12.1989 on the charge of finalisation of a tender case of 1983 and another major penalty charge-sheet dated 23.4.1990 on the charge of construction of a residential house during 1981-87 at high cost.
 By order dated 24.4.1990, which was served on the respondent on 28.1.1991 the was compulsory retired. The delay in the service of the order was due to the court proceedings initiated against him.
 Respondent challenged the order dated 24.4.1990 before the Central Administrative Tribunal.
 The Union of India submitted before the Tribunal that the right to retire a Government servant prematurely was an absolute one and the only requirement was that there should be the formation of an opinion; that in the present case, the opinion was formed in public interest and the 854 requirement of the Rule was strictly complied with.
 The tribunal allowed the application against which the Union of India filed the present appeal by special leave.
 Allowing the Appeal, this Court, 
HELD : 1.01. An order of a compulsory retirement is not an order of punishment. It is actually a prerogative of the Government but it should be based on material and has to be passed on the subjective satisfaction of the Government.
 Very often, on enquiry by the Court the Government may disclose the material but it is very much different from the saying that the order should be a speaking order. No order of compulsory retirement is required to be a speaking order.
 [861A-B] 1.02. The Tribunal completely erred in assuming, in the circumstances of the case, that there ought to have been a speaking order for compulsory retirement. [860H] 1.03. From the very order of the Tribunal it is clear that the Government had, before it, the report of the Review Committee yet it thought it fit of compulsory retiring the respondent. The order cannot be called either mala fide or arbitrary in law. [861C] Baikuntha Nath Das and another v. Chief District Medical Officer, Baripada and another[1992] INSC 57; , [1992] 2 SCC 299; R.L.
