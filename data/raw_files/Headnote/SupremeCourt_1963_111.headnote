 The respondent, a Bank employee not belonging to Subordinate staff, was transferred from one station to another. In an application filed by him under s. 33A of the Industrial Disputes. Act, he contended that the order of his transfer was mala fide and as was act of victimisation for his lawful trade union activities. He prayed for the cancellation of his transfer order. His prayer was accepted by the Labour Court which held that the transfer of the respondent was against the Sastry Award which provided that a clerk like the respondent could not be transferred outside the State or the language area in which he had been serving except with his consent.
 The appellant came to this Court by special leave. His contention was that the Sastry Award did not absolutely prohibit the Bank from transferring workmen not belonging to the subordinate staff outside the State or the language area in which he had been serving except with his consent.
 Moreover, as the order of the Bank had been found to be bona fide, there was no contravention of the Sastry Award, Held that the Sastry Award makes a distinction between the workmen belonging to the subordinate staff and others.
 While there was absolute prohibition against the transfer of the subordinate staff from their language area, there was no such absolute prohibition with regard to other workmen. The Sastry Award had laid down that "as far as possible", the other workmen were not to be transferred outside their language area but that left discretion with the Banks to transfer employee of the category of the respondent if the best interests 269 of the Bank so required. It was for the Bank to decide how to distribute its manpower in its best interests, Transfers were to be avoided if that could be done without scarifying the interests of the Bank.
