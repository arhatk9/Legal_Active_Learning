 The Government of Mysore State conducts four medical colleges two of which are affiliated to the Universities of Mysore and Bangalore, the other two being affiliated to Karnatak University. C passed her pre-university course examination from Bangalore University with 67% marks in optional subjects, namely Physics, Chemistry and Biology.
 She then passed the, B.Sc. Part I examination of Karnatak University. Under the Ordinances of the Karnatak University, she was entitled to be admitted to the M.B.B.S.
 course of Karnatak University. However the Selection Committee formed under the Mysore Medical Colleges (Selection for Admission) Rules 1970 did not select her for admission to that course because of Rule 9 of the said Rules under which preference for admission to a medical college run by a University was given to students who had passed the P.U.C. Examination of the same University and only 20% of the seats were available to those passing the P.U.C.
 Examination of other Universities. C filed a writ petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution on the following contentions: (1) that once the petitioner was eligible for admission to a medical college affiliated to the Karnatak University according to the Ordinances of that University, the State Government could not make rules, the effect of which was to deprive her of admission; (2) that the university-wise distribution of seats provided under r. 9(1) was discriminatory and being without any rational basis violated Art. 14 of the Constitution; (3) that the reservation of seats under rr. 4 & 5 for the various categories of persons set out therein was far more excessive than permitted by the decisions of this Court and was in violation of Art. 15(4).
 V passed her P.U.C. examination from a government college affiliated to Venkateshwar University in Andhra Pradesh with Physics, Chemistry and Biology as her optional subjects, securing in those subjects 150 out of 200 marks i.e. 75%.
 On July 1970 she made an application for selection 609 to a seat in in any one of the medical colleges affiliated to Karnatak University. The Selection Committee did not include her in the list of selected candidates and the reason given was that she was not a resident of the State of Mysore for not less than 10 years at any time prior to the date of the application for a seat as required by r. 3 of the Mysore Medical Colleges (Selection for Admission) Rules 1970. In this connection the petitioner filed a certificate from the Tahsildar, Bellary that she had resided in the State of Mysore for a period of 10 years before her application. It was further stated on her behalf that though she had left the State of Mysore on the transfer of her father to Andhra Pradesh before she was ten years old, she had continued to come and reside at her family house in the State of Mysore during her vacations.
 J. challenged the validity of r. 4(h) of the aforesaid Rules on the ground that the reservation for children of 'political sufferers' made therein was not valid under the Constitution.
 Held: (i) So long as the rules for selection applicable to the medical colleges run by Government do not suffer from any constitutional or legal infirmity, they cannot be challenged as the Government can regulate admission to its own institutions. The objection that it cannot by such rules, provide for requirements over and above those laid down by the universities for eligibility, cannot be sustained. [617D-E] (ii) Since the universities are set up for satisfying the educational needs of different areas where they are set up and medical colleges are established in those areas, it can safely be presumed that they also were so set up to satisfy the needs for medical training of those attached to those universities. There is nothing undesirable in ensuring as has been done under r. 9 (1) that those attached to such universities have their ambitions to have training in specialised subjects like medicine satisfied through colleges attached to their own universities. Such a basis for selection has not the disadvantage of district wise or unit wise selection as any student from any part of the state can pass the qualifying examination in any of the three universities irrespective of his place of birth or residence. Further the rules confer a discretion on the selection committee to admit outsiders upto 20% of the total available seats in any one of these colleges i.e. those who have passed the equivalent examination held by any other university not only in the state but also elsewhere in India. It was therefore impossible to say that the basis of selection adopted in those rules would defeat the object of the rules as was said in Rajendran's case. [619E-620C] The rules lay down a valid classification. Candidates passing through the qualifying examination held by a university form a class by themselves as distinguished from those passing through such examination from the other two universities. Such a classification has a reasonable nexus with the object of the rules, namely, to cater to the needs of candidates who would naturally look to their own university to advance their training in technical studies, such as medical studies. The rules therefore cannot justly be attached on the ground of hostile discrimination or as being otherwise in breach of Art. 14. [620G-621A] (iii) Setting apart 60 seats under r. 4 is not a reservation but laying down sources for selection necessitated by certain overriding considerations, such as obligations towards those who serve the interest of the country,s security, certain reciprocal obligations and the like. The reservation under r. 5 though apparently appearing on the high side, not having been shown as unreasonably excessive the contention in regard to it must fail. [622B] 39-1 S.C. India/71 610 (iv) The residence contemplated by r. 3 must prima facie have an element of continuity or regularity in residence and would not mean all intermittent stay such as during the vacations. It would thus appear that V did not, withstanding the certificate of residence issued by the Tehsildar, comply with the requirement of 10 years residence under r. 3. However the percentage of 750/, marks claimed by the petitioner was only in respect of optional subjects.
 Her aggregate marks were only 65% as compared to 65.6% obtained by the student last selected and on the basis of this percentage her application was rightly rejected. It was therefore not necessary to go into the facts relating to the petitioner's residence in Mysore State or the validity of r. 3. [624B-F, G-H] (v) Per Shelat & Bhargava, JJ. (Dua J. dissenting) The definition of 'political sufferer' in r. 4(h) is in clear and unambiguous language, besides containing sufficient details so as to distinctively identify the persons who would fall within it. The person must have suf- fered incarceration, whether as imprisonment or detention, for a period of at least six months or been awarded capital punishment, or must have died while actually in detention or undergoing imprisonment, or killed or incapacitated permanently by firing or lathi charge by the police or by the military, or must have lost employment, property, or means of livelihood. These should have been the consequences 'of his having participated in the national movement for the emancipation of India. There was thus no ambiguity in the definition of political sufferer which would result in discrimination in administering the rule.
 [626F-H] It is not unreasonable to extend the principle on which Art.
 15 (4) is based to the children of political sufferers who in consequence of their participation in the emancipation struggle became unsettled in life, in some cases economically ruined, and were therefore not in a position to make available to their children that class of education which would place them in fair competition with the children of those who did not suffer from that disadvantage. If that be so, it must follow that the definition of 'Political sufferer' not only makes the children of such sufferers distinguishable from the rest but such classification has a reasonable nexus with the object of the rules which can be nothing else than a fair and just distribution of seats.
 [629G-630C] Per Dua, J. The object of selection for admission to the medical colleges, considered in the light of the directive principles of State policy contained in our Constitution appears to be to select the best material from amongst the candidates in order not only to provide them with adequate means of livelihood, but also to provide the much needed medical aid to the people and to improve public health generally. It cannot be confidently said that there is a reasonable nexus between the differential on which the children of political sufferers are classified as a distinct group and the object of admission to the Medical Colleges.
 In view however of the admitted fact that the marks obtained by J were lower than the marks secured by the last candidate admitted from the category of the children of political sufferers, the petitioner was not entitled to claim admission, even if the children of political sufferers were not given any priority. On this ground alone the petition of J deserved to be dismissed. Accordingly it was unnecessary to go into the question of the invalidity of r.
 4(h) in this case. [632F-H] In view of the above findings the writ petitions must be dismissed.
