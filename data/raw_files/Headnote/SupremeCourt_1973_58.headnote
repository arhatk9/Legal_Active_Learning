 The respondent erected a factory on a plot of land allotted to them by the Faridabad Development Board. They agreed to sell their rights in the plot and the factory to the appellants. Disputes having arisen between the parties on certain matters relating to the agreement, they were referred to arbitration. The arbitrator gave an award and a decree was passed in terms of the award. Under the award, the appellants were liable to discharge the liability of the respondents to the Faridabad Development Board in the sumof ab out Rs. 23,000/-. The appellants were to pay this amount within 1 1/2 years, or, alternatively, to obtain from the Board within that period a complete discharge for the respondents. In default of such payment, the respondents were entitled to take back possession of the plot and factory. The appellants paid only a sum of Rs. 8,000/- to the Board and this sum was shown in the accounts of the Board as if paid by the respondents. As the appellants committed default the respondents took out execution. The appellants opposed the application but the High Court, in Letters Patent appeal, directed execution to proceed.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD: (1) There is no support for the contention of the appellants that the default on their part-occurred by reason of the non-cooperation of the respondents. The evidence shows that the appellants were not in a position to make the payment. [807F-G] (2) By the respondents transferring their entire interest in the property to the appellants there existed a foundation for the creation of privity between the appellants and the Board'; but the Board never agreed to substitute the appellants as its debtors in place of the respondents. Even after accepting the sum of Rs. 8,000/- from the appellants, the Board was entitled to recover the balance from the respondents. [807H; 808 B-D] Kandarpa Nag v.

 (3) The recital in the award that on the failure of the appellants to make the payment the respondents were entitled to take back possession of the plot and the factory has to be considered in the entire scheme of the award, and so considered, there is no doubt that it was not merely the possession of the property but the title thereto also would pass to the respondents. [809 C-D] (4) The appellants' liability to pay the dues of the Board would operate only if the title to the property is vested in them. [809E-F] (5) The tenor of the award shows that the arbitrator did not intend merely to declare the rights of the parties. It is a clear intendment of the award that if the appellants defaulted in discharging their obligation under the award the respondents would be entitled to apply for execution and obtain possession of the property. [809 F-H] 803 (6) The clause in the award providing for the right of the respondents it to obtain possession of the property on the appellants committing default is not in the nature of a penalty against which the appellants are entitled to be relieved. Moreover, the term is contained in a decree passed by the Court in terms of the award and no relief can be granted as against the terms of a decree., The award- decree could not be treated as a consent decree, because, the award was valid on its, own independently of any decision of the parties not to object to it.
