 The first plaintiff was a Society registered under the Bihar and Orissa Co-operative Societies Act, 1935, and the second plaintiff was its Secretary. The Society had an account with the first defendant Bank. The 6th and the 7th defendants were the joint secretary and treasurer of the Society respectively, who were jointly authorised to operate on the account. A sum of Rs. 11,000 was withdrawn from the account by means of a cheque which did not come out of the cheque book of the Society but which was a loose cheque form surrendered by an ex-constituent of the Bank. The spurious cheque bore the signature of the 7th defendant and the forged signature of the 6th defendant. The suit against the Bank, its manager (the 2nd defendant) its employees (the 3rd, 4th and 5th defendants) and ,defendants 6 and 7 was decreed against defendants 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7 jointly. On appeal by the 1st and 2nd defendants, the High Court found in favour of the plaintiffs-on the merits of the case, but dismissed the suit on the ground that the jurisdiction of the civil court was ousted by the combined operation of ss.
 48(9) and 57 of the Act.
 On appeal to this Court, the defendants sought to support the judgment of the High Court on the ground that the words in Explanation (1) to s. 48(1) of the Act must be understood in their widest amplitude, so that, even if a dispute between a registered society and a non-member did not fall within any of the categories 48(1) (a) to (e), it would still be within the purview of the section by reason of the Explanation.
 
HELD: The judgment of the High Court should be set aside. [858 A] (i) The scheme of s. 48(1) is that certain disputes touching the business of a registered society should be referred to the Registrar and not be taken to civil courts and made the subject matter of prolonged litigation. Before the Act was amended by Bihar Act 16 of 1948 disputes in which a Society might be involved with non-members (except as sureties) were not within the section. Therefore, the Explanation to the section as it then stood, made no mention of non-members as such and only served to clear up the doubt as to whether a dispute was referable to the Registrar when the debt or demand was admitted and the only point at issue was the ability to pay or the manner of enforcement of payment. The amendment in 1948, introduced cl. (e) in s.
 48(1) by which a dispute in which one of the disputants was not a member of a society was also covered by the section.
 But only those non-members who bad disputes with a financing bank were made amenable to the jurisdiction of the Registrar, and in the present case the Society was not a financing bank. Therefore cl. (e) would not apply. Nor would the amended Explanation apply, because the Explanation had to include non-members after the insertion of category (e) in a. 48(1), but, by such inclusion, the Explanation did not widen the scope of s. 48(1) so as to include claims by societies against all non-members ,even if they were not included in cl. (e). The Explanation cannot be read 849 as adding a new head to the categories under s. 48 (1) (a) to (e) of disputes which may be referred to the Registrar.
 It must be read only so as to harmonise with and clear up any ambiguity in the main section. [854 B, E.H; 855 A-C] Sagauli Sugar Works (Pw.) Ltd. v. Asstt. Registrar, Co- operative Societies, Motihari, [1962] Supp. 3 S.C.R. 804, followed.
 (ii) Because the signature of the 6th defendant was forged, there never was any mandate by the Society to the Bank.
 Therefore, there was no negligence on the part of the Society. On the Contrary, there was negligence on the part of the Bank in not ascertaining whether the signatures on the cheque were genuine and the circumstances attending the encashment of the cheque showed conclusively that the Bank was negligent and some of its officers fraudulent [857 E-G] London Joint Stock Bank, Ltd. v.
