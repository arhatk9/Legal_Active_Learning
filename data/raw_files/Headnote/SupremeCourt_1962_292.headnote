 The respondent, a non-gazetted permanent employee of the State, was charged with (i) having received illegal gratifi- cation on five occasions and (ii) being possession of property disproportionate to his income. The Governor.
 referred is case to the Administrative Tribunal constituted under s. 4 (1) of the Disciplinary Proceeding,;
 (Administrative Tribunal) Rules which had been framed under Art. 309 of tile Constitution.. The Tribunal found four out of the five heads under the first charge and the second charge proved and recommended the dismissal of the respondent. The Governor, after giving the respondent a reasonable opportunity. to ,how cause against the proposed punishment, dismissed him. The respondent filed a writ petition before the High Court challenging the order of dismissal on the ground that the Tribunal Rules were discriminatory and that in holding the enquiry the Tribunal had violated the rules of natural justice. Following a previous decision the High Court held that the Tribunal Rules were discriminatory but since that decision was under appeal before the Supreme Court, it proceeded to deal with the second ground. It held that the second charge and only two head,, of the first charge were established and directed the Governor to reconsider whether on the basis of these charges the punishment of dismissal should be maintained.
 Held, that the Tribunal Rules were not discriminatory.
 There were simultaneously in existence two sets of parallel rules, viz. the Tribunal Rules and the Classification Rules and proceedings could be taken against the respondent under either of the at the discretion of the Governor. But in substance there 649 is no difference in the procedures prescribed by the two sets of rules. Mere adoption of one procedure in preference to another permissible procedure does not justify an inference ;of unlawful discrimination. The fact that under the Classification Rules there is a right of appeal from an order imposing a penalty whereas there is no such right of appeal under the Tribunal Rules against the order passed by the Governor was not a ground for sustaining the plea of unlawful discrimination.

 Held, further that the High Court had no power to direct the Governor to reconsider the question of punishment. The High Court has only to see whether the constitutional guarantees have been violated; but it is not concerned with the penalty imposed, provided it is justified by the rules. The reasons which induce the punishing authority are not justiciable nor is the penalty open to review by the Court. If the order can be supported on any finding as 'to substantial misdemeanour for which the punishment can lawfully be imposed it is not for the court to consider whether that ground alone would have weighed with the authority dismissing the public servant.
