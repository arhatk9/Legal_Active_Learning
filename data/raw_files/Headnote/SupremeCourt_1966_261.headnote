 The Council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, by a notification issued on February 22, 1964, in exercise of powers conferred by cl. (ii) of Part 11 of the Second Schedule to the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949, notified, inter alia, that a member of the Institute shall be deemed to be guilty of misconduct if, in connection with elections to the Councils of the lnstitute., he took part directly or indirectly in (1) issuing manifestoes or circulars; (2) canvassing votes by visiting places of business or residence of the voters or in any other manner.
 The appellant, who was a prospective candidate for election to the Central Council of the Institute, filed a writ petition to quash the notification. It was contended on his behalf that the power of the Council to issue a notification is limited by the express provisions of cl. (ii) of Part II of the Second Schedule to the Act. Under cl. (i) any contravention of the provisions of the Act or of the Regulations made thereunder was professional misconduct;
 therefore the expression "other act or omission" in cl. (ii) must be an act or omission other than those covered by the Act or the Regulations. Under cl. (2) of Regulation 54-A, undue influence by interfering with the free exercise of any electoral rights was misconduct, but the proviso to cl. (2) which permitted a declaration of policy or a promise of a particular action saved the issuing of manifestoes and circulars from the operation of the substantive part of the clause. The appellant therefore claimed that he had a legal right to issue circulars or manifestoes within the meaning of the proviso and that the impugned notification being in derogation of the Regulation, was illegal.
 It was further contended that the notification was inconsistent with cl. (4B) of Regulation 54A, because that clause only prohibited canvassing for votes within a distance of 200 meters from the polling booths, thereby impiedly permitting canvassing beyond that distance; cf.
 (4B) detracted only to a limited extent from the legal right to canvass and the impugned notification containing a prohibition against general canvassing beyond these limits contravened both cl. (2) and cl. (4B) of Regulation 54-A and was therefore bad.
 The High Court held that the impugned notification in so far as it directed that the issuing of manifestoes or circulars was misconduct, was illegal; but that the rest of it was valid. On appeal to this Court by the appellant and upon a cross-appeal by the respondent.
 HELD: The entire notification was valid.
 Although the act of issuing a manifesto or a circular would not amount to undue influence by virtue of the proviso to Regulation 54-A(2) such 257 act was constituted by the notification a different head of professional misconduct which the Council was authorised to do under cl. (ii) of Part II of the Second Schedule to the Act. [263 H] The Council had the power to issue the notification prohibiting canvassing of votes and the notification was not inconsistent with either the provisions of the Act or the Regulations. [263 F] While the Regulations provide for disciplinary action for undue influence and for canvassing for votes within a distance of 200 meters from a polling booth, the notification placed other acts and omissions under different heads of misconduct. There is no inherent conflict between undue influence, canvassing of votes by visiting the places of business or the residence of the voters, and canvassing within a distance of 200 metres from a polling booth. All the three can stand together. [262 H] The appellant did not have any unlimited right to canvass for vote either statutory or otherwise. His rights were defined by the statute and it could not be said that such an unlimited right to canvass is implicit in the right to stand for election. [263 B] The electorate was an enlightened body and the elections were to a council designed to maintain high standards of the profession. Canvassing may be necessary for explaining to an illiterate voter the qualifications of a candidate and the principles for which he stands or in the case of a vast electorate with which the candidate may not be familiar, but no such necessity exists in the case of enlightened voters of a compact electorate The impugned notification was not therefore unreasonable in the sense that expression is understood in law. [263 C] [The question whether the notification was violative of Article 19 of the Constitution and whether that Article could be invoked notwithstanding the fact that a state of emergency was in force, was left open.] [259 A-B]
