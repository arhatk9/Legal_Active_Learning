 On November 24, 1983, the Court by its judgment and order directed that a writ of Habeas Corpus be issued-Though the 1st, 2nd and 4th respondents were served, they failed to file a return to the Writ. However a return on affidavit by one Ajai Vikram Singh Director, Ministry of Defence was filed on 12.12.1983 expressing their inability to produce the two named officers due to circumstances beyond their control and their failure to trace them even with the assistance of Central Bureau of Investigation. This was supported by a copy of the report by the Dy. Inspector General of Police (s).
 Making the Rule absolute the Court, ^ 
 HELD 1. In compliance with the mandatory direction contained in the Writ of Habeas Corpus, the person to whom it is directed is under a legal obligation to produce the body of the person alleged to be unlawfully detained before the Court on the day specified and to make a formal return to the writ. Here, such a writ has been issued and there has been failure to produce the missing persons in respect of whom writ is issued and to file the return as mandated by law. [547E-F] 2:1 The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 defines 'contempt of court' in Sec. 2(a) to mean 'civil contempt or criminal contempt'. 'Civil contempt' is defined in Sec. 2(b) to mean willful disobedience to any judgment decree, direction, order, writ or other process of a Court or willful breach of an undertaking given to a Court'. Willful disobedience to a writ issued by the Court constitutes civil contempt. [547H;
 548A] 2:2 Mere failure to obey the writ may not constitute civil contempt depending upon the facts and circumstances of the case. But willful disobedience to a writ issued by a Court constitutes civil contempt. Again it is well settled that the appropriate mode of enforcing obedience to a writ of habeas corpus is by committal for contempt. A committal order may be 545 made against a person who intentionally makes a false return to a writ of habeas corpus, but an unintentional misrepresentation on a return is not a ground for committal.
 [548B-C] 2:3 The view of this Court as expressed in the main judgment clearly indicates that the assertion of respondents 1, 2 and 4 that C. Daniel and C. Paul left Phungrei Camp where 21st Sikh Regiment were stationed is not correct and that to avoid responsibility flowing from the mysterious disappearance of C. Daniel and C. Paul an attempt was made to suggest that they had left alive in the company of their compatriots. On that conclusion one can say that there is a willful disobedience to the writ of habeas corpus by misleading the court by presenting a distorted version of facts not borne out by the record. It is thus established that the respondents 1, 2 and 4 have committed civil contempt by their willful disobedience to the writ. [548D-E] 3:1 Civil contempt is punishable with imprisonment as well as fine. In a given case, the court may also penalise the party in contempt by ordering him to pay the costs of the application. A fine can also be imposed upon the contemnor. [548F] 3:2 In the facts and circumstances of the case, keeping in view the torture, the agony and the mental oppression through which Mrs. C. Thingkhuila, wife of Shri C. Daniel and Mrs. C. Vangamla, wife of Shri C. Paul had to pass and they being the proper applicants, the formal application being by. Sebastion M. Hongray, the court considered it proper and directed that as a measure of exemplary costs as is permissible in such cases, respondents Nos. 1 and 2 shall pay Rs. 1 lac to each of the aforementioned two women within a period of four weeks from April 23, 1984.
 [548G-H; 549A] 
 4. Further adjourning the matter to enable the respondents to trace or locate the two missing persons is to shut the eyes to the reality and to peruse a mirage. The two officers have not met their tragic end in an encounter as is usually claimed and the only possible inference that can be drawn from circumstance of the case is that both of them must have met an unnatural death. Prima facie, it would be an offence of murder. Who is individually or collectively the perpetrator of the crime or is responsible for their disappearance will have to be determined by a proper, thorough and responsible police investigation. It is not necessary to start casting a doubt on anyone or any particular person. But prima facie there is material on record to reach an affirmative conclusion that both Shri C.
 Daniel and Shri C. Paul are not alive and have met an unnatural death. And the Union of India cannot disown the responsibility in this behalf. [549B-E] (The Court issued a writ of mandamus to the Superintendent of Police, Ukhrul, Manipur State to treat all the papers in the Writ of Habeas Corpus as "information of a cognizable offence and to commence investigation as" prescribed by the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure.)
