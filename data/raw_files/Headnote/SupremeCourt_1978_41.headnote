 Respondent No. 1 in (C.A. 1375 of 1977) was a workman employed as an operator in the Undertaking of the appellant from 1st March, 1970 and was in receipt of Rs. 100/- per month as salary, which would have been raised to Rs. 115/- per month from 1st October, 1972, if he had continued in service with the appellant. But on 21st December, 1971 the 1st Respondent was suspended by the appellant and a Charge- sheet was served upon him and before any inquiry on the basis of this Charge-sheet could be held another Charge- sheet was given to him on 17th April, 1973. This was followed by a regular inquiry and ultimately the appellant, finding the 1st Respondent guilty, dismissed him from service by an order dated 23rd December, 1974. Since, an Industrial Dispute was pending at the time when the 1st Respondent was dismissed from service in view of the provisions contained in S. 33(2)(b) of the Industrial Disputes Act, the appellant immediately approached Industrial Tribunal at Chandigarh before which the Industrial dispute was pending for approval of the action taken by it. The appellant, however, withdrew that application and the Industrial Tribunal, thereupon, made an order on 4th September 1976 dismissing the application as withdrawn. The 1st Respondent then demanded from the appellant full wages from the date of his suspension till the date of demand, contending that as the action of the appellant dismissing him was not approved by the Industrial Tribunal, he continued to be in service and was entitled to all the emoluments. The appellant did not respond to this demand of the 1st Respondent. whereupon, the latter made an application to the Labour Court under S. 33-C(2) for determination and payment of the amount of wages due to him from the date of suspension on the ground that the appellant not having obtained the approval of the Industrial Tribunal to the dismissal under s. 33(2)(b) the Order of dismissal was void and the 1st Respondent continued to be in service and was entitled to receive his wages from the appellant.
 The appellant resisted this application under S. 33-C(2) inter alia on the ground that the application under S. 33(2) (b) having been withdrawn the position was as if no application bad been made at all, with the result that there was contravention of S. 33(2)(b) but such contravention did not render the order of dismissal void ab Into and it was merely illegal and unless it was set aside in an appropriate proceeding taken by the 1st Respdt. under S. 33-A or a reference under S. 10, the Labour 37 1 Court had no jurisdiction under S. 33-C(2) to direct payment of wages to the 1st Respondent on the basis that he continued in service and the application made by the 1st Respondent accordingly was incompetent.
 The Labour Court rejected the contention of the appellant and held that since reference in regard to an industrial dispute between the appellant and the workman was pending before the Industrial Tribunal, it was not competent to the appellant to pass an order of dismissal against the 1st Respondent, unless the action so taken was approved by the Industrial Tribunal under s. 33 (2)(b) and consequently the appellant having withdrawn the application for approval under S. 3 3 (2) (b) and the approval of the industrial Tribunal to the order of dismissal not having been obtained the order of dismissal was ineffective and the Labour Court had jurisdiction to entertain the application of the 1st Respondent under S. 33-C(2) and to direct the appellant- to pay the arrears of wages to the 1st Respondent. The Labour Court accordingly, allowed the application of the 1st Respondent and directed the appellant to pay an aggregate sum of Rs. 6485.48 to the 1st Respondent on account of arrears of wages upto 30th September 1966. Similarly, on identical facts the Labour Court also allowed the application of another workman Shri Jagdish Singh (1st Respondent in Civil Appeal No. 1384 of 1977) and directed the appellant to pay him a sum of Rs. 6286.80 in respect of arrears of wages upto the same date. The appellant thereupon preferred Civil Appeals Nos. 1375 and 1384 of 1977 after obtaining special leave from this Court.
 Allowing the appeals, by special leave and converting the arrears of wages into compensation, the Court.
 
HELD : 1.(a) It is only if an order of dismissal passed in contravention of section 33 (2)(b) is null and void that the aggrieved workman would be entitled to maintain an application under section 33C(2) for determination and payment of the amount of wages due to him on the basis of that he continues in service despite the order of dismissal.
 [376 E-F] (b) A proceeding under section 33C(2) is a proceeding in the nature of executive proceeding in which the Labour Court calculates the amount of money due to a workman from his employer, or, if the workman is entitled to any benefit which is capable of being computed in terms of money, pro- ceeds to compute the benefit in terms of money. But the right to the money which is sought to be calculated or to the benefit which is sought to be computed must be an existing one. that is to say, already adjudicated upon of provided for and must arise in the course of and in relation to the relation ship between the industrial workmen, and his employer. [376 F-H] Chief Mining Engineer, East India Coal Co. Ltd. v. Rameshwar and Ors [1968] 1 SCR 140, referred to.
 (c) It is not competent to the Labour Court exercising jurisdiction under section 33(C)(2) to arrogate to itself the functions of an industrial tribunal and entertain a claim which is not based on an existing right but which mat appropriately be made the subject-matter of an industrial dispute in a reference under section 10 of the Act. [376 H, 377 A] Gopal v. Union of India, [1968]1 L.L.J. 589; Central Bank of India Lta v. S. Rajagopalan etc, [19641 3 S.C.R. 140, applied.
 
2. (a) The object of the legislature in enacting section 33 clearly appears to be to protect the workman concerned in the dispute which forms the subject-matter of pending conciliation or adjudication-proceedings, against vict- misation by the employer on account of his having raised the industrial dispute or his continuing the pending proceedings and to ensure that the pending proceedings are brought to an expeditious termination in a peaceful atmosphere, undisturbed by any subsequent cause tending to further exacerbate the already strained relations between the employer and the workmen. But at the same time it recognises that occasions may arise when the employer may be 372 justified in discharging or punishing by dismissal his employee and so it allows the employer to take such action, subject to the condition that in the one case before doing so, he must obtain the express permission in writing of the Tribunal before which the proceeding is pending and in the other, he must immediately apply to the Tribunal for approval of the action taken by him. [378 F-H] (b) The only scope of the inquiry before.the Tribunal exercising jurisdiction under section 33 is to decide whether the ban imposed on the employer by this section should be lifted or maintained by granting or refusing the permission or approval asked for by the employer. If the permission or approval is refused by the Tribunal, the employer would be precluded from discharging or punishing the workman by way of dismissal and the action of discharge or dismissal already taken would be void. But the reverse is not true for even if the permission or approval is to be granted that would not validate the action of discharge or punishment by way of dismissal taken by the employer. The permission or approval would merely remove the ban so as to enable the employer to make an order of discharge or dismissal and thus avoid incurring the penalty under section 31(1), but the validity of the order of discharge or dismissal would still be liable to be tested in a reference at the instance of the workmen under section 10. The workman would be entitled to raise an industrial dispute in regard to the order of discharge or dismissal and have it referred for adjudication under s. 10 and the Tribunal in such reference would be entitled to interfere with the order of discharge or dismissal within the limits held down by this Court in several decisions commencing from Indian Iron

3. (a) The exposition of the statute has to be ex visceribus Actus. No one section of a statute should be read in isolation, but it should be construed with reference to the context and other provisions of the statute, so as, as far as possible, to make a consistent enactment of the whole status. [377 F-G 380 C] Colguhoun v. Brooks, (1889) 14 A.C. 493 at 506 referred to.
 Lincoln College Case [1595] 3 Co. Rep.b referred to.
 (b) Section 33 in both its limbs undoubtedly uses language which is mandatory in terms and section 31(1) makes it penal for the employer to commit a breach of the provisions of Section 33 and therefore, if section 33 stood done' it might lend itself to the construction that any action by way of discharge or dismissal taken against the workman would be void if it is in contravention of Section 33. But Section 33 cannot be read in isolation. Section 33 must be construed not as if it were standing alone and apart from the rest of the Act, but in the light of the next following section 33A and if these two sections are read together, it is clear that the legislative intent was not to invalidate an order of discharge or dismissal passed in contravention of section 33, despite the mandatory language employed in the section and the penal provision enacted in section 31(1) [380 B-C, D-E] 
4. (a) Section 33A gives to a workman aggrieved by an order of discharge of dismissal passed against him in contravention of section 33, the right to move the Tribunal for redress of his grievance without having to take recourse section 10. [580 H, 381 A] (b) The first issue which is required to be decided in a complaint filed by an aggrieved workman under section 33A is whether order of discharge or dismissal made by the employer is in contravention of Section 33. The foun- 373 dation of the complaint under section 33A is contravention of section 33 and if the workman is unable to show that the employer has contravened section 33 in making the order of discharge or dismissal, the complaint would be liable to be rejected. But if the contravention of section 33 is established, the next question would be whether the order of discharge or dismissal passed by the employer is justified on merits. The Tribunal would have to go into this question and decide whether, on the merits, the order of discharge or dismissal passed by the employer is justified and if it is, the Tribunal would sustain the order, treating the breach of section 33 as a mere technical breach. Since, in such a case, the original order of discharge or dismissal would stand justified, it would not be open to the Tribunal, unless there are compelling circumstances, to make any substantial order of compensation in favour of the workman.
 The Tribunal would have to consider all the aspects of the case and ultimately what order would meet the ends of justice would necessarily have to be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case. But mere contravention of section 33 by the employer will not entitle the workman to an order of reinstatement, because inquiry under section 33A is not confined only to the determination of the question as to whether the employer is proved, the Tribunal has to go further and deal also with the merits of the order of discharge or dismissal. [382 H, 383 A-D] The Automobile Products of India Ltd. v. Rukmaji Bala and Ors. [1955] INSC 4; [1955] 1 S.C.R. 1241; Equitable Coal Co. v. Algu Singh, A.I.R. 1958 S.C. 761, Punja National Bonk Ltd. v. Its Workmen, [1959] INSC 121; [1960] 1 S.C.R. 806 @ 826, applied.
 (c) The very fact that even after the contravention of section 33 is proved, the Tribunal is required to go into the further question whether the order of discharge or dismissal passed by the employer is justified on the merits, clearly indicates that the order of discharge is not rendered void and inoperative by such contravention. [383 E- F] (d) If the contravention of section 33 were construed as having an invalidating effect on the order of discharge or dismissal, section 33A would be rendered meaningless and fultile because in that event, the workman would invariably prefer to make an application under section 33(C)(2) for determination and payment of the wages due to him on the basis that he continues to be in service. If the workman filed a complaint under section 33A, he would not be entitled to succeed merely by showing that there is contravention of section 33 and the question whether the order of discharge or dismissal is justified on the merits would be gone into by the Tribunal and if, on merits, it is found to be justified, it would be sustained as valid despite contravention of section 33, but if, on the other hand, instead of proceeding under section 33A, he makes an application under section 33C(2), it would be enough for him to show contravention of section 33 and he would then be entitled to claim wages on the basis that he continues in service. Another consequent which would arise on this interpretation would be that if the workman files a complaint under section 33A, the employer would have an opportunity of justifying the order of discharge or dismissal on merits, but if the workman proceeds under section 33C(2), the employer would have no such opportunity.
 Whether the employer should be able to justify the order of discharge or dismissal on merits would depend upon what remedy is pursued by the workmen, whether under section 33A or under section 33C(2). Such a highly anomalous result could never have been intended by the legislature. If such an interpretation were accepted, no workman would file a complaint under section 33A, but he would always proceed under section 33C(2) and section 33A would be reduced to futility. It is, therefore, impossible to accept the argument that the contravention of section 33 renders the order of discharge or dismissal void and inoperative and if that be so the only remedy available to the workman for challenging the order of discharge or dismissal is that provided under section 33A, apart of course from the remedy under section 10 and he cannot maintain an application under section 33 C(2) for determination and payment of wages on the basis that he continues to be in service. The workman can proceed under section 33 C(2) only after the Tribunal has adjudicated, on a complaint under section 33A or on a reference 374 under section 10. that the order of discharge or dismissal passed by tile employer was not justified and has set aside that order and reinstated the workman. [383 H, 384 A-F] 
5. In the employer contravenes the provisions of section 33 and discharges or dismisses a workman without obtaining permission or approval of the Tribunal, he would render himself liable to punishment under section 31(1) and this punishment can extend even to imprisonment. Moreover, the aggrieved workman would not only have the remedy of moving the appropriate Government for making a reference under section 10, but he would also be entitled to make a complaint to the Tribunal under section 33A and on such reference or complaint, the order of discharge or dismissal would be liable to be subjected to a much greater scrutiny than what would be available before a Tribunal exercising the limited jurisdiction conferred under section 33. The workman is thus not left without remedy, though according to the trade union movement, the remedy provided tinder sections, 31, 10 and 33A may not be as adequate as the workman might wish it to be. [384 G-H, 385 A] 
6. Where the Tribunal entertains an application for approval under section 33(2)(b) on merits, it applies its mind and considers whether the dismissal of the workman amounts to victimisation or unfair labour practice and whether a prima facie case has been made out by the employer for the dismissal of the workman. If the Tribunal finds that either no prima facie case has been made out or there is victimisation or unfair labour practice, it would refuse to grant approval and reject the application on merits.
 Then of course, the dismissal of the workman would be void and inoperative, but that would be because the Tribunal having held that no prima facie case has been made out by the employer or there is victimisation or unfair labour practice, it has refused to lift the ban. Where, however, the application for approval under section 33(2)(b) is withdrawn by the employer and there is no decision on it on merits. it cannot be said that the approval has been refused by the Tribunal. The Tribunal having had no occasion to consider the application on merits, there can be no question of the Tribunal refusing approval to the employer. It cannot be said that where the application for approval is withdrawn, there is a decision by the Tribunal to refuse to lift the ban.. The withdrawal of the application for approval stands on the same footing as if no application under section 33(2)(b) has beer, made at all [385 D-G] (b) In the instant case the appellant contravened section 33(2)(b) in dismissing the workman in both the appeals but such contravention did not have the effect of rendering the orders of dismissal void and inoperative and hence the workmen were not entitled to maintain the applications for determination and payment of wages under section 33 C(2).
