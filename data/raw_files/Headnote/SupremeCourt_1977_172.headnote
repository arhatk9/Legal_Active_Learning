 The appeallant's services were terminated with effect from June 10, 1974, with the approval of the Director of Education under sub-rule (2) of Rule 74 of the Grant-in-aid Code by the first respondent. The salary payable under the said rule was also duly paid to him. On June 22, 1974, the Director of Education telegraphically informed the first respondent to "Keep in abeyance" the proposed termination of the appellant's services. The telegram was followed by a letter dated July 25, 1974, addressed by an Under Secretary of the Government of Goa, Daman and Diu, directing the management of the school to reinstate the appellant and hold an enquiry in accordance with sub-rule (3) of Rule 74 of the Code as, according to him, the termination was "in reality" under Rule 74(3) for misconduct. The first respondent wrote back stating that the services of the appellant had already been terminated and the vacancy filled and that she disagreed with the view that this was a case of termination under Rule 74(3). On October 8, 1974, the Director of Education informed the first respondent that as she had not "implemented the Government's order to reinstate the teacher and to hold an enquiry under Rule 74(3), the main tenancy grant other than that part of it that is meant for salary of staff to be paid your school has been stopped from today until further orders." The first respondent, thereupon, moved the court of the Judicial Commissioner for Goa, Daman and Diu, at Panaji for a writ to quash the decision of the authorities contained in the two letters dated July 25, 1974 and October 8, 1974, impleading the appellant as one of the respondents. The Judicial Commissioner held; (i) that the termination was under Rule 74 (2) which did not require an enquiry as contemplated in Rule 74(3); (ii) that the approval given by the Director of Education was valid and could not be subsequently superseded or revoked; and (iii) the direction to reinstate the teacher was without jurisdiction and not binding on the school and, therefore, the stoppage of the grant-in-aid on the ground that the management of the school had declined to comply with that direction was wrong and not authorised under the Code. The respondent-teacher and not the State preferred an appeal against the judgment of the Judicial Commissioner.
 Dismissing the appeal by special leave, the Court, 
HELD : The question, whether the Judicial Commissioner was in error in issuing a writ to enforce the provisions of the Grant-in-aid Code cannot be raised in this appeal at the instance of the teacher. The scope of the appeal must be limited to what directly concerns the appellant in the impugned judgment. A person can claim to be aggrieved, if his legal rights are directly affected.
 In the instant case the dispute was between the management of the school and the Government relating to some of the rights and obligations they nave against each other under the Grant-in-aid Code; the teacher, termination of whose services gave rise to this dispute, was impleaded as a proper party in the writ petition. The scope of the appeal is limited to whom the judgment contains by which the appellant can be said to be aggrieved. The appellant is not directly concerned with the question whether the rules in the Grant-inaid Code conferred on the management of the school an enforceable right against the Government which is entirely a matter between the management and the, Government.
