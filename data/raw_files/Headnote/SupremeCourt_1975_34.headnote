 Section 40 (1) of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands (Vidarbha Region Act 1958, provides that notwithstanding anything ontained in Chapter 111. (containing ss. 38 to 57) the ownership of all lands held by tenants which they are enttled to purchase from their landlords under any of the provisions of chapter, shall stand transferred to and vest in such tenants on and from April 1961. from which date such tenants shall be deemed to be the full owners of qua lands.
 Section 43 (14A) provides that if a tenant fails to exercise hi,, right of purchase under s. 41 etc. the land shall be deemed to be surrendered to the landlords; and s. 49A(1) provides that notwithstanding anything contained in ss.41 and 46 etc., on and from April 1. 1963 the ownership of all land held by a tenant (being land which is not transferred to the tenant under s. 46 or which is not purchased by him under ss. 41 and 56), shall vest in such tenant.
 The Agricultural Lands Tribunal took action under s. 46 read with a. 48 of (he Act for fixing the price of the land in possession of the respondent who, Was personally cultivating the land as a cultivating tenant under the appellant-land- ford. The appellant contested the proceedings without success before the authorities under the Act as well as in a writ petition in the High Court. In appeal to this Court, it was contended (1) that s. 49a is not applicable to the present case as the opening non-obstante clause of that section makes no reference to s. 43(14A) while it specifically mentions ss. 41 and 46; (2) Since the tenant had not exercised his right to purchase the land in question under s. 43(14A) the land shall be deemed to have been surrendered to the appellant and no question of statutory transfer of ownership of the land would arise; and (3) Section 46 is violative of Aets. 14 and 19(1)(f) of the Constitution and is not saved by Art. 31A.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (1),Section 49A is not attracted in the instant case since that section provides for ownership of land which is not transferred to the tenant under s. 46 or which is not purchased by the tenant under s. 41 or s. 50. The present case deals with compulsory transfer of ownership under s.
 
46. [539H] (2) Under s. 46 the tenants became full owners of the lands by operation of law and there is a statutory vesting of the lands in them. This legal vesting by operation of s. 46 on and from April 1, 1961, cannot be divested in the absence of any clear provision tinder the Act. Section 43(14A) is a prospective provision and was introduced in the Act by amendment on March 1, 1962 and has no application. [540A-D] (3) Section 46 has achieved the twin purpose of extinguishment of the right of the landlord in the estate and conferment of the same right upon the tenant. Once that happens, there is, in one breath, extinguishment of the right in favour of the State and the conferment of the said right in favour of the tenant. Article 81A is therefore clearly applicable and it cannot be contained that there is violaion of Arts. 14 Ind 19. [541A- C]
