 Clause (1) of Art. 269 of the Constitution as amended by the Constitution (Sixth Amendment) Act, 1956, which came into force on September 11, 1956, provided that "The following... ..taxes shall be levied and collected by the Government of India (g) taxes on the sale of goods other than newspapers, where such sale . ..takes place in the course of Inter-State trade. . . . . . " Clause (3) of that article provided that "Parliament may by law formulate principles for determining when a sale takes place in the course of inter-State trade.. .." By s. 3 of the Central Sales Tax Act, passed by Parliament on December 21, 1956, it was provided that "A sale shall be deemed to take place in the course of inter-State trade if the sale (a) occasions the movement of goods from one State to another. " In 1957-58 the C. Company made various sales of cement which were supplied from factories outside the State of Mysore to purchasers within that State The State of Mysore levied tax on these sales under two Sales Tax Acts passed by the Mysore legislature. The C. Company applied under Art.32 of the Constitution to quash the assessment orders on the ground that Mysore State had no power to tax the sales as they had taken place in the course of inter-State trade.
 Held, that a sale occasions the movement of goods from one State to another within s.3(a) of the Central Sales Tax Act when the movement is the result of a covenant or incident of the contract of sale.
 Tata Iron and Steel Co. Ltd. v. S. R. Sarkar, [1960] INSC 131; [1961], 1 S.C.R. 379, followed.
 793 As the sales were made under permits issued by the Government and on the terms contained in them, and as the permits provided that the supply had to be made from factories outside State of Mysore the contracts of sale must be deemed to have contained a covenant that the goods would be supplied in Mysore from a place situate outside its borders. The Sales were, therefore, inter-State sales within s.3(a) of the Central Sales Tax Act which a State could not tax in view of Art. 269 of the Constitution.
 The taxing officer had no jurisdiction to tax inter-State sales in view of the Constitutional Prohibition and he could not give himself jurisdiction to do so by deciding a collateral fact wrongly. 'the petitions are, therefore, not incompetent under the principle laid down In Ujjain Bai's case.
 Ujjam Bai v. The State of Uttar Pradesh [1963] I S.C.R.778 held inapplicable.
