 The appellant filed a suit for declaring that certain execution proceedins resulting in the sale of the suit properties were invalid, and for partition of his share therein. The claim was based inter alia on : (1) that the appellant's family were Tamil Vannian Christians governed in the matter of inheritance and succession by the Hindu Mitakshara law including the doctrine of right by birth, but not by that of pious obligation; and (2) that the debt was incurred on a promissory note and that the endorsee of the note was not entitled to obtain a decree against the non- executant coparceners for sale of the family properties.
 
HELD: (1) The doctrine of pious obligation is not merely a religous doctrine but has passed into the realm of law.
 It is an integral part of the Mitakshara school of the Hindu law. wherein, the sons, from the moment of their birth acquire along with their father an interest in the joint family Property. It is a necessary and logical corollary to the doctrine of right by birth and the two conceptions are correlated. The doctrine is in consonance with justice, equity and good conscience and is not opposed to any principle of Christianity. Therefore, the doctrine of pious obligation is applicable to the Tamil Vannian Christians who were governed by the Mitakshara law in matters of inheritance and succession.

 (2) The endorsement in the present case was not a mere endorsement but it has been so worded as to transfer the, debt also. Therefore, the endorsee was entitled to bring a suit against the non-executant coparceners on the ground of their liability under Hindu Law. [655 G-H; 656 B-C]
