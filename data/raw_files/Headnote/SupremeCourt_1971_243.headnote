 The appellant--a private limited company-carried on the business of' manufacturing edible oils, soaps and certain by-products. In connection with its business the appellant employed about 700 permanent workmen. However for loading and unloading seed and oil cake bags and for feeding the hoppers in the solvent extraction plant the appellant employed labour through a contractor. The workmen in an industrial dispute claimed inter alia that the work of loading and unloading seed bags as well as that of feeding the hoppers was of a perennial nature and therefore in respect of these contract labour should be abolished. The Industrial Tribunal on considering the evidence before it held that the work of feeding the hoppers could not be said to intermittent and sporadic as claimed by the appellant; it was on the other hand closely connected with the principal activity of the appellant. In similar plants in the region the work of feeding the hoppers was carried on by permanent workmen. On the basis of these factors the Tribunal held that the appellant also should carry out this work through permanent workmen. In the matter of loading and unloading of seed and cake bags the Tribunal held that these activities were also closely connected with the main industry and the work was of.a permanent character. The Tribunal noted that the comparable units in the same region carried on the work of loading and unloading through contract labour, but nevertheless, on the view that contract labour must be discouraged, the Tribunal held that in this respect also the appellant must employ only permanent workmen. The Tribunal referred to the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act 1970, (Central Act 37 of 1970) and the Maharashtra Mathadi Hamal and Other Manual Workers (Regulation of Employment and Welfare) Act 30 of 1969 and observed, that these two enactments also supported its view. In appeal by special leave before this Court the appellant apart from questioning the Tribunal's decision on merits challenged the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to consider the question of abolition of contract labour in view of the provisions of the aforesaid two Acts.
 
HELD: (i) The Industrial Tribunal acquired jurisdiction to entertain the dispute in view of the reference made by the State Government on April 17, 1967. Admittedly on that date neither Central Act 37 of 1970 nor, Maharashtra Act 30 of 1969 had been passed. Even during the proceedings before the Tribunal the appellant raised no objection after the passing of the two enactments that the Tribunal had no longer jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the dispute. Under these circumstances the Tribunal had to adjudicate upon the point referred to it having due regard to the principles laid down by the Courts, particularly this Court governing the abolition of contract labour. [689 E-G] (ii) Central Act 37 of 1970 had received the President's assent before the passing of the Tribunal's award but it came into force after the. 9-L3SupC.I./72 674 said award. The State Act had come into force before the passing of the award. Though the contention that the Tribunal lost jurisdiction to consider the question of contract labour in view of these enactments could not be accepted this Court would be justified when dealing with this appeal to give effect particularly to the provisions of the Central Act having due regard to the clearly expressed intention of the legislature in the said Act regarding the circumstances under which contract labour can be abolished.
 [689 C-D; 690 B] (iii) Even according to the evidence of the appellant's witnesses it was clear that the feeding of hoppers in the solvent extraction plant was an activity closely and intimately connected with the main activity of the appellant, namely, crushing oil cakes and oil seeds for extraction of oil and other chemical production. Excepting for a few days this work had that by employing contract labour for this purpose the appellant would be enabled to keep down the costs on the ground that there would not be sufficient work for all the workmen if permanent labour was employed. There was no wrong approach by the Tribunal in this regard. Further the award of the Tribunal abolishing the contract labour in respect of feeding the hoppers was fully justified because it was in accordance with the principles laid down by this Court and substantially incorporated in ,Cis. (a) to (d) of s. 10(2) of the Central Art. The Tribunal's direction in this regard must therefore be upheld.. [680 C-F; 681 A-B; 694 C-D] (iv) However the Tribunal's direction to the appellant not to engage :any labour through a contractor for the work of loading and unloading after May 1, 1971 must be set aside.
 The Central Act had come into force on February 10, 1971.
 Under s. 10 of the said Act the jurisdiction to decide matters connected with prohibition of contract labour is vested in the appropriate Government. Therefore with effect from February 10, 1971 it is only the appropriate Government that can prohibit contract labour by following the Procedure and in accordance with the provisions ,of the Central Act.
 The Industrial Tribunal in the circumstances had no ,jurisdiction, though its award was dated November 20, 1970, to give a ,direction in that respect which becomes enforceable after the date of the ,coming into force of the Central Act. In any event, such a direction contained in the award could not be enforced from a date when abolition of contract labour can only be done by the appropriate Government in accordance with the provisions of the Central Act. [692 A-D] Further under cl. (c) of s. 10(2) of the Central Act one of the relevant factors to be taken into account is to consider, when contract labour regarding any particular type of work is proposed to be abolished, whether that type of work is done ordinarily through regular workmen in the establishment, or an establishment similar thereto. In the present case similar establishments, as noted by the Tribunal, employed contract labour for loading and unloading. The evidence also showed that the work of loading and unloading required varying numbers of workmen from day to day justifying the employment of contract labour under the ,.principles laid down by this Court.
