 The respondent, a railway servant, was charged with misappropriation. An Inquiry Committee of three officers of the Railway was constituted to inquire into the charges.
 After the proceedings had gone on for some time and some witnesses were examined, one of the members of the inquiry committee was transferred. There was no de novo inquiry and the proceedings continued with the successor in office. The Inquiry Committee found the respondent guilty of the charges and submitted its report under the Discipline and Appeal Rules of the Indian Railway Establishment Code. The Disciplinary Authority considered the record of inquiry, issued the second show cause notice and thereafter dismissed the respondent from service. The respondent's appeal to the General Manager having proved unsuccessful, he challenged the order in a writ petition. The High Court quashed the order of dismissal on the ground that there was a violation of the principles of natural justice, because of the change in the personnel of the Inquiry Committee.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : No known principle of natural justice is violated when one member of the Inquiry Committee is substituted by another, because, the change in the personnel even though it was after the proceedings bad begun and some evidence was recorded, could not make any difference to the railway servant. The members of the Committee cannot record their findings separately, but must arrive at their conclusion jointly and it is the record consisting of the documents and the oral evidence which forms the basis of the report of the inquiry Committee. Therefore, any impression created by the demand our of a particular witness on the mind of any member could not affect the conclusion. [275 D-F; 276 A-B] Further, under the rules, the duty of the Committee ends with the making of the report, because, it is not the punishing authority. The punishing authority is the Disciplinary Authority and the personal impression of a member of the Inquiry Committee cannot possibly affect the decision of the Disciplinary Authority. The Disciplinary Authority merely goes by the written record after giving a personal hearing to the railway servant if he asks for it, and may even reverse the finding of the Inquiry Committee absolving a railway servant, and impose a penalty on him.
 [275 F-G] Moreover, it is not uncommon, in proceedings before ordinary courts, for one judge or magistrate to record part of the evidence and for his successor to continue the proceedings and dispose of the matter, or for witnesses to be examined on commission and the weight of their evidence being assessed by a judge who did not have the benefit of watching the 272 demeanour, or for an appellate -court, which does not have such an opportunity, to arrive at conclusions of facts on the record of the case. The appellate court may take note of any comment on the demeanour of a witness but never guides itself entirely by such a comment. [276 E-H; 277 A-C] Union of India v. H. C.
