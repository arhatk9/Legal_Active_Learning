 The appellant attacked one Anta with a knife giving the latter a single blow above the left clavicle where it caused a muscle-deep incised wound having the dimensions 1-1/4" x 1/3". The autopsy surgeon, while certifying the existence of that wound, also found that the superior venacava had been cut, the damage so caused being sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. The sessions court convicted the appellant of an offence under section 302 of the Penal Code and sentenced him to imprisonment for life.
 The High Court confirmed the conviction and the sentence in appeal. Hence, the appeal by special leave.
 Allowing the appeal in part and substituting a conviction under Part II of section 304 and sentence of five years' rigorous imprisonment, the Court.

 HELD : 1. To attract clause thirdly of section 300 of the Penal Code and also illustration (c) appended thereto the injury in question needs satisfy only two tests-namely, (a) the injury must be sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death and (b) such injury must have been intended to have been caused by the culprit. [66 A-B] 
 2. In the present case, the solitary blow given by the appellant to the deceased was on the left clavicle a non- vital part-and the appellant cannot be said to know that the superior venacava would be cut as a result of that wound.
 Even a medical man perhaps may not have been able to judge the location of the superior venacava with any precision of that type. The fact that the venacava was cut must, therefore, be ascribed to a non-intentional or accidental circumstance. Therefore, it cannot by said to have been intended by the appellant.
