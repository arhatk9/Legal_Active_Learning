 Pursuant to certain charges against the respondent, a police constable, his entire service with permanent effect were forfeited, which meant reducing his salary to the starting point in the time scale for constables. An appeal by him before the Deputy Inspector General having failed, be filed a suit. The trial court decreed the suit holding that the order amounted to reduction in rank, therefore, Art. 311(2) of the Constitution was attracted and as no show cause notice was served before the order was passed, the order was vitiated and was bad. The decree was affirmed by the first appellate court and thereafter in second appeal by the High Court. Allowing the appeal by the State, this Court, 
HELD : The expression "reduction in rank" in Art. 311(2) has to be construed according to the well-established meaning it has acquired, as in 'the case of the other two expressions, namely, 'dismissal' and 'removal' in that Article, under the various service rules and under the provisions in that regard in the Constitution Acts of 1915 and 1935. The expression "reduction in rank" in the Article, therefore, means reduction from a higher to a lower rank or post when imposed as a penalty. Therefore, an order forfeiting the past service which has earned a Government servant increments in the post or rank he holds, howsoever adverse it is to him, affecting his seniority within the rank to which he belongs or his future chances or promotion, does not attract the Article. His remedy, therefore, .is confined to the rules of service governing his post. [397 E] High Court, Calcutta v. Amal Kumar Roy, [1962] INSC 131; [1963] 1 S.C.R. 437 and Shitla S. Shrivastava v.
