 The appellant challenged the election of the respondent to the State. Assembly on the ground that he nomination papers of two persons were improperly rejected by the Retiring Officer. The High Court held that the nomination papers suffered from defects of non compliance with the requirements of s. 33(1) of the Representation of People Act and so were rightly rejected.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (i) The High Court was right in its finding that the nomination paper of one of the persons was not improperly rejected by the Returning Officer. From a reading of s. 4 of the Rules and Form 28 it would be clear that non-supply of postal address of the candidate or supplying such cryptic address which virtually amounts to non-supply of address is a failure to comply with the provisions of s. 33(1) of the Act. [471-G] (2)(a) Nomination paper of the second person had been rightly rejected by the Returning Officer. The defect that the name of the constituency of the proposer was not given in the nomination form was of a substantial character.
 [472-B] (b)There was clear violation of r. 2(2) of the Rules. A thumb mark has to be placed by the proper on the nomination paper in the presence of the Returning Officer and such officer, on being satisfied as to his identity, has to attest the mark as being the mark of that person. This has not been done in this case. [472-B]
