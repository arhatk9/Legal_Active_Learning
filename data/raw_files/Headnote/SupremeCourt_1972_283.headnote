 Section 33B of the Income-tax Act, 1922, enables the Commissioner to call for and examine the record of any proceeding under the Act and to pass such orders as he deems necessary, as the circumstances of the case justify when he considers the order passed erroneous insofar as it is prejudicial to the interests of the revenue.
 In the present case, the assessee-appellant submitted a return and the income-tax officer, though he was not satisfied about the various sources of, the assessee's income, passed an order of assessment. The Commissioner of income-tax, after notice under s. 33B of the Income-tax Act, 1922, held that inquiries revealed that the assessee neither resided in nor carried or, any business from the address given in the return, that the income-tax officer was not justified in accepting the initial capital, the sale of ornaments, the income from business, the investments etc., without any inquiry or evidence whatsoever, and that there were suspicious circumstances showing connection with the business of the assessee's husband. In the result, he held that the order of the income-tax officer was erroneous and prejudicial to the revenue and directed the income-tax officer to make a fresh assessment, after making inquiries with regard to the jurisdiction and the business carried on by the assessee, the possession of initial capital, acquisition and sale of ornaments, purchase of plot of land and resources, and the money invested in the name of the assessee.
 On the question of the jurisdiction of the Commissioner to pass the order the Appellate Tribunal held in favour of the assessee, and the High Court, on reference, in favour of the Revenue.
 In appeal to this Court, it was contended that the Commissioner had no jurisdiction under S. 33B to cancel the assessment made by the income-tax officer inasmuch as it cannot be said that where an assessee has been assessed to tax it was prejudicial to the interests of revenue on the ground that no assessment could have been made in respect of the income of which she made a voluntary return.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : Even where an income had not been earned and is not assessable, I merely because the assessee wants it to be assessed in his or her hands in order to assist someone else who would have been assessed to a larger amount, an assessment so made can certainly be erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of revenue. If so, the Commissioner, under s. 33B, had ample jurisdiction to cancel the assessment and to initiate proceedings for assessment under the provisions of the Act against some other assessee who, according to the income-tax authorities, is liable for the income thereof.
