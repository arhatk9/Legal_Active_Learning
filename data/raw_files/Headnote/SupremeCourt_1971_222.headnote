 The conviction of the appellant by the Sessions Court for the offence of murder was confirmed by the High Court. The evidence was circumstantial. One of the circumstances was a statement by the appellant, while in police custody, to the doctor, which established the presence of the appellant in the deceased's room at about the time: of death and together with other circumstances, that he alone caused the death of the deceased.
 On the question whether the statement was a confession and hence irrelevant under s. 26 of the Evidence Act, 1872.
 
HELD : A confession has to be a direct acknowledgement of the: guilt of the offence in question and such as would be sufficient by itself for conviction. If it falls short of such a plenary acknowledgement of guilt, it would not be a confession even though the statement is of some incrimi- nating fact which, taken along with other evidence, tends to prove the guilt of the accused. Such a statement is only an admission and not a confession. [454 F-G] Palvinder Kaur v. Punjab, [1953] S.C.R. 94, Faddi V. Madhya Pradesh, [1964] INSC 13; [1964] 6 S.C.R. 312 and A. Nagesia v.
