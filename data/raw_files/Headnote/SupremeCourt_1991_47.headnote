 The appellant company was carrying on the business of running a hotel, bar and restaurant where it had provided air-conditioning. The second respondent, Collector of Calcutta, sought to levy luxury tax on the company under the provisions of the West Bengal Entertainments and Luxuries (Hotels and Restaurants) Tax Act, 1972 calculated at the flat or fixed rate of an annual sum of Rs.100 for every 10 Sq. meters of the floor area provided with air-conditioning.
 The appellant's representation showing that the tax was discriminatory was rejected by the Collector. There-upon, the appellants read a petition in the High Court.
 The appellants in their writ petition inter alia contended that the Act had imposed a flat rate on a specified air-conditioned floor space in hotels and restaurants which may be differently situated with reference to their localities, clientele, services and amenities rendered, the Act made no distinction on any of these bases, as such it, did not even attempt a reasonable classification of these different types or categories of hotels and restaurants, hence it suffered from the vice of discrimination under Art. 14 of the Constitution.
 Before this Court, the appellants while reiterating the contentions urged before the High Court, argued that the legislature while imposing a tax was bound under the Constitution to make appropriate classification and failure to do so resulting in clubbing dissimilar hotels and restaurants for the purpose of luxury tax amounted to an error by inaction; where the incidence of a tax was distributed in a manner which was irrational or arbitrary or where lack of classification created inequality, the tax would be violative of Article 14; and the provision for air- conditioning had no direct nexus with the income earned by the different hotels and restaurants, and on the same ground section 4 of the luxury tax Act must be declared violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.
 430 On behalf of the respondents it was contended that the legislature had made the classification in selecting the hotels and restaurants for the purposes of luxury tax in as much as only the air-conditioned hotels and restaurants had been subjected to tax; that the legislature had the widest latitude in the matter of such classification. and that a system of taxation need not be absolutely perfect and micro division and mini classification may not always be made.
 Dismissing the appeal this Court, 
 HELD: (1) A taxing statute will be struck down as violative of Art. 14 if there is no reasonable basis behind the classification made by it, or,if the game class of property, similarly situated, is subjected to unequal taxation.

 (2) The luxury tax charged under section 4 of the Act is a tax on the mere provision for luxury and not on the hotel property or equipment. The measure or unit and the rate of taxation are uniform for all within the group subjected to tax. Further classification within the group was not considered necessary by the legislature which had wide latitude in the matter of classification keeping in view the nature of the taxable event. The tax therefore could not be said to be discriminatory. [447D-F] (3) Whether a particular tax is discriminatory or not must necessarily be considered in light of the nature and incidence of that particular tax and cannot be judged by what has been held in the context of other taxes except the general propositions. The precedents relating to property taxes such was as land tax, building tax, plantation tax, and even income tax or a service tax will not be of direct relevance to a luxury tax, as it is neither a property tax, nor an income tax but a tax on the provision for luxury. In case of tax on provision for luxury different aspects peculiar to the tax have to be borne in mind. [443G] (4) What exactly is meant by equality in taxation may, have to be looked at from different angles in different kinds of taxes. [444E] (5) The ability or capacity to pay has no doubt been regarded as 431 the test in determining the justness or equality of taxation. It is the goal towards which the system has been, as it must be, steadily working. [444C] (6) Taxation will not be discriminatory if, within the sphere of its operation, it affects alike all persons similarly situated. It, however, does not prohibit special legislation, or legislation that is limited either in the objects to which it is directed, or by the territory within which it is to operate. [445F] (7) The equal protection of the law's provision in our Constitution prohibits a discrimination by the State against its own citizens as well as to one in their favour in imposing the luxury tax. The provision requiring luxury tax to be equal and uniform has to be interpreted in light of its characteristics. The luxury tax is 'uniform' as it is equal upon all persons belonging to the described class upon which it is imposed, namely, the owners of air- conditioned hotels and restaurants. [446G-H] (8) Equality and uniform policy means uniform and equal rates of assessment and taxation which has been followed in this tax. The concept of equality and uniformity has to adjust from time to time to new and advancing social and economic conditions and needs of public finance and fiscal policy, of course within constitutional limitations.
