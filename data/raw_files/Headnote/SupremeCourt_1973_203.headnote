 The petitioner was detained pursuant to an order of detention dated April 2 1973 passed by the District Magistrate, Monghyr, with a view to preventing the petitioner from "acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order and the maintenance' of supplies and services essential to the community." The grounds of detention served on the petitioner on April 6, 1973` were divided into two parts, the first relating to public order and the second to essential supplies and services. Two out of the three grounds mentioned in the first part set out facts which referred respectively to a stray incident on a public street and an assault on a public. servant. The petitioners challenged the order of detention by a habeas corpus petition in this Court.
 Allowing the Petition, 
HELD : (1) The two concepts law and order' 'and 'public order' have well defined contours. Stray and unorganised crimes of theft and assault are not matters of public order since they do not fend to affect the even flow of public life. Infractions of law we bound in some measure to lead to disorder but every infraction of law does not necessarily result in public disorder. "Law and order comprehends & orders of less gravity than these affecting "public order", just as public order, comprehends disorders of less gravity than those affecting "security of State.

 (2)Two of the grounds on which the order of detention rests bear no rational connection with "public order", in the interests of which the petitioner was ordered to be detained. The order of detention expressly states that it was passed with a view to preventing the petitioner from.
 acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order and the maintenance of supplies and service essential to the community, and the District Magistrate was satisfied that if the petitioner was allowed to remain at large he will indulge in activities prejudicial to the maintenance of public order and maintence of supplies and services essential to the community. The two reasons maintenance of public order and maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community cannot therefore be bifurcated and considered in separate compartments. The subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority embraces both the reasons and since two out of the three grounds mentioned in the first part are irrelevant, the entire order is illegal.
