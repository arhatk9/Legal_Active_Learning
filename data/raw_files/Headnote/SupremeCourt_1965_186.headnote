 In a petition under Article 226, the appellant challenged the imposition of a duty of excise on 'foreign liquor' imported into the State which had been levied at Rs. 40/- per L.P. Gallon until March 31, 1961, by virtue of a notification issued in 1937 under s. 27 of the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act, 1915, and which had been enhanced w.e.f.
 1st April 1961 by a fresh notification.
 It was contended on behalf of the appellant that since no foreignliquor' was manufactured within the State and consequently noexcise dutywas being levied on any locally manufactured 'foreign liquor',countervailing duty could not be charged on such liquor brought fromout side the State; that the impose was in violation of Articles 301, 303 and 304 of the Constitution; that even if the original countervailing duty of Rs. 40/could be held to be leviable, the enhancement of the existing duty made (he imposition a new tax which could not be levied if there was no corres- ponding duty on locally manufactured goods of the same kind.
 The petition was dismissed by the High Court.
 On appeal to this Court, 
HELD (per majority) (i)The notification dated March 31, 1961, enhancing the duty on 'foreign liquor' by Rs. 30/- per gallon was invalid as it infringed the guarantee of freedom of trade etc. under Art. 301. [874 H] A restriction on the freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of India declared by Art. 301 cannot be justified unless it falls within Article 304. Exercise of power under Article 304(a) can be effective only if the tax or duty imposed on goods imported from other States and the tax or duty imposed on similar goods manufactured or produced in that State are such that there is no discrimination. As no foreign liquor was produced or manufactured within the State, the protection of Article 304 was not available in the present case. [872 F, G] Power to levy countervailing duties under Entry 51 List 11 is meant to be exercised for the purposes of equalising the burden on alcoholic liquors imported from outside the State and the burden placed by excise duties on alcoholic liquors manufactured or produced in the State. Therefore countervailing duties can only be levied if similar goods are actually produced or manufactured in the State on which excise duties; are being levied.
 [869 H- 870 A] pCI/65-12 866 (ii) Although no 'foreign liquor' was manufactured within the State, the State could continue to levy duly at the rate of Rs. 40/- per gallon prescribed by the notification of 1937 even after the Constitution came into force because that notification, and the provisions of s. 27 of the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act under which it was issued, constituted an existing law or a law in force that was protected by Articles 305 and 372. But the notification of March 1961, which enhanced the duty by Rs. 30/and altered the existing law could be valid only if it complied with the constitutional requirements. Existing- law within the meaning of Art 305 was the provision in s.27 of Act 2 of 1915 authorising the State Government to issue a notification, and the notification issued in exercise of that authority. A fresh notification issued after the Constitution could be valid only if it complied with the constitutional requirements. [872 H873 C] The Bangalore W.C. & 5 Mills Co. v. The Bangalore Corporation A.I.R. 1962 S.C. 562 and 1263; distinguished.
 (per Hidayatullah, J. dissenting) The Bihar and Orissa Excise Act, 1915 was valid under the Government of India Act, 1935 and in view of cl. (3) of the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1937, could not be questioned in a court of law. By reason of Art. 372 of the Constitution, the Act must be deemed to be valid even today. The absence of manufacture of foreign liquir within the State is of no significance because section 27 is saved. The law which was saved was not a combination of the Act and the notification but the Act (particularly s. 27) itself. What was done under its authority in the past and what was being done today was equally valid. The notification of 1961 arrived its force from s. 27. which is a valid enactment, even as the notification of 1937 did before from the same section and the new notification could not be said to run against any constitutional provision. If the duty at Rs. 40/- could be sustained the duty at Rs. 70/- must also be valid, for the same reasons apply. [893 G, H] Articles 301 and 304 (a) could not come into play in the present case. Article 304(a) imposes no ban but lifts the but imposed by Articles 301 and 303 subject to one condition. That Article is enabling and prospective and is available in respect of other taxes such as Sales Tax, etc.
 imposed by the State legislature. The power to levy excise and countervailing duties is conferred on the State legislature by Entry 51 of List 11, and if Article 301 stands in the way, the protection of Article 305 is available. 'The Bihar ,and Orissa Excise Act was sustained by Articles 305 and 37'-' independently of Art. 304(a). [883 C, E]
