 The 1st respondent filed a suit against the 2nd respondent for recovery of money and in pursuance of an order of the Court directing the 2nd respondent to furnish security for satisfaction of the decree that may be passed against him, the three appellants and two others stood sureties agreeing jointly and severally to satisfy the decree. After the 'suit was decreed the first respondent applied for execution of the decree against the sureties. The-sureties raised the pleas that the surety bond was not enforceable because it was not registered, and that the degree holder had committed acts by which the remedy of the sureties against judgment debtor was impaired, but the pleas were negatived by the executing court and the High Court. After the three appellants preferred an appeal to this Court, one of then died and since his legal representatives was not brought on record, the, appeal abated, as far as he was concerned.
 On the question whether the appeal in Sol far as the other two appellants were concerned also abated, 
HELD : Applications to bring on record legal representatives of a deceased appellant or respondent were governed by 0, 16, r 14 of th Supreme Court Rules, 1950, and the rule applied to all classes of appeals including appeals arising from orders in execution. Because the representatives of the deceased appellant were. not brought on record within the time permitted by the rule and the delay in filing the petition to bring the representatives on record was not condoned, the appeal of the deceased appellant abated.
 Since the liability of the sureties was joint and several.
 if this Court proceeds with the appeal of the other two sureties and holds that the High Court was in error in rejecting their contentions, there would be two inconsistent orders-one passed by the High Court holding that the surety bond was enforceable, and the other-of this Court that it was not enforceable. Therefore., the appeal must be held to have abated in its entirety. [454 D; 456 B; 457 B] State of Punjab v. Nathu Ram, [1961] INSC 203; [1962] 2 S.C.R. 636 and Rameshwar Prasad and others v.
