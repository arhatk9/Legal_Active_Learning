 In the contest for election to the Haryana Legislative Assembly one of the respondents, who was the Chairman of the Ambala Improvement Trust.. was declared elected. The appellant challenged the election on the grounds that : (i) the respondent's nomination was improperly and illegally accepted because he was holding an office of profit under the State Government, and (ii) S. 2(i) of the Punjab State Legislature (Prevention and Disqualification) Act, 1952, introduced by the Haryana Amending Act 25 of 1969, enacted by the Haryana State Legislature under Art. 191 of the Constitution which purported to take the office of the Chairman of an Improvement Trust out of the purview of an office of profit, was invalid as it offended Art. 14 of the Constitution.
 The High Court dismissed the petition.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD:(1) The office of the Chairman of an Improvement Trust constituted under the Punjab Town Improvement Act is an office of profit, but s. 2(i) provided that such a person does not incur the disqualification for being chosen as and for being a member of the Haryana State Legislative Assembly. [581H-582B] (2)(a) Article 191(1)(a) of the Constitution gives a wide power to the State Legislature to declare by law what office or offices of profit held under the government shall not disqualify the holder thereof from being chosen or for being a member of the state Legislature. Classification is thus left primarily to legislative discretion and when this power is exercised reasonably in a manner which does not drain out the article of its real content the court will not interfere. [582H-583B] (b)There is no discrimination between the chairman of the trust and the members of the trust. In the case of the members of the trust the disqualification on the ground of their holding the office of profit had been removed by s.
 2(e) of the 1952-Act.
 (c)Further, the status and responsibilities and other conditions of the office of the Chairman of an Improvement Trust differ from those of the members of the trust or other statutory bodies, and therefore, the mere fact that for the purpose of removing the disqualification the Chairmen have been put in cl. (i) as a class se rate from that of the members of the Trust and other statutory bodies in cl. (e) of s. 2 does not offend the guarantee of equal treatment.
