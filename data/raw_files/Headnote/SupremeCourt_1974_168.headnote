 The respondent was a typewriter mechanic under the appellant. He was charged with (1) having absented himself on a particular day without leave and without sufficient cause, and (2) that he on that day did some private repair work of a typewriter. A domestic enquiry was held, the charges were found to be established and he was dismissed.
 Since an industrial dispute was then pending, the appellant applied to the Industrial Tribunal for approval of the dismissal order under s. 33 (2) (b) of the Industrial Disputes Act. The respondent contended before the Tribunal that he was a protected workman and that therefore the appellant should have sought prior permission under s.
 33(3). The Tribunal rejected the respondent's plea and approved the dismissal order. Meanwhile, the respondent had appealed to the Commissioner under s. 41(2) of the Tamil Nadu Shops and Establishments Act, and the Commissioner held the first charge proved, but not the second charge and allowed the appeal holding that the punishment of dismissal was disproportionate to the gravity of the offence proved.
 In appeal to this Court, the appellant contended that (1) the respondent having claimed to be a protected workman should have applied under s. 33A of the Industrial Disputes Act and his appeal to the Commissioner under the Shops Act was misconceived, (2) the Commissioner failed to consider some evidence, and (3) the Commissioner should not have interfered with the order passed in the domestic enquiry.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) (a) The appellant having contended before the Industrial Tribunal that the respondent was not a protected workman cannot be allowed to raise the plea of ouster of jurisdiction. [19C-D] (b) Further, the appellant had not raised any objection to the jurisdiction of the Commissioner to hear the appeal but submitted to the jurisdiction of the Commissioner. [19D] (2) There is no basis for the contention that the Commissioner ignored any evidence. [19G] (3) The jurisdiction of the Commissioner is an appellate jurisdiction and is of wider scope unlike that of the Tribunal under a. 33 of the Industrial Disputes Act. The Commissioner, was therefore, competent to rehear the matter, take additional evidence if necessary, and come to his own conclusion after a re-appreciation of the evidence. [19H- 20B]
