 In 1957, the Government of Rajasthan published a notification under s. 4 of the Rajasthan Land Acquisition Act; 1953, to the effect that the appellants' land was needed for a public purpose. The public notice of the substance of the notification to be given by the Collector at convenient places in the locality, as required by s.
 4(1), was however not given. In January 1958 and February 1959, notifications under as. 5(2) and 6 respectively of the Act, were published in the local Gazette. Thereafter, the officer originally appointed by the Government to perform the functions of a Collector under the Act continued the acquisition proceedings in spite of a Government notification of June 1959, whereby another officer was appointed to perform those functions. The appellants filed objections questioning his jurisdiction and stopped taking part in the proceedings. On 11th December, 1959, after making ex parte enquiries, the officer made an award, and on 27th June 1960, he made :a second award superseding the first. The appellants came to know of the awards in September 1960. In October 1960, they filed a petition under Art. 226, challenging the validity of the proceedings on the ground, inter alia, that the requirement of the giving of the public notice under s. 4(1) at convenient places of the locality was, mandatory, and as it was not complied with, the entire acquisition proceedings were void.
 The High Court agreed with the contention but dismissed the petition on the ground that the objection was taken at a belated stage.
 
HELD: (i) The provision in ss. 4(1), requiring public notice was mandatory and non-compliance with it was fatal to the entire acquisition proceedings. [125 H] Section 4(1) says that the Collector shall cause public notice of the ,,substance of such notification to be given at convenient places in the said locality. If the word "shall" is, construed as "may" the object of the sub-section will be defeated. The object is to give intimation to the person whose land is sought to be acquired, of the intention of the officer to enter the land. Under s. 4(2), such a notice is a necessary condition for the exercise of the power of entry and non-compliance with the condition makes the entry of the officer or his servants unlawful. [125 F-H] The fact that the owner may have notice of the particulars of the intended acquisition under s. 5(2) does not serve the purpose of s. 4, for a notice under s. 5(2) is given after the officer enters the land and submits the particulars mentioned in s. 4.

 (ii) The High Court was in error in holding, on the facts, that there was inordinate delay in invoking its jurisdiction. [127 D] 121
