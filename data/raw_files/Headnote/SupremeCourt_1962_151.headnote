 The Government of Andhra Pradesh ordered the respondents, who had come to India with Pakistan Passport, to remove themselves out of India within a specified date. The respondents filed writ petitions in the, High Court against the said orders and the single judge who heard them held inter alia that as a result of s. 9 read with r. 3 in Sch.
 III of the Citizenship Rules as soon as it is shown that a person had acquired a passport from Pakistan Government there is an automatic statutory cesser of his citizenship of India. This decision was challenged in appeal before the Division Bench of the High Court of Andhra. The Division Bench held that s. 9 was intra vires -but found that r. 3 of Sch. III of Citizenship Rules was ultra vires. However the High Court made it clear that its decision in question would not preclude the Central Government from deciding the question whether the present respondents had acquired citizenship of a foreign country or not, but it directed that the Central Government must ignore r. 3 of sch. III which in its view was ultra vires. It is against this decision of the Division Bench that the Andhra Government has come up in appeal to this Court by certificate granted by the Andhra Pradesh High Court.
 Held that the points raised in these appeals are concluded by the decision of this Court in Izhar Ahmad Khan v. Union of India. In all cases where action is proposed to be taken against persons residing in this country on the ground that they have acquired Citizenship of a foreign state and have lost in consequence the citizenship of this country it is essential that that question should first be considered by the Central Government. In dealing with the question the Central Government would undoubtedly be entitled to give effect to r. 3 in Sch. III of the Citizenship Rules and deal 289 with the matter in accordance with the other relevant rules framed under the Act.
 It cannot be said that by virtue of s. 9 of the Act as soon as it is shown that a person has acquired a passport from the Pakistan Government, there is an automatic statutory cesser of his Citizenship of India. The question about the status of the respondents has to be tried by the Central Government and it is only after the Central Government has reached the conclusion that the respondents have acquired the citizenship of Pakistan that the authorities can issue order of deportation against such person.
