 By a notification dated April 29, 1970 issued under s.
 49(2) of the Gujarat Sales Tax Act. 1969 the State Govern- ment exempted wholly or partly from payment of sales tax or purchase tax certain specified classes of sales and pur- chases described in entries 1 to 52 in the Schedule. This notification was subsequently amended by another dated November 11, 1970 by adding a new entry No. 53 in the Sched- ule exempting a manufacturer, who established a new indus- try, from the whole of (a) purchase tax under s. 15 of the Act, (b) sales tax leviable under the Act, for a period of five years from the date of commissioning the industry. By another notification issued on July 17, 1971 the Government amended the explanation contained in the second notification thereby taking out certain industries, including oil mills, out of the purview of the Act.
 The appellants' oil mill set up in a conforming area, was commissioned on May 14, 1970. Their application for eligibility certificate for claiming exemption from payment of sales tax as per the second notification having been rejected by the Industries Commissioner, they filed a spe- cial civil application under Art. 226 of the Constitution for an order directing the Industries Commissioner to grant them eligibility certificate. It was contended for them that the notification dated July 17, 1971 would have no effect on the eligibility already acquired by them in terms of the second notification.
 The High Court took the view that the notification dated July 17, 1971 was only prospective in operation and not retrospective, that it did not affect the exemption enjoyed by the petitioners under the second notification in respect of the purchases and sales effected prior-to July 17, 1971 and that the second notification created only existing rights and not vested rights and such existing rights could he taken away by 186 the subsequent notification. It, therefore, held that the appellants were entitled to exemption from payment of tax only for the period anterior to July 17, 1971, and for the period thereafter they had no rights to claim exemption.
 In this appeal by certificate under Art. 133(1)(c) of the Constitution it was contended for the appellants that by virtue of the first and the second notifications they had acquired a vested right to a tax holiday for a period of five years and the Government acting in exercise of the delegated powers did not have competence to nullify the exemption by giving retrospective effect to its notification dated July I7, 1971, and that in any event they were enti- tled to the benefit of tax exemption for a period of five years on the ground of promissory estoppel and the Govern- ment was obligated to give tax exemption for the full period of the claim.
 Dismissing the appeal, the Court, 
 HELD: 1. The appellants are entitled to the benefit of tax exemption. only for the limited period during which the concession was offered by the Government. [194F] 
 2. Since the first notification dated April 29. 1970 did not stipulate as to how long the exemption from sales tax would remain in operation the concession granted thereunder was to have operative force only till such time that it was allowed to remain in force before being withdrawn by the subsequent notification. The second notification dated November 11, 1970 which set out that the exemption granted would be operative for a period of five years from the date of commissioning of the industry at any time during the period from April 1, 1970 to March 31, 1975, was prospective in operation. It would, therefore, apply only to those new industries which were commissioned subsequent to issuance thereof. As the appellants' unit was commissioned several months before the second notification the same cannot be invoked by them for claiming benefit of tax exemption for a period of five years from the date of commissioning of their mill. [191E-192A] 
 3. The State Government was under no obligation in any manner known to law to grant exemption from sales tax. What was granted under the first notification was only by way of concession for encouraging entrepreneurs to start industries in rural and undeveloped areas. Such a concession could be withdrawn or revoked at any time and no time limit could be insisted before doing so. The State Government was, 187 therefore, fully within its powers to revoke the exemption by means of a subsequent notification. [192C, 193A, 192B, 192D] 
 4. 1 The Government could withdraw an exemption granted by it earlier only if such withdrawal could be made without offending the rule of promissory estoppel and without de- priving an industry entitled to claim exemption. If the Government grants exemption to a new industry and if on the basis of the representation made by the Government an indus- try is established in order to avail the benefit of exemp- tion then the new industry can legitimately raise a griev- ance that the exemption could not be withdrawn except by means of legislation having regard to the fact that promis- sory estoppel cannot be claimed against a statute. [193B-D] 
 4.2 In order to claim the benefit of promissory estoppel it was necessary to establish: (i) that a representation was made to grant the exemption for a particular period to a new industry established in view of the representation held out by the State Government, and (ii) that the new industry was established acting upon the representation made by the State Government. In the instant case, however, the appellants have failed to prove that but for the concession offered in the, first notification they would not have established the industry in question and that the entire venture was at- tributable only to the inducement offered by the Government.
 That notification was made on April 29, 1970 while the oil mill constructed by the appellants came to be commissioned on May 17. 1970 itself. The issuance of the notification granting tax exemption only constituted a fortuitous circum- stance in appellants' case and it could not be said that the commissioning of their industry was directly the outcome of the Government's notification granting tax exemption.
