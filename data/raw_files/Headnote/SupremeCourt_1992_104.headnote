 The appellant was taken in adoption in the family of his uncle. On adoption, he got about 28 acres of agricultural land from the adoptive family. He also inherited land admeasuring 19 acres and 19-1/2 gunthas from his natural father, who died leaving behind no other heir.
 The Commissioner, exercising power under Section 45(2) of the Maharashtra Agricultural Land (Ceiling on Holding) Act, 1961, came to the conclusion that the land inherited by the appellant was a separate property and could not be characterised as ancestral property. The Commissioner, further took the view that since the land inherited by the appellant could not be described an ancestral property, the appellant's major son's share could not be deducted therefrom, and hence and surplus had to be worked out without making any such deduction.
 These views were confirmed by the High Court in a Writ Petition brought under Article 227 of the Constitution. The contention that the inherited property blended with the ancestral property and hence it had acquired the character of an ancestral property was rejected.
 Aggrieved, the appellant appealed to this Court which granted special leave confining it to the question of blending.
 Dismissing the appeal, this Court, 480 
 HELD :1. A Hindu can have interest in ancestral property as well as acquire his separate or self-acquired property. If he acquires by inheritance separate property a birth of a son or adoption of a son will not deprive him of the power he has to dispose of his separate property by gift or will. [481H] 
 2. Excluding the property inherited from a maternal grandfather the only property which can be characterised as ancestral property is the property inherited by a person from his father, father's father, or father's father's father. That means property inherited by a person from any other relation becomes his separate property and his male issue does not take any interest therein by birth. [482B] In the instant case, the property which the appellant inherited from his uncle (nature father) was his separate property in which his major son could not claim any share whatsoever. [482D] 
 3. Under the Mitakshara Law each son upon his birth takes an interest equal to that of his father in ancestral property, both movable and immovable. This right is independent of his father. [482E] In the instant case, if the appellant is able to establish blending of his separate property with ancestral property, the plea of deduction of 1/5th share of his son on notional partition may perhaps be well founded. It must, therefore be shown that the appellant had thrown his separate property in the common stock with the intention of abondoning his separate claim thereon. [482F] 
 4. Evidence must be led to show a clear intention to give up his separate right and allow the separate property to be treated as an ancestral property and be enjoyed by the coparceners. Such an intention has to be proved by tendering evidence, since no such inference can be drawn even from the fact that he had permitted his family members to us it along with him nor can it be proved from the mere fact that the income of the separate property was used for supporting his son or from the fact that he had failed to maintain separate accounts of the yield of both sets of properties.
