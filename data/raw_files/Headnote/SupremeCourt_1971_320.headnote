 The administration of tribal areas in the State of Assam is governed, by virtue of Arts. 244 and 275 of the Constitution by the provisions contained in Schedule VI of the Constitution. Paragraph 19 of the VI Schedule contains transitional provisions, under which the administration of autonomous districts of the tribal areas specified in Part A of the Table to the Schedule is vested in the Governor of the State until a District Council was constituted for the autonomous district. Under cl. 1(b) of the paragraph the Governor may make Regulations for the peace and good govern- ment of any area and any Regulation so made may repeal or amend any Act of Parliament or of the State Legislature or any existing law which is for the time being applicable to such area. The power conferred on the Governor is thus a legislative power without any limitations even in regard to matters in respect of which he can promulgate a Regulation.
 The only limitation is the requirement of the Presidential assent for the Regulation to have effect. [509 A-B, C-D; 510 G-H; 511 A-D] For the autonomous district of the United Khasi Jaintia Hills a District Council was constituted in June 1952. But before that date, the Governor promulgated the United Khasi Jaintia Hills District (Applications of Laws) Regulation of 1952 for which the Presidential assent was obtained in May 1952. The laws made applicable are set out in the 'schedule to the Regulation. Section 2(2) of the Regulation empowered the Governor to direct by notification in the official gazette that any of the laws set out in the schedule to the Regulation shall extend to and have effect in so much area of the United Khasi-Jaintia Hills District or part thereof, and for that purpose, different areas and different dates may be specified for different laws. [508 A, C; 511 G; 513 D-E] On September 8, 1961, the Governor by notification extended thereby the Eastern Bengal and Assam Excise Act, 1910, which was one of the laws in the schedule to the Regulation, to the United Khasi Jaintia Hills District. The authority under the Act refused renewal of a permit authorising the respondents to distil liquor. The respondents thereupon challenged the validity of the regulation as well as the notification issued there-under and the High Court held that once a District Council was set up the Governor could not exercise power under para 19, that any Regulation made thereunder could remain effective until that period only, and that therefore, the notification issued in September 1961 extending rho Excise Act had no effect.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 507 
HELD : (1) The Regulation was a competent legislation made in pursuance of the power conferred by para 19(1)(b) of the VI Schedule to the Constitution and under that power the Governor could not only make Regulations in the form of substantive laws but also could apply existing statutes.
 The words 'until a District Council is so constituted for an autonomous district' in the paragraph only place a limit to the period until which the power is exercisable and not any limitation on the extent of the power or the period during which a Regulation made by the Governor would be in force once it is validly made. Like any other piece of legislation, the Regulation continues to operate and remain effective until it is either annulled or repealed under some legislative power. [512 A-D; 513 B-C] Ram Kirpal v. Bihar, [1969] INSC 325; [1970] 3 S.C.R. 233, followed.
 J. K. GaS Plant Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. King Emperor [1947] F.C.R. 141, referred to.
 (2) The effect of the Regulation was that the competent legislative authority, namely the Governor, selected certain laws enumerated in the schedule for their being applied to the district; and it left it to the Governor to decide on what date or dates and to which part or parts of the District any one or more of them should be extended and brought into force. The Regulation, therefore, was a conditional legislation [513 E-F, G-H] (3) Assuming, however, that it was delegated legislation there is no question of the delegation being excessive nor is it correct to say that the power so delegated lapsed with the lapse of the legislative authority of the Governor under para 19(1)(b). The power of the Governor to legislate ended when the District Council was constituted; but the power conferred by the Regulation on the Governor to bring into force the laws set out in the schedule continued and would continue so long as the Regulation remained on the statute book. [513 H. 514 A-B] Therefore, the notification dated September 8, 1961, extending the Excise Act, though issued after the power under para 19(1)(b) had ceased. was valid since the Regulation itself continued to operate and the power to issue such a notification did not lapse.
