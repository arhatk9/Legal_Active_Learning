 The Kirlampudi Sugar Mills Ltd. was started in 1951 as a small unit and later was increased to a larger crushing capacity of 1000 tons. By 1963 the factory got into financial embarrassment. in the middle of that year the- present management took over the factory on the specific assurance of the Government that they would provide for and give all facilities to enable them to run the factory.
 After the management was taken over there were disputes between the management and workers with the result that they referred various matters for adjudication including the claim for implementation of the recommendations of the Central Wage Board for sugar. The disputed items related to categorisation of workers their fitments, fixation of work load, the demand for increase of Rs. 10 to be given to every worker over the basic wage implementation of weight age, dearness allowance. the demand for giving grades and for giving retrospective effect etc. On issue No. IA the Tribunal held that categorisation of workers and their fitments and work load should be in accordance with the recommendations of the Wage Board; it decided in favour of the management in respect of certain categories of workers but in respect of some others it gave relief to the workers.
 The Tribunal further held in respect of issue. 2 and 5 before it that the financial capacity of the Appellant was not such as to justify an increase of Rs. IO to all the workers over the basic wage and dearness allowance or the payment of Rs. 5 to workmen for implementation of the weightage recommended by the Wage Board. Appeal No., 1602 of 1966 was filed in this Court by special leave by the management against the Award of the Tribunal in respect of issue IA in so far as it went against them. Appeal No. 1603 of 1966 was filed by the workers against the Tribunal's decision on issues 2 and 5 and that part of issue IA which went against them. The questions that fell for considera- tion were : (i) whether the recommendations of the Wage Board were vitiated by the fact that they had fixed the wages uniformly region-wise without further classification within each region; (ii) If they were valid, whether the Tribunal could go into the question of the financial capacity of the company to implement them; (iii) whether the company had the financial capacity to implement the recommendations.
 
HELD : The Wage Board following the principles laid down by this Court has considered the capacity of the industry region-wise and has also fixed wages different from region to region having regard to the difference in the capacity of the Industry region wise. Further it has given good reason for not furnishing a criteria for further classification of the industry within the region. In these circumstances prescribing the same wage for all units of industry in the same region was justified and the fact that the 429 industry in the region had not been divided into classes could not vitiate he recommendation of the Wage Board.

Workmen, [1963] Supp. 2 S.C.R. 16, referred to However, notwithstanding the fact that a fair wage has been fixed by the Board which would be applicable to all the units in the region for which wage has been fixed, it may be open to any particular unit to plead that in fact its financial position is not such that it can bear the burden of implementing the recommendations. The justification of the plea of want of financial capacity will depend upon the evidence of its financial position over a period of years, to show that it cannot bear the burden or that it is only a temporary or fortuitous situation with every possibility of financial improvement in the immediate future [442 E; 443 C] Ahmedabad Mill Owners' Association etc. v. Textile Labour Association[1965] INSC 149; , [1966] 1 S.C.R. 382, relied on.
 The Appellant's balance sheets for the years 1960 to 1970 for a period of 10 years showed that except for the year ending 30-6-69 the company was not in a position to declare any dividends. Though the factory appeared to have been expanded after 1964 to 300 tons capacity it did not show uniform net profits; on the other hand losses continued.
 The profits that it made in any year seemed to be consumed by losses of the previous years. Various factors contributed to financial unsteadiness. [448 G-H] This being the position the Tribunal was justified in holding that the Appellant did not have the financial capacity to bear the burden of payment of Rs. 10 increase and Rs. 5 as weightage in accordance with the re- commendations of the Wage Board. On this conclusion and also on an examination of the relevant material it was evident that the company was not in a financial position to meet the burden of implementing the recommendations of the Wage Board. Despite this the company had implemented the award in respect of a large number of workers both as to categorisation and fitment except in regard to four categories. The claim, of the Respondent workmen for categorisation and fitment in accordance with the Award in regard to these could not, in the circumstances, be accepted.
