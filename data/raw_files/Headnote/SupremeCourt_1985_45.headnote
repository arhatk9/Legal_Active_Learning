 In case of promotion to posts promotion to which are by the selection method, 15% and 7.5 per cent of posts were to be reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes respectively. Para 9 of the Presidential Directive provided that the aforesaid rule of reservation was also applicable to promotions by selection to posts within Group A' carrying a salary of Rs. 2250 per month or less, and prescribed that officers belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes would be considered for promotion, who are senior enough to be within the zone of consideration, and described the procedure to be adopted.
 By a letter dated the 8th April, 1982, the Ministry of Steel and Mines, Department of Steel, informed the Chairman, Steel Authority of India Limited, that in accordance with para 9 of the Presidential Directive there was no reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in promotion by selection to posts within Group A'. This letter in turn was followed up by a communication dated August 19, 1982 by the Steel Authority of India to the Chief Personnel Manager, Bokaro Steel Plant stating that no reservation for scheduled caste / scheduled tribe candidates in matters of promotions to any grade within Group-A posts are to be provided, since promotions within Group-A posts in the company are based on selection method.
 The writ petition of the Appellant, complaining that the letter dated April 8, 1982 of the Ministry of Steel & Mines and the letter dated August 13 19, 1982 to the Chief Personnel Manager of Bokaro Steel Plant purported to deny to the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes the benefit of reservation in the matter of promotion to selection posts within Group 'A', was summarily dismissed by the High Court.
 Allowing the Appeal to this Court, ^ 
 HELD: 1. Para 9 of the Presidential Directive, which deals with "concession to employees of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in promotions by selection method" makes abundantly clear that the rule of reservation is also applicable to promotions by selection to posts within Group 'A' which carry an ultimate salary of Rs. 2,250 per month or less. It however, prescribes a procedure different from the usual procedure adopted in filling up posts reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
