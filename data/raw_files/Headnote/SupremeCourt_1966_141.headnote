 N, by a will made in December 1888, appointed his widow, S, as the executrix of his estate; he also bequeathed to her for her natural life certain garden lands measuring about 31 bighas and after her death to his son absolutely by way of vested remainder. Clause 3 of the will directed S to pay maintenance to the Testator's mother; clause 4 provides that S could sell any portion of the estate if necessary, for the purpose of meeting the marriage expenses of the testator's son and daughter; clause 5 provided that the executrix would pay the testator's debts and realize his dues.
 After N's death in September, 1899, the plaintiff's predecessor in interest purchased the son's interest at an auction sale held in execution of a decree against the son who became an insolvent.
 In July 1901 S executed a lease of 6 bighas out of the aforesaid 31 bighas of garden land and the interest in this leasehold subsequently vested in the 3rd defendant.
 In September 1945 the plaintiffs instituted a suit claiming a declaration of their title to and for recovery of khas possession of the garden land and for other reliefs. '[be Trial Court decreed the suit. The decree passed against the defendants other than the 3rd defendant was confirmed by the High Court and became final. In the appeal filed by the 3rd defendant, the High Court confirmed the decree of the trial court declaring the plaintiffs title to the 6 bighas of land covered by the leasehold, but it set aside the decree for recovery of khas possession and mesne profits, and instead passed a decree for 3 years rent in respect of the property.
 In the appeal to this Court the plaintiffs challenged the correctness of the decree and it was contended on their behalf that the specific authority in clause 4 of the will to deal with the estate in a particular way negatived any authority to deal with it in any other way. The question for consideration therefore was whether the will of N imposed any restriction on the power of S. executrix, to dispose of his immovable properties vested in her as the executrix.
 
HELD : On the consideration of the terms of the will that Clause 4 of the will did not fetter the power of the executrix to lease the property in due course of administration. Clear language was required for restricting the power of the executrix to deal with the property under a. 90 (1) of the Probate and Administration Act, 1881. The principle expressum facit cessare tacitum had no application to the case. [165 E-F] Purna Chandra Bakshi v. Nobin Chandra Gangopadhya, (1903) 8 C.W.N. 362, referred to.
