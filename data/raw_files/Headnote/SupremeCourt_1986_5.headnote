 A building was bequeathed by its owner by his will in favour of the respondent-University. The respondent- University probated the will and decided to use the building to provide accommodation for its employees and on this ground filed applications for eviction against the petitioners under s. 22 of the Delhi Rent Control Act 1958.
 In the eviction proceedings the petitioners tenants contended: (1) that the ground of bona fide need was outside the objects mentioned in the will and, therefore, the applications were not maintainable and (2) that the building was non-residential and as such the petition seeking their eviction from the building for the purpose of residence of its employees was not maintainable. The Rent Control authorities concurrently held that the only limitation placed on the University in the will was against selling or disposing of the property. The Tribunal observed that it was not disputed before it that the building was residential in nature though some portion of it had been used for commercial purposes. All the courts below concurrently found that the bona fide need was well founded and hence ordered eviction.
 In appeal to this Court, by the tenants it was contended that the use of the building for the residence of the employees of the University would not come within the expression "for the furtherance of its activities", and that the activities of the University were restricted to what took place within the University and providing accommodation for its employees would not come within that concept.
 132 Dismissing the appeal and special leave petitions, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The eviction applications came squarely within s. 22(d) of the Delhi Rent Control Act,1958 and the order of eviction passed against the appellants and the petitioners was correct. [134 E; 135 C] 
 2. That the University of Delhi is a public Institution cannot be disputed because the Explanation to s. 22 makes it abundantly clear. Section 22 enables a public institution to maintain a petition for eviction notwithstanding anything contained in s. 14 or any other law if the application discloses sufficient grounds to indicate that it is for the furtherance of its activities. [134 F-G] 
 3. Residential accommodation for the employees of the University is one of the most pressing requirements to make the employees contented. A University cannot be properly run when its employees are without a roof above them. Therefore, to provide accommodation to the employees directly comes within the expression "for the furtherance of its activities". Use of the building for the residence of the employees is intimately linked with its activities. The requirements of the section, in the instant case, are satisfied. [135 A-B]
