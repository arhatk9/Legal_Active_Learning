 Section 17(1) of the Industrial, Disputes Act, 1947, makes it obligatory on the appropriate Government to publish the award received by it from the Industrial Tribunal; but, the provision in the section as to time, that the Government shall publish it within a period of thirty days from the date of its receipt, is merely directory and not mandatory.
 Therefore, where the Government received the award on 14th October 1966 and published it in the Gazette on the 15th November 1966, the award did not cease to be enforceable.
