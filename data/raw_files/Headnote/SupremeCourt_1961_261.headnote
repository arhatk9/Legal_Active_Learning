 The assessee company was incorporated in 1920 with the objects, inter alia, of acquiring underground coal-mining and relative rights and to do business of coal raising etc.
 Power was given under the memorandum of association to case, develop or otherwise deal with the property and rights of the company. The asscssee acquired from time to time diverse coal-mining leases and after developing the coal- fields by providing means of communication etc., sub-leased them to collieries and other companies. As a condition of the acquisition of the head leases the assessee had paid salam at the rate of Rs. 40/- per standard bigha and had agreed to pay royalty at certain rate-, while from the subleases it charged salami at the rate of Rs. 400/- and royalties at higher rates. For the assessment years 1949-50 and 1950-51 the assessee admitted the liability to tax in respect of the income arising from the enhanced royalties, but claimed that the excess amount realised by way of increased salami was an appreciation of capital and could not be taxed on the grounds that apart from obtaining head leases, developing the coal fields and sub-leasing its rights, the assessee did not do any business' either by working the coal-fields with a view to raising coal or by acquiring or selling coal raised by the sublessees.
 Held, that the assessee company in acquiring the head leases and in granting the sub-leases was carrying on a business within its memorandum of association and that the increased salami received from the sub-lessees represented profits of that business, liable to be included in the assessable income for purposes income-tax and business profits tax.
