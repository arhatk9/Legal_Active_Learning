 In the Andhra area of the State of Andhra Pradesh there are four medical colleges run by the State Government. In July 1970, the Government prescribed for the first time an Entrance test for admission to the colleges and also prescribed the standard of eligibility for the test. A large number of candidates, far in excess of the seats available took the test. Some of the candidates, who were unsuccessful, filed writ petitions challenging the validity of the test prescribed and the method of selection for admission. They contended that, (1) under the provisions of the Andhra University Act" 1926 it was only the Academic Council of the Andhra University that was competent to prescribe qualifications for admission into all degree courses, including the M.B.B.S. course in Govt. Colleges, and it was not for the Government to substitute itself for the statutory Academic body and test the academic standards of candidates; (2) the holding of the Entrance Test and making selections on the basis thereof. in disregard of the marks obtained at the public examination held by the University encroached upon the central subject listed in Entry 66 of List I of VII Schedule to the Constitution; and (3) the test interfered with the personal liberty of the candidates violating Art. 21 of the Constitution. The High Court allowed the petitions. In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) Under Art. 162 of the Constitution the executive power of a State extends to the matters with respect to which the Legislature of the State has power to make laws.
 if there is no legislation covering the field the State Government would undoubtedly be competent to prescribe a test itself to screen the best candidates. [703 F-H] The Andhra University Act, 1926, prescribes the minimum qualification for entry into a higher course of study. A candidate has not an ,unqualified right to a seat in a medical college merely because he has obtained higher marks than another candidate at the qualifying examination.
 Sections 23 and 33 of the Act do not make it incumbent upon the Government to make their selection in accordance with the marks obtained by applicant-candidates at the qualifying examination. Since all the applicants could not be admitted, the Government, which ran them colleges, had a right to make a selection out of the large number of 700 candidates and for this purpose they could prescribe a test of their own which was not against any law and prescribe the minimum number of marks at the qualifying examination for eligibility to the Entrance test. Merely because the Government supplemented the eligibility rule by a written test in subjects with which the candidates were already familiar, their action cannot be impeached nor was there anything unfair in the test prescribed. The test was not in substitution of the University Examination but something additional to that; and the mere fact that the test was introduced for the first time would be no ground for holding that the method of selection was invalid [704 D-F; 708 F-G;
 709 A-B, F] (2)The test prescribed by the Government in no way militates against the power of Parliament under Entry 66 of List I of the VII Schedule to the Constitution The Entry gives Parliament power to make laws for laying_down how stanards in an institutino for higher education are to be determined and how they can be coordinated. It has no relation to a test prescribed by Government or by a university for selection of a number of students from out of a large number applying for admission to a particular course of study. [705 B-D] (3)The test in no way affects the personal liberty of the candidates secured under Art. 21 of the Constitution.
 Everybody, subject to the eligibility prescribed by the University was at liberty to apply for admission to the medical colleges. The number of seats being limited every candidate could not expect to be admitted. The deprivation of personal liberty, if any, in the matter of admission to a medical college was according to procedure established by law. [709 H; 710 A-B] R.Chitralekha v.
