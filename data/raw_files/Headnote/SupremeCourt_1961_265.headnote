 The deceased was going to his field and passed by a platform on which T and his father B were sitting, T carrying a pistol with him. As he passed by the platform B instigated T to shoot the deceased down and T shot him. T and B were tried for the murder and were convicted on the basis of the testimony of eye witnesses and the dying declaration of -'the deceased. B was sentenced to imprisonment for life and T was sentenced to death. The appellant contended that if the deceased was at the spot marked by the Sub-Inspector on the sketch map he could not have received the injuries as stated by the eye witnesses. It was further urged that the sentence of T should be reduced to imprisonment for life as he had acted under the influence of his father.
 Held, that, the marks made on the sketch map by the Sub- Inspector on the basis of statements made by witness" to him were inadmissible under s. 162 Code of Criminal Procedure and the appellant could not use them to found any argument as to the improbability of the deceased being hit in the manner stated by the witnesses if he was standing at the spot marked on the sketch map, 581 Bhagirathi Chowdhury v. King Emperor, A.I.R. 1926 Cal. 550, Ibra Akanda v. Emperor, A.I.R. 1944 Cal. 339 and Santa Singh v. The State of Punjab, A.I.R. 1956 S. C. 526,referred to.
 Held, further, that there was no reason to interfere with the sentence of death passed on T. T was a mature man of 25 and he was sitting armed with a pistol along with his father obviously having planned the murder with his father.
 though he shot at the instigation of his father, he could not be considered a young boy in his teens who was completely under the influence of his father.
