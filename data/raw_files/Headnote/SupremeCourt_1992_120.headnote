 The appellant-company, which was formed for exploiting the manufacturing licence issued by the Government in favour of its promoter Corporation, entered into an agree- ment with the promoter corporation to secure and take over from the promoter Corporation the rights under the licence to manufacture tempo vehicles and to take over its factory as a going concern with its assets, liabilities, machinery, power, quotas etc.Clause 10 of the agreement provided that the transferee, the appellant company, should be in posses- sion of the premises of the factory and the building on payment of monthly rent as a lessee. tools and implements valued at Rs. 3500 of the promoter corporation, were also transferred to the company. After the take-over, the licence was endorsed by the appropriate authority of the Government of India in favour of the assessee company.
 In assessment proceedings for the year 1960-61, the appellant company, the assessee claimed benefit of partial exemption from payment of tax under section 15C of the Act of 1972 as the company was a new undertaking. the Income Tax Officer rejected the claim on the ground that though the undertaking was new, it was not entitled to the benefit, as it 766 was formed by splitting up of business already in existence and also by transfer to the new business of the building and machinery previously used in the other business. Howev- er, the Income Tax Officer observed that it could not be held, on the facts of the case, that it was a case of recon- struction of the business already in existence.
 On appeal by the assessee-company, the appellate As- sistant commissioner held that taking premises on lease could not be held to amount transfer of the building as the building in which the undertaking was set up was not pur- chased but taken onlease only and that since, admittedly,the value of the building could not be included in the capital computation for the purposes of section 15 C, the value of which would be negligible as compared to the value of the assets installed, the assessee was entitled to claim the benefit. In further appeal, the Income Tax Appellate Tribu- nal agreed with the order of the Appellate Authority and rejected revenue's contention that since the premises in question were earlier used for the purpose of business, the assessee was disentitled from claiming the benefit as the 'newly established undertaking must also refer to a building previously used by the assessee himself in any other busi- ness'. It held that lease could not be held to be transfer, and that an industrial undertaking to be covered in the mischief of clause (i)of sub-section(2) of section 15C should have been 'formed' by transfer of building, plant or machinery,which was substantial and prominent in the forma- tion of the undertaking ;in other words, the part played by such transfer should have been such that the industry with- out it could not have come into being, and that it could not stand to reason that a big industrial undertaking should be denied the benefit of Section 15C, only because it took the business premises on lease or used its implements and tools worth a small amount previously used for the purposes of business.
 On a reference made by the department, the High Court answered the question of law raised by the department in its favour and against the assessee. Hence the appeals by the assessee.
 On the question whether the assessee was entitled to claim partial exemption from payment of tax under section 15C of Income Tax Act,1922 on profit and gains derived from an industrial undertaking established in a building taken on lease used for other business, and whether the assessee- company, which had been found by the tribunal, to be a new 767 Company, could be denied the benefit as visualised in Sec- tion 15C(1) because of operation of clause (i) of sub_sec- tion (2).
 Allowing the appeals by the assessee-Company, this Court, 
 HELD:1.1. Section 15 C of the Income Tax Act, 1922 read as a whole, was a provision, directed towards encouraging industrialisation by permitting an assessee setting up a new undertaking to claim benefit of not paying tax to the extent of six per cent in a year on the capital employed. But the legislature took care to restrict such benefit only to those undertakings which were new in form and substance, by pro- viding that the undertaking should not be 'formed'in any manner provided in clause (i)of sub-section (2) of Section 15C. Each of these requirements, namely, formation of the undertaking by splitting up or reconstruction of an existing business or transfer to the undertaking of buildings, raw material or plant used in any previous business results in denial of the benefit contemplated under sub-section (1) clause(i)of sub -section (2) is a restrictive clause. By this clause, the legislature intended to control any attempt or effort to abuse the benefit intended for new undertaking by change of label. The intention was not to deny benefit to genuine new industrial undertaking but to control the mis- chief which might have otherwise taken place. Therefore, a provision in taxing state granting incentives for promoting growth and development should be construed liberally.
 Consequently, the restriction on it, too, has to be con- strued so as to advance the objective of the section and not to frustrate it. Adopting a literal interpretation would result in defeating the purpose of section 15C. Therefore, it becomes necessary to resort to a construction which is reasonable and purposive to make the provision meaningful[773D-F,774B,774D] Broach Distt.

Strawboard Manufacturing Company Ltd; 177ITR[1989] 431 SC, relied on.
 
 1.2 Initial exercise, therefore, should be to find out if the undertaking was new. Once this test is satisfied then clause(i) should be applied reasonably and liberally in keeping with spirit of Section 15C (1)of the Act. While doing so, various situations may arise. For instance, the formation may be without anything to do with any earlier business. That is, the undertaking may be formed without splitting up or reconstructing 768 any existing business or without transfer of any building material or plant of any previous business. Such an under- taking undoubtedly would be eligible to benefit without any difficulty . On the other extreme may be an undertaking new in its form but not in substance. It may be new in name only. Such an undertaking would obviously not be entitled to the benefit. In between the two, there may be various other situations, for instance, a new company may be formed, as was in the instant case, but tools and implements worth Rs.3500 were transferred to it of previous firm. Technical- ly speaking it was transfer of material used in previous business.
 [777 C-F] 1.3 World of a statute are undoubtedly the best guide.
 But if their meaning gets clouded then the courts are re- quired to clear the haze. Sub-section (2) advances the objective of sub-section (1)by including in it every under- taking except if it is covered by clause (i) for which it is necessary that it should not be formed by transfer of build- ing or machinery. The restrictions are denial of benefit arises not by transfer of building or material to the new company but that it should not be formed by such transfer.
 This is the key to the interpretation. The formation should not be by such transfer. The emphasis is on formation not on use. Therefore, it is not every transfer of building or material but the one which can be held to have resulted in formation of the undertaking . Even if the undertaking is established by transfer of building, plant or machinery but it is not formed as a result of such transfer the assessee could not be denied the benefit.[777G-H,778A] Commissioner of Income Tax, West Bengal-II v.

 1.4 The words 'previously used in any other business' cannot be construed so narrowly as to confine it to building of the assessee only . but it cannot be said that if new undertaking was established in a premises 769 taken on lease then it, always, amounted to formation of the undertaking by transfer of the building previously used.

 1.5. `Form' according to the dictionary has different meanings. In the context in which it has been used it was intended to connote that the body of the company or its shape did not come up in consequence of transfer of build- ing, machinery or plant used previously for business pur- pose. Use of the negative before word 'formed' further strengthens it. In other words, building, machinery or plant used previously in other business should not result in the undertaking being formed by it. The transfer to take out the new undertaking out of purview of sub-section (1) must be such that but for transfer the new undertaking could not have come into being. [779 C-D] 
 1.6 In the instant case, the part played by taking the building on lease was not dominant in formation of the company. The High Court was therefore not justified in answering the question in favour of the revenue. The assesse was entitled to partial exemption under Section 15C of the Income Tax Act, 1922. [799 E]
