 The appellant M.S.T.C. had taken a lease of the original company known as R. B. Bansilal Abhir Chand Spinning and Weaving Mills (P) Ltd., Hinganghat (Maharashtra). The said company was ordered to be wound up by an order dated 1-10- 1965 and an official Liquidator was appointed. On 3-2-1967, a lease for the running of the mill was taken by the government of Maharashtra which was handed over to the appellant for running the mill on behalf of the state. At the time of taking over, the appellant did not take possession of all materials which it considered unnecessary as it did not want to pay higher compensation. Consequently several items were segregated and handed over to the official Liquidator. On 31-12-1972 the Sick Textile Undertakings (Taking over of Management) Act, 1972 was passed and was given retrospective operation w.e.f. 31-10- 1972 the date of its earlier ordinance. In January 1973, a Writ Petition was filed in this Court challenging the cons- titutional validity of the Management Act of 1972 and while the Writ Petition was pending an interim order dated 28-9- 1973 was passed viz.; "Upon hearing Counsel, the Court directed that the maintenance of status quo shall continue pending disposal of the Writ Petition except that the liquidation proceedings will go on, but there will be no distribution of money amongst creditors or contributors until further orders." On 16-11-73 meetings were held before the official liquidator to consider the effect of the interim order and ultimately the official liquidator, with the concurrence of the representatives of the erstwhile directors of the Company, decided that the assets of the company may be realised by the official liquidator. On 19-4-74 the official Liquidator reported to the court for granting permission for sale of certain moveable such as furniture duplicating machines and machinery scrap etc. on which the company 'court directed notice to the Additional Government Pleader. On 30-4-1974, the appellant appeared and wanted time for filing objections but no objections were filed and the company judge by its order dated 25-6-1974 directed the official liquidator to sell the said assets and realise the price thereon. On 28-6-1974, certain directors were sought by the official liquidator for approving the proposed purchasers which was granted and the items were sold for Rs. 72,501/-. On 3-7-1974 the court accepted the offer of respondents 2 and 3 and nine days later, the court granted permission for removal of the materials by the purchasers, but because of some labour troubles, the materials could not be taken physical possession of by the purchasers. The Division Bench of the Bombay High Court dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant against the order of the court directing the sale of the articles on the ground that as this court by virtue of its interim order dt. 28-9-1973 had authorised the sale of the articles, the court was fully justified in ordering the sale of these articles.
 Allowing the appeal by special leave, the Court, 
HELD : 1. The High Court has not properly construed the interim order ,of this Court and was under an erroneous impression of law that this Court by itsinterim order had in fact authorised the sale which in law is invalid.
 [503-B] 2.The interpretation put upon the interim order by the High Court is not ,correct. The order of this Court directing the, maintenance of status quo did clot impliedly amount to suspension of the provisions of the Management Act. [503-D] 500 3.Though S. 8(1) of the Management Act does not place an absolute embargo on the continuance of the proceedings for the winding up of a textile company, it imposes an important condition for the continuance of the proceedings, namely, that the consent of the Central Government should be obtained. [503F] 4.When this Court passed the interim order dt. 28-9-1973 and 'allowed the liquidation proceedings to continue it, it only meant that the proceedings should continue in accordance with law and if the law enjoined any condition the same must be complied with. in view of the provisions of S. 8 of the Management Act, the consent of the Central Government was necessary, so the order of this Court would be interpreted as meaning that the proceedings. could continue after the official liquidator obtained the consent of the Central Government u/s 8 of the Management Act.
 [503F-G] 5.The order passed by this Court did not given any free licence to the parties to act in disobedience of the mandatory provisions of the Act and continue the proceedings without complying with the conditions enjoined by S. 8 of the Management Act. Without the consent of the Central Government the liquidation proceedings could not continue and the Company Judge was not legal,, justified in ordering the sale of the moveables without obtaining the sanction of the Central Government. [503G-H, 504A] 6.The words " winding up" in S. 8 of the Management Act must be given the widest possible amplitude in order to serve the purpose of the Act, namely, to control the proceedings of a textile company which is in liquidation, by the Central Government. Whether the company had been wound up or whether the proceedings for the 'winding up of the company had been continuing would make no difference so far as the application of Section 8 of the Management Act is concerned. It is not possible, therefore to construe the words "winding up" in such a narrow sense, viz. that it applies merely to proceedings for the winding up of a textile company, so as to defeat the very object of the Management Act. [504B-D] 7.On a proper construction of S. 35 of the Nationalisation Act, which reproduced the provisions of S. 8 of the Management Act in a different form the permission of the company judge given to official liquidator to sell the moveables would fall within the mischief of S. 35 of the Act. [504-G] 8.In view of the definition of the word "Appointed day" in Sections 2(1)(a) of the Nationalisation Act, it is clear that the Act, after being passed' would by virtue of its statutory fiction, take effect from the 1st day of April' 1974 and all proceedings taken after this day without the permission of the Central Government would become void ab initio. The High Court was in error in not giving effect to the statutory fiction contained in S. 2(1)(a) of the Nationalisation Act, by explaining away that as the Nationalisation Act was in fact passed after the court had granted permission to sell, it could not affect the sale at all. Even though the Nationalisation Act may have come in force on a later date, the statutory fiction contained in the Act must be fully given effect to by the court even if the effect of the same is to nullify anorder passed prior to the passing of the Act.

 Superintendent, Centralfail' Tihar, New Delhi A.I.R.
 1975 S.C. 164 applied;
 9.The express provision of S. 35 of the Nationalisation Act clearly voided the sale which took place under the orders of the company judge after the Act would be deemed to have come into force. The order by which the articles were sold was void in law and completely destitute of any legal effect. The Interim order passed by this Court on 28-9-1973 could not have had the, effect of authorising the sale which was void under the statute. [505 F-G] 501
