 The respondents, who had been allotted a plot by the Rehabilitation Ministry agreed to sell it to the appellants and received a part of the purchase money. On the date of the contract the respondents' title was not perfect as the lease deed in their 'favour had not been executed by the Government nor did the respondents obtain the sanction of the Ministry which was necessary for transferring the plot.
 Therefore, the period for execution of the sale-deed was extended till after receipt of the sanction. But the sanction was applied 'for more than a year later.
 Meanwhile, the respondents wrote to the appellants stating that it was uncertain as to when the sanction would be granted, that therefore the agreement had become void on account of uncertainty, but that they were willing to have the sale-deed registered on payment by the appellants of the balance without waiting for the sanction. Apprehending that the respondents were trying to dispose of the plot to someone else the appellants informed prospective buyers about the agreement in their favour. They also wrote to the respondents declaring their readiness and willingness to pay the balance of the purchase price on the respondents procuring the sanction. Thereafter, the sanction was granted, but the respondents never informed the appellants;
 but coming to know about it the appellants filed a suit claiming specific performance of the contract.
 The trial court held that the respondents, by their letters made time the essence of the contract and refused to decree specific performance, 'out ranted a decree for refund of the amount paid. Thereafter, the appellants applied to the trial court for an injunction restraining the respondents from disposing of the property, but the injunction was not granted and the plot was sold to a third party. The appellants filed an appeal in the High Court against the decree of the trial court refusing specific performance, and during the pendency of the appeal, the amount decreed by the trial court was deposited by the respondents, but the appellants did not withdraw the amount. The High Court confirmed the decree of the trial court and also held that once the appellants obtained satisfaction of the decree for the amount paid by them, they became disentitled to a decree for specific performance.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) There was no question of time having been made the essence of the contract by the letters sent by the respondents; nor could it be said that the appellants had failed to perform their part of the agreement within a reasonable time. 1579 El 5 7 4 As long as the title of the respondents was incomplete and sanction for sale was not obtained there was no question of completing the sale. Also, after the sanction was given, the respondents did not inform the appellants so as to enable them to perform their part of the agreement. [578 E- F; 579 D-E] (2)There was nothing to indicate that the appellants were not ready and willing to perform their part of the contract.
 Readiness and willingness must be determined 'from the entirety of the facts and circumstances relating to the intention and conduct-of the party concerned. In the pre- sent case, the facts that the appellants informed prospective buyers about the existence of the agreement in their favour, that they wrote to the respondents declaring their readiness and willingness to pay the balance as soon as the sanction was obtained, and that they promptly filed the suit, showed their keenness and readiness. The appellants were carrying on business and were in a position to arrange for the balance of the purchase money. It was neither necessary nor incumbent on them to send any draft conveyance after the respondents had cancelled the agreements [579 H; 580 B-C] (3)In the present case, the rule that the appellants could not accept satisfaction of the decree of the trial court and yet prefer an appeal against that decree cannot apply, because, the appellants had by consistent and unequivocal conduct by applying for injunction and prosecuting the appeal in the High Court made it clear that they were not willing to accept the judgment of the trial court as correct. The grant of relief of specific performance is discretionary but the discretion must be exercised in accordance with judicial principles and not arbitrarily. It could not be held that the conduct of the appellants was such that it precluded them from obtaining a decree for specific performance. [581 F-H; 582 A-B] [It was directed that the subsequent transferee should join, in the conveyance so as to pass on the title which resides in him to the appellants.] [582 B-C] Lal Durga Prasad v. Lala Deep Chand, [1953] INSC 71; [1954] S.C.R. 360 referred to.
