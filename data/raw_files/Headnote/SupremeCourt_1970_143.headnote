 H and his son R were two out of the five partners of the respondent firm and represented the interest of a Hindu undivided family. The Income-tax Officer granted registration of the firm under s. 26A of the Income-tax Act, 1922. In 1954-55, he declined to grant such registration.
 The Appellate Assistant Commissioner confirmed his order on the ground that two coparceners could not represent the interest of the H.U.F. in a partnership. The Tribunal reversed this order and the High Court, upon a reference of the question whether the respondent firm could be granted' registration, answered it in the affirmative.
 On appeal to this Court, 
HELD : Dismissing the appeal, That a partnership in which two members of a coparcenary represent same beneficial interest of an H.U.F., may be validly registered under the Income Tax. [648 C-D] Ram Lax an Sugar Mills v. Commissioner of Income-tax, U.P.

 The Indian Contract Act imposes no disability upon members of a Hindu undivided family in the matter of entering into a contract inter se or with a stranger. A member of a Hindu undivided family has the same liberty of contract as any other individual : it is restricted only ill the manner and to the extent provided by the Indian Contract Act.[648 H] It is now settled law that in considering an application for registration of a firm, the Income-tax Officer is not concerned to determine in whom the beneficial interest in the share in the partnership vests.
