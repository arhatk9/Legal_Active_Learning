 The petitioners who profess the Christian faith and belong to the United Church of Northern India are members of a society which maintain educational institutions primarily for the benefit of the Christian Community. The society con. ducts forty-two primary schools and a Training College for teachers. The teachers trained in the college are absorbed in the primary schools conducted by the society and those not so absorbed are employed by other Christian Mission Schools conducted by the United Church of Northern India. The cost of maintaining the training college and the primary schools is met out of donation; received from the Irish Pres by terian Mission, fee from scholars and grant-in-aid from the State Government. On May 28, 1935, the Government-of Bombay issued an order that from the academic year 1955-56, 80% of the seats in the training college., for teachers in non-Government training colleges shall be reserved for teachers nominated by the Government, and the Educational Inspector on June 13, 1955, ordered the Principal of the Training College of the Society, not to admit without specific permission of the Education department private students in excess of 20% of the total strength in each class. The Principal of the college expr- essed his inability to comply with the order. On December 27, 1955,the Educational Inspector informed the management that their action in refusing admission to Government nomi- nated teachers was irregular and against the Government Policy and he severely warned the society that for disregarding the orders, no grant would be paid to the college for the current, year. On March 29, 1956, the Educational Inspector called upon the Principal not to admit private candidates to the 1st year class without obtaining specific permission, failing which 838 severe disciplinary action, such as withdrawal of recognition of the institution, would be taken. The society was again informed by letter dated May 9,1956, that having failed to abide by the conditions set out earlier, the college will not be paid the education grant. The petitioners moved the Supreme Court for a writ in the nature of mandamus or other writ directing the State of Bombay and the Director of Education not to compel the Society and the petitioners to reserve 80% or any scats in the training college for the "Government nominated teachers", nor to compel the society and the petitioners to comply with the provisions of rr.5(2),11, 12 and 14 and not to withdraw recognition of the college or withhold grant-in-aid under r.
 14 otherwise. The petitioners claimed that their fundamental rights guaranteed by Arts. 30(1),26(a). (b),(c) and (d) and 19(1)(f) and (g) were violated by letters dated May 28,1955 December 27,1955, and March 29,1956, threatening to withhold the grant in aid and to withdraw recognition of the college.
 Held, that by the impugned rules and orders no right to acquire, hold or dispose of property was violated.
 Interference with the right of bare management of an educational institution does not amount to infringement of the right to property under Art. 19 (1) (f). No attempt was made by the order of the State to deprive the petitioners of their rights to property and the fundamental freedom guaranteed by Art.19(1)(f) was, therefore, not violated; nor was the right of the petitioners to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business guaranteed by Art. 19(1) (g) of the Constitution infringed by the impugned rules and directions.

 Held. further, that r.5(2) of the Rules for Primary Training Colleges and rr. 11 and 14 of the Rules for recognition of Private Training institutions, in so far as they relate to reservation, of seats therein under orders of Government and directions given pursuant thereto regarding reservation of 80% of the scats and the threat to with old grant-in-aid and recognition of the college, infringed the fundamental freedom under Art. 30(1).
 The right established by Art. 30(1) is a fundamental right declared in terms absolute : unlike the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by Art. 19 it is not subject to reasonable 839 restrictions. It is intended to be a real right for the protection of the minorities in the matter of setting up educational institutions of their own choice. The right is intended to be effective and is not to be whittled down by so called regulative measures conceived in the interest not of the minority educational institution, but of the public or the nation as a whole. Regulations which may lawfully be imposed either by legislative or executive action must satisfy a dual test the test of reasonableness, and the test that it is regulative of the educational character of the institution and is conducive to making the institution an effective vehicle of education for the minority community or other persons who resort to it.
