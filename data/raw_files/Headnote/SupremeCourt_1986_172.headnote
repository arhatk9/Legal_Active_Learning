 The Gujarat Secondary Education Act 1972 (Gujarat Act No. 18 of 1973) was enacted to provide for the regulation of secondary education in the State of Gujarat. Section 33 of the Act provides that whenever it appears to the State Government that the manager of any registered private secondary school has neglected to perform any of the duties imposed on him by or under the Act or the regulations and that it is necessary in the public interest to take over the management of the school, it may, after giving to the manager of such school a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the proposed action and after considering the cause, if any, shown by him, take over the management of the school for such period as the State Government may, from time to time fix, so, however, that such period shall not exceed 5 years in the aggregate. Section 34(1) provides that 15% of vacancies for the teaching staff of a registered private school shall be filled up by persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Section 35(1) requires every registered private secondary school to have two committees: (i) a school staff selection committee for the purpose of recruiting the teaching staff of the school other than the headmaster, and (ii) a special school committee for the purpose of recruiting the headmaster.
 These committees consist of the representatives of the management and the representatives of the teachers. The committees are required to select the headmaster and the teachers in the school. Section 36 of the Act provides that no person who is appointed as a headmaster, a teacher or a member of non-teaching staff of a registered private secondary school can be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank nor can his services be otherwise terminated by the manager until he has been given by the 603 manager a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken against him and the action proposed to be taken has also been approved in writing by an officer authorised in this behalf by the Gujarat Secondary Education Board established under the Act.
 The petitioners/appellants, as the case may be challenged the constitutional validity of the Act and particularly ss. 33, 34, 35 and 36. It was contended on their behalf: (i) that the assent given to the Act by the President being a qualified one, the Act was not enforceable; and (ii) that ss. 33, 34, 35 and 36 of the Act were contrary to the constitutional provisions.
 Dismissing the appeals and the writ petitions, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The Act which was duly published in the official Gazette contains the recital that the said Act had received the assent of the President on the 28th of September, 1973. Questions relating to the fact whether assent is given by the Governor or the President cannot be agitated in this manner. Moreover in the instant case, it is clear from the material placed before this Court that the President had given assent to the Act and it is not correct to say that it was a qualified assent.

 2. A large number of teachers are employed by the private secondary schools. The protection of their interests is also equally important from the point of view of the State. In these circumstances, a provision like s. 33 of the Act which provides that the taking over of the management of a school whenever it is found that the school is not being run in accordance with the statute and the best interest of all the students and the community is necessary. The management of a school cannot be taken over for an indefinite period because the said section provides such taking over shall not exceed 5 years in the aggregate.
 Before a school is taken over a reasonable opportunity has to be given to its manager for showing cause against the proposed action. In these circumstances, it cannot be said that s. 33 of the Act is unconstitutional. The said provision is introduced in the interest of the general public and does not, in any way, affect prejudicially the fundamental right of the management guaranteed under Art.
 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. [609C-F] 
 3. Since a large number of teachers whose salaries are met by the 604 grant given by the State under the Grants-in-Aid Code, are employed by the managements, the State should therefore have a voice in the method of recruitment. The State should also make provision for reservation of certain percentage of seats for members belonging to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes under Art. 16(4) of the Constitution. The insistence on having teachers belonging to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in also in the public interest. Children should be brought up in an atmosphere where there is opportunity to mix freely with students and teachers belonging to traditionally disfavoured communities also. The opportunity to show reverence to teachers belonging to Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes will in the long run enable the child brought up in that atmosphere to shed the feeling of superiority over members belonging to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.
 Such an atmosphere would also be congenial to the development of a society consisting of person free from feelings of hatred or contempt towards others. S. 34 of the Act serves the above mentioned laudable purpose. Even the teachers who belong to the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes have to possess the requisite qualifications for the posts. Therefore, there is no illegality in s. 34 of the Act. [609G-H; 610A-D] 
 4. The presence of the teachers working in the very school and of the representatives of the Board on the committee does not have the effect of silencing the voice of the management. The provisions of s. 35 of the Act do not appear to confer any arbitrary power on the selection committees nor can it be said that there are no guidelines regarding the mode of selection. They have got to select the teachers in accordance with the regulations. Therefore, s.
 35 of the Act is also constitutionally valid. [611B-C] 
 5. Section 36 protects the tenure of the teachers and of the non-teaching staff of a registered private secondary school and acts as a shield against arbitrary actions of the management resulting in wrongful termination of their services. If the management is aggrieved by the decision of the authorised officer it may prefer an appeal before the Tribunal under s. 36(5) of the Act within 30 days from the date of the decision of the authorised officer. S. 39 of the Act provides for the establishment of a Tribunal. The Tribunal consists of a District Judge or a person who has been or is qualified to be a judge of a High Court or a District Judge. The provision for an appeal to the Tribunal is a sufficient guarantee against any arbitrary order of the authorised officer refusing to grant unreasonably his approval to the termination of 605 the services of an employee. Merely because the management cannot terminate the services of a teacher or a member of a non-teaching staff forthwith without the approval of the authorised officer, it cannot be said that an unreasonable restriction has been imposed on the right of the management guaranteed under Art. 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.
