 % Section 13B of the Punjab Village Common Lands (Regulation) Act, 1961 inserted therein by the Haryana Act 34 of 1974 mandated transfer of all suits pending in any civil court against the panchayat relating to the question as to whether the suit land was excluded from the ambit of shamilat deh, to and institution of fresh proceedings in such cases before the Assistant Collector having jurisdiction over the village.
 The suit filed by the appellants for a declaration that they were the owners of the land in dispute in their possession and that the respondent Gram Sabha had nothing to do with the same, was transferred by the trial court to the Assistant Collector under s. 13B of the Act. The revision application filed by them was dismissed by the High Court.
 During the pendency of the appeal by special leave in this Court the Act was further amended by Act 2 of 1981 deleting s. 13B with retrospective effect from November 12, 1974. Amended s. 13(a) barred jurisdiction of civil courts to entertain or adjudicate upon the question (i) whether any land or other immovable property is or is not shamilat deh, and (ii) whether the suit land vests or does not vest in the Panchayat.
 It was contended for the appellants that there was no dispute as to the question whether the suit land was shamilat deh or not. The only question that has to be decided in the suit was whether the appellants had acquired title to the suit land by adverse possession, and therefore, s. 13(a)(i) was not applicable.
 437 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: The suit instituted by the appellants cannot be heard and disposed of by the civil court. The Assistant Collector to whom the suit has been transferred has jurisdiction to dispose of the same in accordance with the provisions of the Act as amended. [440AB] The trial court had transferred the suit to the Assistant Collector on a finding that the controversy between the parties related to the question as to whether the suit land was excluded from the ambit of shamilat deh as defined in s. 2(g) of the Act. The said finding has not been challenged either before the High Court or in the special leave petition. Therefore, the civil court will have no jurisdiction to try the suit instituted by the appellants involving the decision on the question as contained in s.
 13(a)(i) of the Act. [439F-G] Even assuming that s. 13(a)(i) is not applicable and that the question to be decided in the suit is whether the appellants had acquired title to the suit land which is Shamilat deh within the meaning of s. 2(g) of the Act, still the civil court will have no jurisdiction to try the suit in view of s. 13(a)(ii) of the Act, for the question would be whether the suit land vests or does not vest in the Gram sabha.
