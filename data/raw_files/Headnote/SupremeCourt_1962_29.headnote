 The Gujarat Spinning & Weaving Co. Ltd., closed its business on May 14, 1953, and sold its assets to Tarun Commercial Mills Co. Ltd. The old company had discharged all its workmen when it closed its business. The new company re-started the business after a week and took in its service the workmen of the old company. When the closure took place a dispute was pending between the old company and its workman with respect to bonus. The Textile Labour Association, which is a Representative Union of the textile workers in the city of Ahmedabad, filed an application before the Labour 891 Appellate Tribunal where the dispute was pending.
 The matter was compromised and the old company agreed to pay some agreed bonus. The textile Jabour Association gave an undertaking not to claim compensation in any other way in any future proceeding.
 Later on, 376 employees of the old company gave a notice under s. 42(1) of the Bombay Industrial Relations Act, 1947, and claimed compensation. The Textile Labour Association made an appearance before the Labour Court and contended that the application should be dismissed in view of the compromise arrived at before the Labour Appellate Tribunal. The Labour Court accepted the contention and dismissed the application. The workmen went in appeal to the Industrial Court but their appeal was also dismissed. They made a petition in the High Court under Art. 227 of the Constitution but that was summarily rejected. They have come in appeal to this Court by special leave.
 ^ Held, that where a Representative Union appears in any proceeding under the Act, no one else can be allowed to appear, not even the employee at whose instance the proceedings might have been started under s. 42(4). Where the appearance is by any representative of the employees other than a Representative Union, the authorities under s. 32 can permit the employee to appear himself in all proceedings before them. The employee is entitled to appear through any person in certain proceedings specified in s. 33.
 However, whenever the Representative Union makes an appearance, even the employee cannot appear in any proceeding under the Act, and the representation must be confined only to the Representative Union. The complete ban laid by s.
 27A on representation otherwise than through a representative of employees remains complete where the representative of employees is a Representative Union that has appeared. If the representative of employees that has appeared is other than the Representative Union, ss. 32 and 33 provide for exceptions.
 The bona fides or mala fides of the representative of employees can have nothing to do with the ban imposed by s. 27A on the appearance of any one else except the representative of employees as defined in s. 30.
 The argument based on the so called tyranny of a Representative Union or its motives in taking the action it may choose to take in any proceedings after it appears can have no relevance if the intention of the legislature is perfectly clear from the provisions of the Act.
