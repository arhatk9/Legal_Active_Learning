 The three appellants assaulted deceased Shashi Mohan with the common intention to cause injury likely to result in his death, but during the assault, two of them developed a further common intention of murdering him. The sessions Court tried the appellants for charges u/ss. 302/34 and ss.
 323 /34 I.P.C. but giving them the benefit of doubt, acquitted them. In a State appeal, the High Court set aside the acquittal order, and convicted all the assailants sentencing them for life.
 This Court considered the question whether the conviction of all the three appellants u/s. 302 with aid of s. 34 I.P.C.
 was justified in law, and partly allowing only the appeal of Bhaba Nanda Sarma.
 
HELD :-Applying the principle of law under s. 38 of the Penal Code, the case of Bhaba Nanda can be separated from that of his two brothers. He shared their common intention to assault, with the knowledge that it was likely to result in death but while committing the act in furtherance of that common intention, the other two developed and shared the common intention of causing the murder. Bhaba Nanda can, therefore, be held guilty only u/s. 304 Part 11 while the other two appellants are liable for the murder with the aid of s. 34 of the Penal Code.
