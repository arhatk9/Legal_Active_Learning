 In 1887 the head of a math granted a permanent lease of property belonging to the math. In 1910 the lessee's successor in interest made a gift of the leased premises to a Jain Sabha for constructing a school thereon with the condition that if the school was removed from the site or ceased to exist, the site should revert to the donor. In 1925 the plaintiff became head of the math and in 1932 he instituted a suit for ejectment against the heirs of the lessee alleging that the lease was not binding on the math and obtained a decree for possession. The Jain Sabha however was not effectively made a party to the suit and was dismissed from it. In 1943 the plaintiff instituted a suit against the Jain Sabha for possession; and it was contended, inter alia, on his behalf, that the Jain Sabha as a sub- lessee under the defendants in the earlier suit was bound by the decree obtained therein:
 Held, (i) that the rule of law that a sub-lessee would be bound by a decree for possession obtained by the landlord against the lessee was not applicable to the present case, because (a) the suit of 1932 was not a suit by a landlord to evict his lessee but was a suit based on title to eject the heirs of the lessee on the ground that they were trespassers, and (b) because the lands were not given to the Sabha by way of sublease, but by way of gift;
 (ii) the suit was not saved by s. 10 of the Limitation Act as the lease was for valuable consideration and the defendant was not therefore precluded by reason of the fact that the property was to his knowledge trust property, from relying on the provision of the law which prescribes the time within which such a suit should be brought.
 The expression " valuable consideration " has a well- known connotation in law and is not synonymous with " adequate consideration."
