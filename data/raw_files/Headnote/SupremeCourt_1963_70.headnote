 One S filed an election petition against the appellant who had been declared elected to the State Legislative Assembly.
 The appellant applied to the Tribunal for dismissing the petition under 9. 90 (3) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, for noncompliance with the provisions of s. 82 of the Act. The Tribunal accepted the application and dismissed the election petition. Thereupon S filed an appeal under s. 116-A before-the High Court. Subsequently, Supplied forwithdrawal of the appeal but the High Court refused to permit with drawal holding that it had to be guided by the principles of $S. 109 and II 0 of the Act in considering the application for withdrawal.
 Held that S had an absolute right to withdraw the appeal and the High Court was bound to grant him permission to do so.
 Section 116-A (2) of the Act provides that "subject to the provisions of this Act" the High Court shall, in in appeal under the section, have the same powers. jurisdiction and authority and shall follow the same procedure as if the appeal were an appeal from an original decree passed by a Civil Court. The words "subject to the provisions of this Act" in sub-s. (2) mean that the provision must be an express provision in the Act or such as arises by necessary implication from an express provision. Accordingly ss. 109 and 110 of the Act which deal with the withdrawal of election petitions do not apply to the appeal under s. 116- A. There is no express provision in the Act dealing with appeals which deals with the question of withdrawal of appeals and so the provisions regarding withdrawal applicable to ordinary civil appeals before the High Court are applicable also to appeals under 116-A. Under 0.38, r.
 1 (1), Code of Civil procedure, 539 an appellant has the right to withdraw his appeal uncondi- tionally and if he makes such application the High Court has to grant it. Therefore, when an appellant under s. 116-A of the Act makes an application for an unconditional withdrawal of the appeal , the High Court must grant the same.
