 The appellant, a rustic young woman, flogged out of her husband's house by her father-in-law, was living with her parents with her only child. She committed a premeditated, cleverly planned murder of another young woman and her child because of rivalry between the appellant and the murdered woman for the affections of an illicit lover. The Sessions court awarded the death sentence and the High Court confirmed.
 In appeal to this Court.
 
HELD : The death sentence must be dissolved and life sentence substituted.
 (i) Modern penology regards crime and criminal as equally material when the right sentence has to be picked out although in our processual system there is neither comprehensive provision nor adequate machinery for collection and presentation of social and personal data of the culprit to the extent required in the verdict on sentence. However, in the Criminal Procedure Bill, 1973, Parliament has wisely written into the law a post conviction stage when the judges shall "hear the accused on the question of sentence and then pass sentenced on him according to law." [334 C] The unmistakable shift in legislative emphasis is that life imprisonment for murder is the rule and capital sentence the exception to be resorted to for reasons to be stated. The disturbed conscience of the state on the vexed question of legal threat to life by way of death sentence has sought to express itself legislatively, the stream of tendency being towards cautious partial abolition and the retreat from total retention. [336 H] Code of Criminal Procedure Section 367(5) as amended by Act 26 of 1955; Criminal Procedure Bill, 1973, Sections 235, 238 and 354(3); Indian Penal Code (Amendment) Bill, 1972, Section 122, referred to.
 (ii) The case on hand has to be disposed of under the present Code and the Court has to fall back upon the method of judicial bunch in imposing or avoiding capital sentence aided by such circumstances as are present on the record introduced for the purpose of proving guilt. [334 D] (iii) In the present case the criminal's social and personal factors, her feminity and youth, her unbalanced sex and expulsion from the conjugal home and being the mother of a young boy-these individually inconclusive and cumulatively marginal facts and circumstances tend towards awarding of life imprisonment. [339 B--C] Further, the Sessions Judge pronounced the death penalty on December, 31, 1971 and the appeal is being heard in February 1974. This prolonged agony has ameliorative impact according to the rulings of this Court.
