 The petitioners in the two separate writ petitions were detained pursuant to orders made under s. 3 (1) of the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act 1974. The detention orders wore assailed in the High court. During the course of hearing of the writ petitions the detention orders were revoked but the same day fresh orders of detention were passed and the positioners were again detained. The positioners assailed the second detention orders in the High Court by fresh writ petitions. The High Court quashed the detention orders holding that they were violative of Article 2215) of the Constitution and directed the release of the petitioners.
 Fresh detention orders were passed on the same grounds and the petitioners wore again detained.
 In the writ petitions to this Court, it was contended on behalf of the petitioners that the power conferred under s. 11(2) of the Act was not available to be exorcised whom there has been no revocation under s. 11(1) of the Act of a previous order of detention but has been quashed by the High Court in exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction.
 892 Allowing the Petitions, ^ 
 HELD: 1. (i) Where an order of detention under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974 is quashed by a Court in exercise of extraordinary Jurisdiction, the power of making a fresh order under sub-s. (2) of s. I I is not available to be exercised. [898 F] (ii) The pronounced judicial view of this Court was that repeated orders of detention are not to be made.
 Parliament while making provision in s. 11(2) of the Act must be taken to have been aware of such view and in conferring the power of making repeated orders, safeguards have been provided under sub. s. (1) by confining the exercise of power to limited situations. [898 E] (iii) Clothing the prescribed authority to exercise power under s. 3 even in a situation where the Court has intervened to bring about nullification of the order of detention would give rise to complicated situations. [898 E] In the instant case, the orders of detention made on August 20 1984 on the same grounds on which the previous orders had been made and which had been quashed by the High Court are not tenable in law- Once those orders are held to be invalid, the declarations made subsequently under s. 9 could not be made and would have no effect. [898 F-G] 
 2. The law of preventive detention within the ambit of which the Act is covered has bean accepted by the Constitution. Challenge to legislations of preventive detention as being ultra vires the Constitution has, therefore, been repelled by this Court on more than one occasion. The inbuilt safeguards provided by the different statutes dealing with preventive detention have been accepted to be in keeling with the rule of law. There is judicial consensus that under the preventive detention law, before the Act in question came into the field, reported orders of detention could not be made. This Court had clearly indicated that more than one order of detention on the same grounds in succession would not be valid.
 Notwithstanding the aforesaid legal position, s. 11(2) of the Act authorises making of another detention order under B- (3) against the same person. [895 G-H] 3, The power conferred under cls. (a) and (b) of sub- s. (1) of s. I l is in fact extension of the power recognised under s. 21 of the General Clauses Act, the power is exercisable by the authority making the order, the named authorities under cls. (a) and (b) of s. 11 (1) of the Act arc also entitled to exercise the power of revocation When the High Court exercise jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution it does not make an order of revocation. By issuing a high prerogative writ like habeas corpus or certioraris it quashes the order impugned before it and by declaring the order to be void and striking down the same it nullifies the order. The ultimate effect of cancellation of an order by revocation and quashing of the same in exercise of the high Prerogative jurisdiction vested in the High Court may be the same but the manner in which the situation is obtained is Patently 893 different and while one process is covered by s. 11(1) of the Act, the other A is not known to the statute and is exercised by an authority beyond the purview of sub-s. (1) OF s. I l of the Act. It is therefore, clear that in a situation where the order of detention has been quashed by the High Court, sub-s. (2) of s. ll is not applicable and the detaining authority is not entitled to make another order under s. 3 of the Act on the same grounds.
 [897 G-H; 898 A-C] 4. Revoke is the verb and revocation is its noun.
 These words have no statutory definition and, therefore, would take the commonsense meaning available for these words. The true meaning of the verb revoke and the noun revocation seems to signify that revocation is a process of recall of what had been done The word revoke carries with it the idea of cancellation by the same power which originally acted and not to setting aside of an original order be higher forum of power or jurisdiction It does not mean repudiation. .
