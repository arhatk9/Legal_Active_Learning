 The appellant in Civil Appeals Nos. 1372 and 1373, was a Hindu undivided family of which V was the karta and was, is such, t partner in a business of lithography and art printing with other members of the family including M, who was the karta of the appellant HUF in Civil Appeal No. 1371.
 The capital in the case of both V and M was entirely contributed by their respective families. The partnership was governed by two successive partnership deeds which were in similar terms during the relevant period, whereby it was provided, inter alia, that interest would be payable to each partner on the amount of capital, that the general mana- gement and supervision of the business would be in the hands of V; M would be the manager of the works and both he kind V would have power to make contracts, etc. Provision was also made for the payment of' specified amounts by way of remuneration to various other partners out of the gross earnings of the partnership business. For the accounting period relating to the assessment year 1954-55 and 1955-56.
 V was paid a sum of Rs. 18,000 in each year and M was paid Rs. 7,500 in respect of the assessment year 1955-56. The appellants, being the assessee Hindu undivided family in each of the appeals, showed these amounts in Section D of their returns kind it was contended that these amounts were not taxable in their hands as they represented income earned by V and M for the services rendered by each of them to the partnership and constituted their individual income. The Income Tax Officer rejected this contention and appeals to the Appellant Assistant Commissioner were dismissed, Further appeals were also dismissed by the Appellate Tribunal and it held that although V was an employee of the firm even before the family was taken as a partner, after he was taken as such partner, he Could not at the same time be an employee of the partnership firm; the remuneration received by him must therefore be held to be only an adjustment of the share in profits of the family in the partnership. The High Court, upon a reference, also held against the assessees.
 On appeal to this Court, Held : (By Majority) in Appeals Nos. 1372 and 1373 : The High Court had rightly answered the question of law against the assessee and the appeals must therefore be dismissed.
 (i)It was the investment of the joint fimily funds in the partnership which enabled V to become a partner and there was a real and sufficient connection between that investment and the remuneration paid to V under the deed of partnership. It follows therefore that the remuneration of V was not earned without detriment to the Hindu joint family funds and the case fell directly within the principle laid down in The C.I.T., West Bengal v. Kalu Babu Lal Chand, [1959] INSC 89; [1960] 1 S.C.R. 320; and in Mathura Prasad v. C.I.T., U.P.
 60 I.T.R. 428. [74 C-E] 63 M/s. Piyare Lal Adishwar Lal v. The C.I.T., Delhi, [1960] INSC 90; [1960] 3. S.C.R. 669; referred to.
 The general doctrine of Hindu Law is that property acquired by a karta or a coparcener with the aid or assistance of joint family assets is impresed with the character of joint family property., The test of self acquisition by the karta or coparcener is that it should be without detriment to the ancestral --state and before an acquisition can be claimed to be a separate properly, it must be shown that it was made without any aid or assistance from the ancestral or joint family property. [68B, C] The finding of the Tribunal that even before the partnership was formed V was receiving the salary from the business which was carried on the larger joint family, was not relevant for the determination of the question of law in the present case. The salary given to V before he became a partner had no connection with the remuneration earned by him after the contract of partnership which had it different character, and which arose out of a different legal relationship and was paid to him by virtue of the partnership deed. [73H] (ii)The conclusion reached by the Tribunal that V had earned the remuneration in Question without any detriment to the family funds was not a conclusion on a Question of pure fact but was a conclusion on a mixed question of law and fact. Though this conclusion was based upon primary evidentiary facts, its ultimate form had to he determined by the application of the relevant legal principles of Hindu law. In dealing with findings on Questions of mixed law and fact the High Court must no doubt accept the findings of the Tribunal on the primary questions of fact; but it is open to the High Court to examine whether the Tribunal had applied the relevant legal principles correctly or not in reaching it,, final conclusion; and in that sense, the scope of enquiry and the extent of the jurisdiction of the High Court in dealing with such point8 is the same as in dealing with pure points of law.

 (Per Hegde, J., dissenting) The sum of Rs. 18,000 received by V is his remuneration was not rightly included in the total income of the assessee.
 From the fact, found by the Tribunal it was established (i) that V was attending to the business in question even before the partnership came into existence and that he was getting remuneration for the workdone by him; (ii) after the partnership came Into existence, he, one out of the several partners, was designated as the general manager and for that work he was given a monthly remuneration of Rs. 1,500; and (iii) the said remuneration was received by him without any detriment to hi,,, family. [76H] There was no basis for the conclusion reached by the Tribunal that the remuneration received by V was only "an increased share in the profits of the firm paid to him as representing his HUF." The remuneration received by V had no relationship with the share capital subscribed by him. He was not appointed general manager merely because he was t partner. A cannot be said that his joint family was the general manager nor that for any act or omission of his as the general manager his family could be held responsible.
 It was the family which was contending that the income in question was V's individual income and it was therefore reasonable to infer that his family had agreed to his receiving that income 64 as his individual income; the assessee's case would therefore fall within the rule laid down, in Jugal Kishore Baldeo Sahi v. Commissioner of Income-tax, U.P. [1966] INSC 172; [1967] 1 S.C.R. 416. [77G, H; 85B.E] Piyare Lal v. Commissioner of Income tax [1960] INSC 90; [1960] 3 S.C.R 669.

 The Tribunal and the High Court were wrong in thinking that the partner of the firm can under no circumstance,be given remuneration for taking part in the conduct of the partnership business. It is clear from s. 13(a) 'of the Partnership Act that by agreement between the partners, one of the partners can he remunerated for attending to partner- ship work. [77D] S. Magnus v. Commissioner of Income tax Bombay City, 33 I.T.R.
 538: distinguished.
 The High Court was wrong in thinking that the finding of the tribunal that the remuneration received by V was without detriment to his family is not a finding of fact but a legal inference drawn by the tribunal from the facts proved. The tribunal reached that finding on the basis of the facts placed before it and it had given cogent reasons in support of that finding. The conclusion reached by the tribunal was therefore a finding of fact. A finding of this character cannot be considered as a mixed question of law and fact as nolegal principle was required to be applied in arriving at that conclusion.[77B-C] Held : In CivilAppeal No. 1371 of 1966 (Per Wanchoo C.J., Bachawat,Ramaswami and Mitterr, JJ): The material facts in the case of M being almost identical with those in Civil Appeals 1372 and 1373 of 1966, tied High Court rightly answered the question referred to it and the appeal must therefore he dismissed.
 (Hegde J. concurred with the decision of the majority that the appeal should be dismissed but disagreed that the material facts in the case of M were almost identical with those in the case of V).
