 In this appeal by special leave the short question requiring determination was whether the High Court of Gujarat was justified in dismissing in limine with one word 'dismissed' the appellants' appeal against their conviction by the Sessions Judge, Jamnagar for offences under s. 420 read with ss. 511 and 34, I.P.C. and under s. 474 read with s. 34, Indian Penal Code.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD:Section 421 Cr.P.C. no doubt empowers the appellate court to dismiss the appeal summarily but before doing so it is bound to peruse with care and attention the petition of appeal and the copy of the judgment or order appealed against. The order of summary dismissal can be passed only if the court considers that there is no sufficient ground for interference. This conclusion has to be arrived at judicially after a proper scrutiny of the petition of appeal and the impugned judgment or order. [673G] The power of dismissing appeals in limine should be exercised sparing and with judicious caution so that no case raising arguable points, whether of law or of fact requiring re-appraisal. of evidence, goes without requisite scrutiny.
 The requirement of recording reasons for summary dismissal, however concise, serves lo ensure proper functioning of the judicial process. Reasons are, therefore. advisedly required by the decisions of this Court to be given for rejecting an appeal summarily under s. 421 Cr. P. C. [674D] The contention that when the trial court records a well reasoned judgment, then, even though arguable points on the question of the credibility of witnesses are raised, it is unnecessary for the court of appeal to deal with all these points and record Its own reasons for agreeing with the conclusions of the trial court, was unacceptable. Unless the challenge can be held to be prima facie unimpressive and unarguable the High Court would be well-advised to go into the points canvassed and record its reasons. Such a course would be in accord with the statutory intendment, and also of assistance to this Court in more satisfactorily dealing with appeals under Art. 136 of the Constitution. [677D] In the present case the trial court's judgment mentioned several discrepancies in the prosecution evidence. The appellants were not unjustified in claiming to ;have the evidence on the record re-examined by the High Court for coming to its own conclusions. The points raised in the petition of appeal could by no means be said to be unarguable.
 671 Without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case the Court sent the case back to the High Court for a fresh decision in the light of this Court's observation.
