 The first appellant was tried for the offence of forging a valuable security punishable under s. 467 of the Indian Penal Code and for the offence of falsely personating another and presenting a document for registration punishable under s. 82 (c) of the Indian Registration Act, 1908. The second appellant was charged with abetment of these offences. The offence under the Indian Penal Code was tried with a jury and the offence under the Indian Registration Act was tried without a jury. The jury by a majority of 4 to 3 returned a verdict of guilty. The trial judge rejected the verdict on the ground that there was "absolutely no' reliable evidence" and referred the case to the High Court under s. 307 Criminal Procedure Code. The trial judge also acquitted the accused of the offence under the Registration Act. No appeal was preferred against the order of acquittal. The High Court came to the conclusion that there was sufficient evidence to establish against the appellants the offence under the Penal Code.
 It was contended on behalf of the appellants that the trial court having acquitted the appellants of the offence under the Indian Registration Act and no appeal having been pre- ferred against the order, it was not competent to the High Court to rely upon the evidence tendered to prove the offence under s. 82 of the Registration Act for the purpose of convicting the appellants of the offence under the Indian Penal Code.
 Held, that an item of evidence may corroborate charges for more offences than one, and acquittal of the accused for one 853 such offence will not render that item of evidence inadmissible in assessing the criminality of the accused for another offence corroborated thereby.
 Held, if the jury takes one view of the evidence and the judge is of the opinion that they should have taken another view, the view taken by the jury must prevail unless the evidence is such that no reasonable body of men could have reached the conclusion arrived at by the jury. In such a case reference under s. 307 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not justified.
