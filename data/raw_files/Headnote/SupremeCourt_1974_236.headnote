 The respondent in his election petition challenging the election of the appellant alleged that a large number of votes were cast in favour of the appellant by impersonating dead and absentee voters and that in some cases some persons polled their votes twice or more than twice in favour of the returned candidate by registering themselves as voters at two or more places in the constituency. The respondent prayed for the production of the counterfoils of the ballot papers to prove the genuineness of the signatures of the voters. Before the High Court the appellant contended that the counterfoils should not be allowed to be produced unless a prima facie case for inspection was made out. When the High Court allowed the inspection of two counterfoils of ballot papers to confirm the oral evidence of the witnesses that they had impersonated two voters by signing in the counterfoils the appellant came in appeal to this Court and the appeal was dismissed. This Court then pointed out that nothing could be clearer or mom reasonable than the procedure suggested by the petitioner and accepted by the High Court. After examining the evidence of the witnesses recorded then the High Court found prima facie that there had been personation in about 310 cases and allowed the petitioner to inspect the counterfoils of the ballot papers relating to these voters.
 On appeal to this Court it was contended that the High Court did not apply its mind to judge the quality of evidence to see if there had been a prima facie case.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) In some cases the ends of justice would make it necessary for the Tribunal to allow a party to inspect the ballot papers and consider his objections about the improper acceptance or improper rejection of votes tendered by the voters at any given election but care must be taken to see that election petitioners do not get a chance to make a roving or fishing enquiry in the ballot boxes. The allegations in support of the prayer for inspection must not be vague or indefinite; they must be supported by material facts and prayer made must be bona fide one.

 (2) On the material before the Court it could not be said that the High Court acted arbitrarily in taking the view that it has taken. The High Court classified the various types of impersonation and came to the view that the evidence of these witnesses, if unrebutted, would be sufficient to prove the allegation of impersonation. This means that the High Court was satisfied that there was prima facie case and the matter required further investigation.
