 Sub-clause (i) of section 2(a) of the Essential Commodities Act 1955 defines an "essential commodity" to mean "cattle fodder including oilcakes and other concentrates" and by sub-clause (v) an "essential commodity" means "food stuffs, including edible oilseeds and oils." Clause 3 of the Haryana Rice Bran (Distribution and Price) Control Order 1967 provides that no dealer or owner of a rice mill shall sell or offer to sell or supply rice bran save against a permit granted by certain officers of the State Government.
 By a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution, the appellants impugned the validity of clause 3 of the Control Order on the ground that rice bran is not an essential commodity and that for this reason power under section 3 could not be exercised for the purpose of regulating its sale or supply. The High Court rejected the appellants' writ petition.
 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD : Rice bran being a "foodstuff" within the meaning of section 2(a) (v) of the Act, it is an essential commodity and therefore, the power conferred by section 3 can be used to regulate its production, sale or supply. [199 F] The term "foodstuffs" means food of any kind. The dictionary meanings of "food" are not restricted to what is eaten by human beings for nourishment and sustenance.
 According to them, what one takes into the system to maintain life and growth or what is taken into the body of an organism in order to sustain growth is food. [199 C-E] Rice bran, which is a bye-product of the husking and milling process of paddy, consists of the layer that lies between husk and the kernel. It is a food stuff which is commonly used as poultry and cattle feed. Any stuff which is commonly used as food by the generality of living beings is foodstuff; it is not legitimate to restrict its meaning to things used as food by human beings. The animal kingdom is not any the less important in the cosmic scheme than the human empire and it is a distortion to say that it is a matter of little or no concern to the State whether the cattle and the poultry get their due ration of the means of their subsistence. Cattle feed and poultry feed are feed to the cattle and the poultry and therefore they are foodstuffs. [198 E-H] 197 Cattle and poultry are living components of the natural environment and there is no reason to exclude that which they eat or feed upon from the meaning of the word "foodstuffs". If what the human beings eat is food, so is what the other living beings eat. "Cattle fodder" is expressly brought within the compass of essential commodities by section 2(a) (i). It would be illogical if, in that context, rice bran is excluded from the purview of essential commodities on the ground that it is eaten by the poultry and not by Homo Sapiens. [199 B-C]
