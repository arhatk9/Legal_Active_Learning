 The petitioner carried on business of manufacturing, selling and supplying iron and steel materials in the State of Assam. Before the Assam Sales Tax Amendment Act of 1960, it held a registration certificate under which all its purchases for use in manufacture or production of goods taxable under the Act were exempted from Sales Tax, but after the amendment it became liable to pay tax on those goods. It was contended that by omission of sub-cl. (b), discrimination was introduced by differentiating between materials bought for articles to be supplied against a contract and articles produced and sold by the petitioner and that this was not a reasonable classification 590 based on any intelligible differentia and therefore, the amendment by Act XIII of 1960, was violative of Arts. 14 and 19(1) (f) of the Constitution.
 ^ Held, that the object of the amending Act was to raise revenue for the State. It was for the legislature to decide as to what articles it should tax and what articles it should not tax and if it decided to impose the tax on certain articles it thought necessary, that was a question of policy into which the courts cannot enter and in such circumstances per se there is no discrimination. Besides, the provision against discrimination was not on articles but on persons and the petitioner failed to show how the imposition of this tax was an unreasonable restriction on the right to carry on trade.
