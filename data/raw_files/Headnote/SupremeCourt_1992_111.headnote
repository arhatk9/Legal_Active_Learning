 : The appellant-assessee, the descendant of the late ruler of Kolhapur State was sanctioned a monthly cash allowance by the successor to the late ruler. After the merger of the princely State with the then state of Bombay, the cash allowance was discontinued, in view of the provi- sions of the Bombay Merged Territories Miscellaneous Aliena- tions Abolition Act,1955 which abolished miscellaneous alienations of various kinds prevailings in the merged territories. However, in view of sub-section (1) clause (d) of section 15 of the Act which provided that a cash allow- ance could be paid as a compassionate payment notwithstand- ing the abolition of all alienations under section of the act, the assesses continued to receive the cash allowance on modified terms. This amount was also reduced subsequently on account of misappropriation of a part of the trust amount deposited in a Bank.
 For the assessment years 1963-64 and 1964-65 the assessee received Rs.36,000 and Rs.33,992 respectively. The contention of the assessee that these receipts were of a capital nature and, therefore, would not be subject 706 to income tax, was negatived by the Income Tax Officer, and the amounts were assessed to tax in each of the assessment years.
 The assesse's appeals against the Income Tax Officer's order were rejected by the Appellate Commissioner, as well as the Appellate Tribunal.
 On a reference made to it, the High Court upheld the decision of the taxing authorities and the Tribunal that the amounts received by the assesee during the two relevant financial years were income within the meaning of Income Tax Act and that they could not be regarded as capital receipts in the hands of the assessee.
 Hence the assesee filed appeals, by special leave, before this Court not only in respect of the aforesaid assessment years, but also in respect of the assessment years 1965-66 to 1969-70.
 On behalf of the appellant-assessee it was contended that where any cash allowance, which was included in the definition of alienation was granted under Section 15(1)(d) of the Bombay Merged Territories Miscellaneous Alienation Act, the said payment was on compassionate ground and was entirely different from those allowances paid under clauses (i),(ii) and (iii) of the Section, and therefore, the High Court was not correct in holding that it was a receipt of revenue and would not amount to compensation when the stat- ute declares otherwise, and that the interpretation of Section 15 ran counter to the spirit of the Section.
 On behalf of the respondent-Revenue, it was contended that if it was not windfall and if there was regularity in payment, that would be enough to constitute income; that where the assessee was paid maintenance allowance periodi- cally it could not be claimed as compensation ; and that though the marginal heading of the Section was compensation that did not control the operation of the SEction or the interpretation of Section 15.
 Allowing the appeals, this Court, 
 HELD: 1.1 The amounts received by the assessee in lieu of cash allowance abolished by Section 4 of the Bombay Merged Territories Miscellaneous Alienations Act 1955 during the financial years in question are capital receipts and, therefore, are not income within the meaning of Section 2(24) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.

 1.2 Neither the nomenclature not the periodicity of the payment would be the determinative factors as to whether the amounts received ware capital in nature. Regard must be had only to the nature and quality of payment. [722 G] 
 1.3 The compassionate payment was sanctioned by the Government under clause (d) of proviso to Section 15(1) of the Bombay Merged Territories/Miscellaneous Alienation Abolition Act, 1955. Those cases falling under sub-section (1), clauses (i),(ii) and (iii) of Section 15 fall under a different category than what is covered under clause (d) of the proviso. while clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) provide for statutory payment at different rates of payments for differ- ent categories of persons, in the case of a person falling under clause (d), it require and alienee to make an appli- cation. If such an application had been in the prescribed form before the first day of August, 1958, the State Govern- ment, if satisfied after such enquiry as it thinks fit, that applicant has no other source of income, a compassionate payment, equal to such allowance during his life time or for lesser period, as the State Government may deem fit. [717 A- C] 
 1.4 In such of those cases falling under clause (d) of the proviso to Section 15(1) of the Act, no statutory right is created, unlike those falling under clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) which constitute different clauses. [719 B] 
 1.5 There is no compulsion on the part of the Government to make the payment nor is the Government obliged to make the payment since it is purely discretionary. The payment made by the Government is undoubtedly voluntary.
 However, it has no origin in what might be called the real source of income. No doubt, clause (d) of proviso the Sec- tion 15(1) enables the applicant to seek payment but that is far from saying that it is a source. Therefore it cannot afford any foundation for such a source. Further it is a compassionate payment, for such length of period as he Government may, in its discretion, order. [723 d, 724 B] 
 1.6 The marginal heading of Section 15 is "compensation". The fact that under clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of Section 15(1) the compensation is paid as of right and in cases falling under clause (d) of the proviso, it is a discretionary payment would not stamp the payment with a character of revenue. [723 B] 708 1.7. In the instant case, the assessee lost her right to the allowances. Thereafter, on an application made by her, the payment is made by way of compassion under clause (d) of proviso to Section 15(1). The mere fact, after the order is made it becomes an enforceable right, is neither here nor there. The fact that the assessee has applied for a grant for maintenance nor again, the periodicity of pay- ment, would be conclusive. [722 G-H] S.R.Y Sivaram Prasad Bahadur v.
