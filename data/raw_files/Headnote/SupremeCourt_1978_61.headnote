 The nomination paper filed by the Petitioner on July 5, 1977 was rejected by the Returning Officer as it was not subscribed by any elector as proposer or as seconder as required by S. 5 of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Election Act, 1952. The petitioner challenged the election of the respondent, u/s 14 of the Act.
 Dismissing the petition, the Court 
HELD:Since there was no compliance with the requirements of Section 5B(1) of the Act (No. 31 of 1952), the Petitioner was not a duly nominated 'candidate' within the meaning of S. 13(a) of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections (Amendment) Act, 1977 and, as such, has no locus standi to maintain the-petition. [466 B-C] Charan lal Sahu v. Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy, [1978] INSC 34; [1978] 3 S.C.R., 1 Reiterated.
