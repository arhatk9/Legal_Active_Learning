 The appellant had leased a plot of land situated in the Malad Area in Greater Bombay at a rental on a monthly basis.
 The lessee had constructed a house on the plot of land at his own cost. Prior to the merger of the Malad Area into Greater Bombay in February, 1947, the Malad District Municipality assessed and levied taxes on the land and- the structures separately and recovered the same from the landlord and the tenant. After the merger, the respondent Bombay Municipal Corporation issued a notice to the appellant-under section- 167 of the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act No. 3 of 1883, informing him that there would be a composite assessment on him. An appeal against the order to the Chief Judge, Small Causes Court. Bombay, under section 217 of the Act was dismissed. A single bench of the High Court dismissed a further appeal on the view that it was bound by the decision in Ramji Keshavji v.
 Municipal Corporation of Bombay 56 B.L.R. 1132. A Letters Patent appeal was also dismissed.
 In the appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that on a proper construction of section 146 (2) of the Art there should have been a separate assessment in respect of the building and the land; alternatively even if section 146(2) contemplates a composite assessment of the building and the land, a preliminary liability should be imposed upon the owner of the building in whom the right to let the building vests and not on the owner of the land; the appellant could not be treated as a lessor under section 146(2) because it did not let the land with the building thereon as one unit to the lessee, 
HELD : (1) The scheme under section 146 is that when the land is let and the tenant has built upon the land, there should be a composite assessment of tax upon the land and the building taken together. In the case of such a composite unit the primary liability of assessment of tax is intended lo be on the lessor of the land under section 146 (2) (a) of' the Act. [571 F] In section 146(1) and (2) the word "Premises" is used in contrast to section 146(3) where the words "land and building" are separately mentioned. Section 146(3) which is admittedly not applicable in the present cases, furnishes a key to the interpretation of section 146(2) (a). In the context of section 146(3) the lessor of the premises, as mentioned in section 146(2) (a) must be construed to mean the lessor of the land on which the building has been constructed by the tenant. [571 D] Section 147 provides for an apportionment of responsibility to property tax when the premises are let, or sub-let; it is clear the intention of the legislature was to impose the primary liability for payment of property tax upon the lessor of the land to facilitate its collection and to give him the right to recoupment under section 147. [571 F] 566 Ramji Keshavii v. Municipal Corporation for Greater Bombay, 56 Bom. L.R. 1132. approved.
 (2)Even assuming that the meaning of section 146(2) is obscure and that it is possible to interpret it as throwing the primary liability for payment of property tax upon the lessee who has constructed. a building on the land, this was, not a case where the law expressed by the High Court in Ramji Keshavji's case, should be interfered with. That is the construction which the. authorities have put upon it by their usage and conduct for a long period of time, and the Court may therefore resort to contemporary construction by applying the principle "optima legum interpres est consuetudo".
