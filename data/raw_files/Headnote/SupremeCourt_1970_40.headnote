 In 1959 the States of Mysore and Andhra Pradesh entered into a reciprocal arrangement agreeing thereby that certain permits issued by the Transport Authorities of one State should be counter-signed by those of the other. Under s.
 43(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939-the Government of Mysore issued directions to the State Transport Authority to give effect to the above arrangement. On April 25, 1968 the Regional Transport Authority Cuddapah, Andhra Pradesh issued a permit to the appellant for the Cuddapah-Bangalore inter- State route under s. 63 of the Act, which was to be valid up to May 13, 1971. The appellant then applied to the State Transport Authority in Mysore for counter-signature of his permit. By then the Government of Mysore had by its order dated 25-1-1968 approved under s. 68-D of the Motor Vehicles Act, a scheme called the 'Kolar scheme'. That scheme provided for exclusive operation by the Mysore State Transport Undertaking of stage-carriages on the notified routes. Under the scheme existing permit holders' could continue to operate inter-State routes except that their permits would be ineffective for the overlapping portions of the notified routes. On March 1, 1968 the Mysore State Transport Undertaking applied under s. 68F(1) to operate buses on the notified routes. In December 1968 the Regional Transport Authority resolved to give effect to the scheme from 1-1-1969. Meanwhile the appellant's application for counter-signature came up before the Mysore State Transport Authority on July 6, 1968. By that time, however, writ petitions had been filed in the High Court, challenging the 'Kolar scheme' and the Court had made interim orders staying the operation of the, scheme. In that situation the State Transport Authority, Mysore granted to the appellant counter-signature on his permit, expressly subject to the decision of the High Court as to the validity of the scheme.
 On October 7, 1968 the High Court dismissed the said writ petitions and upheld the validity of the scheme. Thereupon the State Transport Authority issued a notice to the appellant to surrender the counter-signature slip and stop running the buses. The appellant challenged this order in a writ petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution. The petition being dismissed he appealed by special leave to this Court. The appellant contended inter alia that (i) the counter-signature on the appellant's permit could not be cancelled as he was an 'existing permit holder' under cl.
 (d) of the scheme and for this purpose the crucial date was 1-1-1969 when the order under. 68F(2) came into effect; (ii) Inter-State agreement overrides the provisions of Chapter IV-A of the Act 
 HELD : (i) Assuming, without deciding, that the date of publication is not the appropriate date, the date on which the transport Undertaking 781 applies under s. 68F(1) for a permit must be the date with reference to which the expression "existing permit holder" must be interpreted. The application by the State Transport Undertaking in the present cases was made on March 1, 1968.
 If this was the crucial date, the appellant was not an "existing permit holder" because he did not obtain his countersignature till July 1968. [785 C-D] Abdul Gafoor v. State Mysore, [1961] INSC 151; [1962] 1 S.C.R. 909, applied.
 Sri Satyanarayana Transports (P) Ltd. Guntur v. Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation, C.A. No. 347 of 1961 dt. 30-10-1961, distinguished.
 (ii) Even if the crucial date be taken as January 1, 1969 as contended by the appellant, he must still fail on the ground that he was not a permit holder at all. His counter-signature must be deemed to have lapsed when the High Court on October 7, 1968 dismissed the writ petitions in which the 'Kolar scheme' bad been stayed. The order of the Regional Transport Authority granting the counter- signature "subject to the decision of the High Court of Mysore about the validity of the Nationalisation Scheme of the Kilar Pocket" in the context of the case meant that if the writs failed the counter-signature would automatically lapse. [786 A-B] The Smarth Transport Co. v. The Regional Transport Authority, [1960] INSC 144; [1961] 1, S.C.R. 631 at 639, referred to.
 (iii) An inter-State agreement cannot over-ride the provisions of Chapter IV-A. The inter-State agreement is not law and to hold that an inter-State agreement over-rides Chapter IV-A would be to completely disregard the provisions of s. 68-B of the Act. Articles 162 and 298 of the Constitution had no relevance in this connection. Assuming that a State hits power to enter into agreement with another State in exercise of its executive powers under Art. 162 and under Art. 298 it can carry on trade or business, the facts did not throw any bight on the question for decision.
