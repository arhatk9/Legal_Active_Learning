 The petitioner was arrested pursuant to an order of detention under ss. 3(1)(a)(iii) and 3(2) of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971. His representation to the State Government was rejected 33 days after its receipt. In a petition under Art. 32 challenging his detention, the State Government explained the delay by stating that the go- slow movement launched by the State Government employees and the increase in the volume of work relating to detentions caused dislocation in the work and consequential delay. It was also stated in the counter-affidavit that the petitioner was a notorious thief of copper wires and that his activities seriously disrupted the telegraphic communication system of the railways and dislocated railway service.
 
HELD : (1), If preventive detention without trial is to be justified then the Government must comply with due promptitude with all the essential requirements of the Constitution as also of the Act relating to such detention.
 The representation made by a detenu to the State has, there- fore, to be considered as early as possible without avoidable delay. This is implicit in Art. 22(5) which prescribes the minimum procedure that must be included in any law permitting preventive detention. When theprovisions of the Article or of a law relating to preventive detention providing for safeguards against arbitrary or illegal detention are not complied with, then, even if the detention may be valid an initio it ceases to be so as soon as violation of the provisions of the Article or of the law occurs. The time within which the Government must consider the representation will depend upon the circumstances of each case and no rigid limit can be fixed; but 'any prima facie unreasonable delay must be satisfactorily explained by the detaining authority if the order of detention is to be upheld., [763F-H. 764A] (2) In the present case, the explanation for the delay is vague and does not indicate that there was any real or genuine obstacle to considering the representation within reasonable time. [764B] (2) In he present case, the; explanation for the delay it vague and does Court it would not advance the cause of justice to postpone the hearing and await the decision of the High Court. [764D-E] (4) Legal safeguards against possible arbitrary exercise of power or abuse or misuse of the provisions of the preventive detention laws, demand compliance in all situation covered thereby, and to ignore the safeguards would be to ignore the mandate of the Constitution. Therefore, the allegations regarding the petitioner's activities cannot absolve the authorities concerned of their constitutional obligation to give appropriate effect to the legal safeguards provided by the Constitution and the Act.
