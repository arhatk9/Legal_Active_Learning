 Pursuant to a certificate issued by the Deputy Commissioner proceedings were started against the respondent to recover instalment of tax, assessed under U.P. Agricultural Income- tax Act, 1949. The respondent moved the High Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution for directing the appellants to refrain from recovering or taking any steps for the recovery by coercive process, and in the alternative, if any amount was held recoverable, for directing the Revenue authorities to adjust it against compensation bonds given to the respondent under the U.P. Zamindari Abolition & Land Reforms Act with respect to his zamindari which vested with State under the Act. The High Court held that the Collector was bound to accept in satisfaction of the instalments of tax due the compensation bonds payable to the respondent under the Zamindari Abolition Act. In appeal 
HELD:(i) The Collector had no option in the matter of adjustment of the liability to pay agricultural income-tax against compensation amount due to the respondent, which was "still due". [34 A-B] Rule 8-A of the Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Rules is in terms mandatory and obliges the Collector to realise the tax in the manner provided. The expression "without prejudice to the right of the State Government to recover dues" with which the Rule opens does not transform that duty into an option. The clause merely provides that the obligation imposed upon the Collector of adjusting the dues against compensation will not prejudice the right of the State Government to recover the dues by other means. [33 F- H] (ii)The case clearly fell within the terms of s. 6(d) and the benefit of Rule 8-A was admissible to the respondent.
 The tax assessed was for the period ending June 30, 1952.
 The assessment was made after the close of the previous year and after the date of vesting but the income which was liable to tax was the income of the previous year that is before the date of vesting. [34 F-G]
