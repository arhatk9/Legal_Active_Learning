 The appellant who was an Upper Division Clerk in the office of the Chief Commissioner of Delhi was convicted of an offence under s. 5 (1) (d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, punishable under s. 5 (2) of the Act. The prosecution case was that R who was anxious to obtain a licence for a double-barralled shot-gun sought the assistance of the appellant who knew him, that the appellant who had nothing to do with the issuing of licences for firearms which was done by the office of the Deputy Commissioner offered to use his good offices in expediting and furthering the progress of R's application for a licence in the appropriate department if he was paid Rs. 250/ and that when the licence was cancelled on its being found that R was not entitled to it the appellant promised to have it restored if he was paid a further sum of Rs. 180/-. The trial judge found that the appellant taking advantage of his position as an employee in the Chief Commissioner's office and of R's ignorance and anxiety to get the licence, had induced him to part with the money on the promise that he would get his licence restored. The appellant pleaded that on the facts found no offence under s. 5(1) (d) of the Act had been Made out and relied on state of Ajmer v. Shiviji Lal , (1959) Supp. 2 S. C. R. 739.
 260 Held, that in order to constitute an offence under cl. (d) of s. 5 (1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, it is not necessary that the public servant in question, while misconducting himself, should have done so in the discharge of his duty, and that the decision in State of Ajmer v.
 Shivji Lal. (1959) Supp. 2 S. C. R. 739, to the contrary, is wrong.
 If a public servant takes money from a third person, by corrupt or illegal means or otherwise abusing his official position, in order to corrupt some other public servant, he commits an offence under s. 5 (1) (d), even though there was no question of his misconducting himself in the discharge of his own duty.
