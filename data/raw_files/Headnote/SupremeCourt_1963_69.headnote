 The plaintiffs-respondents entered into a contract of sale in respect of a house property belonging to the appellant.
 The deed of agreement provided that the vendor shall obtain the permission of the Chief Commissioner to the transaction of sale within two months of the agreement and if the said permission was not forthcoming, within that time, it was open to the purchasers to extend the date or to treat the agreement as cancelled. As the necessary permission was not forthcoming within the Stipulated time, the purchasers extended the time by another month. The appellant withdrew her application for the necessary permission. The defendant having failed to perform her part of the contract, the plaintiffs brought a suit for specific performance of the contract for sale or in the alternative for damages. The trial court, although it found that the plaintiffs had been throughout ready and willing, indeed anxious, to perform their part of the contract and that it was the defendant who had backed out of it, refused the main relief of specific performance of the contract on the ground that the agreement was inchoate, as the previous sanction of the Chief Commissioner to the proposed transfer had not been obtained.
 The High Court came to the conclusion that there 496 was a completed contract between the parties and that the condition in the agreement that the vendor would obtain the sanction of the Chief Commissioner to the transaction of sale did not render the contract incomplete and the trial court was in error in holding that the agreement was inchoate, Held that on the findings in this case, the court had got to enforce the terms of the contract and to enjoin upon the defendant-appellant to make the necessary application to the Chief Commissioner, which was implied in the contract. It will be for the Chief Commissioner to decide whether or not to grant the necessary sanction. In the event of the sanction being refused, the plaintiffs shall be entitled to the damages as decreed by the High Court. In this view of the matter, the High Court was entirely correct in decreeing the suit for specific performance of the contract.
 Motilal v. Nanhelal (1930) L. R. 57 I. A. 33, referred to.
 Held further, that the points not specifically raised in the High Court nor pleaded in the pleadings should not be allowed for the first time to be raised in this Court.
