 The appellant was the manager of a dairy farm. He was charged with an offence under ss. 7 and 16(1) (a) (i) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954, read with r. 44 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Rules, 1955, in that, he exposed for sale skimmed thick buttermilk, which to analysis, was found to be adulterated with water to the extent of 11 per cent, and had thus not maintained the standard prescribed for butter-milk. The trial Court acquitted him on the ground that no standard of quality was prescribed for buttermilk. On appeal, the High Court convicted him, on the view that, the standard for milk has been fixed by the Rules, that the same standard was made applicable to curd and that, as butter-milk was in essence curd from which butter has been extracted, butter-milk should contain the same quantity of solids-notfat as curd should contain.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD. Appendix B to the Prevention of Food Adulteration Rules, which specifies the standards of quality of various articles of food, shows that it is not an ingredient of the definition of butter-milk that it should contain any particular percentage of solids-not-fat. Wherever the rule making authority intended to prescribe a specific standard for the contents of a product, it definitely stated so, but in the case of butter-milk, no standard. for 'contents either specifically or with reference to other items is prescribed. The only requirement is that it shall be a product obtained after removal of butter from curd by churning or otherwise. Therefore, the appellant had not committed the offence with which he was charged. [377 C, F- H]
