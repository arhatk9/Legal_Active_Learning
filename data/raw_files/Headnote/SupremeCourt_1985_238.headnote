 Rule 3.26 (c) of the Punjab Civil Service Rules Vol. I part 1 enacts: "The following are special rules applicable to P.W.D. Officers :- 
 1. Except as otherwise provided in this sub- clause, Government employees in the Haryana Service of Engineers Class I (B&R, I.B. and Electricity) must retire on reaching the age of 58 years, and may be required by the competent authority to retire on reaching the age of 50 years if they have not attained the rank of superintending Engineer.
 The Respondent - State of Haryana by its order No.11/3- BR (Estt)-6-81 dated 18 December 1981 retired the appellant, a superintending Engineer, prematurally after he attained the age of 50 years in pursuance of the provisions contained in rule 5.32(c) of the Punjab civil Service Rules, Vol.II Part II ant Rule 3.26(d) of the Punjab civil Services Rules, Vol. I, Part I as applicable to the State of Haryana. The appellant's promotion to higher and higher posts in quick succession in the part unmistakably indicated that the authorities were satisfied with his work and integrity. He was promoted to the post of Superintending Engineer on 27th May 1971. The appellant made several representations against the order of premature retirement, but did not receive any reply despite repeated reminders. Ultimately, he challenged the impugned order of premature retirement by a writ petition in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana on the ground, inter alia, that in view of the clear provisions contained in rule 3.26(c) of Punjab Civil Services rules Vol. I, Part I (as applicable to Haryana), which are special rules applicable to the public works Department 728 Officers, the general rule contained in rule 3.26(d) empowering the Government to compulsorily retire a public servant has no application in his case. The High Court dismissed the writ petition in limine.
 Allowing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The order of the High Court dated 5th January, 1984 is set aside. The order of premature retirement dated 18th December 1981 is quashed. The appellant shall be deemed to be in continuous service. He is entitled to his salary, emoluments and other consequential benefits to which he would have been entitled to if he had not been prematurely retired. [738 G] 2.(i) Rule 3.26(2), Which is a special rule applicable to Government employees in the Haryana Service of Engineers Class 1, will govern the case of the appellant as the special overrides the general. Admittedly, he was working as the Superintending Engineer for the last so many years on the date when the impugned order of his premature retirement was passed by the Governor. This rule provides as immunity to the engineer who has attained the rank of Superintending Engineer in the B.W.D. (B&R Branch) had always the immunity ever since the provision for premature retirement came into force. The old corresponding rules do not improve the position for the State-respondent. [734 E; 738 E] 2(ii) Rule 3.26(d) is applicable to all government employees but not to engineers of the P.W.D. for whom there is a special rule. It is a supplement to rule 3.26(a) because it supplies the procedure to be adopted in case of premature retirement of other Government servants. [735 E-F] 3.The heading 'Compulsory Retirement' is wide enough to include premature retirement within its fold. Government employee in the Haryana service of Engineers has no right to continue in service if he has reached the age of superannuation which is 58 years in the case of engineers.
 He has perforce to retire unless he has been granted an extension. Likewise an engineer who has not reached the age of superannuation but is made to retire prematurely, his retirement is as much a compulsory retirement as that of an employee who has attained the age of superannuation. It will not be correct to say that the age of superannuation in case of engineers who have not attained the rank of Superintending Engineers has been reduced to 50 years. [735 A-C] 729 M.
