 The appellant-concem promoted two employees from grade A to grade B. One of these promotees M superseded one employee while the other D superseded six, A dispute was -raised by the respondents workmen on account of this supersession, and a reference was made to the industrial tribunal by the Government of Mysore. The case of the workmen was that the action of the management was not bona fide and was taken to victimise the six employees in disregard of seniority. The case of the appellant on the other hand was that seniority alone could not be the criterion for promotion and that other factors like merit. personality etc. had -to be taken into consideration. The Tribunal came to the conclusion that the action of the management was mala fide because it took eleven weeks to reply to the query of the workmen asking for -reasons for their supersession. The Tribunal also found substance in the allegations of victimisation on the ground that those superseded were more or less active members of the union. The Tribunal then came to the conclusion that five of the superseded employees were as good as those who had been promoted -and ordered that they should be promoted from grade A to grade B, with effect from the date from which the other two had been promoted. The appellants came to this Court by special leave against the Tribunal's award and contended : (1) On the face of it the award could not be sustained for there were only two promotions by the management and the Tribunal had ordered the management to promote five more persons. The promotions of M could not be assailed at all as he was second in seniority. (2) The Tribunal's finding that there were mala fides and victimisation was based on no evidence.
 
HELD: (i) Although promotion is a management function it may be recognised that there may be occasions when a Tribunal may have to interfere on grounds of mala fides or victimisation. But it is none of the Tribunal's functions to consider the merits of various employees itself and then decide whom to promote or not to promote. The Tribunal can only set aside the wrongful promotion and ask the management to make a fresh promotion. [468 F-H] In the present case M was second in seniority and therefore only D's case required 'he consideration of the Tribunal.
 Assuming that D's promotion was liable to be set aside the Tribunal had no justification for promoting five persons in addition to the two promoted by the management. [469 B-C] (ii) The management had stated in its reply to the superseded employees that it had considered all the relevant factors and had also considered the cases of all senior employees due for promotion before promoting M and D. It was difficult to see how the tribunal could come to the conclusion merely from the fact that there was some delay in 466 giving the reply to the query as to the reasons that the management had not considered the relative merits of all senior employees before making the promotions. There could be no doubt that the findings of the Tribunal that the relative merits were not considered or that there was mala fides or that there was victimisation were based on no evidence and must therefore be set aside. Once that conclusion was reached there was no reason for the Tribunal to interfere with the promotions made by the management.
