 Under the Punjab General Sales Tax Act, 1948, no sales tax was payable on goods specified in the first column of Schedule B to the Act subject to certain conditions and exceptions. Up to August 31, 1966 Indian made foreign liquor was in Schedule B. But on that date the Government of Punjab in exercise of its powers conferred under proviso to S. 5 deleted Indian made foreign liquor from Schedule B and included the same in Schedule A which made it exigible to sales tax. Simla was part of Punjab tiff, reorganisation of Punjab in 1966. Simla and two other districts of the former State of Punjab were added on to the Union Territory of Himachal Pradesh under the Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966.
 Under the provisions of that Act the laws in force, immediately before the appointed day namely October 1, 1966 in those districts were to continue in operation till the appropriate legislature or competent authority altered the same. Accordingly in Simla and other areas thus transferred to Himachal Pradesh Indian made foreign liquor was liable to sales tax. In the auction for sale of Indian made foreign liquor and beer held on March 31, 1967 the appellant, a firm of wine merchants, was the highest bidder for dealing in liquor under L-2 licence as provided in the Punjab Liquor Licence Rules as applicable to certain parts of the then Union Territory of Himachal Pradesh. When the State of Himachal Pradesh took steps against the firm for realising sales-tax on liquor and beer sold by it the appellant firm filed a writ petition in the High Court. It was alleged in the petition that the Deputy Commissioner Simla, who was also Collector of Excise and Taxation, announced at the time of auction that no sales tax would be liable to be paid on the sale of Indian made foreign liquor and beer.
 Accordingly the appellant prayed that because of the equities of the case the court should issue a writ, direction or order restraining the respondents from enforcing the levy of sales tax on the sales of Indian made foreign liquor at Simla. In the firm's appeal to this Court against the judgment of the High Court, 
HELD : (i) The averments in the petition did not show that the Deputy Commissioner gave an assurance to the bidders that the Himachal Pradesh Government had decided to abolish sales tax on the sale of Indian made foreign liquor. If the statement in the writ petition was correct the Deputy Commissioner merely gave a wrong interpretation of law. On behalf of the respondent it had been denied that the Deputy Commissioner had made such a representation. According to them all that the Deputy Commissioner stated was that "the Government was considering to abolish the tax on the line of the Haryana Government". it further appeared from the correspondence between the State Government and the Central Government that the Government of Himachal Pradesh 941 wanted to bring their sales tax law relating to the sale of Indian made foreign liquor in line with the law in force in Haryana State. Obviously, the Government of Himachal Pradesh was of the opinion that it could not alter the law without the concurrence of the Central Government. That being so it was difficult to accept the contention of the appellant hat the Deputy Commissioner had represented that the Himachal Pradesh Government had decided to remove sales- tax on the sale of Indian made foreign liquor. The only thing which the Deputy Commissioner could have announced was that the Himachal Pradesh Government was considering to abolish the tax in question. Such a representation cannot be considered as a condition of the auction assuming that such a condition could be imposed orally by the Deputy Commissioner., [943 B-H] (ii)The power to impose tax is undoubtedly a legislative power. That power can be exercised by the legislature directly or subject to certain conditions, the legislature may delegate that power to some other authority. But the exercise of that power whether by the legislature or by its delegate is an exercise of a legislative power. The fact that the power was delegated to the executive does not convert that power into an executive or administrative power. No court can issue a mandate to a legislature to enact a particular law. Similarly no court can direct a subordinate legislative body to enact or not to enact a law which it may be competent to enact. [945 F-G] Article 265 of the Constitution lays down that no tax can be levied and collected except by authority of law. Hence the levy of a tax can only be done by the authority of law and not by any executive order. Unless the executive is specifically empowered by law to give any exemption, it cannot say that it will not enforce the law as against a particular person. No Court can give a direction to a Government to refrain from enforcing a provision of law.
 Under these circumstances, it must be held that the relief asked for by the appellant cannot be granted. [945 H-946 B] Collector of Bombay v. Municipal Corporation of the City of Bombay and Ors., [1952] S.C.R. 443, Union of India and Ors.
