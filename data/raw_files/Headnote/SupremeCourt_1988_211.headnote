 A suit filed by the respondent-landlord for eviction of the appellant-tenant from the leased premises on grounds of (i) buna fide requirement, (ii) default in payment of rent for five months, and (iii) wrongful use of leased premises, was decreed by the trial court and the appellate court on first two grounds.
 Rejecting the contention of the appellant-tenant that a sum of Rs.l80 out of the advance of Rs.300 paid to the respondent and the excess amount of rent at Rs.70 p.m. as against the contractual rent of Rs.60 p.m., collected by the respondent-landlord in contravention of sections 4 and 7 of the Bihar Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction).Control Act, 1977, ought to have~ been appreciated by the respondent landlord towards rent arrears, both the courts concurrently held that there was no proof that the appellant-tenant had paid the advance and that although increase in rent from Rs.
 60 to Rs. 70 p.m. on the basis9 of providing additional amenities was not permissible under the Act. the appellant could not take advantage of the situation as he had failed to exercise his option under s. 8(2) of the Act to seek adjustment of' the excess payment of rent arrears.
 The High Court sustained the decree on the ground of default in payment of rent. Affirming the finding of the courts below, it observed that the appellant's prayer for adjustment could be sustained only if he had exercised his right of option under s. 8(2) of the Act. Assailing the view of the High Court the appellant-tenant filed the appeal in this Court.
 Dismissing the appeal, this Court, PG NO 303 PG NO 304 
 HELD; 1. Without the tenant calling upon the landlord to adjust the excess payments towards the arrears of rent, he cannot seek such a right in the suit filed by the tenant by way of defence in the suit for eviction. l308B] 
 2.1 Under sub-section (2) of Section 8 of the Bihar Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act, 1977 if any rent has been collected in excess of the fair rent determined for a building, then the tenant is entitled to a refund of the excess amounts paid by him, unless he opts for a different course of action viz., the adjustment of the excess payment towards rent, past or future. [307G] 
 2.2 Though s. 8(2) deals with payment of excess rent for buildings for which fair rent has been determined or re- determined by the Controller, the same principle, in the absence of a different prescription under the Act, has to govern the buildings for which the rent is payable in accordance with the terms of the contract between the parties. [307H, 308A] 
 2.3 Therefore, even if the rent for the building leased out to the appellant had not been determined by the but had been fixed by the parties themselves, the right to seek adjustment of the excess payments made by the appellant has to be in accordance with the principle set out in s. 8(2).
 [308B] The High Court had. therefore. not erred in any manner in refusing to countenance the appellant's plea regarding the adjustment of the excess payment made by him towards arrears of rent, without his having opted for such adjustment and calling upon the respondent to make such adjustments.
