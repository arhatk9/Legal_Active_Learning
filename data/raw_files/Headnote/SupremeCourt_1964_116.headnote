 The Champaran Cane Concern, appellant, carried on agricultural operations in lands owned by two persons. One of these two persons had a share of four annas in a rupee and other twelve annas in a rupee. They appointed another person as a common manager for facility of cultivation and management. There was no partnership agreement entered into by these two persons. In the returns submitted to the tax authorities for the assessment years the concern was shown as a "firm".
 The Agricultural Income 'Fax authorities assessed the appellant for three years on the basis that the appellant was a partnership firm under s. 3 of the Bihar Agricultural Income Tax Act, 1948. The assessee claimed that it was not a partner. ship firm but a co-ownership concern and that it could be assessed only under s. 13 of the said Act. This plea was rejected by the Income Tax officer. Appeals were filed to the Deputy Commissioner of Agricultural Income Tax and the same were dismissed. Applications for revision were then filed before the Board of Revenue. The Board did not accept the plea of the present appellant that the assessment should have been made under s. 13 or the Act. Thereafter an application was made to the Board, for making a reference to the High Court which was refused. Thereupon, the High Court was moved under s. 28 (3) of the Act for a reference by the Board and the High Court called for a reference. The High Court held that the question whether, the assessee was a co- ownership concern or a partnership firm was a question of fact, and that there were facts and circumstances in the case from which it was open to the taxing authorities to come to the conclusion that 922 the concern was a partnership firm. The High Court answered the reference against the assessee. The present appeal was filed by Special leave of this Court.
 In the appeal before this Court substantially the same questions were raised as before the High Court, the taxing authorities and the Board of Revenue.
 Held that the question whether a concern is a partnership or not, is a mixed question of fact and law and if the authorities who have to ascertain that question apply a wrong principle of law in instructing themselves as to what they have to find, then their finding of fact is not conclusive because they have done it under wrong principle.
 Modern Rigg & Co. and R. B. Eskrigge & Co. v. Monks (1923) 8 T. C. 450, referred to.
 Held further that the appointment of a common manager by two co-owners acting together is consistent with either view and does not clinch the issue in favour of a partnership.
 The mete fact that the profits or even losses are distributed in accordance with the shares of the two owners does not necessarily establish a partnership within the meaning of the Partnership Act.
 One of the principal differences between a partnership and co-ownnership is that co-ownership -is not necessarily the result of agreement whereas partnership is. The second difference is that co-ownership does not necessarily involve community of profit or of loss but partnership does.
 Another difference is that one co-owner can without the consent of other, transfer his interest etc. to a stranger but a partner cannot do this. Fourthly, in a partnership each partner acts for all but a co-owner is not such an agent real or implied of the other.
 A mistake by the Revenue Board in framing the question for reference to the High Court will not change the real position in law.
 Simply because a co-ownership concern has described itself as a "firm" in the printed forms of return does not necessarily mean that it is a partnership firm within the meaning of s. 4 of the Indian Partnership Act as indicated in s. 2 (k) of the Act.
 923 From the facts and circumstances of the case it is found that the appellant is a co-ownership concern and not a partnership. The manager is liable to assessment under s.
 13 of the Act.
