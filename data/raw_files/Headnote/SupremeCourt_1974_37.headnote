 The order detaining the petitioner under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971, mentioned the sole ground that on the night of October 11, 1972, the petitioner and his associates committed theft of some tea chests from a running goods train and that they fled, when challenged, leaving behind three chests of a tea at the P. O. In his petition issue of a writ of habeas corpus the petitioner contended that it was impossible to commit theft from a running train as described. In the counter affidavit, it was stated that what was meant by running train was a train which had come to a stop due to some traffic restriction. It was also stated that the petitioner Was a notorious wagon breaker operating near the Railway Station, but this allegation was never communicated to the petitioner. Even the record relating to the detention nowhere referred 1 to the petitioner as a 'notorious wagon breaker'. In the record the incident of 11th October was mentioned, a description of the modus operandi of a gang of thieves operating on passenger trains was given, and it was also mentioned that the activities of that gang commenced after the incident of 11th October. There was however no indication as to how any information whatsoever came to the District Magistrate, who passed the order of detention, from any source whatsoever that the Petitioner was a member of that gang.
 Allowing the petition, 
HELD : The Court is not concerned with the adequacy or sufficiency of a ground of detention. In the present case, there is clear nexus between the sole ground for detention given and the maintenance of the essential supplies and services. but the ground is vague in so far as it is not apparent what is meant by the words "the P.O." The grounds given could not enable the petitioner to effectively exercise his constitutional right of making a representation against his detention. )Further. matters which were never communicated to the petitioner have been taken into account while ordering the detention. Presuming that whatever was in the record operated against the petitioner he should have been given fuller information of the allegations against him. No explanation has been given as to why that was not done. [452 D-G] [Those exercising drastic powers of preventive detention should at least take care to ascertain whether a detention is being ordered In a manner and on materials which disclose that it is really necessary to order a detention with view to preventing the person to be detained from acting in a manner prejudicial to the objects for which preventive detention may be lawfully ordered. [452 C-D] Prabhu Dayal Deorah v. District Magistrate, Kamrup & Ors., A.T.R. 1974 S.C. 183, followed.
