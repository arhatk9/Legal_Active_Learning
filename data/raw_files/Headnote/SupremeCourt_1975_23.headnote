 The appellant in his petition challenging the election of the respondent alleged (1) that the respondent had been guilty of committing a corrupt practice under s. 123(7) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 in that he had obtained the assistance of a member of the armed forces in his election and (2) that he had distributed posters with the pictures of the Prime Minister and other important ministers together with the three chiefs and four Generals of the Armed Forces bearing the caption 'Pillars of Victory and thereby 'exercised undue influence within the meaning of s.123(2) of the Act. The High Court dismissed the petition.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court.
 
HELD : (1) Since the deletion of the words or a polling agent or a counting agent' from Explanation (2) of s.123(7) by the Amending Act 47 of 1966, a member of the armed forces, merely by acting as a polling agent, is not deemed to assist in the furtherance of the prospects of a candidate's election within the contemplation of s.123(7) of the Act. Secondly, the Lance Naik bad categorically asserted that he did the canvassing on his own and not in the company of the respondent. [441 G] (2) (a) The publication of the, poster was an act of impropriety but not one of corrupt practice falling within the mischief of s.123. Members of the armed forces spoken of in this clause mean persons in flesh and blood and not their inanimate photographs. [443 B] (b) In one sense even election propaganda carried on vigorously, blaringly and systematically through charismal leaders or through various media in favour of a candidate by recounting the glories and achievements of that candidate or his political party in administrative or political field, does meddle with and mould the independent volition of electors, having poor reason and little education in the exercise of their franchise. That such a wide construction would not be in consonance with the intendment of the legislature is discernible from the to proviso to this clause. The proviso illustrates that ordinarily interference with the free exercise of electoral right involves violence or threat of injury of any kind to any candidate or an elector or inducement or attempt to induce a candidate or elector to believe that he will become an object of divine displeasure or spiritual censure. The prefix "undue' indicates that there must be some abuse of influence. 'Undue influence is used in contra-distinction to 'proper influence. Construed in the' light of the proviso cl. 2 of s. 123 does not bar or penalize legitimate canvassing or appeals to reason and judgment of the voters or other lawful means of persuading voters to vote or not to vote for a candidate. Such proper and peaceful persuasion is the motive force of our democratic process [442 E-G]
