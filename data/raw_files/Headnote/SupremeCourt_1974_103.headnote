 The respondent-landlord having failed in his attempts to recover possession of the non residential premises from the appellant, entered into a lease deed by which he gave a lease of the premises to the appellant for a period of two years. After the expiry of the period of lease the appellant continued in possession as a monthly tenant. Two years after the expiry of the lease period the respondent again filed suit for eviction on the ground that the bona fide required the premises for starting his own business as a dealer in iron and steel materials, a ground for eviction recognised by s. 12(1)(f) of the Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act, 1961. The trial court granted a decree for eviction. The first appellate Court set aside the decree for eviction. It came to the finding that the business of dealer in iron and steel materials which the landlord wanted to start was a totally new business for him, that there was no evidence to show that the landlord made the necessary preparations from which inference could be drawn that he wanted to start new business, and that for the nearly two years, after the expiry of the lease, the landlord did not take any steps to terminate the tenancy.
 Therefore, the first Appellate Court held that what the evidence showed was mere assertion on the fell short of the proof required. The High Court, in second appeal held that it was established that the requirement of the landlord was bona fide. It pointed out that the first Appellate Court had fallen into an error in holding that unless the respondent showed that he had made preparations for starting the business it could not be held that be bona fide required the premises. The High Court relied on the objective facts that the respondent had as far back as 1959 sought to recover possession of the premises for the purpose of the new business and that having discontinued the business he was carrying on and surrendered the premises, it was but natural that the respondent wanted to start this new business. The High Court thus came to the conclusion that the respondent had succeeded in establishing that he bona fide required the premises for the purpose of starting business ,is a dealer in iron and steel materials.
 In appeal by Special Leave to this Court it was contended by the appellants that in reversing the findings of the First Appellate Court on the question of bona fide requirement of the premises by the respondent, the High Court exceeded its jurisdiction in second appeal; since the finding that the respondent did not bona fide require the premises for the purpose of starting his own business was i finding of fact, it was not open to the High Court to interfere with it unless it could be shown that it was vitiated by an error of law. The respondent on the other contended that the finding in regard to the question of bona ride requirement was a mixed finding of law and fact and the High Court was, therefore. entitled to examine its correctness.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : The High Court exceeded its jurisdiction in second appeal in reversing the decision of the First Appellate Court and passing a decree for eviction against the appellant. [137F] (1) The issues whether the respondent required the shop for the purpose of starting new business as a dealer in iron and steel materials, and, if so, whether his requirement was bona fide were both questions of fact. Their determination did not involve the application of legal principles to the facts established in the evidence. The findings of the First Appellate Court on these issues were no doubt inferences from other basic facts, but that did not alter 128 the character of these findings and they remained findings of fact, Therefore, the conclusion of the First Appellate Court that the respondent did not bona fide require the shop premises for the purpose of starting new business as a, dealer in iron and steel materials represented a finding of fact and could not be interfered with by the High Court in second appeal unless it was shown that in reaching it a mistake of law was committed or that it was based on no evidence or was such as no reasonable man could reach.

 (2) Mere assertion on the part of the landlord that he requires a nonresidential accommodation in the occupation of tenant for the purpose of starting or continuing his own business is not decisive. It is for the court to determine the truth of the assertion and also whether it is bona fide.
 The word 'requires' signifies that mere desire on the part of the landlord is not enough but there should be an element of need and the landlord must show,. the burden being upon him, that the genuinely requires the non-residential accommodation for the purpose of starting or continuing his own business. The First Appellate Court did not misdirect itself in regard to these matters. [135G-136C] (3) The First Appellate Court was clearly in error in relying on two circumstances, namely, that the respondent had not made preparations for starting the new business and that he had asked for possession of the whole of the pre- mises and not merely a portion of it, in support of the finding of fact reached by it. But, that would not entitle the High Court to interfere in second appeal and set aside this finding of fact so long as there was some evidence to support it and it could not be branded as arbitrary, unreasonable or perverse. [136D-E] (4) There was evidence to sustain the finding of fact arrived at by the First Appellate Court. The respondent had been trying to obtain the possession of the premises from the appellant since as far back as 1952. and it was apparent that the respondent was anyhow bent upon evicting the appellant from the premises. The respondent allowed the appellant to continue as 'a monthly tenant for a period of two years matter the expiry of the period of lease and did not take any steps to terminate the tenancy and recover possession of the shop from the appellant. Moreover, the respondent had no experience in the business of dealing in iron and steel materials and it was entirely a new business so far as he was concerned. These circumstances. borne out by the evidence on record and held established by the First Appellate Court clearly supported the finding of fact. Nor could this finding of fact be said to be arbitrary, unreasonable or perverse so as to merit interference by the High Court in second appeal. [136E-137B]
