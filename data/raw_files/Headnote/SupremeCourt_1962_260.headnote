 The appellant company was the owner of certain mines in Bihar from where it extracted iron ore which it utilised in its factory at Jamshedpur for making iron and steel. Under ss. 5 and 6 of the Bengal Cess Act, 1880, as amended in Bihar, all immovable property situate in any part of the State of Bihar was liable to payment of local cess which, in the case of mines, was to be assessed on the annual net profits from them. For the assessment year 1954-56, the company was assessed by the Cess Deputy Collector on the basis that it had made a profit of Rs. 4-7-0 per ton of iron ore extracted. The appellant claimed that it was not liable to the levy of cess under the Act because it did not sell any ore as such and could not therefore be treated as having made "any profit" from the mines within the meaning of s.6 of the Act. The question was whether the appellant company could in law be said to have derived "Profit" from the mine when the ore extracted was not sold by it as such but was utilised by it for the purpose of manufacturing finished products which it sold.
 Held, that on the true construction of ss.5, 6 and 72 of the Bengal Cess Act, 1880, as amended in Bihar, where activities 200 other than mere winning the ore are carried on by an assessee with a view to convert the ore into a finished product and there is a transaction of sale of the ultimate product, the profit derived from the working of the mine is imbeded in the final realisation, and the profit which accrues to the assessee from the mining operation can be disintegrated and ascertained, and a tax levied thereon.
