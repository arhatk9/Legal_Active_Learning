 The appellant is a minority College, affiliated to he respondent-University. In August 1964, the College management applied to the respondent for permission to start teaching in certain courses of study. The respondent insisted, that as a condition of recognition of the additional subjects, the Managing Committee must be re- constituted in conformity with statute 14-A by including the Principal of the College and the senior most member of the staff in it. The, appellant filed a writ petition in the, High Court challenging Statute 14-A a,,, violative of Art.
 30, but the High Court dismissed the petition.
 (Per majority, V.R. Krishna Iyer and A.C. Gupta, JJ.) The inclusion of the Principal and the senior member of the staff on the Managing Committee, improves the administration and does not inhibit its autonomy, and the Statute is therefore good and valid. [833A] (1) Abridgement of the right under Art. 30 is as obnoxious as its annihilation, but the right can be regulated in a benign manner which neither abridges nor exaggerates autonomy but promotes better performance. To regulate is not to restrict, but to facilitate the effective exercise of the very right regulated. [820B-C; 824D] (2) The Principal is an invaluable insider-the Management's own choice and not an outsider. He brings into the work of the Managing Committee that intimate acquaintance with educational operations and that necessary expression of student-teacher aspirations and complaints which are so essential for the minority institutions to achieve a happy marriage between individuality and excellence. An activist Principal is an asset in discharging the duties of the Managing, Committee which are inextricably inter-laced with academic functions. The senior most teacher is a seasoned representative of the teachers and is also chosen by the management itself. His role, though less striking and moire unobstrusive, is also a useful input into managerial skills.
 [8251-H] (3) Moreover, the Managing Committee is subject to the hierarchiral control ofthe Governing Body and General Council. [825H] (4) To draw a distinction between creating a managing body, and regulating the manner of its functioning to obviate maladministration, and hold that-the former is beyond the pale of legislative prescription while the latter is permiSSible as a preservative, is broadly sound; but, as a rigid logical formula, it breaks down. For example, if the law says that a person convicted of breach of trust or that ,in undischarged insolvent would be disqualified to be the treasurer, it affects the structure of the governing body, but it is indubitably a protection against likely maladministration. [823E-H] (5) In the D.A.V. College case (1971) Supp. S.C.R. 688 and Stat of Kerala v. Very Rev. Mother, Provincial [1970] INSC 151; (1971) 1 S.C.R. 734 some provisions relating to the principal of the institution were struck down, but the real reason for striking them down was that those provisions and others deprived the minority of its right to manage its own institutions.

Bishop Patro's case [1969] INSC 100; (1970) 1 S.C.R. 172, referred to.
 (Per K. K. Mathew, I dissenting The Whole temper and tone of a college do depend upon the principal and the teachers, but that does not mean that they should be members of the governing council of a college.
 [815F-G] The matter is concluded by the decision of this Court in Ahmedabad St. Xavier's College Society V. State of Gujarat [1974] INSC 106; (1975) 1 S.C.R. 173. This Court held by a majority that s.
 33A(1) (a) of the Gujarat University Act, 1949, was violative of Art. 30(1) because, that provision required the inclusion, in the: governing body of the College, of persons whom the religious minority did not want to include. When the article says that a religious or linguistic minority has the right to administer educational institutions of its choice, it means that the right to carry on the administration of the institution must be left to the managing body consisting of Persons in whom the religious or linguistic minority has faith and confidence. The minority community has the exclusive right to vest the administration of the College in a body of its own choice and any compulsion from an outside authority to include any other person in that body is an abridgement of its fundamental right to administer the educational institution. The, determination of the composition of the, body to educational institution established by a religious minority must minority as that is the core of the right to administer, though prevent maladministration by that body are permissible. But,such regulations can only relate to the manner of administration after the to administer has come into being. [812D; 815B-D] State of Kerala v.
