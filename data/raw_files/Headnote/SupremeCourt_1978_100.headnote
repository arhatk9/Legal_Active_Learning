 Nishan Chand (deceased), son of appellant Mohan Lal, resident of Roranwali, was the Secretary of Roranwali, and Phulukhere Co-operative Societies. Respondent Ajit Singh, Nishan Chand's friend, was the Secretary of Roranwall Patti Sikhan Co-operative Society. He also lived in village Roranwali, with his maternal uncle Gurdial Singh who was the village Chairman. On June 17, 1974 both Nishan Chand and the respondent left for villages Lambi and Malaut on the former's bicycle for depositing the moneys realised on account of the dues of the Co-operative societies. They did not, however, return to Roranwali that night. On the next day, Satpal, the younger brother of Nishan Chand, found the bicycle of his brother lying at some distance from the boundary of the village near a culvert and his brother's body in a field at a short distance from there and informed his father Mohan Lal. Mohan Lal and his brother Dharam Chand went to the place where the dead body lay. The dead body had many injuries, and a blood stained blade of a knife (Ex. P3) was lying near it. A black piece of cloth "fifty" was lying at some distance on the road, and as it was worn by Ajit Singh the-previous day, a report was lodged with the police. Ajit Singh was arrested on 21st June, 1974 and on his information that he had buried a sum of 41.00/- and a gold ring in his purse, tied in a handkerchief, near the water lift, and had concealed the blood stained clothes and a shoe inside the heap of cotton 'sticks' in a kiln on a road, the Police recovered those articles at his instance.
 The bundle of currency notes which was recovered at the instance of the respondent contained one currency note of Rs. 100/- which was suspected to have fingerprints. Ajit Singh was tried and was convicted by the Additional Sessions Judge of offences under ss. 302, 392 and 397 I.P.C. The Additional Sessions Judge sentenced him to death for the offence under secton 302 I.P.C. and to rigorous imprisonment for five years and seven years respectively for the offences under sections 392 and 397 I.P.C. On appeal, the High Court gave him the benefit of doubt and acquitted him. Mohan Lal (father of the deceased) and one Surinder Kumar filed the present appeal, by special leave.
 Allowing the appeal, the Court, 
HELD : (1) While considering the statement of the accused under section 313 Crl. P.C., 1973 it is permissible to reject the exculpatory part of the statement if it is disproved by the evidence on record, and to acts upon it.

 (2)The evidence on record was sufficient to show that the statement of the respondent which led to the recovery of certain articles was not only voluntary but fell within the purview of section 27 of the Evidence Act in as much as the "fact discovered" was the place from which the various articles were produced by the respondent and his knowledge of it. Moreover the actual recovery of the currency notes, the ring (bearing the initials of the deceased) and the purse (containing a library card having the address of the respondent) in pursuance of the information given by the respondent, and at his instance, was sufficient guarantee of the truth of that information and it could safely have been relied upon by the High Court. [834 C-D] (3)There is no gainsaying the fact that a majority of fingerprints found at crime scenes or crime articles are partially smudged, and it is for the experienced and skilled fingerprint expert to say whether a mark is usable as fingerprint 824 evidence. Similarly it is for a competent technician to examine and give his opinion whether the identity can be established, and if so whether that can be done on eight or even less identical characteristics in an appropriate case.
 In this case there was the categorical statement of the Director, Finger Print Bureau, Phillaur, that one particular impression on the currency note was photographically enlarged alongwith the right middle finger impression of the respondent, that it was comparable, and there existed not less than eight points-of similarity i.e. matching characteristic details in their identical sequence, without any discordance, between its comparable portion and the corresponding portion of the photographically enlarged right middle finger impression. The Director graphically showed the eight points of similarity, in their same form and position and indicated the nature, direction and sequence of each point. He clearly stated that so many points of similarity could not be found to occur in impressions of different thumbs and fingers and that they were identical and were of one and the same person. [840 F-G, 841 D-E] (4)The recovery of incriminating articles in pursuance of the respondent's information is an important piece of evidence against him. The question whether a presumption should be drawn against him under illustration (a) of section 114 of the Evidence Act is a matter with depends on the evidence and the circumstances of each case. The nature of the recovered articles, the manner of their acquisition by the owner, the nature of the evidence about their identification, the manner in which the articles were dealt with by the accused, the place and the circumstances of their recovery, the length of the intervening period and the ability or otherwise of the accused to explain the recovery, are some of those circumstances. All these factors were against the respondent.[841 G-H, 842 A] Baiju Bharosa v. State of Madhya Pradesh [1978] INSC 10; [1978] 2 SCR 594 reiterated.
 (5)The ring (Ex. PI) was made of gold and bore the initials of the deceased, and the goldsmith was able to establish that it belonged to the deceased. It was found tied in a handkerchief alongwith other two highly incriminating articles, namely, the finger marked currency note and the respondent's own purse about whose identity there could possibly be no reason for any doubt. The respondent knew that he would be suspected of the crime because the deceased was last seen in his company, and the fact that he buried the articles near the water lift in the middle of the way leading from Khankanwali to his village shows that he wanted the articles to lie there until he could feel reassured enough to dig them out. It so happened however that he was suspected from the very beginning, was arrested within four days and gave the information within the next two days which led to the discovery of an important fact within the meaning of section 27 of the Evidence Act.
 It must therefore be held that the incriminating articles were acquired by the respondent at one and the same time and that it was he and no one else who had robbed the deceased of the money and the ring and had hidden them at a place and in a manner which was known to him. Then there is the further fact that the respondent was unable to explain his possession. All these facts were not only proof of robbery but were presumptive evidence of the charge of murder as well.[842 B-F] Wasim Khan v. The State of U.P. [1956] SCR 191; Tulsiram Nanu v. The State, AIR 1954 SC 1; Sunderlal v. The State of M.P., AIR 1954 SC 28 Alisher V. State of U.P. [1974] 4 SCR 254; and Baiju @ Bharosa v. State of M.P., [1978] INSC 10; [1978] 2 SCR 594 reiterated.
 (6)The High Court committed serious errors in reading the evidence on the record and very often based its findings on mere conjectures. Its finding that the prosecution had failed to "connect the accused with the commission of the crime" was quite incorrect and must be set aside. Reasoning of High Court examined with reference to the direct and circumstantial evidence on record. [838-C-D]
