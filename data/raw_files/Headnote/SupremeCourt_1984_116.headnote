 The respondent-assessee, a limited company, was engaged in the business of manufacturing dyes. Its 50 per cent share capital was held by Atul Products Ltd. and the remaining 50 per cent by Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd. London which also had a subsidiary company fully owned by it, called Imperial Chemical Industries (India) Pvt. Ltd. The Imperial Chemical Industries (India) Pvt. Ltd. ceased to be a subsidiary company wholly owned by the chemical Industries Ltd. London on 13th March 1978, since 60 per of the share capital of Imperial Chemical Industries (India) Pvt. Ltd, was offered to the public in pursuance of the policy of the Government of India requiring that not more than 40% of the share capital of an Indian company should be held by a foreign shareholder. Consequent upon this dilution o foreign shareholding, the name of Imperial Chemical Industries (India) Pvt. Ltd, was changed to Crescent Dyes and Chemicals Ltd.
 The assessee at all material times sold the large bulk of dyes manufactured by it in wholesale to Atul Products Ltd. and Imperial Chemical Industries (India) Pvt. Limited which subsequently came to be known as Crescent Dyes and Chemicals Ltd. at a uniform price applicable alike to both these wholesale buyers and these wholesale buyers sold these dyes to dealers and consumers at a higher price which inter alia included the expenses incurred by 931 them as also their profit. The transactions between the assessee on the one hand and Atul Products Ltd. and Crescent Dyes and Chemicals Limited on the other were as principal to principal and the wholesale price charged by the assessee to Atul Products Ltd and Crescent Dyes and Chemicals Ltd. was the sole consideration for the sale and no extra-commercial considerations entered in the determination of such price.
 The assessee went on clearing the dyes manufactured by it after payment of excise duty as per the price list submitted by it on the basis of the wholesale price charged to Atul Products Ltd. and Crescent Dyes and Chemicals Ltd.
 as the same was approved by the Asst. Collector on 29th October, 1975. The Superintendent of Central Excise, however, issued a notice to the assessee on 31st July 1976 calling upon the assessee to show cause why the earlier decision approving the price list should not be reviewed and the differential duty worked out on the basis of selling price charged by Atul Products Ltd. and Crescent Dyes & Chemicals Ltd. should not be recovered w.e.f. 1st October, 1975 on the ground that the assessee on the one hand and Atul Products Ltd. and Crescent Dyes and Chemicals Ltd. on the other were "related persons" and the assessable value of the dyes manufactured by the assessee was therefore liable to be calculated on the basis of the price at which Atul Products Ltd. and Crescent Dyes and Chemicals Ltd. sold the Dyes to the dealers and the consumers. The assessee in its reply dated 31st August 1976 pointed out that the assessee on the one hand and Atul Products Ltd. and Crescent Dyes and Chemicals Ltd. on the other were not "related persons" within the meaning of the definition of that term contained in clause (c) of sub-section (4) of section 4 of the amended Central Excise and Salt Act 1944. The Asstt. Collector was however not satisfied with the explanation offered by the assessee and viewed his earlier order of approval of the price list and confirmed the demand of differential duty which came to an aggregate amount of Rs 1,17,77,737.65 with retrospective effect from 1st October, 1975 and directed the assessee to file a fresh price list on the basis of the selling price charged by Atul Products Ltd. and Crescent Dyes and Chemicals Ltd.
 The assessee thereupon filed a writ petition in the High Court of Gujarat challenging the validity of the demand made by the Asstt. Collector on two grounds namely, (i) that the concept of "related person" occuring in clause (c) of sub-section (4) of section 4 of the amended Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944 was outside the legislative competence of Parliament under Art. 226 read with Entry 84 in the Union List and was therefore unconstitutional and void; & (ii) that the assessee on the one hand and Atul Products Ltd. and Crescent Dyes & Chemicals Ltd. on the other were not "related persons" and the wholesale cash price charged by the assessee to Atul Products Ltd. and Crescent Dyes and Chemicals Ltd., and not the price at which the latter sold the dyes to the dealers or the consumers represented the true measure of the value of the dyes for the purpose of chargeability to excise duty. The High Court allowed the writ petition on these two grounds and also gave direction to the Revenue for paying the costs incurred by the assessee in 932 connection with the bank guarantee furnished by it. Hence the appeal to this Court by certificate granted under Art.
 132 and 133 (1) of the Constitution Allowing the appeal in part, the Court.
 ^ 
 HELD: (1) On a proper interpretation of the definition of "related person" in sub-section (4) (c) of sec. 4, the words "relative and a distributor of the assessee" do not refer to any distributor but they are limited only to a distributor who is a relative of the assessee within the meaning of the Companies Act, 1956. The definition of "related person" is not unduly wide and does not suffer from any constitutional infirmity. It is within the legislative competence of Parliament. The decision of the High Court holding that "the concept of related person occurring in amended section 4 is ultra vires the legislative competence of Parliament under Article 256 read with Entry 84 in the Union List and striking down clause (c) of sub-section (4) of sec. 4 as also the expression "the buyer is not a related person and" in clause (a) of sub-section (1) of sec. 4 and proviso (iii) to that clause must consequently be set aside and it must be held that these provisions are constitutionally valid. [937 E-H] Union of India v. Bombay Tyres International Ltd.
 [1984] 1 SCC 467 applied.
 High Court judgment in Special Civil Appln. No. 119 of 1976 decided on 20 21 February 1979 reversed.
 (2) The first part of the definition of "related person" in clause (c) of sub-section (4) of sec. 4 defines 'related person' to mean "a person who is so associated with the assessee that they have interest directly or indirectly in the business of each other" It is not enough that the assessee has an interest, direct or indirect in the business of the person alleged to be a related person nor is it enough that the person alleged to be a related person has an interest, direct or indirect in the business of the assessee. To attract the applicability of the first part of the definition, the assessee and the person alleged to be a related person must have interest direct or indirect in the business of each other. Each of them must have a direct or indirect interest in the business of the other. The quality and degree of interest. which each has in the business of the other may be different; the interest of one in the business of the other may be direct while the interest of the latter in the business of the former may be indirect.
 That would not make any difference so long as each has got some interest direct of indirect in the business of the other. [938 G-H; 939 A-B] (3) (i) In the present case Atul Products Ltd. has undoubtedly interest in the business of the assessee since it holds 50% of the share capital of the assessee and has interest as shareholder in the business carried on by the assessee. But, it cannot be said that the assessee, a Ltd.
 company, has any interest, direct or in direct in the business carried on by one of its shareholders, 933 namely Atul Products Ltd., even though the share-holding of such shareholder may be 50 per cent. Secondly, Atul Products Ltd. is a wholesale buyer of the dyes manufactured by the assessee but even then, since the transactions between them are as principal to principal, it is difficult to appreciate how the assessee could be said by virtue of that circumstance to have any interest, direct or indirect, in the business of Atul Products Ltd. The assessee is not concerned whether Atul Products Ltd. sells or does not sell the dyes purchased by it from the assessee nor is it concerned whether Atul Products Ltd. sells such dyes at a profit or at a loss. [939 C-F] (ii) Perhaps the position in regard to Crescent Dyes and Chemicals Ltd is much stronger than that in regard to Atul Products Ltd. Crescent Dyes and Chemicals Ltd. is not even a shareholder of the assessee and it has therefore no interest direct or indirect in the business of the assessee.
 Equally, the assessee has no interest, direct or indirect in the business of Crescent Dyes and Chemicals Ltd., which is just a wholesale dealer purchasing dyes from the assessee in wholesale on principal to principal basis. [939 G-H] (iii) The first part of the definition of related persons in clause (c) of sub-section (4) of section 4 of the amended Act is therefore clearly not satisfied both in relations to Atul Products Ltd. as also in relation to Crescent Dyes and Chemicals Ltd. and neither of them can be said to be a "related person" vis-a-vis the assessee within the meaning of the definition of that term in clause (c) of sub-section (4) of sec. 4 of the amended Act. Therefore, the assessable value of the dyes manufactured by the assessee cannot be determined with reference to the selling price charged by Atul Products Ltd. and Crescent Dyes and Chemicals Ltd. to their purchasers but must be determined on the basis of the wholesale cash price charged by the assessee to Atul Products Ltd. and Crescent Dyes and Chemicals Ltd. The demand made by the Asstt. Collector for differential duty must therefore be held to be rightly quashed by the High Court. [940 D-F] (4) The High Court was not right in giving direction to the Revenue to pay costs incurred by the assessee in connection with the bank guarantee furnished by the assessee. The bank guarantee was required to be furnished by the assessee as a condition of grant of interim stay of enforcement of the demand for differential duty and if it is ultimately found that the demand for differential duty was not justified, the bank guarantee would certainly have to be discharged. But, it is difficult to see how the costs of furnishing the bank guarantee could be directed to be paid by the Revenue to the assessee. This direction of the High Court which directs the revenue to pay to the assessee the costs in connection with the bank guarantee furnished by it in pursuance of the interim order of the High Court is set aside.
