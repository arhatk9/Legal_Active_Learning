 The auction of leasehold rights on the plot in question was in favour of the appellant for Rs. 8.13 crores on 19.1.1981. The appellant paid 25% of the auction amount on the fail of the hammer. According to the terms and conditions of the auction balance 75% was required to be paid within 90 days of the formal acceptance of the bid which was made on 18.2.1982.
 The appellants did not pay the balance amount and took a stand that there was some confusion as to whether it was D.D.A. or the Union of India, which was the owner of the plot in question. The appellant also sought for time for payment on the ground that money market in relation to the land property had gone down tremendously.
 On 14.12.1984 revised terms were communicated by the D.D.A. to the appellants. The essential terms of the revised agreement were that 25% of the bid amount was to be paid within 90 days of the issuance of the letter of revised terms. 50% of the remaining bid amount along with interest for delayed payments was to be paid in five equal half yearly instalments which included the interest calculated at 18% per annum.
 The appellants submitted a bank guarantee dated 15th July, 1985 in favour of the D.D.A. The fresh schedule of instalments was specifically mentioned in the bank guarantee. Thereafter on 23.7.1985, a formal deed 466 of agreement was executed between the parties and possession over the plot was given on 25.7.1985. The building plans were submitted by the appellant on 12.8.1985. The D.D.A.
 forwarded building plans to the Delhi Urban Arts Commission (DUAC). The DUAC by its letter dated 18.9.1985 sought certain clarifications from the appellant within ten days and again sent a reminder on 24.9.1985, but the appellant did not send any reply.
 The appellant sent a notice for commencement of construction on 15.10.1985 claiming that they having not received any order of rejection of the plans within sixty days as contemplated under bye-law No. 6.7.4. had become entitled to deemed sanction; that the first instalment, according to the re-schedule of instalments was payable on 15.11.1985 but even before that they had paid Rs.47 lakhs on 8.10.1985 itself.
 Thereafter the Government of India by an office memorandum dated 17.10.1985 decided to stop construction of multi-storeyed building in New Delhi including areas under D.D.A. and Municipal Corporation, with immediate effect till the Master plan for 2001 was finalised.
 The DUAC then returned the proposals of the buildings plans of the appellant to the D.D.A. on 20.11.1985. The D.D.A. by its letter dated 9.12.1985 informed the appellants regarding the decision of the Government of India and returned the building plans and it was directed not to process the sanction further till further directions were received from the Government of India.
 A notice to stop the construction immediately till the plans were sanctioned finally by the D.D.A. was given to the appellants on 17.1.1986.
 On 25.3.86 the D.D.A. informed the appellants that their plans had been rejected as the same had no been approved by the DUAC.
 The appellants filed writ petition challenging the notice issued by the D.D.A. of stopping the construction work and also the ban introduced by the Government of India.
 The High Court on 17.9.1986 passed an interim order permitting the appellants to continue the construction work at their own risk.
 On 15.10.1987 the bank guarantee was invoked by the D.D.A. for a sum of Rs.8 crores approximately.
 467 The appellants filed a second writ petition challenging the encashment of the bank gurantee by D.D.A. and obtained an interim order on 28.10.1987 restraining the D.D.A. from encashing the bank guarantee.
 The ban imposed by the Central Government was lifted on 8.2.1988. The appellants completed the construction of the building in 1988 under the cover of the stay order given by the High Court. The two writ petitions were dismissed by the High Court.
 These appeals were filed by the contractors against the judgment of the High Court, by special leave, contending that the D.D.A. was not entitled to charge any compound interest; that the D.D.A. was not entitiled to claim any interest for the period 7.10.1985 to 8.2.1988 during which the ban in respect of construction of multi-storeyed buildings remained in force; that the ban itself was also illegal; that the D.D.A. was not entitled to claim any compounding fee; and that the D.D.A. was not entitled to claim any interest on the compounding fee.
 Partly allowing the appeals of the contractors, this court, 
 HELD: 1.1. The object of Delhi Development Act is to provide for the development of Delhi according to the plan.
 While under Section 9(2) of the Delhi Development Act every master plan has to be submitted to the Central Government for approval and the Government may either approve the plan without modifications or with such modifications as it may consider necessary or reject the plan with directions to the Authority to prepare a fresh plan according to such directions. The Development Authority had sent the new master plan for approval of the Central Government and as such the Government for the planned development of Delhi was entitled to issue directions in consonance with law. [475H- 476B] 1.2. There was no violation of law in issuing a restriction on high rise constructions during the formulation stages of the new master plan pending for approval before the Central Government. Thus it cannot be said that the ban imposed by the Central Government was in any manner unauthorised or illegal. [476 D] 2.1. The question of deemed sanction only arises if within sixty days of the receipt of notice under 6.1. of the bye-laws the authority fails to intimate in writing to the person who has given a notice of its refusal or 468 sanction or any intimation. [478 B] 2.2. In the instant case the D.D.A. had informed the appellant that the plans had been sent to DUAC for approval and the DUAC was also seeking some clarifications from the appellant by their letters dated 18.9.1985 and 24.9.1985.
 [478 B] 2.3. The requirement as contemplated under bye-law 6.7.4. is that the fact of deemed sanction has to be immediately brought to the notice of the authority in writing by the person who has given notice and thereafter if no intimation is received from the authority within 15 days of giving such written notice the provision of deemed sanction comes into operation.
 [478 C] 2.4. The appellant only sent a notice for commencement of construction on 15.10.1985 and the same does not fulfil the requirement of the notice which is contemplated under bye-law 6.7.4. in as much as intimation had already been given by DUAC seeking information. Apart from this the ban on the construction of multi-storeyed buildings came into operation from 17.10.1985 itself and in view of this circumstance also there was no question of the applicability of deemed sanction in the facts of this case.
 [478D-E] 2.5. The amount which was required to be paid in five instalments of Rs. 166.20 lakhs each from 15.11.1985 to 15.11.1987, included simple interest charged at the rate of 18% per annum but it was based on a fresh agreement and the appellants cannot claim any right to re-open the transaction on the basis of terms of auction made originally in 1982.
 The indulgence of re-scheduling of delayed payment of bid amount in July, 1985 was made on the request of the appellant and for its own benefit. Thus the D.D.A. is perfectly right and justified in claiming future interest at the rate of 18% per annum on the instalments fixed in the agreement dated 23rd July, 1985. The D.D.A. is not charging any compound interest but are claiming simple interest at the rate of 18% per annum on the amount of instalments fixed in the fresh agreement dated 23rd July, 1985 till payment, After novation of the agreement the instalments fixed shall be considered as principal amount and thus it is not a case of charging compound interest. [474H-475C] 2.6. For charging of interest during the ban period is concerned, the D.D.A. cannot be held responsible as the ban was imposed by the Central Government. This action was taken for the whole of Delhi and the D.D.A.
 469 was to carry out such directions as provided under Section 41 of the Delhi Development Act, 1957. [475D-E] 2.7. It is not in dispute that the building has been constructed without any sanction or permit from the D.D.A.
 as required under the building bye-laws and the building has been constructed at the risk of the appellant under the stay order of the High Court. [478 F] 2.8. No building permit has been given to the appellants and as such they are bound to pay the compounding fee according to the rates prescribed in this regard. [479 C] 2.9. In the facts and circumstances of the case the D.D.A. is not entitled to charge any interest on the compounding fee. [479 D]
