 Section 107, Cr. P. C. is designed to enable the Magistrate to take measures with a view to prevent commission of offences involving breach of peace or disturbance of public tranquillity. it is not correct to say that once the period for which the bond was ordered to be executed had expired the order becomes nugatory, because, it would lead to the result that the proceedings under the section would have to be dropped if the person proceeded against succeeds in protracting the proceedings even though the apprehension of breach of peace or disturbance of public tranquillity still persists. [740B-F] But the court is not precluded from taking into account subsequent events. If the material on record discloses that the danger of breach of peace has disappeared the Court can.
 drop the proceedings and discharge the person proceeded against. Even in the absence of positive evidence of reconciliation between the opposing parties. if the Court finds that since the date of the incident complained of, a very long period had elapsed during which nothing_ untoward had happened the Court may draw the inference that the danger of breach of peace has vanished. [740F-H] In the present case, the appellants were ordered in 1959 to furnish bonds under the section. The amount of the bonds was reduced by the appellate court. A revision by the appellants to the High Court against the order to furnish the bonds was dismissed. The bonds, however, were not executed because of stay orders passed by the courts. The appeal ,against the High Court's order was disposed of by this Court in 1972, and during the 13 years that the matter was pending in the lower Courts and this Court, the appellants had not done anything which may cause apprehension of breach of peace. [740H; 741A-B] Therefore, it was not expedient to compel them to execute the bonds.
