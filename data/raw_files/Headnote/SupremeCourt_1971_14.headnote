 The assessee firm was constituted under a deed of partnership dated October 6, 1955. It was to come into existence with effect from November 5, 1954. The assessee filed an application under s. 26A of the Act for registration of the firm for the assessment year 1956-57.
 The previous year of the firm was shown as the year ending October 26, 1955. The application was received by the Income-tax Officer on October 14, 1955. On October 20, 1955 the assessee filed before the Registrar of Firms a statement under s. 58 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932. On November 2, 1955 the Registrar of Firms filed the statement of the assessee and made entries in the register of firms.
 On March 23, 1961 the Income-tax Officer passed an order refusing to register the firm under s. 26-6A. inter-alia for the reason that the application had not been made in time.
 The appeal taken to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner failed. The Tribunal also upheld the order of the authorities below. In reference the High Court answered the question in favour of the assessee holding that the partnership should be deemed to have been registered on the date when the application was presented and that the requirement of r. 2(b) of the Rules would be satisfied if it became registered under the Partnership Act even after the 'application under s. 26A was filed. in appeal by the Revenue.
 HELD : (i) The view taken by the High Court was not correct.
 Under the Partnership law it can be taken to have been settled by decision,-, of High Courts, from a long time that the registration of firm takes place only when necessary entries are made in the register of firms under s. 59 of the Partnership Act by the Registrar. Section 58 of the Act no doubt employs language which, without anything more may appear to lend support to the view that the registration of a firm may be effected merely by sending an application which would mean that as soon as an application is sent and if entry is made under s. 59 pursuant to it the registration would be effective from the date when the application was presented. But s. 58(2) is not to be read in isolation and has to be considered along with the scheme of the other provisions of the Act viz. ss. 59 and 69. The latter section which deals with the effect of non-registration throws light on what was contemplated by the Legislature with regard to the point of time when the firm could be regarded as registered.

 366 (ii) The views expressed by the Special Committee appointed by the Government of India in respect of the Bill which came to be passed by the Central Legislative as the Partnership Act were irrelevant for the purpose of construing the provisions of the Act. [1369B]
