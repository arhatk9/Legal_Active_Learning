 The election to the office of President of India held in August 1969 was challenged in five election petitions filed in this Court. The main question that 'fell for consideration was whether the distribution of an anonymous pamphlet making defamatory statements about one of the candidates at the election, in the manner alleged by the petitioners, amounted to exercise of undue influence within the meaning of s. 18 of the Presidential and Vice- Presidential Election Act 31 of 1952 read with s. 171 C of the Indian Penal Code. In this connection the Court had further to decide whether the pamphlet was published and distributed by the winning candidate or with his connivance, by his supporters, and whether the result of the election was materially affected by the publication and distribution of the pamphlet in question. The other questions of law at fell for consideration were (1) whether Part III of Act 31 of 1952 had 198 the effect of curtailing the jurisdiction of this Court under Art. 71(1) of the Constitution and was therefore ultra vires, (ii) whether an election under the Act could be challenged on grounds other than those mentioned in s. 18 of Act 31 of 1952 which fell in Part III thereof; (iii) whether s. 21 of the Act was void because of excessive delegation of legislative power; (iv) whether r. 4(1) was ultra vires s.
 21 and also void because it was arbitrary and unreasonable; consequently whether r.4(2)was void;(v) whether the prohibition in r. 4(3) on an elector proposing or seconding more than one candidate was ultra vires s. 5(2) of Act 31 of 1952; consequently whether s. 6(3) was void; (vi) whether nomination paper of one of the candidates was rightly rejected when the electoral roll showed the candidate's age as above 35 years but the candidate's own statement its to his date of birth showed that he was below 35 years; (vii) whether certified copy of entry in electoral roll relating to candidate must under the Rules be issued either by the Electoral Registration Officer or the Assistant Electoral Registration Officer; (viii) whether a nomination paper signed first by the candidate and thereafter by his proposer and seconder could be treated as valid; (ix) whether the elected representatives of the Legislatures of Union Territories are entitled to be included in the Electoral College for the election of President of India on the footing that the word 'State' includes 'Union Territories'; (x) whether s. 5(2) of Act 31 of 1952 is ultra vires Art, 58 of the Constitution; (xi) whether the offence of 'bribery' as alleged by the petitioners was shown to have been committed and (xii) whether in the circumstances of the case costs should be awarded to the winning party. Dismissing the petitions, HELD: (A) Per Sikri, Shelat and Vaidialingam, JJ.
 (Bhargava and Mittee, JJ. dissenting) : (a) Though undue influence for purpose of s. 123 the Representation of the People Act, 1951 has the same meaning as in the present Act that section does not go as far as s. 18 of the present Act so as to provide that even if it is committed by a third party that is to say not an election agent nor a person with the consent of the returned candidate, the election would still be declared to be void provided it has been materially affected by such undue influence. From the fact that both these Acts were enacted by the same legislature and Act 31 of 1952 was passed after the Representation of the People Act was passed, it is clear that Parliament deliberately made s. 18 stricter than the Representation of the People Act, firstly, by using the word "his consent" and secondly, by including undue influence committed even by a stranger having nothing to do with returned candidate as a ground for declaring the election to be void, the only condition in respect of such an Act being that it should have materially affected the election. The object of doing so is obvious.
 namely, that Parliament wanted to ensure that in respect of an election for the highest office in the realm the election should be completely free from any improper influence emanating even from a third party with whom the returned candidate had no connection and without any connivance on his part. The only limitation placed in s. 18 is that in such a case It has to be established that the election was materially affected The questions, therefore, which would arise under s. 18 would be: (1) Has the offence of undue influence been committed ? (2) If so, was it committed by the returned candidate or by a person with his connivance ? and (3) Even if the offence was committed by a stranger and without the connivance of the returned candidate, has the committal of that offence by such "any person" materially affected the election? [222 E-223B] The argument that s. 171 C of the Indian Penal Code does not apply to the first stage when the elector goes through the mental process of weighing merits and demerits of the candidates but only to the second stage when having made his choice he goes to cast his vote in favour of 199 the candidate of his choice, cannot be accepted. The argument completely disregards the structure and provisions of s. 171C. The section is enacted in three parts. The first stage contains the definition of undue influence.
 This is in wide terms and renders a person voluntarily interfering or attempting to interfere with the free exercise of any electoral right guilty of committing undue influence. That this is very wide is indicated by the opening sentence of sub-s. (2) that is, "without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of sub-s. (1)". It is well settled that when it,,, expression is used anything contained in the provisions following this expression is not intended to cut down the generality of the meaning of the preceding provision. [224 G-225 B] Kings emperor v. Sibnath Banerji [1945] F.C.R. 195, referred to.
 It follows that sub-s. (1) has to be looked at as it is without restricting its provisions by what is contained in sub-s. (2). Sub-s. (3) throws a great deal of light on this question. It proceeds on the assumption that a declaration of public policy or a promise of public action or the mere exercise of a legal right can interfere with an electoral right, and therefore it provides that if there is no intention to interfere with the electoral right it shall not be deemed to be interference within the meaning of this section. Such a declaration of public policy or the promise of public action can only act and tend to interfere at the stage when a voter is trying to make up his mind as to which candidate he would support. [225 B-D] Sub-s. (3) further proceeds on the basis that the expression "free exercise of the electoral right" does not mean that a voter is not to be influenced. This expression has to be read in the context of an election in a democratic society and the candidates and their supporters must naturally be allowed to canvass support by all legal and legitimate means. This exercise of the right by a candidate or his supporters to canvass support does not interfere or attempt to interfere with the free exercise of the electoral right.
 What does however attempt to interfere with the exercise of an electoral right is "tyranny over the mind". If the contention of the respondent was to be accepted it would be quite legitimate on the part of the candidate or his supporters to hypnotise a voter and then send him to vote.
 At the stage of. casting his ballot paper there would be no pressure cast on him because his mind has already been made up for him by the hypnotiser.[225-E-G] From a reading of s. 171G it is clear that in pursuit of purity of elections the legislature frowned upon attempts to assail such purity by means of false statements relevant to the personal character and conduct of the candidate and made such acts punishable thereunder. But the fact that making of such a false statement is a distinct offence under s. 171 G does not and cannot mean that it cannot take the graver form of undue influence punishable under s. 171F. The false statement may be of such virulent, vulgar or scurrilous character that it would either deter or tend to deter voters from supporting that candidate whom they would have supported in the free exercise of their electoral right but for their being affected or attempted to be affected by the maker or the publisher of such a statement. Therefore, it is the degree of gravity of the allegation which will be the determining factor in deciding whether it falls under s.
 171C or s. 171G. If the allegation, though false and relating to a candidate's personal character or conduct, made with the intent to affect the result of an election, does not amount to interference or attempt at such interference, the offence would be the lesser one. If, on the other hand, it amounts to interference or an attempt to interfere it would be the graver offence Linder s. 171F read with s. 171C. [225 D-G] 200 The above view is supported by the statement of objects and reasons attached to the bill which ultimately resulted in the enactment of Ch. IXA of the Indian Penal Code, and by a number of decisions given on similar statutory provisions.

 (b) On the evidence in the case it must be held that the pamphlet in question was distributed by post and in the Central Hall of Parliament by some members of Parliament and there was wide discussion about it in the Central Hall. The allegations in the pamphlet, made against one of the losing candidates were covered under s. 171C I.P.C. even if they may be covered under s. 171G. [231 F; 257 B] The argument that the pamphlet could not come under s. 171C because it was anonymously distributed was fallacious. A series of anonymous attempts in a country like ours would have as much if not more, effect as one open powerful attempt. It would be dangerous to provide a sanctuary for anonymous attempts. Moreover, when members of Parliament distribute a pamphlet in the Central Hall it has the same effect as if they had endorsed the pamphlet in writing. [231 H] Accordingly it must be held that the distribution of the pamphlet by post as also distribution in the Central Hall constituted an attempt to interfere with the free exercise of the right of vote-within S. 18 of the Act. [232 C] (c) There was however no evidence to show that the respondent had any connection with the pamphlet or with its distribution. Nor was there any evidence to show that anyone connected with the distribution either through the post or in the Central Hall had any contact with the respondent, or that he distributed it with his knowledge or connivance. [257 D-E] (d) It is well settled that the burden of proving that the result of the election has been materially affected is on the petitioners. As held by this Court in Samant N.
 Balkrishna v. George Fernandes, the matter cannot be decided on possibility or reasonable judicial guess. There was no justification for over-ruling that decision. [265 D-266 C] Vashist Narain v.

 1201, reaffirmed.
 On the evidence in the present case it was difficult to hold that the petitioners had proved that the publication and distribution of the pamphlet materially affected the result of the election. It only leads to the conclusion that it probably did have some effect but the vast majority of the electors were able to throw off the effect of the pamphlet and vote according to their own personal wish or according to the mandate of their party. [269 B-C] 201 Per Bhargava, J. : Sub-section (1) of s. 171C in general terms makes any act an 'undue influence' if it interferes or attempts to interfere with the free exercise of any electoral right and if it is committed voluntarily. The electoral right according to the definition in s. 171A(b) is the right of a voter to vote or refrain from voting. Undue influence can be held to be committed if the person charged with the offence interferes or attempts to interfere with the free exercise of this right of voting or refraining from voting. When an elector exercises the right of voting it can be envisaged that he goes through the mental process of first taking a decision that he will vote in favour of a particular candidate and thereafter, having made up his mind, he has to go and exercise that electoral right by casting the vote in favour of the candidate chosen by him.
 The language used in s. 171C indicates that the offence of undue influence comes in at the second stage when the offender interferes or attempt-, to interfere with the free exercise of that choice of voting in accordance with the decision already taken by the voter. It, therefore, follows that if any acts are done which merely influence the voter in making his choice between one candidate or another, they will not amount to interference with the free exercise of the electoral right. In fact all canvassing that is carried on and which is considered legitimate is intended to influence the choice of a voter at the first stage and that is quite permissible. Once the choice has been made by the voter, there should be no interference with the free exercise by him of that choice by actually casting the vote, or in the alternative there may be cases where a voter may decide that he will not vote for any candidate at all but some acts are done which compel him to cast his vote. It is in such cases that the offence of undue influence will be held to have been committed.
 The language used in the definition of undue influence implies that an offence of undue influence will be held to have been committed if the elector having made up his mind to cast a vote for a particular candidate does not do so because 'of the act of the offender, and this can only be if he is under the threat or fear of some adverse consequence.
 Whenever any threat of adverse consequences is given it will tend to divert the elector from freely exercising his electoral right by voting for the candidate chosen by him for the purpose. In a case where the voter is threatened with an injury as defined in the Indian Penal Code, it has to be deemed under s. 171C (2) (a) that it interferes with the free exercise of the electoral right of the voter and the same applies if the elector is induced or attempt is made to induce him to believe that he or any person in whom he is interested will become or will be rendered an object of divine displeasure or of spiritual censure. There can, however, be cases where the threat may not he of an injury as defined in s. 44 I.P.C., where the harm caused must be illegal. [320 H-321 C] Mere propaganda against a candidate cannot be held to be exercise of undue influence. The word free is used in s.
 171C I.P.C. as qualifying ,exercise' and not as 'qualifying' the word 'vote'. If undue influence bad been interference with the exercise of free vote, possibly the definition could have been construed as indicating that influence brought on the mind of a voter so as to change the manner of his voting by affecting his choice and judgment in selecting the candidate for whom he is going to cast his vote would be comprised within undue influence. The word free having been used as qualifying the word 'exercise' gives the indication that the freedom envisaged is to cast the vote in accordance with the choice already arrived at and. if such freedom of casting the vote in that manner is interfered with the offence of undue influence will be held to have been committed.
 [322 A-C] The subject of influence at the stage of making a choice was dealt with 202 in Ch. IXA of the Indian Penal Code under a separate and distinct provision which is contained in s. 171G. This section clearly recognises, that, at elections, there is bound to be propaganda in which candidates or their supporters may be issuing statements so as to influence the voters against their rival candidates, and it limits the prohibition by law to only those statements of fact which are false, or believed to be false, or believed not to be true, in relation to the personal character or conduct of any candidate. These false statements about the personal character and conduct of the candidate may of course be scurrilous and foul, but even then, the offence committed would fall under s. 171G I.P.C. which makes the offence punishable with the fine only. On, the other hand, an offence of undue influence as .defined in s. 171C I.P.C. has been made punishable under s. 171F I.P.C. with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to one year or with fine, or with both. If it is held that false propaganda against personal character or conduct of a candidate can amount to undue influence the person indulging in that propaganda would become liable to punishment under s. 171F I.P.C. which has been considered a more serious offence by being made punishable with imprisonment in addition to, or, in the alternative with fine. This interpretation would thus make S. 171G I.P.C., totally ineffective and otiose. If the false statements as to personal character or conduct are held to be punishable under s. 171F as constituting the offence of undue influence, there would be no point in prosecuting the same person for the less serious offence under s. 171G. [323 C- 324 A] In the Representation of the People Act, 1951 also, undue influence is ,defined in almost the same language as that contained in s. 171@C ]I.P.C. In that Act an election can be declared void not only on the ground of commission of the corrupt practice of undue influence, but also on the ground ;of publication of false propaganda as to the personal character or conduct of a candidate. Parliament, however, chose not to include any such provision in Act 31 of 1952 which was passed when the Representation of the People Act, 1951 had already been enacted and enforced. The omission may be deliberate or accidental but, in either case, it is not for the court to attempt to fill up this gap by enlarging the meaning to be given to the expression 'undue influence, which is the corrupt practice included in the Act as a ground for setting aside the election. It is clear from the scheme of Ch. IXA of the Indian Penal Code that false propaganda as to the personal character and conduct of a candidate was created as a separate offence and the definition given in s. 171C of undue influence was not in- tended to lay down that such propaganda will amount to interference with the free exercise of electoral right so as to constitute undue influence. [324 F-325 A] Case law referred to.
 (b) In the present case the contents of the pamphlet in question did not contain any threat of a nature which would constitute undue influence as explained above. But even on the assumption that the publication of this pamphlet could constitute undue influence the election of the respondent was not liable to be set aside because it had not been proved that the distribution by post or in the Central Hall of Parliament was with connivance of the respondent or had materially affected the result of the election. [337 B-F] Per Mitter, J.-The only difference between the Act of 1951 and the Act of 1952 lies in the fact that under the latter Act corrupt practice of bribery and undue influence by one who was not a party to the election or his agent are also brought in. But the nature and character of undue influence under both the Acts remains the same. There is no reason for taking the view that what would not be undue influence under the Act of 1951 can become one under the Act of 1952.
 [354 F-G] 203 If publication of any defamatory matter relating to a candidate was to, be treated as a direct or indirect interference or an attempt to interference with the exercise of any electoral right-under the wide words of s. 171C(1), there would have been no occasion for the legislature to provide for it separately under s. 123(4) of the Act of 1951. The same position would obtain under the Act of 1952, and before any publication of defamatory matter relating to a candidate can be treated as commission of the offence of undue influence there must be some overt act in addition to the mere publication, some attempt or persuasion of a voter to restrain the free choice of a candidate before, the law of undue influence is excited. [354H-355B] The decided cases are sufficient to reject the respondent's contention that in under to establish undue influence it must be shown that there was .some threat to a voter or at least an element of complusion in the appeal to him. The cases also show that it would. be futile to. attempt to lay down a simple test applicable to all sets of facts and circumstances where undue influence is alleged to have been exercised. It can however be said that an attempt on the part of anybody to deflect a voter's will away from a parti- cular candidate by creating prejudice against or hatred for him, as for instance by casting false aspersions on his personal conduct and character whether by spoken words or in writing may be sufficient for the purpose of establishing the commission of undue influence., Much would however de- pend on the nature of the attempt, the position of the person making it, and the manner in which it is made. The mere publication by postal despatch of an anonymous but scurrilous pamphlet relating to the personal character of a candidate to voters all and sundry might attract the operation of s. 171G of the Indian Penal Code but would fall short of s. 171C. But if such a pamphlet is pressed upon voters and methods of inducement applied to them, specially by others who are equally interested in the election, different considerations may well arise. In such a case a court of law may legitimately hold that the disseminators of the pamphlet were attempting to canalise or force the will of others away from the person whose character was assailed.
 [263 B-F] Case-law referred to.
 (b) There can be no doubt that a charge of undue influence is in the nature of a criminal charge and must be proved by cogent and reliable evidence not on the mere ground of balance of probability but on reasonable certainty that the persons charged therewith have committed the offence, on the strength of evidence which leaves no scope for doubt as to whether they had done so. Although the re are inherent differences between the trial of an election petition and that of a criminal charge in the matter of investigation, the vital point of identity for the two trials is that the court must be able to come to the conclusion beyond any reasonable doubt as to the commission of the corrupt practice. However onerous the task of the court may be because of the partisan nature of the witnesses it cannot reject the oral evidence adduced merely on that ground, but it has to examine the same carefully and come to a conclu- sion whether the evidence establishes the corrupt practice beyond reasonable doubt. Even in a criminal trial the court can hold a person guilty of a crime on the strength of evidence of partisan witnesses if they are found to be reliable although there may be no independent corroboration thereof and there is no reason to depart from that principle in the trial of an election petition where charges of offences culpable under the Indian Penal Code are levelled. [366 F-367 G] Case-law referred to.
 (b) In the present case although the pamphlet in question was defamatory, the evidence fell short of any personal appeal through the means of the pamphlet and it could not be held that the offence of undue influence 204 distribution may attract culpability under s. 171G of the Indian Penal Code but would not per se attract s. 171C. [380 D] (b) Per Bhargava, J. (Sikri, Shelat, Mitter and Vaidialingam, JJ. concurring) :
 The contention that Part III of the Act is ultra vires Art.
 71 (1) of the Constitution on the ground that it purports to curtail the jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme Court to enquire into and decide all doubts and disputes arising out of or in connection with the election of a President or Vice-President by laying down certain limitations such as the grounds on which only the election of a President may be challenged in an election petition, cannot be accepted. A similar contention was rejected by this Court in Dr. N. B.
 Khare's case. Even if it is accepted that Art.- 71(1) lays down the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, the manner in which that jurisdiction is to be exercised can only be regulated by an Act of Parliament passed in exercise of its power under Art. 71(3). In exercise of the power to regulate all matters relating to or connected with the election of a President or Vice-President, Parliament clearly had the power of laying down the grounds on which the election can be challenged and set aside, in addition to other matters relating to the election. [295 B-297 B] Dr. N. B. Khare v. Election Commission of India, [1957] INSC 83; [1958] S.C.R. 648, applied.
 The fact that Art. 71(1) does not contain a provision corresponding to that in Art. 329(b) which specifically mentions a law made for calling in question an election by an election petition, could not lead to an inference in support of the petitioner's argument. Article 329(b) is a provision which lays down a limitation on the manner in which an election can be called in question, while the procedure for calling in question the election, as well as the grounds on which the election can be called in question, can only be laid down by Parliament by a law passed under Art. 327. In the case of Art. 71, it appears that no need was felt of making a provision similar to Art. 329(b) when Mt. 71(1) itself laid down the limitation that all doubts and disputes arising out of or in connection with the election of a President or Vice-President are to be inquired into and decided by the Supreme Court whose decision shall be final. [297 C-G] (ii) On the above finding that Part III is not ultra vires, the contention that the petitioners were entitled to challenge the election on grounds other than those mentioned in s. 18 of the Act, must also fail. 1315 HI (iii) The power of making rules conferred on the Central Government by s. 21 of the Act is subject to two principles of guidance. One is that the rules are to be made after consulting the Election Commission, and the second is that the Rules must be such as are needed for carrying out the purposes of the Act. Such power being already limited by the purposes of the Act cannot be held to be unguided or even arbitrary, even though Parliament did not choose to lay down the requirement that the Rules framed must be laid on the table of the two Houses of Parliament and should be subject to modification or annulment within a specific period. in fact, Parliament all the time has power of altering the Rules by amending the Act itself in case it disapproves any of the Rules made by the Government, while any Rule, which is shown to have been made in contravention of the provisions of the Act, would be declared void by the Court not on the ground that there was excessive delegation of legislative power, but that it goes beyond the scope of the power conferred 205 on the Government under s. 21 of the Act. Section 21 of the Act cannot therefore be held to be void on any ground. [298 B-G] (iv) The contention that r. 4(1) of the Presidential & Vice- Presidential Rules 1952 is beyond the rule making power of the Government under s. 21 of the Act 31 of 1952 has no force. Clause (d) of subs. (2) of s. 21 lays down that the Rules made under that section may, in particular, and without prejudice to the generality of the power granted under sub-s. (1), provide for the form and manner in which nominations may be made and the procedure to be followed in respect of the presentation of nomination papers; and the requirement that a certified copy of the entry showing that the candidate being nominated is an elector for a Parliamentary constituency which alone makes him eligible to stand as a candidate for the office of President or Vice- President must accompany the nomination paper falls squarely within this clause. This requirement relates to the manner of proving that the candidate is an elector in a Parliamentary constituency. In any case, this provision in r. 4(1) would be fully covered by s. 21(1) of the Act inasmuch as the requirement is for no other purpose except of ensuring a smooth and proper election to the office of President or Vice-President which object can be achieved by enabling the Returning Officer to ensure that candidates, whose nominations are accepted by him, are eligible for election. [299 C-F] Ranjit Singh v. Pritam Singh & Ors. [1966] INSC 39; [1966] 3 S.C.R. 543 applied.
 The election to the office of a President or Vice-President may not coincide with or be very close to the time when there is general revision of the electoral rolls, so that the electoral roll printed or published nearabout the time of general election,, may be out of date by the time the election for the office of a President or Vice-President is held. The publishes electoral roll may therefore be misleading if it is allowed to be filed before the Returning Officer to show eligibility in the case of a Presidential or Vice-Presidential election. That seems to be the reason why r. 4(1) lays down that a certified copy of the entry alone will be the proper manner of satisfying the Returning Officer of the eligibility of the candidate. The rule is therefore neither arbitrary nor unreasonable.
 Accordingly r. 4(1) must be held to be valid. Rule 4(2) which prescribes the consequence for non-compliance with the requirement of r. 4(1) must also be held to be valid as it is intended merely to make the valid r. 4(1) effective. [301 F] (v) The submission that s. 5(2) should be read as conferring any right either on the candidate or on the electors in respect of signing of nomination papers cannot be accepted. Had there been an intention to confer a right on any of them the language would have been different giving such indication by laying down what the candidate and the electors are entitled to do in respect of a nomination paper. Obviously, s. 5 only lays down the essential ingredients of the process of nomination, leaving the details of the manner of nomination to be filled up by Rules made by the Government under s. 21 of the Act. Rule 4(3) which requires that no elector shall subscribe whether as proposer or seconder, more than one nomination paper at any election, is thus, supplementary to s. 5(2) as containing a more detailed direction in respect of filing of nomination papers. [302 D-303A] The fact that there is no ban in s. 5(2) of the Act on an elector signing more than one nomination paper as a proposer or a seconder does not, therefore, mean that r. 4(3) of the Rules could not have been 206 competently made by the Government Rule 4(3) on the face of it contains a very reasonable direction. If there is only one vacancy for which election is to be held, an elector can reasonably be expected to nominate only one candidate as proposer and put him forward before the other electors as a suitable person to be chosen. Similarly, when seconding a nomination paper, an elector indicates his preference for that candidate to the general electorate which is to cast votes at the election. If the indication of such choice is restricted to as many candidates as there are vacancies, the provision is, on the face of it salutary and conducive to proper election. [303 H-304 B] The historical background of the Rules relating to elections in India also bears out that such a provision has always been considered desirable. A similar provision exists in the Rules governing elections in England. [304 C-305 D] In the circumstances it must be held that r. 4(3) of the Rules was validly made by the Government in exercise of its rule making power under s. 21 of the Act; that Rule being valid r. 6(3) (c) of the Rules which is consequential, must also be held to be valid. [305 H] Amolak Chand v. Raghuvir Singh, [1968] INSC 44; [1968] 3 S.C.R. 246, referred to.
 (vi) The entry in the electoral roll showing a candidate as being above 35 years of age has little value when the candidate's own statement to the Returning Officer as to his date of birth shows that he is below 35 years of age. [306 E-F] (vii) There is nothing in the Rules framed under the Act or under the Representation of the People Act, 1950 and Rules framed thereunder, requiring that a certified copy of the electoral roll must necessarily be issued by either an Electoral Registration Officer or an Assistant Electoral Registration Officer. Every government servant, who has custody of a document, is competent to issue certified copies of that document. [308 B] (viii) When the Act was enacted in 1952, the law in India, as administered by various Election Tribunals, was clear that the order in which signatures are made on a nomination paper by the candidate the proposer and the seconder is immaterial and no nomination paper would be invalid it the signatures are made by the candidate before the pro-Act must be presumed to know that this was the law as interpreted in India and consequently, when the language incorporated in s. 5(2) of the Act was used, it must have been intended that nomination papers would not be invalid by reason of the candidate making his signature before the proposer and the seconder. [312 C-E] Therefore, in the present case, the nomination papers of the candidate who signed his nomination paper before the proposer and the seconder as well as those of the candidate who signed his nomination paper before his seconder, were rightly accepted, [312 F] Case-law referred to.

Territories and therefore the elected members of the Legislative Assemblies of the Union Territories are also to be included in the Electoral College, must be rejected. [313 D-E] It is true that under Art. 367, the General Clause,; Act applies for interpretation of the Constitution as it applies for the interpretation of ,in Act of the Legislature of the Dominion of India but that Act has been applied as it stood an 26th January, 1950 when the Constitution 207 came into force subject only to any adaptations and modifications that may be made therein under Art. 372. The General Clauses Act as it was defined State so as to include a Union Territory. This was done by Art. 372 A which was introduced by the Constitution 7th Amendment Act, 1956. The new definition of State in s. 3(5) of the General Clauses Act as a result of the modifications and adaptations under Art. 372(A) would, no doubt, apply to the interpretation of all laws of Parliament but it cannot apply to the interpretation of the Constitution because Art. 367 was not amended and it was not laid down that the General Clauses Act as adapted and modified under any Article other than Art. 372 will also apply to the interpretation of the Constitution since its amendment in 1956. Since, until its amendment in 1956, Section 3(58) of the General Clauses Act did not define 'State' as including Union Territories for purposes of interpretation of Art. 54, the Union Territories cannot be treated as included in the word 'State. [313 E-314 B] Further the members of Houses known as Legislative Assemblies under Art., 168 can be members of the Electoral College under Art. 54. in the case of Union Territories the provision for legislatures is contained in Art. 239A but that Article does not mention that any house of the legislature created for any Union Territories will be known as Legislative Assembly. All that that Article lays down is that Parliament may by law create a body whether elected or partly nominated or partly elected to function as a Legislature in the Union Territory. Such a Legislature created by Parliament is not a, Legislative Assembly as contemplated under Art. 168 or Art. 54. Members of Legislatures created for Union Territories under Art. 239A cannot, therefore be held to be members of Legislative Assemblies of States. They were, therefore, rightly excluded from the Electoral College. [314 C-E] (x) On the face of it the argument that s. 5(2) of the Act contravenes Art. 58 or any other Article of the Constitution has no force at all. The requirement laid down by Parliament that every person must be nominated by two electors as proposer and seconder is a reasonable requirement relating to regulation of election to the office of President and cannot be held to be a curtailment of the right of a candidate to stand as candidate under Art. 58.
 [315 E] (xi) If in fact a licence had been granted to a private limited company with the specific purpose of obtaining the vote of an electors for the respondent, that could constitute bribery. However from the evidence led on this issue on behalf of the petitioners themselves no case at all of commission of the offence of bribery during the election period could possibly be established. [316 G-H] (C) Per Sikri, Shelat and Vaidialingam, JJ. (Bhargava and Mitter, JJ. Concurring)-The parties must bear their own costs., The pamphlet had been sent by post and distributed in the Central Hall and this justified the petitioners in bringing the two main petitions. Most of the evidence which was led in court dealt with the question of the distribution of the pamphlet. Further, a number of witnesses had not told the whole truth. It was distressing to see truths being sacrificed at the altar of political advantage by these witnesses. [288 B-C]
