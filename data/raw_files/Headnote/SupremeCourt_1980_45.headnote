 In the money suit filed by the appellant-plaintiff to recover the value of tobacco sold to respondent-defendant after the four cheques covering the value of tobacco and issued by latter bumped, the defendant took a plea of nonexistence of privity of contract and while admitting both the receipt of the tobacco from and issuance of cheques to plaintiff, explained the tobacco had been supplied to defendant by the plaintiff at the instance of another Firm R. K. Patel with whom the defendant had placed the order for the supply of the tobacco and that the four cheques were issued in favour of plaintiff at the instance of Firm "R. K.
 Patel", in respect of another transaction for the supply by that Firm of 900 bags of tobacco, which transaction later failed.
 The Trial Court decreed the suit after rejecting the evidence and pleadings of the defendant. In appeal the High Court reversed the judgment and set aside decree of the trial Court.
 Allowing the appeal by certificate, the Court ^ 
 HELD : Supply of the goods by the plaintiff to the defendant and the issuance of cheques by the latter in favour of the former shifted the onus of proof on the point of privity of contract to the defendant. The fact that the goods had been sent to the defendant by the plaintiff and had been received by the former was admitted on all hands and was sufficient to raise a presumption, till the contrary was proved, that an order had been placed for the supply of the goods with the plaintiff by the defendant firm. The plaintiff could thus bank on the said fact for the purpose of discharging the initial onus which lay on him to prove the privity of contract between the parties and it was for the defendant to rebut the presumption which the fact raised. [27 G-H, 28 A] (ii) The books of account maintained by the defendant being the best evidence available in proof of the stand of the defendant firm that no order had been placed by it with the plaintiff the failure of the defendant to place on record those books is a clincher. Non production of these books by the defendant raises a presumption against it that if such evidence had been produced, the same would have gone against the case propounded by it, more 23 so when the defendant fails to bring witnesses to the transactions set up by it into witness-box and examine them.
