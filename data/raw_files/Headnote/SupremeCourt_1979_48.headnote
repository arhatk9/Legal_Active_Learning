 Sections 43C and 88 of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 exempted certain lands from the operation of the Act. Section 43C provided that nothing in s. 32 to s. 32R (both inclusive) and s. 43 shall apply to lands in the "area within the limits" of a Municipal Corporation constituted under the Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporations Act, 1948. The Gujarat Amendment Act, 1965 substituted the words "areas which on the date of coming into force of the Amending Act, 1956 and within the limits of" for the words "areas within the limits of" occurring in the original section. Similarly s. 88(1) (b) conferred power on the State Government to exempt land from the operation of the provision of the Act which the State Government may, from time to 1 time, by notification in the official Gazette, specify as being reserved for non- agricultural or industrial development. The Amendment Act, 36 of 1965 engrafted a proviso to cl. (b) of s. 88(1), providing that if after a notification in respect of any area specified in the notification is issued under the said clause, whether before or after the commencement of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1965 the limits of the area so specified are enlarged on account of the addition of any other area thereto, then, merely by reason of such addition the reservation as made by the notification so issued shall not apply and shall be deemed never to have applied to the area so added.
 The appellant was the owner of survey No. 165 situated within the revenue limits of village Acher near Ahmedabad.
 For sometime prior to 1946 the respondent had been a tenant of this land. By virtue of the provisions of the Bombay Tenancy Act, 1939 the respondent became a protected tenant and continued to be so under the Tenancy Act, 1948. The Amendment Act of 1956 provided for the transfer of ownership of the land from the landlord to the tenant by operation of law. The day was styled as tillers' day. Under this section every tenant was deemed to have purchased from his landlord free from all encumbrances subsisting thereon on the tillers' day the land held by him as tenant. By virtue of this provision the tenant claimed himself to be the owner of the land On August 9, 1956 the Government issued a notification specifying the area within the limits of the Municipal Corporation of Ahmedabad as being reserved for urban non- agricultural and industrial development. This notification was superseded by another notification dated the 14th February, 1957 by which the Government specified, amongst others, the areas within the limits of the Municipal Corporation of the city of Ahmedabad as being reserved for the above mentioned purpose. Subsequently the Government extended the limits of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation by reason of which survey 330 No. 165 which was formerly outside the Municipal limits, was included within the area of the Municipal Corporation of Ahmedabad as from May 30, 1959.
 In an inquiry by the Agricultural Lands Tribunal for determining the purchase price of the land the appellant- landlord contended before the Tribunal that in view of s.88(1)(b) read with the notification of February 14, 1957 the land (survey No. 165) was exempt from the operation of the 1948 Act and that the inquiry should be dropped. This contention was negatived and the appeal by the landlord failed. In revision preferred by the landlord, the Revenue Tribunal was of the opinion that not merely the lands which were in the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation area at the date of the notification would be exempted from the operation of the Tenancy Act but the exemption would also extend to the lands brought within the Corporation area from time to time without any fresh notification for reservation.
 In the respondents-tenants' writ petition the High Court held that the exemption would apply only to the lands included within the limits of the Municipal Corporation as on the date of the notification and in the absence of fresh reservation by a fresh notification the land included in the Municipal area on extension of the limits of the Municipal Corporation subsequent to the notification would not enjoy the exemption from the operation of the Tenancy Act.
 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: 1 (a) From the language of the amendments made in s. 43C and s.88(1)(b) it is clear that both the amendments are retroactive from August 1, 1956 i.e. from the date the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands (Amendment) Act 1956 came into force. In other words the amended s.43C and s.
 88(1)(b) with its proviso will have to be read as if they have been introduced in their amended form from August 1, 1956. [336 A-B] (b) The land of survey No. 165 would be governed by the Tenancy Act, 1948. The land which was originally within the revenue limits of the village was included in the area of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation from May 30, 1959. When the amended s. 43C and s. 88(1) (b) with its proviso came into force on August 1, 1956, the land not being in the Municipal Corporation area, would not enjoy the exemption as conferred on the land within the Municipal Corporation area by the notification issued on August 9, 1956 superseded by the subsequent notification of February 14, 1957. [336D-E] 2(a) The respondent was a tenant on the tillers' day and has by operation of law become the owner and a deemed purchaser. [338 F] (b) The land (Survey No. 165) was not within the Municipal Corporation area either on February 14, 1957, the date on which the exemption was granted or on August 1, 1956 when Bombay Act XIII of 1956 was put into operation or on April 1, 1957 the tillers' day when title to land would stand transferred to the tenant by sheer operation of law without anything more. Therefore the Notification dated February 14, 1957 would not cover the land which was at the date of the issue of the Notification not included in Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation area. Subsequent extension of the area of Municipal Corporation would not ipso facto qualify the lands falling within the extended area for exemption in view of the proviso to s.88(1)(b) and the opening word of s. 43C, both of which clearly recite that the exemp- 331 tion would apply to the land included in the Municipal Corporation area on August 1, 1956, the date on which the Bombay Act 13, 1956 came into force and not to any subsequently added area to the area of Municipal Corporation. Since the land was brought within the Municipal Corporation area after August 1, 1956 the Notification dated February 14, 1957 would not cover such added or extended area and there would be no exemption under that Notification for the land in the extended area. [338B-E] (c) The ratio in the decisions in Mohanlal Chunilal Kothari v. Tribhovan Haribhai Tamboli [1962] INSC 186; [1963] 2 S.C.R. 707 and Sidram Narasappa Kamble v. Sholapur Borough Municipality [1965] INSC 169; [1966] 1 S.C.R. 618 would not apply because those cases turned upon the construction of s.88(1)(b) as it stood at the relevant time. Presumably in order to combat the effect of some judgments which purported to lay down that the exemption once granted would apply to any area that may be included in the Corporation area at a date much later to the date of the issue of the Notification, the amendment of s.
 88(1)(b) was made. The law having undergone substantive amendment bearing on the subject, the earlier decision would be of no assistance. [339 A-D] Mohanlal Chunilal Kothari v. Tribhovan Haribhai Tamboli [1962] INSC 186; [1963] 2 S.C.R. 707 and Sidram Narasappa Kamble v. Sholapur Borough Municipality [1965] INSC 169; [1966] 1 S.C.R. 618 held inapplicable.
