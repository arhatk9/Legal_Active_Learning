 The respondents held from the appellant certain land on Mokurrari tenure (permanent lease) created under a registered instrument dated October 29, 1885. According to the said document the proprietor was competent to cancel the lease in the event of a default in the payment of 'four successive kists by the tenure holder. On the failure of the respon-dents to pay four successive kists the appellant on June 22, 1953 served -on them a notice terminating and cancelling the Mokurrari tenure. During the pendency of the suit which was filed by the appellant in September 1953 it was declared that the Mokurrari tenure became vested in the 'State of Bihar with effect from July 26, 1954 under the provisions of the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950. The plaint was amended and certain parties were added. The appellant claimed that he was entitled to the ,entire compensation which was to be 'received from the State. The trial court held that on account of the failure of the appellant to give a notice to the respondents under s. 155 of the Bihar Tenancy Act, 1885 the respondents continued to be the tenure holders till the tenure vested in the 'State and therefore the appellant was not entitled to the full compensation. Me High Court upheld the order of the trial court. In appeal by certificate the appellant relied on s. 10 of the Act which it was claimed made s. 155 inapplicable in a case like the present, where the contract was made before the Act of 1885.
 
HELD:Section 10 simply provides that the holder of a permanent tenure shall not be ejected except on the ground that he has broken a condition on breach of which he is liable to be ejected under the terms of the contract.
 Section 178(1)(c) says categorically that even though the contract has been made before the passing of the Act the landlord -cannot eject a tenant otherwise than in accordance with its provisions. Section 155 places a bar against a suit being entertained unless the requirements laid down therein have been satisfied. Therefore even though under s.
 10 -the appellant became entitled to eject the respondents on 'account of the breach of the condition relating to payment of rent the condition prece,dent for a suit being entertained by a court was the notice served in the prescribed manner specifying the breach which was capable of remedy and in which the tenant should have been required to remedy the same or in any case to pay -reasonable compensation for the breach. If the tenant had failed to comply within a reasonable time with that request then alone the suit was maintainable. Even if under the proviso to s.
 10 the contract which was entered into before the commencement of the Act could contain conditions which were inconsistent with the provisions of the Act that did not dispense with the requirements of s. 155 of the Act 82 7 which had to be satisfied before any suit could be entertained. As the notice which had been served by the appellant did not comply with 'the provisions of s. 155 the courts below -rightly negatived his claim to the entire compensation money. [829 C-G]
