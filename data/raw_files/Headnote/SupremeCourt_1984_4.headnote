 The respondents filed a suit for recovery of possession of the premises from the appellant after termination of his licence. The appellant claimed title by adverse possession.
 The High Court held that mere termination of the licence of a licencee does not enable the licence to claim adverse possession, unless and until he sets up a title hostile to that of the licencer after termination of his licence, and decreed the suit for possession.
 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD : 1. There must be some overt act on the part of the licencee indicating assertion of hostile title. Mere continuance of unauthorised possession even for a period of more than 12 years is not enough. [288 D] 
 2. It is not merely unauthorised possession on termination of his licence that enables the licencee to claim title by adverse possession but there must be some overt act on the part of the licencee to show that he is claiming adverse title. It is possible that the licencor may not file an action for the purpose of recovering possession of the premises from the licencee after terminating his licence but that by itself cannot enable the licencee to claim title by adverse possession. [288 C] In the instant case, the High Court was right in taking the view that the appellant had not established any title by adverse possession, and that the suit of the first respondent for recovery of possession of the premises from the appellant was not barred under Article 65 of the Limitation Act, 1963.
