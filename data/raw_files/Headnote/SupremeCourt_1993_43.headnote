 The husband of the petitioner died in a road accident. His father, wife and minor daughter moved a petition before the Motor Accidents Claim Tribunal claiming a compensation of Rs. 1,50,000. The tribunal ordered payment of Rs. 26,000 and apportioned the amount amongst the widow, minor daughter and father at Rs. 12,000, Rs. 10,000, and Rs. 4,000 respectively. The Tribunal also ordered payment of interest @ 6% from the date of application.
 The appeals riled by both the parties were dismissed by the High Court. However, it enhanced the interest from 6% to 9%. The widow and minor daughter of the deceased preferred the present appeal against the judgment of the High Court.
 Allowing the appeal, this Court, 
HELD : 1. There was no evidence before the tribunal to show that the deceased was addicted to drinking. The tribunal fell into patent error in fixing the dependency of the claimants on the deceased to the extent of Rs. 150 per month on the ground that he was a drunkard and as such was spending more amount on himself than on his family. [324B-C] 
2. From the evidence on the record it can safely be concluded that the deceased was spending Rs. 300 per month on his family and running the house-hold. On the date of the accident, the deceased was 26 years of age. The father of the deceased was aged about 70 years in 1985 when the special leave petition was riled. Longevity in the family can, therefore, be 322 assumed. The tribunal did not give any allowance for the future increments and promotional chances of the deceased.
 No compensation was awarded for the loss of consortium.
 Keeping In view all these facts and circumstances it would be just and proper to allow 24 years multiplier, as against the multiplier of 17 adopted by the Tribunal. On this basis a sum of Rs. 86,000 is awarded as compensation to the three claimants. They shall also be entitled to Interest @ 12% from the date of application before the tribunal. Since the compensation is being enhanced by this Court after about 15 years of the accident, there is no question of making any deductions on any score. The sum of Rs. 86,000 shall be apportioned by paying Rs. 40,000 to the minor daughter, Rs.
 30,000 to the widow of the deceased and Rs. 16,000 to the father of the deceased. [324E-H]
