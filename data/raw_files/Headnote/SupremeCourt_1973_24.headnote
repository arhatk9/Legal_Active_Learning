 In respect of the assessment year 1948-49 the Income-tax Officer's finding that the assessee was 'resident but not ordinarily resident' in that year in India was confirmed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the Tribunal. It was also held that a sum of Rs. 2 lakhs remitted by the assessee to India from Burma during the relevant period formed part of the assessee's accrued profits. The High Court answered both the questions in favour of the Revenue.
 The assessee appealed with certificate.
 
HELD : (i) For the finding that the assessee was 'resident' but 'not ordinarily resident' in the year in question the authorities under the Act as well as the High Court had relied on the fact that the assessee has failed to prove his visit to India in 1947 was casual or occasional. This was essentially a finding of fact. [501B-C] The burden of proving that the assessee's visit to India in 1947 was occasional or casual was on the assessee. In the affidavit filed by him before the Department he merely stated that he visited India for a period of two months in 1947 but did not state the reason for visiting India nor did he state his visit was occasional or casual. In the face of this affidavit it was idle for the assessee to contend that the Tribunal came to an erroneous conclusion in holding that he did not discharge the burden of proving that his visit to India in 1947 was occasional or casual. The fact that the assessee had no business in India during the period of stay of two months did not discharge the onus. [500 F-G; 501C-E] Commissioner of Income-tax, West Bengal v. B. K. Dhote, 66 I.T.R. 457, referred to.
 (ii) The assessee had also failed to prove that the sum of Rs. 2 lakhs remitted by him to India did not represent his business income. Even though the Income-tax Officer gave him several opportunities to produce his account books to establish his case he failed to produce the account books.
 [501 H] The complaint that the Tribunal ignored the photostat copies of the account books without good reasons did not appear to have been made in the application filed by the assessee under s. 66(1). The statement of' case submitted by the Tribunal does not refer to that fact. Admittedly the assessee did not take up any question regarding these documents. Hence the High Court was fully justified in not considering those documents. [502A-D]
