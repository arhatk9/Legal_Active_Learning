 In a partition suit the Arbitrator filed his award in the court and the judge adjourned the case for "the parties' say to the arbitrator's report." No notice in writing was given to the parties by the court of the filing of the award.
 Objection to the award was filed by the appellant beyond the period of limitation. The court ordered the award to be filed and decree to be drawn up in terms of the award as the objection filed was beyond the period of limitation.
 The appellant's case was that the period of limitation as under art. 158 of the Limitation Act, for an application to set aside the award, would run against him only from the date of service of the notice in writing of the filing of the award and as no notice in writing was issued by the Court to the appellant the time never began to run against him. The appellant also contended that as the court had refused to set aside the award the appeal was maintainable under S. 39(1)(VI) Of the Arbitration Act.
 Held, that the communication by the court to the parties or their counsel of the information that an award had been filed was sufficient compliance with the requirements of sub-s. (2) of s. 14 Of the Arbitration Act, with respect to the giving of the notice to the parties concerned, about the filing of the award. Notice does not necessarily mean "communication in writing". The expression "give notice" in sub-s.(2) of s. 14 Of the Arbitration Act simply means giving intimation of the filing of the Award. Such intimation need not be given in writing and could be communicated orally. That would amount to service of notice when no particular mode of service was prescribed.
 Held, further that where there was no objection before the court praying for setting aside the award, no question of refusing to set it aside could arise, and no appeal therefore was maintainable under s. 39(1)(VI) Of the Arbitration Act.
