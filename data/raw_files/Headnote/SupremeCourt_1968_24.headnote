 The Board of Revenue, Rajasthan. without recording a finding on the factum of respondent's adoption to the last holder of the jagir, rejected his claim to be recognised as the adopted son, on the around that, under the Matmi Rules, the adoption, without the previous sanction of the Ruler, could not be recognised for the purpose of determining succession to the jagir. In the writ petition filed by him, the High Court dealt- with the dispute on merits and, holding (a) that the Jaipur Matm Rules had no statutory force because the Ruler had not given his assent to them; (b) that on the death of the last holder without any issue the jagir would vest in the respondent if it was proved that he was adopted in accordance with the personal law of the last jagirdar;
 and (c) that rule 14(2) requiring the previous sanction of the Government of the State to adopt is prospective and could have no application to an adoption made before the Rules were promulgated, directed the Board to decide the case in accordance with the law declared by the High Court.
 The Board held that the respondent was proved to have been adopted by the last jagirdar and directed that he should be recognised as the jagirdar.
 In appeal to this Court, against the order of the Board of Revenue it was contended by the appellant, who claimed to have a preferential right to the jagir, that : (1) the Board of Revenue had no jurisdiction to decide the dispute relating to adoption as it was triable by a civil court, and (2) since the Jaipur Matmi Rules (Validation) Act, of 1961, was passed after the judgment of the High Court, the Board was bound to dispose of the matter in the light of the Rules.
 
HELD : (1) Under the Rajasthan Jagir Decisions and Proceedings (Validation) Act, 1955, the power to deal with and decide disputes relating to succession to jagir-estates was vested, in respect of proceedings pending at the date of the Act and instituted thereafter, in the Revenue Courts.
 Therefore, the Board of Revenue was competent to decide the question relating to the respondent's adoption, and its decision on the factum of adoption recorded on appreciation of evidence must be accepted. [852 D-E, HI (2) It was not open to the appellant to contend that the right of the respondent, as the adopted son, to the jagir had to be decided by the Board on the basis of the Matmi Rules and not in accordance with the personal law of the last jagirdar.
 (a) Though the State legislature enacted the Validation Act, declaring that the Matmi Rules 'shall have and shall be deemed always to have had, the force of law and shall be treated as being and as having been an existing jagir law within the meaning of s. 2(d) of the Rajasthan Land Reforms and Resumption of Jagirs Act, 1952, notwithstanding anything 849 contained in any judgment of any court, the Act did not supersede the judgment of the High Court and therefore, the Board was incompetent to consider and decide the question whether the Government may, in the absence of its previous sanction, refuse to recognise the adoption of the respondent on the basis of the Matmi Rules. [854 A-C] (b) According to the personal law applicable to the last jagirdar, the respondent could have been adopted by him and the finding of the High Court that the jagir would vest in the respondent as the adopted son in accordance with such personal law operated as res judicata and could not be reopened before the Board of Revenue; and, it was not open to the appellant to contend in the appeal to this Court that the decision of the high Court on questions decided in the writ petition was erroneous. The order of the High Court on the writ petition was not an interlocutory order. [854 E-G] (c) Rule 14(2) is on its terms prospective and the Validation Act does not give retrospective operation to the Matmi Rules. [853 F] (d) It could not be contended that the judgment of the High Court should not be treated as res judicata, on the ground that if it was regarded is binding between-the parties, the equal protection clause of the Constitution would be violated if another person similarly situated were to be differently treated by the Board of Revenue.
