 The four appellants along with K, were jointly tried and convicted for offences under s. 147 IPC. They all jointly appealed to the High Court by one memorandum of appeal. The High Court admitted the appeal on behalf of K, and dismissed in limine the appeal on behalf of the appellants.
 In appeal to this Court, the appellants challenged the order dismissing in limine the appeal on their behalf, when the appeal of K, co-accused, was admitted for hearing on merits after notice to the State.
 
HELD : When an appeal in the High Court raises a serious and substantial point which is prima facie arguable it is improper for that court to dismiss it summarily without giving some indication of its view on the points raised.
 The interest of justice and fairplay require the High Court in such cases to give an indication of its views on the points argued so that this Court, in the event of an appeal from that order being presented here, has the benefit of the High Court's opinion on those points. [527F] This was an eminently fit case in which, while admitting K's appeal, the appeal on behalf of the appellants was also admitted so that the appeals of all the five accused could be considered together. If K's defence was upheld, then the case against the appellants would also require serious consideration. The evidence on the record would have to be scrutinised at least for determining how far the case of the appellants is distinguishable from that of K. The charge of rioting under s. 147 IPC could only be sustained if an unlawful assembly was held to have been formed. It was, therefore, more appropriate to consider the case of all the accused together on appeal. On this ground also the order of the High Court. is open to objection. [528 G] Mushtak Hussein v.
