 The appellants are four public limited companies, all separately registered under the Indian Companies Act, and all producing iron and steel goods though of different type.
 They had a common General Manager who later became their Works Manager; they had a common time office, a common canteen and a common Labour officer. By one order of reference, certain industrial disputes between the appellants (described in the reference as first appellant and "their allied conerns) and their workmen, were referred for adjudication. All the companies were not interested in all the disputes. The Industrial Tribunal gave an award against the appellants. In appeal to this Court, the appellants contended that (i) as all,companies were not concerned in all items of dispute, one order of reference embracing all of them, should not have been made; (ii) the comprehensive order of gratuity binding on all the companies was bad as the Tribunal considered only balance sheets, and profit and loss accounts and other documents of the first appellant and did not have before it those of the other companies; (iii) Tribunal was wrong in holding that the retrenchment of a workman was illegal as s. 25F of the Act had not been complied with; and (iv) the award abolishing contract labour employed by one of the companies was wrong as it would place the said concern in a very disadvantageous position compared to other which did similar-kind of work.
 
HELD: (i) In order to find out whether there was sufficient functional integrality between the employers and whether it was proper to have one reference in respect of the four concerns which were separate entities in the eye of law, it was necessary to take an overall picture of their activities and the interest, if any, which they had in common. [395 G] The things the appellants had in common were sufficient to show a community of interest so far as industrial disputes were concerned. If then wages, the dearness allowance or benefit of gratuity or leave rules were altered in one without affecting the others, the industrial peace and harmony in the other establishments were bound to be disturbed. All the four concerns filed written statements which appear to have been drafted by the same draftsman, and same set of lawyers represented them. At no point of time was it ever shown to the Tribunal that there was any possi- bility of conflict of interest between them. Making separate orders of reference in the cases of the four establishments would only have multiplied costs enormously without any corresponding benefit to anybody. It was also patent from the course of the proceedings that it was only the first appellant which played a major part in the adjudication before the Tribunal. The other three concerns were content to abide by what was done by the first appellant.. [395 H; 396 A-B, H; 397 B] Wenger & Co. v. Their Workman, [1963] II L.J. 403 at 308 followed.

 (ii) The scheme of gratuity as framed was quite a reasonable one on the facts and figures presented by the first appellant. The three concerns were content to make the first appellant their mouthpiece in this respect or they must have felt that the facts and figures, if disclosed, would have been such as would go against them and they deliberately refrained from producing them.

 (iii) When a workman is asked to leave forthwith he bar.
 to be paid at the time when he is asked to go and cannot be asked to collect his dues afterwards.
 The notice, in this case, bore the date November 15, 1958, terminating services of the workman from November 17, and asking him to collect one month's wages in lieu of notice on November 20, 1958 or thereafter. So S. 25F had not been complied with [399 E] Bombay Union of Journalists v. The State of Bombay [1963] INSC 258; [1964] 6 S.C.R. 22. followed.
 (iv) There was no material before this Court to conclude that the direction for partial abolition of the employment of contract labour in one of the companies was wrong. The abolition of contract system of labour can be ordered by an Industrial 'Tribunal if the facts justify it. [400 D-E] Standard Vacuum Refining Co. of India v.
