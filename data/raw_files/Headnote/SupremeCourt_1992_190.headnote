 The appellant-government issued a notification dated 30.5.1978 under Section 2(i)(a) of the Rajasthan Colonisation Act, 1954 appointing the Colonisation tehsildars to perform the functions and exercise the powers of the Collector under Section 22 of the Act.
 The Colonisation Tehsildars initiated proceedings against various persons under section 22 of the Act and also passed orders of eviction from the lands under their possession.
 The aggrieved persons challenged the proceedings and the orders of eviction before the High Court filling writ petitions under Article 226/227 of the Constitution of India. They contended before the High Court that the notification dated 30.5.1978 was vague, ambiguous and did not confer any powers or functions of the Collector under Section 22 of the Act on the Tehsildars; and that the proceedings under Section 22 of the Act initiated by the Tehsildars were inherently without jurisdiction and as such were liable to be quashed.
 The Single Judge allowed the writ petitions.
 The appeals preferred by the State were dismissed by a Division 749 Bench of the High Court.
 Hence these appeals were filed by the State by special leave against the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court.
 On the question, whether the notification dated 30.5.1978 issued under section 2(i)(a) of the Rajasthan Colonisation Act, 1954 validly conferred the powers and the functions of the Collector under the Act upon the Colonisation Tehsildars, allowing the appeals of the State, this Court.
 
 HELD: 1.01. The notification dated May 30, 1978 is not happily worded. It shows the casual manner in which the government-documents are drafted. However, the wording of the notification fully conveys the intention of the State Government. [753G] 1.02. The manifest intention of the government, which can be spelled-out from the notification, is that all the powers under Section 22 of the Act have been delegated and conferred on the Colonisation Tehsildars in the State of Rajasthan. The expression `such' used in the notification twice, only indicates that the Colonisation Tehsildars, who have been given all the powers of the Collector under Section 22 of the Act, may exercise `such' of these powers as are necessary to be exercised in a given case before them. [754D] 2.01. Section 22 of the Act provides summary proceedings for the ejectment of tress-passers from government lands. Various sub-sections of Section 22 provide a scheme for getting the trespass on government lands vacated. In the nature of the provisions of Section 22 of the Act the proceedings under various sub-sections have to be initiated and action taken by the same authority. [753H- 754A] 2.02. The proceedings under section 22 of the Act being quasi judicial the authority entrusted with the powers of the Collector has to be invested with the powers under all the sub-sections to enable the said authority to proceed in accordance with the scheme of the Act. In that view of the matter there is no scope for conferring some of the powers under Section 22 on the Tehsildars and remaining to be left with the Collector. [754B] 2.03. The notification dated May 30, 1978 appointing the Colonisation Tehsildars in the State of Rajasthan to perform the functions and to 750 exercise the powers of the Collector under Section 22 of the Act is legal and valid. [754F] 
 3. While dealing with a notification it is permissible to iron-out the creases to clarify the manifest intention of the State Government in issuing the notification. [754E]
