 The appellant firm carried on business in Andhra Pradesh and was registered as a dealer under the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act 1957. In its return for the assessment year 1962-63 the firm claimed exemption of certain turnover on the ground that it had sent the goods to its commission agents and under the contract of agency the commission agents were empowered to pay sales-tax and had paid the same directly to the Sales Tax Department. When the Commercial Tax Officer sought to assess the appellant firm on the aforesaid turnover the appellant filed a writ petition in the High Court which was dismissed. In appeal before this Court by certificate it was contended : (i) that Explanation III to s. 2(1) (n) of the Act enlarged the scope of the word 'sale' by treating mere entrustment to an agent as a sale and therefore the Explanation was ,ultra vires, (ii) that the commission agents to whom the appellant had sent the goods for sale had already paid the tax and the appellant could not be taxed again on the same transaction as there was only one sale; (iii) that the Explanation was violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution as it made an arbitrary classification.
 
HELD : (i) The real effect of the third Explanation is to impose the tax only when there was a transfer of title to the goods and not where there is a mere contract of agency.
 The Explanation says in effect that when there is in reality a transfer of property by the principal to the agent and by the agent in his turn to the buyer there are two transactions of sale. The phrase "when the goods are transferred" in cls. (1) and (2) of Explanation III on a proper construction means "when title to the goods is transferred" and so construed it is impossible to say that the Explanation enlarges the scope of the main section.
 Explanation III is not. there fore ultra vires. [480 B-E] State of Madras v. Gannon Dunkerley & Co. (Madras) Ltd. 9 S.T.C. 353. referred to.
 (ii) As a matter of law there is a distinction between a contract of sale and a contract of agency by which the agent is authorised to sell or buy on behalf of the principal and make over either the sale proceeds or the goods to the principal. The essence of a contract of sale is the transfer of title to the goods for a price paid or promised to be paid. The transferee in such a case is liable to the transferor as a debtor for the price to be paid and not as agent for the proceeds of the sale. The essence of agency to sell is the delivery of the goods to a person who is to sell them, not as his own property but as the property of the principal who continues to be the owner of the goods, and will therefore be liable to account for the sale proceeds. The true relationship of the parties in 477 each case has to be gathered from the nature of the contract, its terms and conditions, and the terminology used by the parties is not decisive of the legal relationship.
 [480 G-481 B] Whether the transactions in the present case were sales or contracts of agency was a mixed question of law and fact and must be investigated with reference to the material which the appellant might be able to place before the appropriate authority. The question was not one which could be properly determined in an application under Art. 226 of the Constitu- tion. [482 B] W.T. Lamb and Sons v. Goring Brick Company, Limited [1932] K.B. 710, and Hutton v. Lippert [1883] 8 A.C. 309, referred to.
 (iii) The classification contemplated by the Explanation between sales through commission agents who account fully for all collections made and sales through commission agents who do not account for collections is based upon an intelligible differentia and it has a rational relationship with the object sought to be achieved by the statute. It did not therefore, violate Art. 14. [482 C-D]
