 The appellant and respondent were the tenant and land-lord of certain agricultural lands to which the Punjab Security of Land Tenures Act, 1953 applied. The appellant tried to avoid payment of rent for each year of the lease period (1951-1955), under one pretext or the other, and for every year recoveries of rent were only made through the court.
 After the period of lease expired, the appellant continued to hold over without paying rent. So the respondent filed two applications to the appropriate authorities, one for arrears of rent under s. 14A(ii) and the other for eviction under s. 14A(1), on the ground, inter alia, specified in s' 9(1) (ii) that the appellant had failed to pay the rent regularly, without sufficient cause. On the application for rent, the appellant was asked to pay the arrears which he did within the time fixed. The application for eviction was dismissed, but on appeal by the respondent, the appellant was ordered to be evicted. The appellant's further appeal application for revision and petition to the High Court under Arts. 226 and 227 of the Constitution were all dismissed.
 In the appeal to the Supreme Court it was contended that, (i) s. 9(1) (ii) applies only prospectively and therefore the conduct of the tenant, prior to the enactment of s. 14A in 1955, could not be taken into account for determining that there was not sufficient cause for non-payment, and (ii) as the appellant had paid the arrears within the time fixed he could not be ,evicted.
 HELD : Though the appellant could not be evicted under s.
 14A(ii) his case was covered by s. 14A(1) and his eviction could be ordered because, the irregularity in payment was patent and there was no sufficient cause. [42 A] The necessary condition for the application of s. 9 (1) (ii) may commence even before the Act came into force and past conduct which is as relevant for the clause as conduct after the coming into force of the Act, cannot be overlooked. A statute is not applied retrospectively merely because a part of the requisites for its action is drawn- from a moment prior to its passing. [41 A-C] The scheme of the Act shows that cls. (1) and (ii) of s. 14A are entirely different and that there is no inconsistency between them. Clause (ii) deals with eviction as punishment for non-compliance with an order to deposit arrears of rent within the time fixed for payment, whereas cl. (1) deals with eviction for any of ',he reasons given in s. 9(1), one of which is non-payment of rent regularly without sufficient cause, under s. 9(1) (ii) [41 D-E]
