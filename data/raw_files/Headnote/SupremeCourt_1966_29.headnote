 The Maharaja of Dumraon filed a rent suit against some of the sharers in a tenure held under him of certain lands and at the sale in execution the tenure was purchased by one L.
 N, the widow of one of the original co-sharers instituted a title suit. (No. 127 of 1939) for a dad that her share in the tenure was not affected by the execution sale During the pendency of this suit the Maharaja instituted a second rent suit against L and at the sale in execution of the decree the respondent purchased the tenure and obtained possession.
 The respondent was also impleaded as a party in N's suit and a preliminary decree was passed. Thereafter N died- and the appellant was substituted as the plaintiff in place of N on the ground that before her death N had made an oral gift of her share to him. A final decree was then passed and the appellant obtained possession of the land dispossessing the respondent. The respondent then instituted title suit No.
 126 of 1944 against the appellant and others for a declaration that the decree passed in suit No. 127 of 1939 was not binding upon her. The case was disposed of by a compromise de whereby the respondent's name was expunged from the category of defendants in suit No. 127 though the decree was to stand in other respects. The respondent then applied for restitution of the land under s. 144 of the Code of Civil Procedure and obtained possession.
 The appellant thereafter filed the present suit against the respondent and others for a declaration of his title to the land and contended, inter alia, (i) that by the doctrine of lis pendens the respondent was constructively bound by the final decree in suit No. 127 of 1939 in the presence of her predecessor-in-title L; and (ii) the decree conclusively declared his title to the land on the basis of the oral gift a to him by N.
 The trial court decreed the appellants suit but on appeal to the High Court the decree was set aside. On appeal to this Court, 
HELD: The appellant had no title to the suit property and the High Court had rightly dismissed the suit.
 The purpose of the compromise decree in 'suit No. 126 of 1944 was that the respondent's name should be expunged from the array of parties in suit No. 127 of 1939 so that she should not be bound by the decree in that suit either actually or constructively.
 An application for restitution under s. 144 C.P.C. is an application for execution of a decree and therefore the principle of res-judicata applies to such proceedings.
 Accordingly, in view of the restitution obtained by the respondent, she, was not bound by the decree in suit No. 127 of 1939. [482 G-H] 480 Mahijibhai v. Manibhai [1965] 2 S.C.R. 436 applied.
 The High Court had rightly held that the appellant failed to prove the alleged oral gift and furthermore, the gift was also invalid.
 The three requirements of a valid gift under Mohamedan Law are declaration, acceptance and livery of possession. A gift of property in the possession of a lessee or mortgagee or a trespasser is not established by mere declaration of the donor and acceptance by the donee. To validat the gift there must also be delivery of possession, or failing such delivery. some overt act by the donor to put it within the power of the donee to obtain possession. On the facts N had done nothing after the alleged declaration to place it within the power of the appellant to obtain possess sion.
