 The appellant was the President of a Co-operative Marketing Society constituted mainly for the purpose of enabling its members to obtain credit facilities and to arrange for the sale of agricultural products at reasonable prices. On complaints, an enquiry was instituted into the affairs of the society by the Registrar of Co-operative Societies and as a result, the committee, then in management of the society was, after due notice to show cause and a hearing, superseded by the Registrar. A special officer was appointed to take charge of the affairs of the society and this officer filed a, claim before the Registrar, inter alia, against the appellant. The main item of the claim was commission stated to have been actually earned by the society on the sales effected by it of jaggery belonging to its producer members but which was not credited to the society. It was alleged that while on paper the transactions entered into between the members of the society and the purchasers showed sales at the prices fixed by law, in reality, higher prices were charged. The society was entitled to charge commission on the sales effected through it. As regards this it was stated that commission was earned on the entire price at which gur was sold, and while the amount of commission payable on the basis of controlled prices was credited to the society, the commission earned in respect of the extra price which its members obtained was, it was stated, not brought to the credit of the society in its accounts but appropriated by members of the management.
 On receipt of the claim, the Registrar appointed, under S.
 51(2) of the Madras Co-operative Societies Act, the Deputy Registrar of Co-operative Societies to act as an arbitrator to adjudicate the claim. Thereupon, the appellant filed a petition in the High Court for the issue of a writ of prohibition under Art. 226 of the Constitution, prohibiting the Deputy Registrar from dealing with the claim which he was directed to try. The Single Judge allowed the petition.
 On appeal by the respondent the Division Bench allowed the appeal and dismissed the writ petition. On appeal by special leave,it was contended by the appellant, that (1) the Registrar should have proceeded under s. 49 and not under s. 51 of the Act, (2) the dispute about the retention of money belonging to the Society by the appellant was not "a dispute touching the business of the society", and (3)the transaction of sale which gave rise to the commission alleged to be improperly retained was illegal and that therefore the society could not, in law, make a claim on the basis of such an illegal transaction.
 
HELD : (i) The case did not fall under s. 49 of the Act. If s. 49 did not apply, subject to other arguments about the illegality of the order of the Registrar, proceedings under s. 51 was not open to objection. [192D].
 Besides the factors that the claim was one "against a person in management of the society" and "for the fraudulent retention of money or other 187 property of the society", there was also another condition which had to be satisfied before s. 49(1) could be attracted. The facts giving rise to the charge had to be disclosed in the course of an audit under s. 37 or am enquiry under s. 38 or an inspection under a. 39 or on the winding up of the society. [191 G-H] Sundaram Iyer v. The Deputy Registrar of Co-operative Societies, I.L.R. (1957) Mad. 371, referred to.
 (ii) The claim made before the arbitrator was "a dispute touching the business of society". It could not be disputed that the sale of the produce belonging to the members of the society was part of the business of the society, and then the charging of the commission would equally be the business of the society; and [192 G-H] (iii) No illegality attached to the contract between the appellant and the society; that was perfectly legal. It arose out of his, position as the President of the Society and he was in law, bound to account for the moneys he received on behalf of the society. [193 C] Kedar Nath Motani v. Prahlad Rai, [1960] 1 S.C.R. 861, followed.
