 Prior to the assessment year 1950-51 the assessee was assessed under the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 in the status of a non-resident Hindu Undivided Family. The income received by the assessee in the former Indian State of Madhya Bharat was not subject to tax under the Act but was taken into consideration in computing its "world income" for the purpose of determining the 'rate. After the Constitution came into force the present definition of "taxable territories" was incorporated into the Income-tax Act by the Finance Act, 1950 and the areas in which the assessee was carrying on business with which this appeal is concerned were included therein with the result that for the assessment year 195051 the assessee who was a resident of Madhya Bharat was deemed to be a resident in the "taxable territories" during the "previous year" and hence liable to be taxed in respect of its income received in Madhya Bharat.
 Prior to the assessment year 1950-51 the assessee had proceeded on the basis that its account year ended on Diwali day, but for the assessment year 1950-51, in respect of its income from business in Madhya Bharat it chose the financial year ending on March 31, 1950 as the "previous year". The Income Tax Officer as well as the Appellate Assistant Commissioner rejected the claim of the assessee that it could make such a choice. The Tribunal reversed the finding of the Income Tax Officer and the High Court on reference agreed with the tribunal. On the question whether under the circumstances of the case, having regard to s. 2(11)(i)(a) of the Income Tax Act, 1922, the assessee is entitled to take the year ended on 31-3-1950 as the "previous year" relevant to the assessment year 1950-51 in respect of his sources of income arising outside the "taxable territory", 
HELD : The High Court was right in answering in favour of the asseme.
 (1)It is clear from the provisions of s. 2(11)(i) (a) that in respect of any separate source of income, profits or gains unless the assessee has made a choice in accordance with the second part of s. 2(11)(i)(a) the 12 months ending on 31st day of March next the preceding year for which the assessment is made is the "previous year". The section does not refer to the income of the assessee generally but to his "separate sources of income, profits and gains". Hence it is possible for an assessee to have a different "previous year" for each "separate source of income, profits and gains" : and the business of the as-sessee in Madhya Bharat constituted a separate source of income.

 324 (2)For the purpose of finding out the total "world income" of the assessee, the income derived by the assessee from its businesses outside the "taxable territories" had been taken into consideration in the past; but that was done only for the purpose of determining the rate at which the assessee's income should be assessed. No tax was imposed on the income from those business. The expression that "where in respect of a particular source of income, profits and gains" in the proviso to S. 2(11)(i)(a) means the income from a particular source which has been brought to tax under the Act and not which has been taken into consideration for computing the total world income of the assessee. In the context the word "assessee" in the proviso to s. 2(11)(i)(a) refers to the person whose income, profits or gains in respect of a particular source had been once assessed to tax. The word "assessed" in that proviso means subject to levy or imposition of tax not computed. [327 C-F] Commissioner of Income Tax, Bombay v.
