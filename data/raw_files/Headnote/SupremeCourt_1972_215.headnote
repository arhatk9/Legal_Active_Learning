 "If any application, pending in the Small Cause Court immediately before the date of the commencement of the Presidency Small Cause Courts (Maharashtra Amendment) Act of 1963, or made to it on or after such date. the occupant appears at the time appointed within the meaning of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging Houses, Rates Control Act 1947, and in consequence whereof is entitled to the protection of that Act. and if such claim is not admitted by the applicant, then, notwithstanding anything contained in that Act, the question shall be decided by the Small Cause Court as a preliminary issue." Two questions arose for decision in this appeal. First, whether the word "appears" occurring in S. 42A means appearance of the party in person, or through someone at the date of the hearing. Secondly, whether the Small Cause Court is required to frame an issue as to whether the occupant was a tenant within the meaning of the Bombay Act of 1947, and entitled to issue, whether or not the contesting party appears before the court at the date of the hearing. Allowing the appeal.
 
HELD : (i) S. 42 was introduced by the Maharashtra Amendment Act, which provided a special procedure, where occupant claims tenancy within the meaning of the 1947 Act. The occupant is to claim the tenancy of the applicant within the meaning of 1947 Act. If such claim of the occupant is not admitted by the applicant a.-,king for possession, then the question shall be decided by the Small Cause Court as a pre- liminary issue. The words of importance to denote the time when the question is to whether the occupant is entitled to the protection of the 1947 Act are "then notwithstanding anything contained in that Act". The word "then" is prefaced by the preceding aspects; first, the occupant is to appear at the time appointed; 2nd, be is to claim that he is a tenant of the applicant within the meaning of the 1947 Act; thirdly, he is to claim that in consequence, he is entitled to the protection of the Act: fourthly, that the claim of the occupant is not admitted by the applicant asking for possession. It is clear from the provisions of that statute that the word "appear" in S. 42A of this statute means appearance at the date of the hearing. [177H] (iii) Further, it is not obligatory on the trial court to frame a preliminary issue on the appointed day irrespective of the appearance of' the occupant. In the present case, since the respondent did not appear at the date of hearing and claim the protection of the statute, he is entitled to retain possession of the said tenancy.
