 The workmen of the appellant company resorted to direct action in order to enforce their demands for bonus, leave etc. Thereupon, the company served charge sheets upon sixty-three workmen. The enquiry officer who investigated the charges found that all the workmen were guilty of sabotage and slowdown strike and that they were liable to be dismissed. But as at that time a dispute between the company and its workmen relating to payment of bonus was pending before the Industrial Tribunal, the conditions of service of the workmen could not, by virtue of cl. 29 of the order issued in 1954 by the Governor 243 of Uttar Pradesh under the U. P. Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, be altered nor the workmen discharged without the previous permission of the Conciliation Officer. An application was made to the Conciliation Officer for permission to dismiss the workmen. The Officer granted permission in respect of only eleven workmen on the ground that the rest of the workmen were mere passive participants in the go-slow campaign. The company preferred an appeal to the Labour Appellate Tribunal but it was dismissed as incompetent on the ground that the Conciliation Officer was not an authority within the meaning of s. 2 (c) (iii) of the Industrial disputes (Appellate Tribunal) Act, 1950. The company then obtained special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court against the direction of the Conciliation Officer and also against the order of the Labour Appellate Tribunal.
 Held, that a Conciliation Officer under cl. 29 of the Order promulgated in 1954 under the U. P. Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, has to act judicially in granting or refusing per- mission to alter the terms of employment of workmen at the instance of the employer, but as he is not invested with the judicial power of the State, he cannot be regarded as a tribunal within the meaning of Art. 136 of the Constitution of India. Consequently, an appeal under that Article is not competent against the direction given by the Conciliation Officer.

 Held, further, that an "authority" under s. 2 (c) (iii) of the Industrial Disputes (Appellate Tribunal) Act, 1950, to be an industrial tribunal must be a body constituted for the purpose of adjudication of industrial disputes under a law made by the State; since a Conciliation Officer is not invested with any such power, he cannot be regarded as an "authority" within the meaning of that section.
 Accordingly, an appeal against the order of the Conciliation Officer is not maintainable under s. 4 of the Industrial Disputes (Appellate Tribunal) Act, 1950.
