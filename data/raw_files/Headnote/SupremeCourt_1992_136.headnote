 The respondent was engaged as an appraiser by appellant bank, for weighing and testing, gold ornaments offered to be pledged to the appellant-Bank to secure loans, whenever required on commission basis. His services were terminable at any time. After about one year and seven months the appellant Bank terminated his services. On a reference from the Government, at the instance of the respondent, the Labour Court set aside the termination order, holding it as illegal and unjustified and ordered his reinstatement in service. However, it held that he was not entitled to back wages since those were not capable of a precise computation and involved an element of speculation.
 On appeal by both the appellant-Bank as well as the respondent, the High Court affirmed the view of the Labour Court.
 In the appeal before this Court on behalf of the appellant-Bank, it was contended that though the appellant might be a workman as commonly understood unless there was a jural relationship of master and servant between the respondent and the Bank, he could not be termed as a workman, for the purposes of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.
 Allowing the appeal, this Court, 
 HELD: 1.1. Though the respondent claims to be a workman as commonly under stood, he was not `employed' as such, so as to establish a master and servant relationship, which could warrant a re-union in the event of disruption, by the intervention of the Labour Court. [980 H, 981 A] 978 1.2. Engaging the respondent was to require him to weigh the ornaments brought in the Bank for pledging and to appraise their quality, purity and value. He could be directed to do this, but not the manner in which he shall do it. That was left to him exclusively, as it depended on his skill, technique and experience. Besides, under the terms of engagement he was required to, and he did, execute a bond indemnifying and holding himself responsible to the Bank for all his acts and commissions as an appraiser, and be accountable for the loss sustained by the Bank on account of under-valuation of the gold pledged with it. These terms inhered in the Bank the power to warn him and to remind him that he was not expected to be negligent in his duty. Still there was a fair element of freedom though coupled with responsibility for the respondent in the manner in which he could do his work. [980 F-G] 1.3. It is also an uncontroverted position that the respondent was a reputed goldsmith and had remained gainfully employed so as to disentitle him any back wages and that the Bank has, on its approved list, other such like appraisers and it was not obligatory for the Bank to allot work to the respondent or any other, at all. Additionally, in no event can he ask for work, or periodic remuneration or idling wages. These particulars, not by themselves, but in the totality of circumstance indicate lack of master and servant relationship. [981 B] 1.4. In the circumstances, the courts below were wrong in holding that any master and servant relationship stood established in engaging the respondent as an appraiser of ornaments. [981 C] D.C. Works Ltd. v. State of Saurashtra, [1956] INSC 74; AIR 1957 SC 264 and Chintaman Rao v. State of M.P., [1958] INSC 10; AIR 1958 SC 388, referred to.
