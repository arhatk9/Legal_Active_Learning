 On April 15, 1982, the Customs Officers raided bungalow No. 3, Sweta Park Society, Bhuderpura, Ambawadi, Ahmedabad, allegedly belonging to the petitioner-detenu, but standing in the name of Rekhaben Champaklal Seth and during the search that followed in the presence of the petitioner and one Hasmukh Prabhudas Sharma contraband of several items were recovered and seized under the reasonable belief that they were smuggled goods liable to be confiscated under the Customs Act, 1962. This seizure was followed by recording of confessional statements of the petitioner and his co- conspirators. During the follow up action certain other premises were searched and further contraband was seized. By an order dated April 19, 1982, issued by the State of Gujarat under Section 3(1) of COFEPOSA, the petitioner was detained in Ahmedabad Central Prison, with a view to preserving him from keeping and transporting smuggled goods.
 Grounds of detention dated April 23, 1982 alongwith copies of statements and documents relied upon by the detaining authority were served on the petitioner. The petitioner's representation to the Advisory Board was accepted, since the failure on the part of the detaining authority to supply the translations in Urdu of the grounds and documents relied upon, amounted to a clear violation of the constitutional mandate of Article 22(5) vitiating the order of detention.
 Consequently, the order of detention was revoked by the State under section 8(f) of COFEPOSA and directed his release forthwith, unless he was required to be retained in custody under orders of any competent Court of Law. However, on the same day i.e. on 1st of July 1982, the State Government passed another order of detention against the petitioner under section 3(1) of the COFEPOSA and served it on him on 2nd of July 1982 whilst he was in judicial custody under Court's Order in two cases, one under the Arms Act and another under the Foreigner's Act. This detention order was also passed with a view to preventing him from smuggling goods and engaging himself in transporting smuggled goods and keeping smuggled goods." Grounds of detention running into 32 typed pages in English together with copies 541 of all the statements and documents referred to and relied upon in the grounds, in regional language, were served upon the petitioner on 7th July, 1982. Urdu translations of only some of these documents were supplied on 15th of July 1982 without furnishing the recorded reasons for the delay in supplying them. The petitioner's representations made through his counsel on 5th August 1982, having been rejected on 13th August, 1982 the petitioner has filed this writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution, contending that non-supply of Urdu translations of some of the statements and documents relied upon by the detaining authority. In spite of the revocation of an earlier order on this ground, and the non-communication of the reasons for the delayed supply of Urdu translations in respect of the rest of the documents, have resulted in violation of Article 22(5) of the Constitution read with section 3(3) of the COFEPOSA.
 Allowing the Petition, the Court, ^ 
 HELD: In section 3(3) of the COFEPOSA, the concept of "reasonable time", or "the shortest possible time" or reasonably requisite time", predicated by the expression "as soon as may be" has been retained but it is only with a view to meet the practical exigencies of administrative affairs that the detaining authority is permitted to communicate the grounds of detention, not latter than 5 days ordinarily, and not later than 15 days, if there are exceptional circumstances and that too with a safeguard of reasons being recorded in writing. In other words, section 3(3) provides for the outer limits and the grounds of detention must, therefore, be furnished to the detenu ordinarily within 5 days from the date of detention but in exceptional circumstances and for reasons to be recorded in writing, the time may stand extended but in any event it cannot be later than 15 days from the date of detention. Unless the first duty imposed upon the detaining authority under Article 22(5) is discharged within the prescribed time, it would not be possible for the detenu to exercise his right of making a representation against his detention-a corresponding right arising from the second duty cast on the detaining authority, namely, to afford the detenu the earliest opportunity of making such representation against his detention.

 2:1 The principle clearly enunciated in Smt Icchu Devi's case [1980] 4 S.C.C., 53 is that copies of all documents, statements and materials referred to or relied upon in the grounds of detention (meaning thereby which has influenced the mind of the detaining authority in arriving at its subjective satisfaction about the necessity to detain the detenu) must be communicated to him within the time prescribed under section 3(3) of the COFEPOSA and that without this the right to make representation cannot be meaningfully exercised. [552 D-E] 2:2 From the decided cases, it would follow that if the grounds together with copies of all documents, statements and other materials incorporated in the grounds by reference on which the detaining authority has relied are required 542 to be communicated to the detenu under Art. 22(5) read with section 3(3) of COFEPOSA within the prescribed time, the, not merely the grounds of detention but also the copies of all incorporated documents, statements and other materials must be supplied to the detenu in a script or language which he understands and failure to do so would amount to a breach of the mandate contained in Article 22(5) read with section 3(3) of COFEPOSA.

 2:3 Not merely the exceptional circumstances must exist justifying the delay in communicating to the detenu all the materials relied upon, but these should be communicated to the detenu to enable him to make an effective representation.

 3:1. Preventive detention is a serious invasion of personal liberty and the normal methods open to a person charged with commission of any offence to disprove the charge or to prove his innocence at the trial are not available to the person preventively detained and, therefore, in preventive detention jurisprudence whatever little safeguards the constitution and the enactments authorising such detention provide assume utmost importance and must be strictly adhered to and one of such safeguards is that unless exceptional circumstances really obtain the delay in supply of grounds of detention as also the documents and statements incorporated therein by reference beyond the normal period of five days would be fatal. [556 D-F] In all the facts and circumstances no exceptional circumstances obtained in the case justifying the delay and as such the same constitutes a breach of the constitutional as well as legislative mandate. (1) Upon revocation of the earlier detention order on 1st of July 1982, there was no urgency to issue the impugned order on the same day or serve it on the detenu on the following day since he was already in judicial custody in other two cases, one under the Arms Act and the other under the Foreigners Act and no bail having been granted to him, there was no fear of his absconding from Ahmedabad, there being no urgency the detaining authority could have kept all the material ready in Urdu and supplied the same to him immediately after detaining him second time; (2) In the absence of information as to the number of Urdu translators put on the job except vaguely stating "handful translators were available" and the reasons for not entrusting to others who do not observe Ramzan. it is difficult to swallow the proposition that the State Government (with all its power and resources could not find requisite number of qualified persons to do that job so as to make Urdu translations of the concerned documents and statements available to the detenu within the normal period of five days; and (iii) With the previous 543 detention order having been vitiated on the very ground, greater vigilance and expedition was expected from the detaining authority. [556 G-H, 557A-E] 3:2. It is true that neither Article 22(5) of the Constitution nor does the COFEPOSA contain any provision which casts a duty upon the detaining authority to inform the detenu anything about the exceptional circumstances due to which delay may occur or about the fact whether reasons have been recorded in writing or not for the delay. It is also true that the court will, of course, go into and satisfy itself about these matters when any issue in that behalf is raised before it. [557 H, 558 A] 3:3. Under the scheme of COFEPOSA, against his detention the detenu has a right to make a representation to an authority as well as to the Advisory Board and such representation against his detention can be on merits of the grounds of detention as also for the failure on the part of the detaining authority to observe strictly the requisite safeguards and on satisfying the superior authority or the Advisory Board on either count he is entitled to have his detention revoked or quashed. In other words, the detenu is entitled to satisfy either the superior authority or the Advisory Board that the delay that has occurred in the supply of requisite material to him was not justified because exceptional circumstances did not exist or those put forward were unreal or invalid. Obviously, the detenu will not be in a position to do so if the alleged exceptional circumstances are not communicated to him. Therefore, duty to inform the detenu about the existence of exceptional circumstances and what they were for delay in supplying grounds of detention and/or the documents and statements incorporated therein arises by necessary implication and flows from the right which is conferred upon the detenu to make representation against the detention. The impugned failure in this case constitutes another breach of the safeguard contained in Article 22(5) of the Constitution read with section 3(3) of COFEPOSA and vitiates the continued detention of the petitioner. [558 B-G, 559 A-B] (4) Non-supply of Urdu translation of the documents has clearly prejudiced the petitioner in the exercise of his right to make an effective representation against his detention and hence the safeguard contained in Article 22(5) is clearly violated. The petitioner is a Pakistani national and Urdu seems to be his mother tongue and a little knowledge of English figures, ability to read English words written in capital letters and a smattering knowledge of Hindi or Gujarati would not justify the denial of Urdu translation to him of the material documents and statements referred to as incriminating documents in the grounds and relied upon by the detaining authority in arriving at its subjective satisfaction.
