 The State Government, purporting to, act under ss. 3, 4 and 8 of the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act, 1944 referred a dispute in the appellant's factory to an adjudicator who_ gave his award on December 31, 1957. On January 28, 1958, the Government passed an order enforcing the Award, under ss. 3 and 6(12) of the Act. The Award was challenged by means of a writ petition in the High Court. A single Judge of the High Court allowed the writ petition holding that the State Government had no power to enforce the Award in question. According to the single Judge the old s. 6 having been replaced by a new s. 6 by U.P. Act 1 of 1957 it was not a case of repeal simpliciter and therefore old s. 6 could not be resorted to by relying on s. 6(e) of the General Clauses Act. A Division Bench, in appeal, reversed the order of the single Judge and dismissed the writ petition.
 On the question whether s. 6A as mentioned in s. 16 of the U.P. Industrial Disputes (Amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1956 (U.P. 1 of 1957) as amended by U.P.
 Industrial Disputes (Amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act XXIII of 1957 refers to s. 6A as it stood in U.P. Act XXVIII of 1947 prior to its amendment by U.P. Act 1 of 1957 or as it emerged after the said amendment, HELD:(i) By U.P. Act 1 of 1957 s. 6A was replaced by new s.
 6A which came into force from April 16, 1957. Prima facie the amendment in s. 16 made in November 1957 by U.P. Act XXIII of 1957 should be referable to s. 6A in the form in which it existed on the date of the enforcement of Act XXIII of 1957. But looking at the position as it stood on April 16, 1957 it would be seen that s. 16 was designed to save the pending proceedings from the operation of U.P. Act 1 of 1957 itself. If this Act was held to be inapplicable then s. 6A as amended thereby would be excluded and that section as it stood prior to the amendment by U.P. Act 1 of 1957 would automatically be attracted. To uphold the view of the learned single Judge would render awards like the one in the present case unenforceable which intention is difficult to attribute to the legislature. On the adjudication of the dispute the provision of s. 6A would be attracted and thereunder the State Government could enforce the Award. [32 C-F] (ii)The broad proposition that section 6 of the General Clauses Act is ruled out whenever there is a repeal of any enactment followed by a fresh legislation, cannot be accepted. Section 6 would be applicable in such cases also unless the new legislation manifests an intention incompa- tible with or contrary to the proposition of the section.
 Such incompatibility would have to be ascertained from a consideration of all the relevant provisions of the new law and the mere absence of a saving clause is by itself not material. [33 G-34 B] 28 State of Punjab v. Mohar Singh, [1954] INSC 95; [1955] 1 S.C.R. 893 referred to.
 (iii) The contention that the decision of the adjudicator is not an "award" as defined in s. 2(c) of the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act, as -amended by Act 1 of 1957 has no force. If U.P. Act 1 of 1957 is excluded from its application to pending proceeding under s. 16, then the word "award" has to be liberally construed and so construed it would be covered by s. 6A. The power conferred by s. 16 and 6A has to be construed as real and not illusory and it has to be interpreted so as to achieve the purpose for which it was conferred. [33 D-E]
