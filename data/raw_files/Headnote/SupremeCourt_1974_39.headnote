 The appellant challenged the collection of the respondent to the state Assembly. He alleged that at the time of the' scrutiny of nomination papers the returning officer improperly rejected the nomination paper of one of the, candidates for the election. The name of the rejected candidate was, found not on the electoral rolls of the constituency in which he had filed his nomination papers, but on the rolls of another constituency. Since his name was not correctly printed on the electoral rolls, he had obtained a corrigendum to the electoral roll, a certified copy of which was enclosed with the nomination paper.
 Objection having been raised by the respondent, his nomination paper was rejected on the ground that the provisions of s. 33(5) of the Representation of People Act were not complied. with inasmuch as he had not produced the certified copy of all the relevant entries in the electoral roll at the time of scrutiny of the nomination papers.
 Section 33(5) of the Representation of the People Act provides that where the candidate is an elector to a different constituency a copy of the electoral roll of that constituency or of the relevant part thereof or a certified copy of the relevant entries of such roll shall.
 unless it has been filed along with the nomination paper, be produced before the returning officer at the time of scrutiny.
 The High Court dismissed the election petition of the appellant.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD: Non-compliance with s 33(5) is a defect of a substantial character and is 'not covered by s. 36(4) of the Act. The Returning Officer rightly rejected the nomination paper and rejection cannot be held to be improper. Evidently the rejected candidate is an elector be a different constituency. That being the position he could have complied With s. 33(5) by following one or the other of the three modes provided in that sub-section namely : (1) he could have produced a copy of the electoral roll of constituency in which his name appeared, or (2) he could have produced a copy of the relevant part of the electoral roll of that constituency in which his name appears or (3) he could have produced a certified copy of the relevant entries in the electoral roll of that constituency. He however selected the third mode by enclosing a certified copy of the corrigendum to the electoral roll. (457 D-F; 459 C-D] It is clear that the corrigendum did not furnish all the particulars : which would be available if a certified copy of the relevant entries in the original electoral roll as well as the corrigendum were produced before the Returning Officer at the time, of scrutiny. Since the original electoral roll may be corrected and amended it was absolutely necessary for the, satisfaction ,of, the Returning Officer that a certified copy of not only the original electoral roll containing the relevant entry as also a certified copy of the amendment list concerning the candidate were produced at the time of scrutiny if this had not already been filed along with the nomination paper.
