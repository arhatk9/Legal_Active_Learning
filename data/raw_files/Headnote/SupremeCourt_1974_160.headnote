 In the year 1948 Miraj State was merged in the then Bombay Province and from that date the Bombay Tenancy Act 1939 became applicable to the lands in question. The question arose whether the appellant was a tenant at the time the Bombay Tenancy Act 1939 was made applicable and would therefore be a protected tenant or not. There were two proceedings in respect of two different parts of the same land one between the appellant on the one hand and Yeshwant and Jinnappa on the other hand and the other between the appellant on the one hand and Bhim Rao and Dasrath on the other hand raising the same issue whether the appellant was a tenant at the relevant time. In the proceedings by Bhim Rao and Dasrath, the Deputy Collector held that the appellant was a tenant at the relevant time. In the proceedings initiated by Yeshwant and Jinappa the Mamlatdar also held the appellant to be a tenant. The Mamlatdar's order was, however, set aside by the Special Deputy Collector. Two Revision Applications were filed before the Maharashtra Revenue Tribunal; one by the appellant and the other by Bhim Rao and Dasrath. The Tribunal dismissed the application filed by Bhim Rao and Dasrath and allowed the application filed by the appellant and set aside the order of the Special Deputy Collector. Two. Writ Petitions were filed in the High Court, under Article 227. The High Court allowed both the petitions.
 
HELD : (1) The powers of the Maharashtra Revenue Tribunal are to be found in section 76 of the Act. The Tribunal clearly exceeded its power in reversing the order of the Special Deputy Collector. The Tribunal clearly acted in complete disregard of its powers and proceeded as though it were either defiling with the matter as a court of first instance or an appellate Court. [902 A-B] (2) The High Court was, however, plainly in error in interfering with the judgment of the Tribunal which merely upheld the Deputy Collector's order. The High Court has ignored the limitation within which it has to art while ex- ercising its powers under Article 227 of the Constitution.
 It was not for the High Court to discuss the evidence and come to the conclusion as to whether the appellant was or was not the tenant on 11-8-1948. That was a matter for the Deputy Collector whose judgment has been upheld by the Tribunal. The High Court while exercising the powers under Article 227 was not entitled to discuss the evidence and come to its own conclusion, on the evidence as to who was in possession of the land. The High Court has plainly over- stepped the limits of its power under Article 227. [903 E- 904 A]
