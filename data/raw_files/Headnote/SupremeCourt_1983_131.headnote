 The appellant was working as a clerk in a branch of the first respondent Bank. He was issued a notice by the Deputy General Manager of the Bank informing him about the decision to hold departmental enquiry against him and also that one Sen Gupta, Agent of another branch of the Bank had been appointed as the Enquiry Officer and that any appeal rising out of his order could be made to the Chief Agent of the Bank at Delhi. The Enquiry Officer held an enquiry, found the appellant guilty of the charges and proposed to award the punishment of dismissal. The appellant protested against the proposed punishment and stated that the enquiry was arbitrary, biased and improper. The Enquiry Officer dismissed the appellant. An appeal filed by the appellant was dismissed by the appellate authority. On behalf of the appellant the Union raised an industrial dispute and the Central Government ultimately made a reference to the Industrial Tribunal. The Tribunal held that the dispute was not an industrial dispute. In appellant's appeal by special leave this court held that the dispute was an industrial dispute and remanded the matter to the Tribunal. The Tribunal held that the domestic enquiry was vitiated and not in accordance with the principles of natural justice. The Tribunal further held that Sen Gupta was not clothed with any authority to award the punishment of dismissal as disciplinary authority and that no useful purpose would, therefore, be served by allowing the management to lead fresh evidence in the enquiry before it as requested by the management in its application. The Tribunal set aside the dismissal and ordered reinstatement of the appellant with full back wages. The High Court took the view that Sen Gupta was also the disciplinary authority as per the notice of enquiry and quashed the Tribunal's Award and remitted the enquiry to the Tribunal for affording an opportunity to the management for letting in further evidence to support the charges before the Tribunal. In this appeal the appellant submitted that the Enquiry Officer was not the appointing authority and that the order of dismissal passed by him is invalid in law.
 Allowing the appeal, 86 
 HELD : It is difficult to say that the order of dismissal suffers from any lack of authority of Sen Gupta to award that punishment. The management's request for giving an opportunity to lead further evidence to support the charges before the Tribunal made at that late stage cannot be allowed. [99 H; 103 D] From the fact that Sen Gupta has been appointed as the Enquiry Officer in the notice of enquiry dated 23-7-1965 and that it has been stated in that notice that any appeal from his order could be made to Majumdar, Chief Agent of the Bank at Delhi, it could be inferred that Sen Gupta had been constituted also as the disciplinary authority as otherwise it would not have been stated in that notice that any appeal against his order which could naturally include an order imposing punishment pursuant to any finding recorded in the domestic enquiry conducted by him should be presented before the Chief Agent of the Bank at Delhi. The workman also understood Sen Gupta to be functioning also as the disciplinary authority in the enquiry when he did not question his authority to award the punishment but merely stated that the enquiry was arbitrary, biased and improper.
 It would appear from para 521(12) of the Sastri Award which has been bodily incorporated in para 18.20(12) of the Desai Award that it is not necessary that only the appointing authority or any authority superior to that authority can be the disciplinary authority in regard to employees of a bank and that on the other hand the bank should decide which officer shall be empowered to take disciplinary action in the case of each office or establishment and that it should also make provision for appeals against orders passed in disciplinary matters to an officer or body not lower in status than the Manager. But what is required by that para in the Awards is that the names of the officer or body competent to pass the original orders or hear appeals shall from time to time be published on the Bank's notice boards.
 In the instant case, the workman has not contended anywhere including in the course of arguments advanced on his behalf even before us that there was no such publication in the notice board in regard to the Jullunder Branch of the Bank where he was employed at the time of his suspension. [98 C- F; 99 B-D] The rights which the employer has in law to adduce additional evidence in a proceeding before the Labour Court or Industrial Tribunal either under s. 10 or s. 33 of the Industrial Disputes Act questioning the legality of the order terminating the service must be availed of by the employer by making a proper request at the time when it files its statement of claim or written statement or makes an application seeking either permission to take certain action or seeking approval of the action taken by it. If an application is filed by the management under s. 33 of the Act the management is made aware of the workman's contention regarding the defect in the domestic enquiry by the written statement of defence filed by him. Then, if the management chooses to exercise its right it must make up its mind at the earliest stage and file the application for that purpose without any unreasonable delay. But when the question arises in a reference under s. 10 of the Act after the workman had been punished pursuant to a finding of guilt recorded against him in the domestic enquiry there is no question of the management filing any application for permission to lead further evidence in support of the charge or charges framed against the 87 workman, for the defect in the domestic enquiry is pointed out by the workman in his written claim statement filed in the Labour Court or Industrial Tribunal after the reference had been received and the management has the opportunity to look into that statement before it files its written statement of defence in the enquiry before the Labour Court or Industrial Tribunal and could make the request for the opportunity in the written statement itself. If it does not choose to do so at that stage it cannot be allowed to do it at any later stage of the proceedings by filing any application for the purpose which may result in delay which may lead to wrecking the morale of the workman compel him to surrender which he may not otherwise do. [101 C-D; G-H; 102 A.D] In the present case an application seeking further opportunity to lead evidence before the Tribunal for substantiating the charges framed in 1965 was made by the management on 8.2.1979 for the first time when the matter was before the Tribunal for the second time after it had been remanded by this Court on 2-2-1978 after rejecting the management's contention that the dispute is not an industrial dispute. That was done by the management nearly 14 years after the workman had been suspended on 20-7-1965 and nearly 13 years after the workman had been found guilty in the domestic enquiry and dismissed from service on 28-12- 1965. The management is thus seen to have been taking steps periodically to see that the dispute is not disposed of at an early date one way or the other.

 (Per Desai J.) That statement in Shankar Chakravarti v. Britannia Biscuit Co. Ltd. & Anr. that if an application for giving an opportunity to adduce additional evidence in a proceeding before the Labour Court or Industrial Tribunal is made during the pendency of the proceedings does not mean that some independent right to make an application at any time is conferred on the employer. Ordinarily, where a party claims relief, it must plead for the same. The pleading can be incorporated in a statement of claim or a written statement of defence. It was not for a moment suggested that an application at any stage of the proceedings without explaining why the relief was not claimed in the original pleading has to be granted. If a separate application is made, it would be open to the Labour Court/Industrial Tribunal to examine the question whether it should be granted or not depending upon the stage when it is made, the omission to claim the relief in the initial pleading, the delay and the motivation for such delayed action ? Without being specific, it can be said that such an application has to be examined as if it is an application for amendment of original pleadings keeping in view all the aforementioned considerations and if it does not appear to be bona fide or has been made after a long unexplained delay or the explanation for the omission to claim the relief in the initial pleading is unconvincing, the Labour Court/Industrial Tribunal would be perfectly justified in rejecting the same.
