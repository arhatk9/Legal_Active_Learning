 The appellant, an Idol, is the grantee of certain lands.
 They are "State grants" under r. 4 of the Jaipur Matmi Rules, 1945, having been made or recognised by the Ruler of the State. All State grants are subject to Matmi dues under the Rules, that is, to the amount payable to the State by the successor of a deceased grantee, on his recognition as such. There had been changes in the person of the Shebait of the idol twice, the previous incumbent dying and his son being recognised as the successor. The respondent therefore passed an order demanding Matmi dues from the present Shebait. The appellant by a Writ Petition disputed the validity of the order, but the petition was dismissed. On appeal, 
HELD:(i) The grants in question being grants made in favour of the idol and not in favour of the Shebaits, no question of the death of the grantee or his successor could arise and consequently, the respondent could not claim any Matmi dues from the appellant. [100F-H].
 (ii)Though the order for payment of Matmi dues had been nominally passed against the Shebait, as they were intended to be enforced against the properties belonging to the appellant, the appellant's Writ Petition was maintainable.
 [102E-G].
