 The Regional Transport Authority granted one stage carriage permit to the appellant. On appeal, the State Transport Appel- 870 late Tribunal took the view that the appellant was a monopolist over a distance of 18 miles which was a part of the route in question and so, it rejected the application for a permit made by the appellant and granted the permit to respondent no. 1 over the route in question. It is against this order of the Appellate Tribunal that the appellant preferred a writ petition before the High Court. The single Judge, who heard the writ petition, quashed the order of the Appellate Tribunal. This order was challenged by respondent no. 1 by preferring an appeal under the Letters Patent before a Division Bench of the said High Court. The Division Bench affirmed the order of the Appellate Tribunal and set aside the order of the single Judge on the ground that the single Judge was not justified in issuing a writ of certiorari under Art. 226 of the Constitution of India.
 Hence this appeal.
 Held: (i) In granting a permit, the appropriate authorities under the Motor Vehicles Act are required to consider the interests of the public generally under s. 47(1)(a) of the Act. In dealing with this aspect of the matter, it would not be irrelevant for the appropriate authority to hold that if any applicant is or would be in the position of a monopolist if a permit was granted to him, he would be liable to neglect the interests of the public and may not be very keen on taking all steps to keep his service in good and efficient order. Therefore, it cannot be said that in taking into account the fact that the appellant was a monopolist on a part of the route, the Appellate Tribunal has been influenced by any irrelevant fact.

 (ii) It is true that the administrative directions issued by the Government under s. 43(a) have no force of statutory rules and are, therefore, not binding; but that does not mean that the consideration that the granting of a monopoly to a bus-operator may be prejudicial to public interest, becomes irrelevant only because it has been included or is implied in the administrative instructions. The said consideration has to be taken into account not because it has been included in the administrative instructions, but because, by itself, it is a relevant consideration under s.
 47(1) (a) of the Act.

 (iii) In dealing with the applications under Art. 226 in cases of this kind, it is necessary to bear in mind that the High Court is not exercising the jurisdiction of an Appellate court in the matter. In entertaining writ petitions, the High Court must not lose sight of the fact that decisions of questions of fact under the Motor Vehicles Act have been left to the appropriate authorities which 871 have been constituted into quasi judicial Tribunals in that behalf, and so, decisions rendered by them on all questions of fact should not be interfered with under the special jurisdiction conferred on the High Courts under Art. 226, unless the well recognised tests in that behalf are satisfied. If the order passed by the Appellate Tribunal which is challenged in writ proceedings suffers from infirmities which would justify the issue of a writ under the well recognised principles laid down by judicial decisions in that behalf, the High Court should and ought to interfere but the writs of certiorari should not be issued merely on the ground that all relevant reasons have not been set out in the judgment of the Appellate Tribunal or that the High Court would have taken a different view on the evidence adduced in the proceedings.
 (iv) There can be little doubt that if a decision of a quasi-. judicial Tribunal is challenged before the High Court under Art. 226 and it is shown that the said decision is based on irrelevant considerations or on considerations which are invalid in law, a writ will undoubtedly be issued under Art. 226. But the order passed by the Appellate Tribunal in the case does not suffer from any such infirmity. In the present case, the Division Bench was right in holding that the Single Judge should not have issued a writ in favour of the appellant.
