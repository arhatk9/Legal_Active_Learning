 The disputed property belonged to a Muslim who left India in 1942. After the partition of the country she migrated to Pakistan in 1948, without coming to India. In 1962 she came to India and sold the property to respondent no. 1 for a sum of Rs. 42,000. Respondent no. 1 purchased the property after ascertaining from appellant no. 1 Custodian of Evacuee Property that the property was not evacuee property.
 Later, however, the appellant passed an order declaring the property to be evacuee property. On a petition by respondent no. the Assistant Custodian General directed that the property be handed over to the respondent no. and the sale price deposited in the bank could be taken by the Custodian. Since the Custodian did not issue a sale certificate in his favour respondent no. I filed a writ petition in the High Court which was dismissed by a single Judge on the ground that the seller was an evacuee. The Division Bench on the other hand held that the seller was not an evacuee under s.2 (c)(i) of the United Provinces Administration of Evacuee Property ordinance 1949 but refused to consider whether the seller was an evacuee under s. 2(c)(ii) thereof. According to s. 2(c)(i) of the ordi- nance "evacuee" means, any person who leaves or has on or after the 1st day of March 1947, left any place in the United Provinces for any place outside the territories now forming part of India while according to sub clause (ii) "evacuee" means any person who is resident in any place now forming part of Pakistan and is for that reason unable to occupy, supervise or manage in person his property in the United Provinces.
 Allowing the appeal, (1) There could be no doubt that the seller was an evacuee within the meaning in Teheran till she left for Pakistan from there cl. 2(c)(i) would not apply but clearly cl.
 2(c)(ii) would. There was no doubt that she was resident in Pakistan after the partition of India and was, therefore unable to occupy, supervise or manage her property in the United Provinces. [361 G; C-D] (2)The fact that the first respondent had made an inquiry from the Assistant Custodian whether the property was evacuee property and was told that it was not, did not make any difference to this question. [362 A] Howell v. Falmoth Boat Construction Co. Ltd., [1951] A.C.
 837 at 845, Ebrahim Abbobaker and Another v. Tek Chand Dolwani [1953] INSC 30; [1953] S.C.R. 691 Zafar Ali Shah v. Assistant Custodian of Evacuee Property [1961] INSC 133; [1962] 1 SCR 749 referred to.
 (3)Once it is declared that the property was evacuee property, the sum of Rs. 42,000 paid by respondent no. 1 to the seller and deposited in the bank could not also be evacuee property. Either the one or the other could be evacuee property. This sum must be held to be in trust for the first respondent. [363 F]
