 The respondent had two sons. Prior to the assessment year 1954-55 the Income-tax Authorities assessed him as had of a Hindu undivided family. In 1954-55 the Income-tax Officer held that he was an 'individual' and assessed him accordingly. Thereafter, having obtained sanction from the Commissioner he issued to the respondent a notice under s.
 34 of the Income-tax Act 1922 in respect of the year 1949-50 in the status of an individual. A return was filed by the respondent in response to the notice. However in the appeal relating to 1954-55 the Appellate Assistant Commissioner held thatthe correct status of the assessee was that of a Hindu undivided family. The Income-tax Officer then issued another notice under s. 34 to therespondent in respect of 1949-50 in the status of a Hindu undivided family. On he return filed in response to this second notice the Incometax Officer made an assessment adding certain "escaped income" -to that originally assessed for 1949-50. In reference, the High Court held that the first of the notices under s. 34 was not invalid in law and consequently the issue of the second notice was illegal and the assessment made in pursuance of it was illegal. The Revenue appealed to this Court.
 
HELD : Under the scheme of the Income-tax Act the Individual' and the 'Hindu undivided family' are treated as separate units of assessment and if a notice under s. 34 of the Act is wrongly issued to the assessee in the status of an 'individual' and not in the correct status of 'Hindu undivided family', the notice is illegal and ultra-vires and without jurisdiction. [391F-G] The Income-tax Officer was therefore justified in ignoring the first notice under s. 34 of the Act and the return filed by the assessee in response to that notice and consequently the assessment made by the Income-tax Officer pursuant to the second notice was a valid assessment.
