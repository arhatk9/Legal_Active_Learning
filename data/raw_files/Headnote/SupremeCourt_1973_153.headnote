 The Secretary of State for India had entered into a lease with the respondent in 1931. The lease was for a term of ninety years. The leased land was entrusted for management on behalf of the Government of India to the Delhi Improve- ment Trust and thereafter after abolition of the Trust to the appellant, the Delhi. Development Authority. The lessee had paid a permium in consideration of the lease and had agreed to pay an annual rent of Rs. 465/- for the duration of the lease.
 Covenant 9 of the deed provided that "the lessor will at the request and cost of the lessee at the end of the term hereby granted and so on from time to time thereafter a' the end of each such successive further term of years as shall be granted" execute to the lessee a new lease of the premises demised by way of renewal for 20 years at the first renewal and 20 years for the second renewal and 30 years for the third renewal. The proviso to covenant 9 stipulated "that of each such renewed term of years as shall be granted shall not with the original term of the years and any previous renewals exceed in the aggregate the period. of ninety years." Covenant 10 made the rent subject to enhancement on the second renewal. The appellant enhanced the rent during the period of ninety years and demanded arrears of rent.
 The respondent then sued for a declaration; that the annual rent payable by him could not be enhanced during the subsis- tence of the lease. The High Court decreed the suit. In the appeal to this Court it was contended that the proviso to covenant 9 made the enhancement clause operative within the admitted period of the lease of ninety years because the "original term" mentioned therein not only stood for the initial ninety years but after the expiry of the first period of ninety years. [541.F] Dismissing ,he appeal, 
HELD : That on an interpretation of the lease deed on its own language and' terms the enhancement clause could only operate upon the grant of a fresh lease after the expiry of the first period of ninety years. [54 IF] The initial term of lease of ninety years could not exist with the renewal of that very lease within ninety years. A renewal of a leaese is really a grant of a fresh lease. If as the words in covenant 9 clearly signify enhancement of rent is made conditional upon grant of a fresh lease, it could only take place on the expiry of ',he initial lease and not before that time. [538G] The meaning of the words "original term" as used in the proviso could not be the initial term of 90 years because if that is added to the periods of renewal of lease the total must obviously and necessarily exceed 90 years. It is quite. natural to restrict this expression used in the context of renewals to a term of renewal. This would be a logical course to adopt as the whole covenant 9 deals with renewals of leases. The difficulty in tearing the few words in the proviso away from the context of the rest of the covenant as well as from all other parts of the deed is that it could, if that were done override not merely the words of the demise, giving the duration of the initial lease as ninety years, but would also conflict with the contents of covenant 9 itself. Nothing in the proviso to, covenant 9 could reasonably be used to destroy the meaning of the unambiguous opening words of the covenant showing that the whole covenant is meant to, operate only "at the end of the term hereby granted". The meaning of a document or of a particular part of it is to be sought for in the document itself. This rule follows from the literal rule of construction which, unless its application produces absurd results must be resorted to first. [542E, H] 536 Monypenny v. Mony penny [1861] EngR 357; 1861 9 H.L.C. 114 and Re Meredith ex. p. Chick [1879] 11 Ch. d 731, referred to, The proviso to covenant 9 could be said to suffer from the vice of an uncertainty which can only be removed by ignoring the words creating this uncertainty. In such a case the ambiguous words can be disregarded so that the terms of the earlier operative part of the demise, which are clear, must prevail. [544B] Smt. Bina Das Gupta and Others v. Sachindra Mohan Das Gupta, [1968] S.C. p. 39 at 42 and Glynn and Ors. v.
 Margetson & Co., [1893] A.C. p. 351 at p. 357, referred to.
 If the ambiguity created by the words used in the proviso to covenant 9 can be resolved, assuming that two interpretations of it are reasonably possible, as it seems possible, the principle to apply would be that the interpretation favouring the grantee as against the grantor should be accepted. The English rule that a grant should be construed most favourably to the sovereign was subject to the exception that, in case of grants made for valuable consideration, the sovereign's honour must take precedence over the sovereign's profit. A lease ranted by the Secretary of State for India could not be interpreted today by relying upon an,, special rule of construction applicable to leases by or on behalf of the British sovereign. It is not the ordinary rule of construction applicable to grants capable of two constructions which could be obsolete today but it is the reversal of that rule in the case of grant by the sovereign which would more aptly be said to be inapplicable today. In the present case the lease was for valuable consideration. [544D-F. 545F-H] Dahebzada Mohd. Kamgar Shah v.
