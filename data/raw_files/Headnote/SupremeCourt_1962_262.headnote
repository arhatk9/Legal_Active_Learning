 The respondent was appointed as a constable in the Tripura Police Force. The employment was temporary. In accordance with r. 5 of the Central Services (Temporary Service) Rules, 1949, his services were terminated by giving one month's notice. The respondent appealed. The Appellate Authority wrote to him that as he was an ex-convict for theft nothing could be done for him. The respondent, filed a writ petition challenging the order of termination. The Judicial Commissioner held that the order was one of dismissal as punishment on the ground that the respondent was an "ex- convict" and that as no reasonable opportunity was given to the respondent to show cause, the protection of Art. 311 was not afforded to him and the order terminating the respondents employment was invalid.
 Held, that the respondent had not been dismiss by way of punishment and there was no violation of Art. 311(2). The order in terms merely terminated the service of the respondent; there was nothing in it to suggest that the termination was on account of the respondent being an "ex- convict". It could not be in the circumstances of this case inferred that an order of 267 dismissal was camouflaged as an order of termination. It cannot be assumed that an order ex-facie one of termination was intended to be one of dismissal. The onus to prove such intention lies upon the employee.
 Purshotam Lal Dhingra v. Union of India, [1957] INSC 95; [1958] S.C.R. 828 and Satish Chander Anand v, Union of India, [1953] S.C.R.
 655, referred to.
 Held, further, that, a court considering the validity of an order of termination or dismissal of a public servant is not required to investigate into the matter in the same way as an Industrial Tribunal is when considering an application under s. 33 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The Court has merely to see whether the protection prescribed by Art.
 311 and the rules made under Art. 309 has been denied to the public servant. There is no similarity between an enquiry under s. 33 of the Industrial Disputes Act and an enquiry by the court when 'an order of dismissal of a public servant is challenged.
