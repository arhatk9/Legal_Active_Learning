 The respondent had a structure beside a nallah which carries dirty water and rain water to the creek. The Government demolished a portion of the dam upstream as a result of which the water stored in the lake was bound to pass through the nallah to the creek. The appellant had left unfinished the work of laying cement slab across the nallah. In the rainy season the nallah overflowed and flooded the respondent's property causing damage to it. The respondent alleged that on account of the negligence of the appellant the water course was completely blocked in the monsoon season and resulted in the flooding of his premises.
 The High Court decreed the respondent's suit for damages.
 Section 167 of the Bombay District Municipal Act confers protection on the Municipality in respect of anything done in good faith or intended to be done.

Being aware of possible harm to others and acting in spite thereof, is acting with reckless disregard of consequences. It is worse than negligence, for negligent action is that the consequences of which, the law presumes to be present in the mind of the negligent person.

 Something more than negligence is necessary. In the instant case the appellant was aware of the possible harm and yet cared to do nothing about it. Its action was, therefore reckless and showed its mala fides in the eye of law.
 Section 167 of the Act did not protect it. [126 B] Jones v. Gordon, 2 A.C. 616, referred to.
