 The appellant in C.A. Nos. 2946-47 of 1992 was appointed as an Assistant Engineer in the State Woolen Mill on 18.7.1992. On 12.12.1975, upon being declared surplus therein, he was appointed as an Assistant Mechanical Engineer in the Mines and Geology Department of the State Government (the first respondent).
 On 25.9.1973, the appellant in C.A. No. 2948 of 1992 was appointed as an Assistant Mechanical Engineer in the Mines and Geology Department.
 On 30.9.1977, two posts of Deputy Drilling Engineer fell vacant. The appellants filed writ petitions in the High Court praying that the State Government be directed to consider their cases for promotion to the post of Deputy Drilling Engineer and, if found suitable, to be so promoted with effect from the date upon which the vacancies occurred.
 The appellant also challenged the appointments of the third and fourth respondents to take charge of the vacant posts of Deputy Drilling Engineer on the ground that the respondents were much junior to them.
 The promotions to the post of Deputy Drilling Engineer were regu- 883 lated by Entry 6 of the Schedule to the Rajasthan Mines and Geological Service Rules, 1960. It was amended on 20.5.1977 and again on 11.8.1982.
 On 17.2.1984 the State Government issued an order banning promotions to the post of Deputy Drilling Engineer, for the period 20.5.1977 to 31.3.1983.
 On 7.3.1984, the writ petitions were allowed, inter alia, holding that the appellants were eligible for promotion to the post of Deputy Drilling Engineer as they possessed the necessary qualification and experience. The Single Judge of the High Court rejected the contention of the respondents that the amendment to the Entry 6 of the Schedule was retrospective in operation and held that it did not debar the appellants from being considered for promotion against vacancies existing before 6.11.1982.
 Appeals were filed by the respondents. Pending the disposal of the appeals, on 17.12.1986, the third and fourth respondents were promoted to the posts of Deputy Drilling Engineer upon a temporary basis and they were confirmed on 19.12.1987. On the same day, the appellants were promoted to the post of Mechanical Engineer.
 The Division Bench of the High Court rejected the contention of the appellants that the experience of five years prescribed thereby was only for diploma-holders and there was no requirement of any experience of drilling or of maintenance of drilling machines for degree-holders and set aside the judgment of the Single Judge.
 The present appeals were filed by special leave challenging the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court.
 The appellants contended that it was clear from the Entry 6 of the Schedule that there was no necessity of five year's experience of drilling or of maintenance of drilling machines in the case of degree-holders such as the appellants; that the experience of five years that was prescribed was only in respect of diploma-holders; and that the appellants possessed the necessary experience of five years in the maintenance of drilling machines.
 884 Dismissing the appeals, this Court 
 HELD : 1.01. The qualification that an Assistant Drilling Engineer or an Assistant Mechanical Engineer had to possess for being promoted to the post of Deputy Drilling Engineer was (a) a diploma in Mechanical Engineering and (b) five year's experience of drilling or of maintenance of drilling machines. The qualification prescribed was two-fold : educational and practical experience. A better educational qualification does not obviate the need for the prescribed practical experience.
 (887F) 1.02. The Entry 6 of the Schedule speaks of the practical experience that each Assistant Mechanical Engineer must possess to qualify him for promotion to the post of Deputy Drilling Engineer, it does not say that every Assistant Mechanical Engineer of five years standing would qualify for such promotion.[888F] 1.03. The acquisition of a qualification cannot be equated with practical experience. The fact that the appellant (in C.A. No. 2948 of 1992) had acquired the additional qualification does not ipso facto lead to the conclusion that he had or must have had the requisite practical experience prescribed in the Entry 6 of the Schedule. [889D] 1.04. Neither before the Division Bench nor in the Special Leave Petitions have the appellants stated what work they did from time to time since their appointment as Assistant Mechanical Engineers. Such an averment would have shown with precision whether or not they had five years' experience of maintenance of drilling machines. That they did not so ever even after the Division Bench dismissed their writ petitions on the very ground must be considered significant. [887G-888A] 1.05. At the very last moment of the hearing the appellant (in C.A. Nos. 2946-47 of 1992) filed an affidavit which stated that he had been posted at the Central Workshop ever since he was absorbed in the Mines and Geology Department and his job had included the repair and maintenance, inter alia, of drilling rigs. This last minute attempt to cure the defect cannot be countenanced as the averment cannot at this stage be confirmed or denied.
