 The appellants applied to the High CouRt for a certificate seeking to appeal against the judgment and order of the High Court dismissing their petitions challenging the constitutionality of the Maharashtra Agricultural Lands (Ceilings on Holdings) Act, 1961. The -High Court had held that an earlier case had already laid down that the Act was saved by Art. 31A and that because of its inclusion in the Ninth Schedule to Act enjoyed the protection of Art. 31B.
 -The High Court refused the certificate and gave no reasons for the refusal. In appeal to. this Court against the order refusing certificate it was urged that in view of the decision of this Court in Ramesh v. Seth Gendalal Motilal Patni the certificate ought to have granted because the order was made in the exercise of extra-ordinary original jurisdiction in a civil proceeding and the valuation of the claim was well over Rs. 20,000.
 
HELD : (i) Article 133 is wide enough to take in civil proceedings decided in the High Court in the exercise of the extra-ordinary jurisdiction provided some civil right of the patty is decided. The appellants were attempting to save their property by challenging the validity of the Act and the decision of the Court that the Act was valid directly affected the civil rights of the parties in properties well over the mark in value. In these circumstances the High Court could not refuse the certificate.
 Ramesh v. Seth Gendalal Motilal Patni, [1966] INSC 5; [1966] 3 S.C.R. 198.
 The case was not remanded for certification because it would be an exercise in futility to ask the High Court to certify the cases when the appeals that would follow must inevitably fail, as this Court had held the Act to be intra vires and it was protected by Art. 31B of the Constitution. State of Maharashtra v. Madhavrao Damodar Patilchand. [1968] 3 S.C.R.
 712.
 (iii) It is desirable to state in brief why the certificate is refused, since, much depends on whether the civil rights of the parties are passed on or not by the judgment proposed to be appealed against. Again, if the court refused to exercise jurisdiction under Art. 226 without deciding the civil rights claimed, it is better to say so while refusing the certificate.
