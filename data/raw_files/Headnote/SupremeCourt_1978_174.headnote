 The Rice Milling Industry (Regulation) Act was passed in 1958, the object and reasons of which were to preserve and protect the indigenous and hand pounding industry of rice growers so as to provide sufficient employment to rural population and to ensure the modernisation of conventional type of rice mills with a view to producing more rice of better quality and nutritive value. Since the original Act did not include the rice hullers, by the Amendment Act 29 of 1968, Sec. 3(d) was substituted viz. "Milling rice, with it grammatical variation, means (i) recovering rice or any produce thereof from paddy; (ii) polishing rice with the aid of power". Under Section 5 read with Section 3A, the petitioners were required to take licences for operating their husking mills. The petitioner, therefore, assailed (a) that the requirement of taking licences for operating their mills amounted to complete destruction of their fundamental rights to carry on business and (b) that the provisions of the Act further contain unguided and uncanalised powers so as to violate the provisions of Art. 14.
 Dismissing the petitions, the Court ^ 
 HELD: (1) An analysis of the provisions of Sections 3(d), 3A, 5, 6 and 7 indicates that the provisions contained sufficient guidelines and do not amount to exercise of an arbitrary power. [759B] (2) Having regard to the setting in which Sec. 3(d) is placed and the dominant object of the Amending Act 29 of 1968, the intention of the Legislature was to widen the purpose and scope of the definition of milling rice. If Clause (i) and (ii) are read conjunctively then, it will defeat the very purpose of the Act and would in fact become meaningless because clause (i) which means recovering rice or any product thereof from paddy could include products like chura etc. which do not require polishing and yet if the two clauses are read conjunctively chura will have to be polished within the meaning of Section 3(d), which could not have been contemplated by the legislature. Furthermore, polishing rice under Section 3(gg) includes the process of removal of bran from the kernel of rice with the aid of power and that is what the rice hullers do. Thus on a true interpretation of Sec. 3(d) clauses (i) and (ii) and (gg) there can be absolutely no doubt that the section includes the 14-549 SCI/78 752 operation carried out by the rice hullers. Though it was not necessary for the legislature to have added Sec. 3(A), it was done in order to put the matter beyond doubt or controversy. [760B-D, E, 761D-E] (3) Rice-millers and rice hullers constitute a separate class having regard to the nature of their functions the classification is reasonable, because (1) it to the objects, sought to be achieved by the Act namely, the protection of the domestic hand-pounding industry and improvement of the quality of the rice domestic hand-pounding industry and improvement of the quality of the rice and ensuring its easy and quick distribution. The contention that the Act by bringing the rice hullers and rice millers within the same fold seems to treat unequals as equals, because rice hullers cannot be equated with rice-millers is not correct. [762B-C] (4) Sections 5 and 6 of the Rice Milling Industry (Regulation) Act, 1958 do not amount to unreasonable restrictions on the right of the petitioners to carry on their trade and business. In the first place, the licensing provisions is in public interest and is meant to carry out the purpose of the Act. Secondly, sections 5 and 6 are purely regulatory in character and do not amount to unreasonable restriction. [762C-D, 763C] Narendra Kumar & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors., [1959] INSC 147; [1960] 2 SCR 375; Daruka & Co. v. Union of India, [1973] INSC 159; [1974] 1 SCR 570;
 Glass Chatons Importers & Users' Association v. Union of India, [1961] INSC 145; [1962] 1 SCR 862 referred to.
 (5) In view of the language of section 6 with which the rice hullers are concerned, the question of uncanalised powers being conferred on the licensing authority does not arise. Under Section 6(3) once an application is received by the licensing officer he shall grant a licence or such condition as he may impose. The statute does not have any discretion in the licensing officer to grant or to refuse to grant licence. He has a mandatory duty to perform, and, therefore, there is no question of the licensing officer having been conferred or uncanalised powers under the Act.
 [763D-E] (6) Sub-section (4) of Sec. 5 columns as many as six guidelines for the grant of permit. The power is to be exercised by such a high authority as the Central Govt.
 Furthermore under S. 12 an appeal lies against a decision of the licensing officer under Sec. 6 or Sec. 7 to an appellate officer nominated by the Central Government. [763F-G]
