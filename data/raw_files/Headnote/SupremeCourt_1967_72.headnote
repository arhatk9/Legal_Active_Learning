 The appellant company carried on general insurance business.
 One of the bye-laws of the company allowed payment of bonus where a policy was 'renewed and there had been no claim in the preceding year. The company did not debit in its profit and loss account the amount so paid in the previous years relevant to the assessment years 1957-58 and 1958-59; it showed an amount estimated to be payable as bonus in its profit appropriation account. The Income-tax Officer held that (i) the payment of bonus was made after the profits for the relevant year were determined and on that account it was only a case of appropriation of profits after they were earned, (ii) in any event since the company had not charged the bonus paid to revenue account and had merely made a provision in the appropriation account, it could not claim relief after modifying the accounts in Form B to Schedule It of the Insurance Act 1938 submitted to the Controller of Insurance. The High Court in a reference under s, 66 of the Income-tax Act held against the company The company appealed.
 
HELD : (i) Rule 6 of the Schedule to the Income-,tax Act enjoins the Income-tax Officer to take the balance disclosed by the annual accounts -is the profits and gains of insurance business other than life insurance : it does not oblige him to accept the figure disclosed at the foot of the profit and loss account in the determination of the quantum of profits and gains of the insurance business. Section 15 of the Insurance Act requires the insurer to submit not merely the profit and loss account in Form B but also the balance sheet and the account in Form C and other accounts, and there is no warrant for the view that the balance of profits disclosed must be equated with the balance of profits disclosed in Form B. [283G-H] (ii) By debiting the estimated bonus payment to the profit appropriation account the company did not seek to alter the character of the expenditure. If it had been debited in the profit and loss account it could not with any show of reason be regarded as not incidental to the business of the assessee company. Merely because it was debited as 'an estimated amount an intention not to treat it as expenditure for the purpose of the business is not indicated. It was open to the assessee company to debit to its annual accounts a certain outgoing actual or estimated and if sanctioned by the Controller to claim that amount or such other amount as the Income-tax Officer may under s. 10(2) allow as permis- sible deduction. [284B-D] (iii) The bonus scheme was clearly intended to advance the business of the insurer and the expenditure: in this regard was expenditure laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the business of the company within 'the meaning of s. 10(2) (xv). [284F] (iv) The liability of the company for payment of bonus was not a contingent liability. So long as the year of risk has not expired the liability is contingent, but once the year of risk is over, and the policy is renewed the liability becomes actual and concrete. The assessee company had not claimed the full amount for which an estimate was made in the accounts submitted to the Controller of Insurance but only those amounts which were entered in the balance sheet as actually paid. This expenditure could not be said to be contingent. [284 H; 285 Al
