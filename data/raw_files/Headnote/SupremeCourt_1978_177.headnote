 On a complaint by the respondent a partner of the Punjab Oil Mills, that the appellant who had been carrying on the occupation of a baker in the premises let out to him by the Mills had constructed an oven and a chimney, which constituted a nuisance under Section 133 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the trial magistrate after hearing the parties and on local inspection confirmed his earlier conditional order directing the appellant to demolish the oven and the chimney within a period of ten days. While confirming the conditional order the magistrate however directed the appellant to cease carrying on the trade of a baker at the particular site and not to lit the oven again.
 The Additional Sessions Judge recommended reversal of the said order and made a reference to the High Court. The High Court, upheld the trial court's order.
 Dismissing the appeal by special leave, the Court ^ 
 HELD : 1. In a matter of this nature where what is involved is not merely the right of a private individual but the health, safety and convenience of the public at large, the safer course would be to accept the view of the learned magistrate, who saw for himself the hazard resulting from the working of the bakery. [809B-C] The magistrate however went beyond the scope of the conditional order passed by him. Preventing the appellant from using the oven is certainly within the terms of the conditional order but not so the order requiring him to desist from carrying on the trade of a baker at the site.
