 The Bangalore Bench of Central Administrative Tribunal held that the employees belonging to the Accounts Wing of Indian Audit and Accounts Department were entitled to the benefit under Office Memo dated 12.6.87 issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Finance, Department of Expenditure with effect from 1.1.86.
 Subsequently, some of the employees of the Accounts Wing in the Tamil Nadu filed petitions before the Madras Bench of the CAT, claiming that they also should be given benefit with effect from 1.1.86.
 The Madras Bench did not agree with the view taken by the Bangalore Bench and the matter was referred to the Chairman of the CAT and a Full Bench was constituted.
 The Full Bench answered the reference agreeing with the view taken by the Bangalore Bench.
 The appeals, before this Court, were filed against several orders passed by the Madras Bench as well as the Bangalore Bench of the CAT.
 The appellants contended that the Office Memo dated 12.6.87 was based on the recommendations of the Fourth Central Pay Commission which consisted of two parts. The first part recommended corresponding scales of pay for the existing posts in the Accounts Wing giving effect from 531 1.1.86. The other part was contained in para 11.38. Pursuant to those recommendations the Government decided to implement the same with effect from 1.4.87; that the Full Bench failed to appreciate correctly the second part of the recommendation of the Pay Commission, which indicated that the number of posts to be placed in these scales were to be identified by the Government and the Government could therefore decide and then give effect at a later date.
 The respondents-employees contended that the Pay Commission recommended that there should be parity in the pay scales of the staff in the I.A. & A.D.and other Accounts Organisations and since all of them discharged similar duties the benefit should be extended to all of them uniformly with effect from 1.1.86; that the persons allocated to the Accounts Wing, who possessed similar qualifications before and after entry into the Department, were performing duties of same nature, as those allocated to the Audit Wing, and allowing them lower scales of pay than those allowed to the Audit wing was violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution; that since all of them did the same work, they should be treated alike and the principle of equal pay for equal work was very much attracted; and that the recommendations of the Pay Commission should be accepted as a whole in respect of all the categories of employees.
 On the question, "whether the benefit under Office Memo dated 12th June, 1987 issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Finance,Department of Expenditure should be extended to the members of the Accounts Wing of the Indian Audit and Accounts Department, with effect from 1.1.86, as in the case of Audit Wing, or whether it should be from 1.4.87 as indicated in the Office Memo ?" Allowing the appeals of the Union of India, this Court, 
 HELD: 1.01. The Pay Commission Report indicated that after bifurcation, certain posts in the Accounts Wing should be declared to be brought into the functional grades and thereafter the higher scales of pay should be paid to the officers fitted in such grades. [541E-F] 1.02. For that purpose necessary rules have to be framed prescribing the eligibility etc. and the senior Accountants who have completed three years' regular service in the grade are upgraded to the post of Asstt. Accounts Officer. It is evident that all this could have been done only in the year 1987 and in the organised Accounts Office higher scales of pay 532 were given with effect from 1.4.87 i.e. from the beginning of the financial year. [540G-H] 1.03.The respondents cannot insist that they must be given higher scales with effect from 1.1.86. This claim is obviously based on the ground that some of the officers belonging to the Audit Wing were given scales with effect from 1.1.86. But it must be borne in mind that they were eligible on that date for the higher scales. Likewise some of the Officers of the Accounts Wing who were eligible for higher scales were also given. [540H-541A] 1.04.Before bifurcation all of them belonged to one Department and as such all those officers of both the wings who were entitled to the scales of pay from 1.1.86, have been granted the same with effect from that date. But with regards the posts that were to be identified and brought into the functional grades in future. the higher scales of pay cannot be made applicable retrospectively, i.e. with effect from 1.1.86. It cannot be said that on that date the post identified subsequently, were also in existence. In such a situation the principle of equal pay for equal work is not attracted as on 1.1.86. [541F-H] 1.05. After upgradation, officers in the Audit and Accounts Wings who are doing the equal work are being paid equal pay. But that cannot be said to be the situation as well on 1.1.86 also. [543D] 
 2. Equality before the law means that among equals the law should be equal and should be equally administered and that like should be treated alike. However, the principle does not take away from the State the power of classifying persons for legitimate purposes. [537C] Ameerunisa Begum and Ors. v.
