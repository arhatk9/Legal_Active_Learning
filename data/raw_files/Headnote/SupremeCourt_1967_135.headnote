 The respondents were prosecuted under S. 4(1)(a) of the Andhra Pradesh (Andhra Area) Prohibition Act, on the allegation that they were found transporting arrack. The respondents denied the offence and pleaded that a mere statement by the witnesses that there was a strong smell of arrack, emanating from the tins, when they were pierced was not sufficient to establish that the tins contained arrack and that the samples of the commodity should have been sent for opinion of the Chemical Examiner. The trial and the appellate courts rejected the respondents' pleas and convicted them but the High Court acquitted them. In appeal, to this Court.
 
HELD : The prosecution has not established that the respondents were guilty under s. 4(1)(a) of the Act.
 Merely trusting to the smelling sense of the Prohibition Officers, and basing a conviction, on an opinion expressed by those officers, could not justify the conviction of the respondents. Better proof, by a technical person, who bad considered the matter from a scientific point of view, was not only desirable, but even necessary, to establish -that the article seized was one coming within the definition of 'liquor'.
