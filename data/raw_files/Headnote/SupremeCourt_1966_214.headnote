 Members of a family held 4,015 shares, out of 4,391 shares in the respondent company, which was a public limited Company. In the course of investigation under the Taxation of Income (Investigation Commission) Act, 1947, the heads of the various branches of the family admitted that the shares were purchased by them out of their joint income which had not been disclosed and that a majority of the shares were held benami. An offer of settlement was also made that a single assessment may be made in respect of the "secreted income" treating them as an association of persons and that every member of the family be treated as jointly and severally liable to pay tax on that income. For the assessment years 1950-51 and 1951-52, the Income-tax Officer commenced proceedings under s. 23A of the Income-tax Act, 1922, and held that the Company was one in which the public were not substantially interested and that its affairs were under the control of the members of the family. He passed an order under the section that the undistributed portion of the assessable income of the Company as computed for income- tax purposes and reduced by the amount of income-tax and super-tax shall be deeming to have been distributed as dividends among the share-holders. The order was confirmed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. The Income-tax Appellate Tribunal reversed the order. The Tribunal held that the offers made by the members of the family to the Income-tax Investigation Commission were not relevant in determining whether the Company was one in which the public were not substantially interested, and that from the fact that the members of the family held 4,015 shares, it could not be inferred that the shares were jointly acquired, or that the members exercised control over the affairs of the Company. The Tribunal also observed that there was no material placed by the Department to show that the members of the family actually controlled the voting or acted in concert so as to bring the company within s. 23A. The Tribunal, therefore, held that the section did not apply to the Company since it was not established that the Company was one in which the public were not substantially interested, even though the members of the family held more than 75% of the shares issued by the Company. On a reference, the High Court confirmed the order of the Tribunal holding that even on the finding that the members of the family were in a position to control the affairs of the Company, there was no evidence of any overact showing that they were acting in concert and thereby constituted a block.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The approach to the problem by the Tribunal and High Court was erroneous. It was for the Tribunal to determine, having regard to ordinary human experience whether it may be safely taken that the members of the family must have acted together as a controlling block. That 822 enquiry had not been made and the case was decided on the application of an erroneous test. [830 C-D] (i) In deciding whether an order under s. 23A (as oh the relevant date) is called for, it must be decided in the first instance whether there was a of persons acting in concert holding a sufficient number of shares may control the voting as a block. It is sufficient, if having regard to their relationship, their conduct, their common interest etc. it may be inferred that they must be acting together :
 evidence of actual concerted acting is normally difficult -to obtain and is not insisted upon. It is the holding in the aggregate, of a majority of the shares issued, by a person or persons acting in concert in relation to the affairs of the company which establishes the existence of a block, and if the block holds 75% of the voting power it shall be deemed that the company is one in which the public are not substantially interested. TO establish that a company is one in which the public are not substantially interested,, it is not a condition that actual exercise of control by a group must be established. [828 B, E-F; 829 F- H] (ii) The fact that certain provisions of the Taxation of Income (Investigation Commission) Act were held to be ultra vires did not render the Commission an unlawful body, and the admissions recorded by the Commission could not be ignored. The report could be taken in evidence after giving an opportunity to the respondent to make its representation against the report and to tender evidence against the truth of the recitals contained therein.
