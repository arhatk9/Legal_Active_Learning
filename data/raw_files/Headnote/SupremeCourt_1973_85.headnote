 One of the disputes between the appellant and the respondents, referred to the Industrial Tribunal, was whether construction allowance should be payable to any categories of regular employees for extension of existing projects after the operation stage had commenced, and if so, to what extent and to which categories of regular employees.
 The Tribunal held that the allowance should be payable to all categories of regular employees including school teachers and welfare centre workers at any station where there is both construction work and operational work.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The Tribunal was justified in holding that the employees, who were posted at the same station, some doing construction work and others operational work, will both be entitled to construction allowance, as the two sets of employees have to be treated and paid uniformly.
 According to the circulars issued by the appellant the essential qualification for getting construction allowance was that the employee must be stationed at the construction camp site, the reason 'for such payment being the arduous and exacting nature of construction duties and the lack of civic amenities at, the camp site. The evidence in the case, however, disclosed that the appellant had modified these principles, because, construction allowance was paid even to employees who were posted at headquarters but who had to visit the construction site during the process of such construction. If such employees are posted or stationed at headquarters they will be enjoying the civic amenities in the same manner as the other employees who are doing operational work at the same headquarters. There would. be no distinction between them in the matter of enjoying civic amenities, but the former are paid construction allowance while the latter are not. Also there is no justification for denying construction allowance to the employees coming under the category of school staff especially when employees coming under the head, of hospital staff are paid construction allowance. The appellant has neither pleaded nor established any factors distinguishing the two categories of employees.
