 The father of the first respondent executed a trust deed in 1930, in respect of properties owned by him. The deed provided inter alia, that the settlor would be trustee during his life time, that from and after his death, his wife should be paid Rs. 50 per mensem from the profits of the trust estate, that the balance of the income was to be paid in equal shares to the sons of the settlor, and that after the wife's death, the whole estate was to be made over to the settlor's sons in equal shares. The settlor reserved to himself the power to vary the quantum of interest, given to each of the beneficiaries after his death by will alone and in no other way. After administering the trust for some time he wanted to make some changes in the trust deed, and for this purpose took out an originating summons on the original side of the Calcutta High Court, under Ch. 13 of the Original Side Rules and prayed for two reliefs, namely, (i) to have the Official Trustee appointed as the trustee in his place, and (ii) to empower the settlor to alter the clause relating to variation of the 'quantum of interest by a deed inter vivos. The first respondent did not appear in those proceedings though notice was served on him. The High Court, in specific terms, granted the prayers. The settlor then executed another trust deed in 1938 under which the first respondent was deprived of all his interest in the corpus of the trust properties and was given a meagre allowance of Rs. 20 per mensem. The Official Trustee carried out the order of the High Court and disbursed the income to the various beneficiaries. In 1950, after the death of the settlor, the first respondent filed a suit and prayed : (i) that the power reserved to the settlor in the original trust deed for altering the quantum of interest by will alone, was irrevocable; (ii) that the order on the originating summons was null and void as having been made without jurisdiction; (iii) that the plaintiff was entitled to the benefits provided by the original deed; and (iv) that the Official. Trustee should render accounts since the time of the death of the settlor.
 The trial court decreed the suit but the first appellate court reversed the decree. In second appeal, the High Court restored the decree of the trial court.
 In appeal to this Court, on the questions : (1) Whether the settlor was entitled to execute the second trust deed; (2) Whether its validity was not open to challenge in view of the order on the originating summons, because, the Judge had jurisdiction to pass the order either under s. 34 of the Indian Trusts Act, 1882, or s. 10(1) of the Official Trustees Act, 1913, or s. 41 of the Trustees and Mortgagees Powers Act, 1866, or in 93 exercise of his inherent powers; and (3) Whether the Official trustee was liable to render accounts and if so for what period.
 
HELD : (1) The stipulation in the trust deed that the variation can only be made by will and not otherwise is a binding condition. Being a material condition the settlor had no power to vary it and therefore had no power to execute the second trust deed., [98 F] Re : Anstis [1886] 31 Ch. D. 596; Reid V. Shergold (1805) 10 Ves. 370 and Molineux v. Evered, (1910) 2 Ch. 147, applied.

 (2) Before a court can be held to have jurisdiction to decide a particular matter it must not only have jurisdiction to try it but must also have the authority to decide the questions at issue and pass appropriate orders.
 It is not sufficient that it has some jurisdiction in relation to the subject-matter under the various provisions of law or under its inherent power. If the High Court had the power under those provisions of law or in its inherent jurisdiction the fact that they were not invoked by the petitioner in the originating summons would not invalidate the order even if it was wrong. But the order on the originating summons in the present case was outside the jurisdiction of the Judge. It was not merely a wrong order, or an illegal order; it was an order which he had no competence to make and was therefore a void order. [101 B-D;

 (a) The facts stated and the nature of relief asked for in the originating summons, show that the matter did not come within the scope of s. 34 of the Trusts Act. The jurisdiction of the Court under the section is a limited jurisdiction. The statute has prescribed what the Court can do and inferentially what it cannot do. Under the provision, the Court could only give 'opinion, advice or direction on any presented question respecting the management or administration of the trust property' and not on any other matter arising under the trust deed. The relief prayed for by the settlor did not relate to the management or administration of the trust Property. [101 G;
 102 A-D] (b) Section 10(1) of the Official Trustees Act, 1913, might have empowered the High Court to appoint the Official Trustee in the place of the settlor, as the settlor was not willing to continue as trustee. But it could not have granted the other reliefs asked; for. [102 G] (c) Section 43 of the Trustees and Mortgagees Powers Act, 1866, is similar to s. 34 of the Trusts Act. Under that provision, a Judge of a High Court could have only given opinion, advice or direction on any question respecting the management or administration of the trust property and therefore, the order on the originating summons could not be justified on the basis of the section. [103 D] (d) There is no rule in Ch. 13 of the Original Side Rules of the Calcutta High Court, under which the order on the originating summons could have been made. It is not as if the Judge, in passing his order on the originating summons, was merely interpreting the original 'trust deed in which case it might not have mattered whether his interpretation wag 'correct or not. [104 A-C] 94 It may be that a Judge sitting on the original side of the High Court has all the powers of a Chancery Judge in England, but the inherent powers of a Chancery Judge only relate to management and administration of trust property which powers are similar to those codified in s. 34 of the Trusts Act and s. 43 of the Trustees and Mortgagees Powers Act, and is therefore of a limited character. [105 G-H; 106 A] Chapman v. Chapman, [1954] UKHL 1; [1954] A.C. 429 and Chapman's case, [1953] Ch. 218, referred to.
 (3) But for the order on the originating summons the settlor would have certainly altered by will the quantum of interest given to the first respondent. The first respondent did not challenge the second trust deed during the father's life-time and there was no knowing that he would have challenged it till he filed the suit. Since the Official Trustee merely carried out the order of the Court, he is not a trustee de-son-tort and his liability should not be greater than that of a trustee. Therefore, there is no Justification for directing him to account from the date he took charge of the trust estate, and the ends of justice would be met, if accounting was ordered as from the date of suit.
