 In Part III of the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order.
 1950, issued by the President of India under Art. 342, Munda is specified as a scheduled tribe, but not Patar. The first respondent was a Patar. He was declared elected to the Bihar Legislative Assembly from a scheduled tribes constitu- ency. The appellant, who was an unsuccessful candidate, filed an election petition for setting aside the election on the ground that the first respondent was not a member of a scheduled tribe. The High Court dismissed the petition holding that the first respondent was a Munda and was hence a member of a scheduled tribe.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD: (1) Evidence is admissible for the purpose of showing what an entry in the Presidential Order was intended to mean, but not so as to modify the order by including other tribes. Since the first respondent's case was not that Patars are a distinct community who are regarded as Mundas but that Patars are Mundas, evidence may be given to show that the entry Munda includes Patars.

 C.A.No. 1622/67 dt. 21-5-1968, referred to.
 (2) Whether a particular person is a member of a scheduled tribe so declared by the President is essentially a question of law. Though an admission made by him expressly or by implication that he is not a member of a scheduled tribe is evidence against him. in an election petition, the evidence is not conclusive. [808 B-C] (3) If a member of a scheduled tribe, transfers property by a deed in which he describes himself to be not a member of the scheduled tribe in order to avoid refusal of registration under s. 46 of the Chota Nagpur Tenancy Act, he will not, on that account, be disentitled to claim the status of a member of scheduled tribe. It could not be said, on that ground alone, that the transferor was not a member of a scheduled tribe or was estopped from setting up that status. [808 D-E] (4) The evidence in the case established that Patars are a sub-tribe of Mundas and that they are not different from Mundas. [813 F-G] (5) If Patars are Mundas, because some sub-tribes of Mundas arc 805 enumerated in the Presidential Order and others are not, no inference will arise that those not enumerated are not Mundas. Merely because Patars are not specifically mentioned in the Presidential order, they cannot be on that account alone be excluded from the general heading of Munda.
