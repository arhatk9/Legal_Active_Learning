 A criminal complaint was registered against five persons, amongst whom the two appellants were included. The police having found that the two appellants were innocent, charge-sheeted the remaining three persons. They were committed to trial.
 At the trial after evidence showing the appellants' involvement in the crime was recorded the prosecution moved an application that they be tried, along with the three accused. The Sessions Judge directed the appellants to stand trial, together with the other accused. Their revision application to the High Court was dismissed.
 In their appeal to this Court it was contended that, (1) sections 193 and 209 Cr.P.C. were a bar to the Court of Sessions taking cognizance of any offence as a court of original jurisdiction and (2) s. 319 was inapplicable to the facts of this case because that section in so far as it is applicable to a Sessions Court would be subject to or subordinate to s. 193 and the phrase "any person not being the accused" occurring in the section excludes from its operation an accused who had been released. by the police.
 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: (1) A plain reading of s. 319(1) clearly shows that it applies to all the courts including a Sessions Court and as such a Sessions Court will have the power to add any person, not being the accused before it but against whom there appears during trial sufficient evidence indicating his involvement in the offence, as an accused and direct him to be tried along with the other accused. [311 E-F] (2) (a) Both under s. 193 and s. 209 the commitment is of 'the case' and not of 'the accused' whereas under the equivalent provision of the old Code viz., s. 193(1) and s 207A it was 'the accused' who Was committed and not 'the case'. [312D] (b) Although there cannot be a committal of the case without there being an accused person before the court, this only means that before a case in respect of an offence is committed there must be some accused suspected to be involved in the crime before the Court but once the case in respect of the offence qua those accused who were before the Court is committed then the cognizance of the offence can be said to have been taken properly by the Sessions Court and the bar of s. 193 would be out of the way. [312E] 307 (c) The summoning of additional persons who appear to be involved in the A crime from the evidence led during the trial and directing them to stand their trial alongwith those who had already been committed must be regarded as incidental to such cognizance and a part of the normal process that follows it; otherwise the conferal of the power under s. 319(1) upon the Sessions Court would be rendered nugatory. [312F] (d) Section 319(4) (b) which enacts a deeming provision provides that , where the Court proceeds against any person under sub-section ( 1 ), the case may proceed as if such person had been an accused person when the Court took cognizance of the offence upon which the inquiry or trial was commenced; in other words, such person must be deemed to be an accused at the time of commitment because it is at that point of time the Sessions Court in law takes cognizance of the offence. [312G] (3) Under s. 193 read with s. 209 of the Code when a case is committed 1 to the Court of Sessions in respect of an offence the Court of Sessions takes cognizance of the offence and not of the accused and once the Session Court is properly seized of the case as a result of the committal order against some accused the power under s. 319(1) can come into play and such Court can add any person, not an accused before it, as an accused and direct him to be tried alongwith the other accused for the offence which such added accused appears to have committed, from the evidence recorded at the trial. Looking at the provision from this angle there would be no question of reading s. 319(1) subject or subordinate to s. 193. [313H-314B] (4) The expression "any person not being the accused" clearly covers any person who is not being tried already by the Court. The very purpose of enacting such a provision like s. 319(1) clearly shows that even persons, who have been dropped by the police during investigation but against whom evidence showing their involvement in the offence comes before the criminal court are included in the said expression.
