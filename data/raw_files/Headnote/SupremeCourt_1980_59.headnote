 The petitioner was found guilty of burning his wife by the Court below. By Special Leave Petition, the Petitioner sought to discredit the dying declarations.
 Dismissing the Petition, ^ 
 HELD: Concurrent findings of fact cannot be disturbed on enormity of improbability. The dying declarations under Section 32 of the Evidence Act, are the groaning utterances of a dying woman in the grip of dreadful agony which cannot be judged by the standards of fullness of particulars which witnesses may give in other situations. To discredit such dying declarations for shortfalls here and there or even in many places, is unrealistic, unnatural and unconscionable, if basically there is credibility. [280E-G]
