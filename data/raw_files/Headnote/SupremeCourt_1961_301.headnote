 The petitioners, who were holders of Khor Posh grants from the Rulers of Talcher, Bamra and Kalahandi before these states merged with the Dominion of India, challenged the constitutional validity of certain orders passed by the State 406 of Orissa and the Union of India annulling those grants which the Petitioners claimed were based on the law and custom prevailing in these states relating to maintenance of the junior members of the Ruling family. The grant in controversy in Petition No. 79 of 1957, made by the Ruler of Talcher under Order 31 of the Rules and Regulations of the State of Talcher, 1937, originally of land but converted in 1944 into money grant, was regularly paid till April 1949.
 The grant in Petition No. 167 of 1958, made by the Ruler of Bamra prior to January 1, 1948, was annulled on June 8, 1949, by the Government of Orissa as the delegate of the Government of India under s. 4 of the Extra Provincial Jurisdiction Act 1947. The petitioner in Petition 168 of 1958 was the same as in the previous petition. He was granted an increased allowance by the Ruler of Bamra on December 8, 1947. The grant was recognised on June 11, 1949, but paid at a reduced rate from April 1, 1948, to July 1, 1957, and was annulled by a statement made on June 29, 1957, by the Chief Minister of Orissa in Legislature. The allowance in favour of the first petitioner in Petition No. 4 of 1959; the widow of the late Maharaja of Kalahandi, fixed by the Political Department of the Government of India in 1939, and the allowance granted to the second petitioner by the Ruler, were paid till they were annulled by the aforesaid statement of the Chief Minister of Orissa. By the Merger Agreements signed by the Rulers on or after December 14, 1947, Sovereignty over these States vested in the Dominion of India before January 1, 1948, and in exercise of its powers under s. 3(2) of the Extra Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947, which came into effect on December 24, 1949, the Central Government delegated its powers to the Government of Orissa to administer the States. On January 1, 1948, the Government of Orissa in exercise of its powers under s. 4 of that Act made an order called the Administration of Orissa States Order, 1948, para.
 4(b) of which provided, inter alia, that all prior laws, which included Rules, Regulations, byelaws and orders, whether based on custom or usage, would continue in force until altered or amended by an order under the Extra Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947. By s. 3 of the States' Merger (Governors' Provinces) Order, 1949, which came into effect on August 1, 1949, these States became parts of the Province of Orissa. Section 4 of the Order provided that all laws in force in a merged State before that day including orders made under ss. 3 or 4 of the Extra Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947, would continue in force until repealed modified or amended by a competent legislature or other competent authority. The case of the petitioners was that by these provisions the grants were recognised by the new sovereign and their abrogation by executive action amounted to infringement 407 of fundamental rights guaranteed by Arts. 14, 19(1)(f) and 31 of the Constitution A preliminary objection was taken on behalf of the respondents in the first two Petitions that the grants in question having been annulled prior to the Constitution, no writs could issue thereunder and it was urged, that in any view of the matter, the orders annulling the grant amounted to acts of state and their legality could not be canvassed in a Municipal Court.
 ^ Held, that the preliminary objection had no substance and must fail. Since the grants at the time they were annulled had ceased to be grants of land and been converted to money allowances, payable periodically at regular intervals, every periodic deprivation gave the petitioners the right to approach the court and it was not until 1957 that the protracted correspondence between the parties for the revision of the impugned orders came to an end.
 The expression 'act of state' means the acquisition of sovereignty by a state over foreign territory by conquest, treaty, cession or otherwise. That act may take place on a particular date or by a gradual process but sovereign power, including the right to legislate for and administer the acquired territory, may be acquired before the merger. No Municipal Court has, however, the power to judge the propriety or legality of such an act relating either to public or private rights nor can it enforce obedience to ordinary principles of International law relating to rights of private property which a new sovereign is presumed to respect. Individual citizens cannot enforce such rights even though they may be protected by the treaty since they are no parties to the stipulations. It is only when the new sovereign recognises the Municipal Courts that they can have the power and jurisdiction to investigate and ascertain only such rights as it chooses to recognise either by legislation or agreement or otherwise. Recognition may be express or implied from its dealing with those rights.
 Such recognition, however, is a matter within thee jurisdiction of the Municipal Courts, but the onus of proving it must be on the claimant.

 408 Judged in the light of these principles, there could be no doubt that Order 31 of the Rules and Regulations of the State of Talcher, 1937, had the effect of law, having been continued in force by sub-para. (b) of Para. 4 of the administration of Orissa States order 1948, in the absence of any legislation to the contrary under the Extra Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947. The said Rules and Regulations were existing law within the meaning of Art. 327 of the constitution. It was wholly immaterial whether the grant by the former Ruler was a legislative or an executive act.

 The wide language of sub-par. (b) of para.
 (4) of the Order of 1948, read with the Explanation, left no manner of doubt that the new sovereign by that Order had recognised the Khorposh grant made to the petitioner.
 It was not correct to say that the impugned order annulling the grant could be sustained under ss. 3(1) and (5) of the Extra Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947. Section 3(1), properly construed, could not override s. 4 of the Act and an order made thereunder by a competent authority could be superseded only by another under the section itself. Section 5 of the Act could not be so construed as to authorise the abrogation of a law continued in force by s. 4 or an order passed thereunder The entire Act must be read harmoniously so as to give effect to each one of its provisions. It must, therefore, be held that the annulment by executive action was not justified.
 It was not, therefore, necessary for disposing of this matter to consider whether the petitioner was entitled to the protection of s.
 299(1) of the Government of India Act, 1935.
 Johnstone v. Pedlar, [1921] UKHL 1; (1921) L.R. 2 A.C. 262, considered.
 Since the order impugned by Petition No. 167 of 1958 was made in terms of s. 4 of the Extra Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947, it had the effect of law, and was not open to investigation by this Court.
 The right of the petitioner in Petition No.
 168 of 1958, having been recognised on June 11, 1949, in modification of the grant by the Ex-Ruler and implemented, it could not be abrogated by a mere executive fiat.
 The orders of annulment in Petition 4 of 1959 must also for the same reasons be held to be unjustified.
 409 Per Sarkar and Mudholkar, JJ.-Section 299(1) of the Government of India Act, 1935 could be of no help to the grantee from an Ex-Ruler unless his right had been recognised by the new sovereign so as to enable him to establish the same in its municipal courts. That section could only protect such rights as the new citizen had at the moment of his becoming a citizen of the Dominion of India. It did neither enlarge his rights nor cure any infirmity in them.
