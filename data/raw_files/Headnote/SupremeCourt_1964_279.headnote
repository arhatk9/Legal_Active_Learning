 The appellant firm applied for registration under s. 26-A of the Indian Income-tax Act. In the application the persons recited as partners were a Yam shop-another firm and four other persons and the collective share of the Yarn shop and the shares of the other partners were set out. The Income- tax Officer rejected the application and his order was confirmed in appeal by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal. The Tribunal held that because in the deed of partnership benefits to which certain minors were admitted and particulars "about the distribution of profits or losses in the manner in which the firm wanted the same to be distributed" were not specified, and because by the deed of partnership the yarn shop was introduced as a partner in the firm, the privilege of registration under s. 26A must be denied to the firm. The question was referred to the High Court, which too answered similarly. In appeal by special leave, HELD: The appeal must be allowed.
 (i) If the statutory conditions which qualify the firm for registration are fulfilled, an arrangement between some of the partners, which binds them to distribute the profits under a stipulation which is not a part of the partnership agreement does not effect the right to claim registration of the partnership agreement.

 (ii) The word "specify" is used in s. 26A and Rule 2 as meaning mentioning, describing or defining in detail; it does not mean expressly setting out in fractional or other shares. [314 D-E] (iii) If the conditions for registration of a firm are fulfilled, the Income-tax Officer has no power to reject the application. Undoubtedly, the application must strictly be in conformity with the Act and the Rules, but in so ascertaining, the dead of partnership must be reasonably construed. [311 G]
