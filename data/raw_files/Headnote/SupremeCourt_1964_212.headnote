 The Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay published a resolution under s. 354R of the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, 1888, declaring a certain area to be a clearance area.
 After the expiry of the period within which persons affected by it had to lodge objections thereto, the Corporation submitted a clearance order to the State Government, under s. 354RA for confirmation. After confirmation an agreement was entered into between the Corporation and the landlords of certain buildings in the clearance area for the demolition of those buildings. The tenants therein, filed a suit in the City Civil Court against the Corporation and landlords contending that : (i) ss. 354R and 354RA were ultra vires as they did not provide for the giving of an opportunity to the tenants to show that the premises did not require to be demolished, and (ii) the action of defendants was mala fide because it was taken under unconstitutional provisions and also because no opportunity was -given to them to object to the proposed action. The suit was dismissed on the ground that the only remedy of the plaintiffs was to file an appeal against the clearance order to the Judge, City Civil Court, under Schedule GG, cl. (2) of the Act. An appeal to the High Court was also dismissed but in Letters Patent Appeal, the High Court remitted the matter to the trial Court, after allowing the plaintiffs to amend the plaint. By the amendment the plaintiffs shifted their ground by saying that the landlords wrongfully and fraudulently induced the Corporation to make the order. The Court also gave directions for taking additional evidence and for examining certain specified persons as witnesses.
 The Corporation appealed to the Supreme Court.
 
HELD : (i) The interest of the tenants in the demised premises is property within the meaning of Art. 19 (1) (f) of the Constitution. Since however, s. 354RA and Schedule GG afford opportunities to them to object to a clearance order, it follows that the restrictions on the tenants' right to hold property, enacted by ss. 354R and 354RA, are not unreasonable and that the provisions are valid. [554 C;
 558 D-E].
 (ii) Upon the view that the sections are valid, it must further follow that it was open to the plaintiffs to prefer an appeal under Schedule GG cl. (2) to the Judge, City Civil Court as the tenants were "persons aggrieved" within the meaning of the clause. Finality is given to a clearance order after its confirmation by the Government and its publication, subject only to the result of an appeal so preferred. If no such appeal was 543 preferred or if such appeal was filed and dismissed no remedy by suit was available to a person like a tenant whose contention was that he was aggrieved by a clearance order. L558 E-G].
 (iii) The High Court was in error in allowing the amendment to the plaint and in remitting the suit for a virtual retrial[552 F].
 By the amendment, the -plaintiffs were making out a new case of fraud for which there was not the slightest basis in the plaint. Also the power under 0. XLI, r.27 of the code, was only for removing a lacuna in the evidence and did not entitle the High Court to let in fresh evidence at the appellate stage, where even without such evidence it could pronounce judgment in the case. Further, the High Court should not have given directions for examining specified persons as it was beyond its competence to virtually oblige a party to examine any particular witness. [547 F; 548 G-H;
 552 G-H].
