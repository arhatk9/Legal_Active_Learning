 The legislative assembly for the Union Territory of Pondicherry passed the Pondicherry General Sales Tax Act (10 of 1965) which was published on June 30, 1965. Section 1(2) of the Art provided, that it would come into force on such date as the Pondicherry Government may, by notification, appoint and s.., 2(1) provided that the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1959, as in force in the State of Madras immediately before the Commencement of the Pondicherry Act, shall be extended to Pondicherry subject to certain modifications, one of which related to the constitution of the Appellate Tribunal. The Act also enacted a Schedule, giving the description of goods, the point of levy 'and the rates of tax. The Pondicherry Government issued a notification on March 1, 1966, appointing April 1, 1966 as the date of commencement. Prior to the issue of the notification, the Madras legislature had amended the Madras Act and consequently it was the Madras Act as amended up to April 1, 1966 which was brought into force in Pondicherry.
 When the Act had come into force, the petitioner was served with a notice to register himself as a dealer and he thereupon filed a writ petition challenging the validity of the Act.
 After the petition was filed, the Pondicherry Legislature passed the Pondicherry General Sales Tax (Amendment) Act, 13 of 1966, whereby s. 1(2) of the principal Act was amended to read that the latter Act ,,shall come into force on the 1st day of April 1966", it was also provided that all taxes levied or collected and all proceedings taken and things done were to be deemed valid as if the principal Act as amended had been in force at all material times.
 
HELD : (per Subba Rao, C.J., Shelat and Mitter JJ.) The Act of 1965 was void and still-born and could not be revived by the Amendment Act of 1966.
 The Pondicherry Legislature not only adopted the Madras Act as it stood at the date when it passed the principal Act, but in effect also enacted that if the Madras legislature were to amend its Act prior to the notification of its extension to Pondicherry, it would be the amended Act that would apply. The Legislature at that stage could not anticipate that the Madras Act would not be amended nor could it predicate what amendments would be carried out or whether they would be of a sweeping 651 character or whether they would be suitable in Pondicherry.
 The result was that the Pondicherry Legislature accepted the amended Act though, it was-not and could not be aware what the provisions of the amended. Act would be. There was, in these circumstances, a total surrender in the matter of sales tax legislation by the Pondicherry Assembly in favour of the Madras Legislature. [660 D-G] The principal Act was not saved for the reason that it contained certain provisions relating to the Appellate Tribunal and a Schedule independent of the madras Act. The core of a taxing statute is the charging section and the provisions relating to the levy of such tax- and defining the persons who are liable to pay the tax. If that core disappears, the renaming provisions have no efficacy [660 H] In re Delhi Laws Act, 1912, etc. [1951] INSC 35; [1951] S.C.R, 747, explained and distinguished.

 The Amendment Act was passed on the footing that there was in, existence a valid Act; it was and was intended to be an amendment of the principal Act. It could not be construed as an independent legislation and therefore it could not be said that the Pondicherry Legislature I re-enacted the principal Act extending the Madras Act as amended up to April 1, 1966, to Pondicherry.

 Per Shah and Bhargava, JJ.. (dissenting) : The delegation of power by the Pondicherry Legislature to the Pondicherry Government was to the extent that the latter could either bring into force the Madras Act as itstood when the principal Act was published or could, at its option, enforce, the Madras Act as subsequently amended by the Madras Legislature,, which would amount to giving it discretion to apply a future law to be passed by the Madras Legislature. [666 C-D] But even assuming that the principal Act was bad for exsive delegation of powers when it was enacted and published, the subsequent Amending Act passed by the Pondicherry Legislature had the effect of bringing into force in Pondicherry a valid Act, under which proceedings sought to be taken against the petitioner were fully justified. [668 E] Initially, when the principal Act came into force in Pondicherry with effect from 1st April, 1966, the amendments made by the Madras Legislature also became effective in Pondicherry, because the Pondicherry Government notified that the principle Act was to commence with effect from ist April, 1966; but, subsequently, when the Amending Act was passed by the Pondicherry Legislature, that Legislature itself decided that the Madras Act which should come into force in the territory of Pondicherry cherry should be the amended Madras Act, and by the retrospective operation of the Amending Act, the effect of any excessive delegation was, removed.
