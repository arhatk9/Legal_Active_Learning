 The assessee respondent made advance payment of tax under s.
 18 A (1) of the Income-tax Act' for the assessmetn 163 year 1952-53. A part- of the amount paid was found refund- able on regular assessment on August 30, 1952. On September 11, 1952, a sum of Rs. 14,720-14-0 was paid to the respondent as interest under s. 18 A (3), on the amount refundable as it then stood. The sub-section was amended on May 24, 1953, with retrospective effect from April 1, 1932.
 Under the law as it stood after the amendment the assessee was entitled to Rs. 9,404-5-0 and no more. The Income-tax Officer issued a notice under s. 34 (1) (b) proposing to recover the excess paid by way of reassessment on the grounds that the respondent bad been under-assessed and also that it had been allowed excessive relief. By an order made by him based on the latter ground, he directed recovery of the excess. The respondent moved the High Court under Art.
 226 of the Constitution and that court set aside the order.
 Held, that S. 34 of the Act had no application. None of the conditions for its applicability had been fulfilled in the present case.
 The case was not one of under-assessment but really one of over-assessraent though provisional for more had been paid in advance as tax than was found payable. Neither was the case one of grant of excessive.relief for the interest paid by the Government on the amount paid by the assessee in excess of what was found to be due, was not a grant of relief to the assessee at all. Excess payment of such interest cannot, therefore, be a case where excess relief has been allowed to an assessee, Sub-sections (8) and (11) of s. 18 A deal with interest payable by an assessee and do not show that interest payable by the Government under s. 18 A (3) is part of tax payable by the assessee so as to lead to a contention that excess allowance of such interest was in substance grant of excess relief to the assesse.
 It could not also be said that the interest payable by the Government to an assessee for tax paid in advance was a tax paid by the, assessce.
