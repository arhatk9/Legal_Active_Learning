 Six posts of Readers in the English Department of the University fell vacant and applications were invited by advertisement. The appellants and respondents 5 to 10, among others were applicants and they were all serving as lecturer in the University at that time. Since section 29 of the Allahabad University Act, 1921 stipulates that teachers of the University shall be appointed by the Executive Council on the recommendations of the Selection Committee, a Selection Committee was constituted. The selection committee has to do the statutory exercise of choosing the best among the applicants in conformity with the minimum qualifications prescribed under ordinance 9(2) of the University. But the committee chose to interview the candidates who were otherwise eligible for consideration. 13 applicants turned up for interview. Respondent 9, Dr. Rhattacharya and appellant Skand Gupta resented the viva voce test as unauthorized and did not care to appear for the interview.
 However Dr. Bhattacharya. On being persuaded, did later turn up, was interviewed and eventually included in the Select List. Skand Gupta did not enjoy the benefit of a second pursuation to present himself for interview, did not appear before the Selection Committee and missed the bus.
 Respondents S to 10 were chosen and on the recommendation, the Executive Council made their appointment. The appellants thereupon moved the Chancellor under section 42 of the Act requesting him to cancel the appointments of respondents 5 to 10. But by an order dated November 22, 1973 he upheld the selection and appointment. The appellant, therefore, moved the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution and impugned the selection process and the appointments on various grounds. The learned single judge considered the merits of the contentions and concluded that the selections and the consequent appointments were bad in law except in regard to respondents 7 and 10 and directed the University to make fresh selection and fill UP the vacancies.
 Respondents 5 to 6 and 8 and 9 went in appeal to the Division Bench which accepted their appeals and reversed the judgment of the single judge in its entirety and hence the appeal by special leave.
 Allowing the appeal the Court, ^ 
 HELD: 1. Any Administrative or quasi-judicial body clothed with powers and left unfettered by procedures is free to device its own pragmatic, flexible and functionally viable processes of transacting business subject, of course, to the basics of natural justice, fair play in action, reasonableness in collecting decisional materials, avoidance of arbitrariness and extraneous considerations and 903 other vise keeping within the leading strings of the law.
 Though there is no flaw in the methodology of interviews, certainly, cases arise where the art of interviewing candidates deteriorates from strategy to stratagem and undetectable manipulation of results is achieved by remote control tactics masked as viva voce tests. This, if allowed is surely a sabotage of the purity or proceedings, a subterfuge whereby legal means to reach illegal ends is achieved. So, it is that Courts insist on recording of marks at interviews and other fair checks like guidelines for marks and remarks, about candidates and the like. If the Court is skeptical, the record of the Selection proceedings, including the notes regarding the interviews may have to be made available. Interviews, as such, are not bad but polluting it to attain illegitimate ends is bad [908 H, 909 A-C] 
 2. Social scientists and educational avant garde may find pitfalls in our system of education and condemn the unscientific aspects of marks as the measure of merit, things as they now stand. But, however imperfect and obtuse the current system and however urgent the modernization of our courses culminating in examinations may be, the fact remains that the Court has to go by what is extent and cannot explore on its own or ignore the measure of merit adopted by universities. Judges must not rush in where even educationists fear to tread. So the criterion of marks and class, the Allahabad University bas laid down is sound, although to swear religiously by class and grade may be exaggerated reverence and false scales if strictly scrutinized by progressive n criteria. [909,E-G] 
 3. The prescription of a high second class in ordinance 9 is a mandatory minimum. A glance at the relevant portion of ordinance 9 reveals that wherever relaxation of qualifications is intended, the ordinance specifically pelfs it out and by necessary implication, where it has not said so, the possession of such qualification is imperative. The ordinance has a purpose when it prescribes at least a high second class for a Reader's post. It is obligatory. [909 H, 91 O A. C-D] 
 4. "High" is the antithesis of "low" and a high second class is, therefore, a contrast to a low second class. When the range of a second class marks is wide of the candidate who gets that Class with marks within the lower half bracket it cannot be said that he gets a high second class. If he manages to get 48 marks he barely gets a second class not a high second class. And commonsense, which is not an enemy of Courtsense, points clearly to the meaning, of high second class as one where the marks fall a little short of first class marks and he narrowly misses first class. In the context of ordinance 9 and its purpose and the collection of words used viz. 'first class or a high second class', the interpretation will misfire if the Court disregard the intent and effect of the adjective, 'high' and indifferently read it to mean merely the minimum marks needed to bring the candidate within the second class. High is high and a superior second class denotes marks somewhere near first class marks. Even by relaxing, diluting and liberalizing the rigour clearly imported by the draftsman by using the expression "high second class", still it is impermissible to render the word 'high' nugatory or make, by construction, that intensive adjective redundant. Nor did the University has all these years treat a high second class to mean a mere second class and English has not lost its potency in he Allahabad University so 25 to include low in high. The utmost construction would be: Draw a line at mid-point, and marks above and below that line will be high and low second class respectively. In the instant case, the mid-line 904 being 54 those who have not secured above 54 cannot claim to have obtained a high second class and are ineligible. [910 D-H, 911 A, D] 
 5. It is true that the Selection Committee is in expert body. But their expertise in not in law, but in other branches of learning and the final interpretation of an ordinance is a legal skill outside the academic orbit.[911 E-F] 
 6. While there is no absolute ban, it is a rule of prudence that courts should hesitate to dislodge decisions of academic bodies. But university organs, for that matter any authority in our system, is bound by the rule of law and cannot be a law unto itself. If the Chancellor or any other authority lesser in level decides an academic matter or in educational question, the court keeps its hands off; but where a provision of law has to be read and understood, it is not fair to keep the could out. To respect in authority is not to worship it unquestion illegal since the bhakti cult is inept in the critical field of law. In short, while dealing With legal affairs which have an impact on academic bodies, the views of educational experts are entitled to great consideration but not to exclusive wisdom.

 7. An illegal act cannot be deemed to be legal by reading a legislative function into an executive action.
 Were this dubious doctrine applied to Governmental affairs and confusion between executive and legislative functions juries prudently sanctioned, the consequence could well be disastrous to the basics of our democracy. Shall gains in some case should not justify the urging of propositions which are subversive of our constitution. [912 E-F]
