 A condition that the motor vehicle covered by the permit shall not be more than four years old, counted from the date of registration to any time during the validity of the permit is attached to every permit for plying a mini bus. The petitioners contended (i) that this condition amounted to an infringement of Article 14 of the Constitution in that no such condition was attached in the case of omnibuses and (ii) that the authority competent to impose the condition was the authority constituted under the U. P. Act and not tho Regional Transport Authority.
 Dismissing the petitions.

 HELD: It is not correct to say that a condition similar to the one attached to permits issued in the case of mini buses was not attached to the permits issued in the case of omnibuses. In their case too, there is a condition that the vehicle should be replaced on the expiry of five years from the date of registration. Secondly, omnibuses and mini buses constitute different classes and are not comparable. [598 D] The source of power for imposing condition 18 is section 51(2) (x) of the Motor Vehicles Act under which the authority empowered to impose the condition is the Regional Transport Authority. Section 4 of the U. P. Motor Vehicles (Special Provisions) Act, 1976 has nothing whatever to do with the imposition of conditions on mini buses plying as contract carriages. That Act deals with authorization of and use of private mini buses as stage carriage within specified limits covered by an approved scheme. [598 G]
