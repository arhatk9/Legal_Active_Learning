 Section 75(1)(c) of the Employees State Insurance Act 1948 makes it obligatory on the Insurance Court to decide "the rate of contribution payable by a principal employer in respect of any employees" if such question or dispute arises. Section 75(2) also provides that "the claim for the recovery of contributions from the principal employer" shall be decided by it.
 The appellant-Corporation filed five applications under s.
 75 of the Employees State Insurance Act before the Insurance Court, Bhopal (Civil Judge First Class) for recovery from the respondent of employees' contributions payable under s. 39 of the Act for different periods from 27-9-1959 onwards, working out the contribution payable on an "ad hoc basis" by taking the wages at Rs. 100/- per employee per month as indicated by the Central Govern- ment by their notification SRO 224 dated 25-1-1957 issued in exercise of their powers under s. 99A of the Act.The Insurance Court disallowed the claims on the ground that the claims have been made on an "ad hoc basis". The first appeals against that order were allowed by a single Judge of the Madhya Pradesh High Court (Jabalpur Bench) relying on s. 99A of the Act and on a further notification dated 16-1-1968 issued by the Central Government under s.
 99A. The Letters Patent Appeals filed by the respondent were allowed by the Division Bench which held: (1) The power of the Central Government of issuing directions is not absolute and The directions cannot be inconsistent with the Act (22). When under section 45A of the Act a special procedure is prescribed regarding the method of calculation of the employees' contribution, no notification or order can be issued by the Central Government prescribing any other method on ad hoc basis which obviously becomes inconsistent with the other provisions of the Act, namely, section 45A.
 Remanding the matter to the Insurance Court, the Court, HELD:
 (1) The nature of the proceedings under the Employees State, Insurance Act 1948 was not properly understood either by the Employees Insurance Court or by the High Court when the matter was taken before these authorities. [37D] (2) The scheme of the Act is that the. Corporation itself should, in a case where there is omission on the part of the employer to maintain records in accordance with s. 44 of the Act, determine the amount of contribution on the strength of such information as it may collect, make a demand and upon refusal come up before the Insurance Court under s. 75 of the Act. The Court should give the Corporation a direction to perform its duty where it considers that this should be performed by the Corporation. It cannot decline to perform its ,own duty because the Corporation has failed to dis- charge its function.The Insurance Court is under a duty to determine the basis of calculation itself.[36F-H] (3) The notification of the Central Government under s. 99A of the Act was intended to overcome difficulties in deter- mining the wages of the employees.This provision cannot be availed of for the purpose of supplying a defect or overcom- ing a difficulty in adjudication of a dispute for which the Employees Insurance Court is given ample powers under s.
 75(1)(c) and 75(2). [37A-B] 36
