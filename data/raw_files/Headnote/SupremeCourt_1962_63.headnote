 The Income-tax Appellate Tribunal passed an order s. 33(4) of the Indian Income-tax Art disposing of an appeal. The assessee as well as the Commissioner of Income-tax, Calcutta, applied to the High Court for orders requiring the Tribunal to state a case under s. 66(2), which applications were dismissed by the High Court. The assessee and the Commissioner of Income-tax appealed to the Supreme Court against the order of the Tribunal, with special leave. The main contention before the Supreme Court was that even if the appeal against the order of the High Court under s.
 66(2) fails on merits, the court has power to consider the appeal against the order of the Tribunal.
 307 Held, that when the aggrieved party approaches the High Court under a taxing statue for an order calling for a statement of the case and the High Court rejects the appli- cation, this Court in exercise of its powers under Art. let of the Constitution of India will not in- the absence of special or exceptional circumstances allow the order of the High Court to be by-passed by entertaining an appeal directly against the order of the Tribunal under the taxing Act. The Supreme Court will take this view even if an appeal has been filed against the order of the High Court as well.
