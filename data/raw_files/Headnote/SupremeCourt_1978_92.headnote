 Twenty-three watches on which no custom duty was paid were seized from the respondent by the Customs Authorities and in the adjudication proceedings under section 122 of the Customs Act, the Assistant Collector of Customs ordered that the watches which were seized be confiscated and imposed a penalty of Rs. 250/- on the respondent under Section 112 of the Act. In appeal, the Appellate Collector by his order dated 22-2-1972 vacated "without prejudice" the order of the Assistant Collector mainly on the ground that the Assistant Collector had not complied with the rules of natural justice. The department interpreted the order as an implied order of remand and issued a fresh notice to the respondent on 27-7-1972 and started fresh adjudication proceedings.
 Thereafter, the respondent filed in the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, a writ petition which was allowed. The notice and the fresh adjudication proceedings were quashed.
 Allowing the appeal by special leave, the Court 
HELD : 1. Where an order passed in appeal vacates the order of the first tribunal on purely technical grounds and expressly states that it was being passed without prejudice which means an order not on the merits of the case, such an order does not debar fresh adjudicatory proceedings which may be justified under the law. It is necessary for the court interpreting an order of this kind to give full and complete effect to the exact words used by the authorities and not to draw a sweeping conclusion merely from the fact that no explicit direction has been made by the appellate authority. [735 C-D] 
2. (a) Whenever an order is struck down as invalid being in violation of the principles of natural justice there is no final decision of the cause and fresh proceedings are left open. All that is done. is that the order assailed by virtue of its inherent defect is vacated but the proceedings are not terminated.
 [732 C] (b) In the instant case A perusal of the order of the Appellate Authority clearly shows two important facts : (1) that the Appellant Collector has not set aside or vacated the order of the Assistant Collector on merits but has vacated it only on a technical infirmity, namely, the violation of the rules of natural justice and that is why the Appellate Collector has advisedly used the words "without prejudice" in his order, (2) that the Assistant Collector in his order dated 30th June. 1969 had directed confiscation of the watches and imposed a penalty of Rs. 250/- and if the Appellate Collector intended to set aside this order completely and irrevocably then he should have passed a consequential order for refund of the amount of the penalty and release of the property confiscated. The fact that no such order was passed by the Appellate Collector clearly shows that he never intended to bar fresh adjudicatory proceedings provided they were conducted according to the principles of natural justice. [731 A, 732 A-C] (ii) The Appellate Collector found that the order of the Assistant Collector suffered from a serious procedural infirmity, viz., that it was passed without 12-315SCI/78 730 giving the respondent a proper opportunity of being heard, and therefore, it cannot be said that fresh proceedings by complying with the rules of natural justice could not be started against the respondent. The Appellate Collector has clearly used the words "without prejudice" which also indicate that the order of the Collector was not final and irrevocable. [732 G-H, 733 A] M/s Thimmasamudram Tobacco Co. v. Assistant Collector of Central Excise, Nellore Dt. Nellore, A.I.R. 1961 A.P. 324 approved.
 
3. (a) The implication of the term "without prejudice" means (1) that the cause or the matter has not been decided on merits, (2) that fresh proceedings according to law were not barred. It is true that the Appellate Collector does not say in so many words that the case is remanded to the Assistant Collector but the tenor and the spirit of the order clearly shows that what he intended was that fresh proceedings should be started against the respondent after complying with the rules of natural justice. [733E-F] (b) A true interpretation of the order of the Appellate Collector would be that the order of the Assistant Collector was a nullity having violated the rules of natural justice and having been vacated the parties would be relegated to the position which they occupied before the order of the Assistant Collector was passed. In this view of the matter the Assistant Collector had ample jurisdiction in issuing the notice against the respondent in order to start fresh adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with law.
