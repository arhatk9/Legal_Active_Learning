 The petitioner's claim, by virtue of the, provisions of s.
 6(1)(f) of the West Bengal Estate Acquisition Act, 1954, for his entitlement, as an intermediary, to retain the land in which he has raised in addition to mango and Jack fruit trees, bamboo clumps and also banana-plants, was allowed by the Courts below but rejected by the Calcutta High Court in appeal by the State of West Bengal. The High Court held that though cultivated bamboo garden would fall within the definition of 'Agricultural land' in s. 2(b) of the Act, it cannot in any view be called an 'Orchard' within the purview of s. 6(t)(f) of the Act. It further held that a banana plantation is not an 'Orchard' because banana plants are not fruit-trees.
 Dismissing the special leave petition the Court, 
HELD : 1. In view of clause (p) of Section 2 of the West Bengal Estate Acquisition Act, 1954 read with s. 14K(e) of the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, the existence of cultivated fruit trees on a compact area, is central to the connotation of 'Orchard'. A tree is "a perennial plant having a self-supporting woody main stem or trunk (which usually develops wood branches at some distance from the ground), and growing to a considerable height." [10.H, 11 A- B] (2) A plant to come within the connotation of 'tree' must have two essential characteristics : (a) It must be perennial and not seasonal; and (b) Its main stem must be "woody" and not herbacious or pulpy. A banana plant lacks both these characteristics. It is not a perennial plant, but is more in the nature of seasonal crop lasting for one or one and a quarter years. Once the :plant yields fruit, it becomes useless and does not yield any further fruit.
 Further, its stem is not "woody" but "fleshy" or 'herbacious". A banana plant, therefore, cannot be regarded as a fruit-tree and a banana plantation is not an 'Orchard' within the contemplation of s. 6(1)(f) of the Act. [11 B-C, E]
