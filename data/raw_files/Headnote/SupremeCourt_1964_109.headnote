 The Rohtas Industries Ltd. issued in 1945 shares at a pre- mium and the share premiums so received were, kept separate under the head Capital Reserve. In the calendar year ending December 31, 1953, the company paid a sum of Rs. 50,787/- as dividend to the appellant company. For the year 1954-55, this sum was taxed in the hands of appellant as dividend by the Income-tax Officer. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner set aside the order of the Income-tax Officer, but the same was restored by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal. The Tribunal referred to the Punjab High Court the question whether on "he facts and in the circumstances of the case, the receipt of Rs. 50,787/- was a receipt of dividend and was taxable under the Indian Income-tax Act.
 The High Court answered the question against the appellant and the latter appealed this Court with special leave.
 Dismissing the appeal.
 Held: The receipt of Rs. 50,787/- was a receipt of dividend :and was taxable under the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922. It was well-established before the Companies Act, 1956, that premiums received on the issue of shares were profits available for distribution and the word "profits" in Regulation 97 of Table A of Companies Act 1913 should be understood to include share premiums also. S. 78 of the Companies Act does not in any way change the taxability of dividends declared out of premiums on shares received by a Company before the Act of 1956 came into force. If it was taxable, apart from s. 78, it remains so taxable.
