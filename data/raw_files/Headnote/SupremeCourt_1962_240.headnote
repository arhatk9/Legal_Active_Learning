 The word 'subordinate' used without any qualification in s.
 165 of the Indian Penal Code indicates that the Legislature intended to include within its ambit also such subordinates as had no connection with the functions with which the proceeding or business was concerned. That word cannot be read as functionally subordinate' so as to defeat the inten- tion and policy of the Legislature.
 Consequently where an Assistant Controller of Imports was prosecuted for accepting valuable things for helping an applicant, who had appealed to the joint Chief Controller of Imports and Exports. to secure a permit to export goods and was convicted under s. 165 of the Indian Penal Code by the special Judge and such conviction was affirmed by the High Court and the contention on appeal to this Court was that, although the appellant might be administratively subordinate to the joint Chief Controller of Imports and Exports, he was not functionally so, having nothing to do with export permits, and was not, therefore, liable under the section.
 Held, that the appellant was subordinate to the joint Chief Controller of Imports and Exports within the meaning of the section and had been rightly convicted.
