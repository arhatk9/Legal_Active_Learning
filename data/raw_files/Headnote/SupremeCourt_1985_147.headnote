 The assessee, a partnership firm, took over the running business of an earlier firm with all the assets and liabilities including a debt of Rs.23,577. The assessee paid income tax on the interest income accruing on the aforesaid amount of debt for the assessment year 1963-64. On March 31, 1965 the assessee and the debtor entered into a settlement whereby a sum of Rs.25,000 was accepted by the assessee in satisfaction of the debt and the amount of interest due thereon. The balance of Rs. 15,100 was written off by the assessee as irrecoverable. The assessee also incurred a sum of Rs. 6,880 as legal expenses on filing an appeal which arose out of a suit already instituted by the predecessor firm for recovering a sum due from the Central Government.
 In assessment proceedings for the assessment year 1965- 66, the assessee claimed deduction of the aforesaid two amounts written off as bad debts. The Income Tax Officer disallowed both the claims. On appeal, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax allowed the claims of the assessee-firm holding that the business transferred from the predecessor firm to the assessee continued uninterrupted, and the change of ownership was no bar to the bad debt being allowed. The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal and the High Court confirmed the view taken by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. Hence this appeal.
 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: (1) The money owed by a debtor under a transaction with a predecessor firm can be written off as irrecoverable in the accounts of the successor, the assessee, in a subsequent year and could be claimed as a bad debt under clause (vii) of sub-s.(1) of s.36 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. [24 A-B] 21 (2) When a business along with its assets and liabilities is transferred by one owner to another, there is no reason why a debt so transferred should not be entitled to the same treatment in the hands to the successor. The recovery of the debt is a right transferred along with the numerous other rights comprising the subject of the transfer. If the law permits the transferer to that the whole or part of the debt as irrecoverable and to claim a deduction on that account, it seems difficult to accept that the same right should not be recognized in the transferee.
 It is merely an incident flowing from the transfer of the business, together with its assets and liabilities, from the previous owner to the transferee. It is a right which should, on a proper appreciation of all that is implied in the transfer of a business, be regarded as belonging to the new owner. [25 E-H] (3) Even if the debt had been taken into account in computing the income of the predecessor firm only and had subsequently been written off as irrecoverable in the accounts of the accounts of the assessee would still have been entitled to a deduction of the amount written off as a bad debt. It is not imperative that the assessee referred to in sub-clause (a) must necessarily mean the identical assessee referred to in sub-section(b). A successor to the pertinent interest of a previous assessee would be covered within the terms of sub-clause (b). the successor assesee, In effect, steps into the shoes of his predecessor. [26 E-F] In the present case, the debt was taken into account in the income of the assessee for the assessment year 1963-64 when the interest income accruing thereon was taxed in the hands of the assessee. It is the same assessee who has subsequently, pursuant to a settlement, accepted part payment of the debt in full satisfaction and has written off the balance of the debt as irrecoverable in his accounts.
 Therefore the conditions in both sub-clause (a) and (b) of Clause (1) of sub-s.(2) of s.36 are satisfied. The same test has to be applied for acknowledging the claim to deduction of Rs. 6,880. [26 B-D]
