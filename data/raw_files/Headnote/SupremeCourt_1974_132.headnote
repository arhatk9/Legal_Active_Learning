 The trial court and first appellate court held in plaintiffs favour. A second appeal to the High Court by that time the Act had come into force and the High Court the decision.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : An appeal is a rehearing and in moulding the relief to be granted in case on appeal, the appellate Court is entitled to take into account even facts and events which have come into existence after the passing of the decree appealed against. If the High Court were to confirm the decree allowing the suit for pre-emption, it would be passing a decree in a suit for pre-emption. for. when the appellate court confirms a decree it passes a decree of its own, and therefore, the High Court was right in allowing the appeal.
