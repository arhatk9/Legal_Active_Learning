 The appellant challenged the election of the respondent to the Bihar Legislative Assembly by an election petition on the ground that his own nomination paper had been improperly rejected by the Returning Officer. On January 21, 1967 the date fixed for scrutiny of nomination papers under s. 36 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. the Returning Officer rejected the nomination paper of the appellant on the ground that he was not qualified to be chosen to fill a seat in the State Legislature requisite since he had not made and subscribed the oath or affirmation as enjoined by clause (a) of Art.173 of the Constitution. The High Court rejected the appellant's election petition.
 It was contended for the appellant that s. 36(2) that the petitioner had not made and subscribed an oath or affirmation according to the form set out in the Third Schedule of the Constitution, he was entitled to make and subscribe the oath or affirmation immediately before the objection was considered by the Returning officer. As soon as a candidate makes or subscribes the oath or affirmation, he would become qualified under Art. 173 of the Constitution, and this qualification would exist "on the date fixed for the scrutiny" within the meaning of s. 36(2) because the date of scrutiny of nomination papers-in this case January 21, 1967-would not have passed away by ,the time the oath or affirmation is taken or subscribed.
 HELD : dismissing the appeal.
 The expression "on the date fixed for scrutiny" in s. 36(2) (a) means "on the whole of the day on which the scrutiny of nomination has to take place". In other words, the qualification must exist from the earliest moment of the day of scrutiny. On this date the Returning Officer has to decide the objections and the objections have to be made by the other candidates after examining the nomination papers and in the light of s. 36(2) of the Act and other provisions. On the date of the scrutiny the other candidates should be in a position to, raise all possible objections before the scrutiny of a particular nomination paper starts. [817 F-H] Paynter v. James, (1866-67) L.R. 2 C.P. 348 and Reg v.
 Humphery[1839] EngR 314; , 10 Ad. & E. 335; referred to.
 The fact that there was no place in form. 2B prescribed under the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 where it can be stated by the candidates that he had taken the requisite oath or -affirmation does not mean that the oath or affirmation can be taken and subscribed on the date fixed for -scrutiny. The nomination 'paper does not provide for the statement about 813 the oath because the oath or affirmation has to be taken after a candidate has been nominated. It cannot be said that a person can be regarded its nominated only when, after scrutiny of the nomination papers, the Returning Officer finds him to be validly nominated. The form of oath does not say "having been validly nominated" but only "having been nominated". [818 E] Shiva Shankar Kanodia v. Kapildeo Narain Singh, Election Appeal No. 4 of 1965; judgment dated September 22, 1965 of the Patna High Court; disapproved.
 The words "having been nominated" in the form of the oath or affirmation in the third Schedule to the Constitution clearly show that the oath or affirmation cannot be taken or made by a candidate before he has been nominated as a candidate. Further, it is clear that none of the sections from s. 30 to s. 36 require that this oath should accompany the ,nomination paper. No reference has been made to, the form of oath in s. 33 or s. 35, although in s. 33 it is provided that in certain cases the nomination paper should be accompanied by a declaration or by a certificate issued by the Election Commission.
