 Succession contemplated by s. 25(4) of the Indian Income-tax Act, (XI of 1922) involves change of ownership, that is, the transferor goes out and the transferee comes in. It connotes that the whole business is transferred. It also implies that substantially the identity and the continuity of the business are preserved. If there is a transfer of a business, any arrangement between the transferor and the transferee in respect of some of the assets and liabilities, not with a view to enable the transferor to run a part of the business transferred but to enable the transferee to run the business unhampered by any load of debts, or, for any other appropriate collateral purpose, cannot detract from the totality of succession.

 The tests crystallised by decisions have given a legal content to the expression "succession" in s. 25(4) of the Act and whether facts proved satisfy those tests would be a mixed question of law and fact. The High Court would therefore have jurisdiction under s. 66(1) of the Act, to ascertain the correctness of a finding given by the Tribunal on the question of succession.
