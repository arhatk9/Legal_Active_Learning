 The appellant companies carried on the business of manufacturing chemical in a vilage. There were disputes between the companies and their workmen. regarding dearness allowance, transport allowance and other demands. In regard to transport allowance the Tribunal in its award directed the employers to pay 15 paise per day to workmen who lived more than five miles away from the place of work except on days when a workman was on leave. in doing so the Tribunal took into account the fact that in the same region a pbarmaceutical company was paying transport allowance to its workmen. The Tribunal rejected the contention of the companies that it was not the obligation of an employer to provide transport facilities for the workmen or to pay in whole or in part their transport expenses.
 In appeal by special leave, 
HELD : (i) The principle that in a proper case the Industrial Tribu nal can impose new obligation on the employer in the interest of social justice and can also involve the parties in a new Contract has been accepted by this Court. There can be no doubt that an Industrial Tribu- nal has jurisdiction to make a proper and reasonable order in an industrial dispute. [779 F; 780 D] (ii) The Tribunal was justified in having regard to the practice obtaining in the region on the principle of region- cum industry when considering the claim of the workmen for payment of transport allowance. The foundation of the principle of region-cum-industry is that as far as possible their should be uniformity of conditions of service in comparable concerns in the industry in the region as that there is no balance ,in the conditions of service between workmen in one establishment and those in the rest. The danger otherwise would be migration of labour to 'he one where there are more favourable conditions from those where conditions are less favourable. [780 B-C; 781 A-B] (iii) When the Tribunal was fixing the wage scales and dearness allowance it was aware that it had also to adjudicate on a claim for transport allowance. Having regard to this claim it must have fixed the wage scales and dearness allowance. In the scale of dearness allowance fixed by the Tribunal complete neutralisation has not been awarded. The Tribunal had also proceeded on the basis that the workmen must bear, from and out of the wages earned by them, a part of transport expenses. It was only when the Tribunal found that the expense incurred by the workmen for transport was rather high that it had afforded some relief.
 771 No material had been placed before this Court on behalf of the companies concerned to how that in the preparation of the cost of living index in the area concerned transport expense can be taken into account [781 D-F; 777 G] (iv) In the circumstances of the case it could not be stated that the award of the sum of 15 paise per day was in any manner unreasonable or arbitrary. The payment had also been hedged in by the condition that the employer had to be satisfied that the workman was staying at a place five mile and over from the pace of work and that it need not be paid on days when the workman was either on earned leave or any type of leave authorised or otherwise. The Tribunal had also taken into account the financial capacity of the appellants and there was 'no flow in its reasoning. [782 F;
