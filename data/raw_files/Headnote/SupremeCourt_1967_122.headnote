 The petitioners were vendors of potato chops and other edibles which they sold on public streets. The New Delhi Municipal Committee issued them licences for some time and later on tried to give them alternative sites for carrying on their trade. Finally however on 30th April 1965 it passed a resolution banning the sale of cooked edibles on public streets. The vendors filed a petition for writ in the High Court which failed. With special leave they appealed to this Court.
 It was urged on behalf of the appellants that : (i) in the absence of bye-laws framed under s. 188 of the Punjab Municipal Act the Municipal Committee had no power under s.
 173 of the Act to prohibit their trade; (ii) After the passing of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 the powers under s. 173 could not be used to regulate the sale of food from the purity aspect; (iii) the power of the Municipality under s. 173 was only to regulate the trade but it could not be used to contravene the fundamental right of the petitioners to carry on their business.
 
HELD : (i) The powers of the Municipality under s. 173 to allow encroachments on public streets and to permit sale of food or stalls to be set up was meant for special occasions like festivals, etc. Section 188 was not designed for the purpose of. framing bye-laws to regulate the conditions on which persons like the petitioners, could be allowed to carry on trade on public streets and thus create permanent unhygienic conditions. This should never have been permitted by the Municipality.[753 M] (ii) The object of the Food Adulteration Act was that food which the public would buy was prepared packed and stored under sanitary conditions so as not to be injurious to the health of the people consuming it. The rules made thereunder would override rules or bye-laws made by a municipality only if they covered the same field. Under s.
 173(1) of the Punjab Municipal Act, however, it was open to the Municipal Committee to take steps to prevent sale of any cooked food however pure if the sale thereof on public streets would offer obstruction to passersby or create insanitary conditions. [755 D-F] (iii) Out of sympathy for the street hawkers and squatters the N.D.M.C. had permitted the continuance of the trade for a long time. But no objection could be taken to their exercise of power under s. 173 of the Punjab Municipal Act to eradicate the evil. The power was confined merely to preventing obstruction to traffic. Every person has a right to pass and repass along a public street. But he cannot be heard to say that he ha,;; a fundamental right to carry on street trading and particularly in a manner which is bound to create insanitary and unhygiene conditions in the neighbourhood.
