 The services of the appellant, who was a Government servant, were terminated forthwith and he was ordered to be paid a month's pay and allowances calculated at the same rate at which he was drawing them immediately before the date on which the order of termination was served on him or, as the case may be. tendered to him: Having failed in departmental representations, the appellant filed a writ petition in the High Court. When the petition was before the High Court it was not brought to the notice of that court that the proviso to sub-r. (1) of r. 5 of the Central Civil Services (Temporary Services) Rules 1965 was amended with retrospective effect from May 1, 1965. The High Court dismissed the petition in Iimine and granted certificate relying on the decision of this Court in R.M.S. v. K. V.
 Gopinath which was not brought to its notice when the petitioner was dismissed.
 The amendment provided that the services of any Government servant may be terminated forthwith and on such termination he shall be entitled to claim a Sum equivalent to the amount of his pay plus allowances for the period of the notice at the same rates at which he was drawing them immediately before the termination of the services or as the case may be for the period by which such notice falls short of one month.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) The effect of the amendment is that on and from May 1, 1965 ,is also on the date of the dismissal of the appellant it was not obligatory to pay to him a sum equivalent to the amount of his pay and allowances for the period of notice at the rate at which he was drawing them immediately before the termination of the services or as the case may be for the period by which such notice falls short.
 The Government servant is only entitled to claim the amount.
 The effect of the amendment is that the decision in Gopinath's case no longer holds good.[965 B-C] (2) There is no doubt that the rule is a valid rule because it is now well established that rules made under the proviso to Art. 309 of the Constitution ire legislative in character and, therefore, can be given effect to retrospectively. [965 C] (3) Once a law is given retrospective effect as from a particular date all actions taken under that law even before the amendment was made would be deemed to have been taken under the law as amended and there could be really no question of having to validate any action already taken provided it is subsequent to the date from which the amendment, was given retrospective effect. the question of the particular form of the validation would always depend on the circumstances of a case and no general formula can be devised for all Circumstances. [965 H; 966 A] In the instant case the action taken against the appellant was on a date subsequent to the date on which the amended rule took effect and, therefore, that action being in accordance with the amended rule, is a legally valid action and there is no need to have a validating provision. [966 B] Prithvi Mills v. Broach Muncipality [1970] 1 S.C.R. 388, held inapplicable.
 (4) When action is taken against a government servant under the relevant rules, which enable the authorities concerned to terminate his temporary services without assigning any reason, the Court would not go into the reasons which and to the services being terminated. [966 D] 964
