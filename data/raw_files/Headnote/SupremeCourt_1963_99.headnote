 An industrial dispute having arisen between the appellants and the respondents, the Government of West Bengal referred the dispute to the Second Industrial Tribunal, West Bengal, for determining the question of bonus for each of the four years (from 1955 to 1959) and the method of its distribution amongst different categories of workmen including temporary hands. The tribunal on examination of the evidence applying the Full Bench Formula came to the conclusion that there was no surplus in any of the four years for the grant of bonus and therefore rejected the claim. The appellants thereupon appealed to this Court with special leave. The Tribunal's Award was impugned by the appellants on four grounds, namely, tribunal went wrong in calculating (a) gross profits for the years 1956-57 (b) income-tax for all the four years (c) working capital for all the four years and (d) rehabilitation for all the four years.
 Held that if there had been any addition to the profit on account of an increase in the value of the stock that would be an extraneous profit for which no credit could be claimed by the workmen and such extraneous profit could not be taken into account in calculating the available surplus.
 But in that case the result of the revaluation was not that increased value was taken into account in the matter of consumption of raw materials. The Tribunal overlooked this fact in applying the ratio of that case to the facts to the present case.
 Tats Oil Mitts Go. Ltd., v. Its Workmen, [1959] INSC 56; [1960] 1 S.C.R. 1, explained.
 If the stocks are revalued that is no reason for showing the relevant cost on the debit side as consumption, for in reality 39 the revalued price is not what the mills paid for the raw materials etc. consumed and therefore to get a correct picture of the actual profit made it is only the original cost price which will have to be taken into account for that purpose. On sale of paper, the profit must be on the original valuation of paper stock and not on the revalued figure.
 FIeld further, that at p. 962 of the decision of this Court in The Associated Cement Companies Ltd. v. Its Workmen, [1959] S.G.R. 925, the word "not" has been printed by mistake and what the court then decided was that in calculating the amount of tax payable the Tribunal should take into account the concession given by the Income-Tax Act. The Tribunal was wrong in calculating the income tax after deducting the notional normal depreciation and not the statutory depreciation.
 Sree Meenakshi Mills Ltd. v. Their Workmen [1957] INSC 96; [1958] S.C.R. 878, referred to.
 Held further that it is well settled that a balance sheet cannot be taken as proof of a claim as to what portion of reserves has actually been used as working capital and that the utilization of a portion of reserves as working capital has to be proved by the employer by evidence on affidavit or otherwise after giving opportunity to the workmen to contest the correctness of such evidence by cross-examination. In the present case no acceptable proof has been given and the method of proof was not proper.
 Petled Turkey Red Dye Works Ltd. v. Dye and Chemical Workers Union, [1960] INSC 14; [1960] 2 S.C.R. 906, refered to.
 Held further, that the question whether investments have been actually used as working capital is a question of fact and it has to be proved by proper evidence. In the present case the Tribunal was wrong in assuming that all investments have been used as working capital without any evidence to support this assumption.
 Where advances have been given for obtaining raw materials etc. they would certainly be part of the amount used as working capital. But where advances are purely loans and where advances have not been made for the purpose of the business such advances cannot be taken to have been used as working capital.
 Held further that the determination of rehabilitation is a long term affair and once it has been determined it cannot go 40 on increasing from year to year except in case of a sudden appreciable rise in prices or on account of new blocks being added followed by further rise of price after the purchase of the new blocks. All rehabilitation amounts which may have been allowed to the employer for rehabilitation in previous years but remained unused for rehabilitation in the meantime have to be taken into account in arriving at the amount required for rehabilitation.
 The Associated Cement Companies Ltd. v. Its Workmen [1959] S.C.R. 925, referred to.
 In Kandesh Spinning & Weaving Mills Co. Ltd. v. The Rashtriya Girni Kamgar Sangh Jalgaon, [1960] INSC 1; [1960] 2 S.C.R. 841, this Court held that before a particular reserve could be said to be not available for rehabilitation it must be established that it had been reasonably earmarked for a binding purpose or the whole or a part of it has been used as working capital and that only such part of the reserves coming under either of the two heads can be said to be not available for rehabilitation. This means that if any reserve has been earmarked for a particular purpose which is binding it cannot be deducted from the gross rehabilitation amount. For example assessment kept in reserve for paying debentures when they fail due or working capital which is in the shape of raw materials cannot be deducted from the gross rehabilitation amount. The Tribunal misunderstood and misapplied the ratio of this decision to the facts of the present case.
