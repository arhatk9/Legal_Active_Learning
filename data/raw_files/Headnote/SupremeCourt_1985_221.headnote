 The subject of lotteries" organised either by the Government of India or by the Government of a State falls within the Union List (Entry 40 of List I) but in the absence of any law having been enacted by the Parliament on the subject the running of lotteries could be tone by the Government of various States only under Article 258(1) of the Constitution on entrustment of that function by the Union to the concerned State. By virtue of that power entrusted to them by Presidential orders, the Government of Tamil Nadu and the Government of West Bengal organised a State lottery by sponsoring a haole scheme ant framing appropriate Rules in that behalf. me State Governments were also desirous of levying sales tax on the sale of the lottery tickets by placing the incidence thereof on every dealer selling such tickets within the State.
 In the State of Tamil Nadu, by a Notification GOP No.
 77 state January 28, 1984 issued under section 59 of the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act, 1959 the State Government inserted an 343 Entry 163 in the First Schedule to the Act whereby lottery tickets were brought within the purview of the charge ant tax at A the rate of 20% was levied on the sale of such tickets at the point of first sale in the State." This Notification was later followed by a regular legislative amendment made in the Act as required by section 59(2).
 Under the Raffle scheme 80 promulgated, the first sale of lottery tickets issued thereunder was by the State Government of Tamil Nadu to various licenced agents, whole salers, stockists etc. ant the State Government became liable to pay sales tax as the first dealer. Therefore, the Finance (Raffle) Department of the State Government issued Notification GOMs No. 219 on March 31, 1984 bringing into force certain arrangement where under while retaining the sale price of the ticket at its face value the tax was not passed on to the licenced dealer or to purchaser; in other words effectively exemption from payment of sales toy was granted to the purchaser. Shri H. Anraj the common petitioner, in both the writ petitions filed under Article 32 of the Constitution, who has been carrying on business in the State of Tamil Nadu as a dealer in lottery tickets issued by the Bengal Government of Bhutan, the State of Assam and various other lotteries, has challenged the validity of both the levy of sales TOY on the sale of lottery tickets as also the exemption granted under Notification GOMs 219 dated 31.3.1984.
 In West Bengal, the State Legislature promulgated the West Bengal Taxation Laws (second amendment) Act, 1984 whereunder by making appropriate amendments (by way of additions) to sections 5(1)(aa),5(1)(dd),5(2)(a) (vb) and 5(2)(v) (iva) of the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act 1941 sales tax at the rate of 20% was levied on the taxable turnover of every dealer in regard to the sale of lottery tickets. By a Notification No. 1020 FT dated March 29, 1984 the levy imposed under the aforesaid amendment w 8 brought into force with effect from May 1, 1984. By a writ petition filed in the Calcutta high Court the appellants (being three petitioners who carry on business in the State of W . t Bengal as agents and stockists of various lotteries organized by different States including the State of West Bengal changed the validity of the aforesaid amendments made in the Bengal Finance (sales Tax) Act, 1941 whereunder sales tax has been levied on the sale of lottery tickets substantially on the ground that a lottery ticket when sold represented an actionable claim and not "goods" and such a transaction being merely a sale of a chance to win a prize in the draw was not exigible to sales tax and, therefore, the amendments made were beyond the legislative 344 competence of the State Legislature, as Entry 54 of List II in the Seventh Schedule authorises legislation levying sales tax only on the sale or purchase of goods"; the matter ultimately went before a Division Bench of that Court which by its judgment and order dated August 14, 1984 dismissed the writ petition upholding the constitutional validity of the amendments in question as also the levy imposed thereunder. In substance the high Court came to the conclusion that lottery tickets were not actionable claims but "good" within the definition of that expression given in the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941 and therefore, the State Legislature was competent under Entry 54 of the List II to enact the concerned amendments levying sales tax on the sale of lottery tickets. Hence the appeal by special leave.
 The following contentions were raised on behalf of the selling agents; (i) the levy of sales tax on the sale of lottery is not valid on the sole ground of lack of legislative competence on the part of the concerned State Legislatures (ii) under the charging provision contained in both the Acts (section 3 of the Tamil Nadu Act 1959 and section 4 of the Bengal Act 1941) the taxable event is the sale of goods (here lottery tickets) and the levy is imposed upon the taxable turnover of every dealer in regard to the sales of lottery tickets and therefore, quite clearly, each of the State Legislature has purported to act in the exercise of its own taxing power under Entry 54 of the List II, which enables legislation imposing a tax, inter alia on 'sale of goods". It is well settled that the expression sale of goods" has to be construed in the sense which it has in the Indian Sale of Goods Act, 1930 and goods" under section 2(7) thereof comprises within its scope every kind of movable property but specifically excludes actionable claim.
 The essence of lottery being a chance for a prize for a price the sale of lottery tickets is not a sale of goods and therefore, the levy of sales tax on sale of lottery tickets would be beyond the ambit of Entry 54 of List II; (iii) Alternatively, a lottery ticket is an actionable claim as defined in section 3 of Transfer of Property Act or a chose- in-action known to English Law, the ticket itself being merely a slip of paper or memorandum evidencing the right of the holder thereof to claim or receive a prize if successful, in the draw and therefore the impugned levy is outside Entry 54 of List II; (iv) So far as the Madras Act is concerned the State Government's Notification GOMs. No.
 219 dated March 31, 1984 is discriminatory and violative of Article 14 and Article 304 (a) of the Constitution inasmuch as thereunder the burden of sales 345 tax, sur-charge and additional sur-charge is prohibited to be passed on to the purchaser of Tamil Nadu lottery Tickets while there is no such similar treatment given to the lottery tickets of other state which are being sold in the State of Tamil Nadu thereby putting the sale of other lottery tickets at a serious disadvantage. The respondents refuted the validity of the grounds and contended: (i) for deciding the legislative competence of the impugned Amendments levying sales-tax of lottery tickets, apart from Entry 54 of List II ("taxes on the sales or purchase of goods") Entry 62 of List II ( Taxes on....betting and gambling ) must be looked into. If the dealer's contention were correct that lottery is a chance and when a lottery ticket is sold it is a chance that is sold, then the tax in the present case would be a tax on betting and gambling and the same has to be levied in the case of lottery tickets at the time of the sale of the tickets because it is at that time that betting takes place and as such the impugned Amendments would fall under Entry 62 of List II; (ii) a lottery ticket is "goods" within the definition of that expression given in the two Acts as also in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 and not purely an actionable claim; (iii) a sale of a lottery ticket confers on the purchaser two rights (a) a right to participate in the draw and (b) a right to claim a prize if successful in the draw and though the latter may be an actionable claim the former constitutes beneficial interest in the movable property (incorporeal in character) in possession of the holder of the ticket and hence goods capable of being possessed and bought or sold;
 and (iv) as regards the exemption granted by the Tamil Nadu Government under Notification No. GOMs. 219 dated March 31, 1984 the circumstance that the Tamil Nadu Government decided not to pass on the sales-tax to the purchaser CAN'T invalidate the same as falling under Article 14 or Article 304 inasmuch as it is open to a dealer not to pass on the burden to the purchaser and bear it himself and further it is also open to all other State Governments who run lotteries to elect not to pass on the sales-tax to the purchaser of their lottery tickets.
 Dismissing the appeal and allowing the writ petitions in part, the Court ^ 
 HELD: (Per Tulzapurkar, J.) 1.1 The Amendments made to the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act, 1959 and the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1942 imposing a levy for the first time on such sales of lottery tickets fall within the legislative competence of the concerned State Legislature under Entry 54 of List II in the Seventh Schedule. [374 A-b] 346 
 1.2 The lottery tickets to the extent that they comprise the entitlement to participate in the draw are "goods" properly 80 called, squarely falling within the definition of that expression as given in the Tamil Nadu Act, 1959 and the Bengal Act, 1941 and to that extent, they are not "actionable claims" and in every sale thereof, a transfer of property is involved. [373 G-H; 374 A] 
 1.3 From a combined reading of section 2(7) of the Sale of Goods Act and section 3(26) of the General Clauses Act, 1897, it is clear that when section 2(7) of the Sale of goods Act defines "goods" as meaning "every kind of movable property other than actionable claims and money, the expression "movable property occurring therein must mean property of every description except immovable property.
 Since lottery tickets cannot be regarded as immovable property, but would, therefore, be immovable property and as such they will fall within the expression 'goods". [364 C-E] 
 2.1 Whether by reason of a sale of lottery ticket merely a contractual document come into existence or along with the delivery of such a ticket to the purchaser on payment of price by him some rights are transferred to the purchaser must depend upon the intention of the parties, the mode of issued such ticket and the rules governing the Raffle Scheme. Even proceeding on the assumption that lottery ticket are contractual documents that fact cannot militate against the tickets being goods and certain rights thereunder being transferred to the purchaser. [365 D-F] 
 2.2 The delivery of a lottery ticket issued under the rules governing the Raffle Scheme in the instant case to a purchaser thereof 18 obviously not a mere contract creating an obligation or right in personam between parties to it, but would be in the nature of a grant. [366 C-D] 
 2.3 It is well settled that rights and benefits arising under agreements in the nature of a grant, unless or a personal nature, partake of the character of personalty as opposed to realty act therefore, movable property, capable of being assigned or transferred. As opposed to personal rights, like life, liberty or reputation, these would be proprietory rights and benefits and hence includible in property. In the case of agreements in the nature of a grant, the right or benefits arising thereunder would be property more so when a party thereto has become entitled to the same on performing his part of the contract and in fact such rights or benefits would also be assignable. 1366 D-E;

 2.4 In every Raffle Scheme based on the sale of lottery tickets, similar to the schemes sponsored by each of the`e two State in this case, a participant is required to purchase a lottery ticket by paying a price therefor (the face value of the tickets and such purchase entitles him not merely to receive or claim a prize in the draw, if successful but, before that, also to participate in such draw. In other WORDS, a sale of a lottery ticket confers on the purchaser thereof two right (a) a right to participate in the draw and (b) a right to claim a prize contingent upon his being successful in the draw. Both would be beneficial interests in mo cable property, the former "in presenti", the latter "in futuro depending on a contingency. Lottery ticket, not as physical articles, but as slips of paper or memoranda evidence not one but both these beneficial interests in movable property which are obviously capable of being transferred, assigned or sold and on their transfer, assignment or sale both these beneficial interests are made over to the purchaser for a price. [367 D-F] The two entitlements which arise on the purchase of a lottery ticket are of a different character, inasmuch as the right to participate arises in presenti, that is to say it is a choate or perfected right in the purchaser on the strength of which he can enforce the holding of the draw while the other is inchoate right which is to materializes in future as and when the draw takes place depending upon his being successful in such draw. Moreover, on the date of the purchase of the ticket, the entitlement to participate in the draw can be said to have been delivered unto-the- possession of the purchaser who would be enjoying lt from the time he has purchased the ticket and as such it would be a chose in possessing while the other would be an actionable claim or a chose-in-action. Thus a transfer of the right to participate in the draw which takes place on the sale of a lottery ticket would be a transfer of beneficial interest in movable property to the purchaser and therefore, amounts to transfer of goods and to that extent it is no transfer of an actionable claim; to the extent that it involves a transfer of the right to claim a prize depending on a chance it will be an assignment of an actionable claim. When a purchaser purchases a lottery ticket he pays consideration (price) nor merely for the 348 right to claim in future a prize in the draw but also for the right in presenti to participate in the draw, that is to say not one but two distinct rights are transferred to the purchaser and therefore, the contention that the two together constitute a single right cannot be accepted.

 2.5 The analogy of capital issue by a Joint Stock Company is wholly inappropriate. The capital issue by a Joint Stock Company 18 governed by the provisions of the Companies Act and Memorandum and Articles of Association of the company (whereunder no company can subscribe to or purchase its own shares since it amounts to reduction of capital) whereas the issue of lottery tickets would be governed by a Raffle Scheme and the Rules framed therefor by the promoter (who in the instant case happens to be a State Government) containing provisions entirely different from those governing issue of share capital. Moreover, the agreement that comes into existence as a result of the sale of a lottery ticket by a promoter to a buyer is in the nature of a grant conferring the two rights (the right to participate and the right to claim a prize if successful) upon such buyer; if this be the true nature of the agreement it implies that both the right come into existence and are with the promoter no sooner a Raffle Scheme together with the Rules governing it (Rules which fix the number of series to be issued, the number of tickets in each series, the manner of holding a draw', the number and the terms on which the prizes to be awarded, etc. etc.) is sponsored, published and the tickets are offered for sale and these rights are transferred upon the sale of the ticket to the purchaser.
 The mere fact that under the Rules the promoter 18 disabled from participating in the draw or from claiming a prize in such draw does not mean that these right do not come into existence or are not with the promoter before the actual sale of the tickets to the buyer nor does lt mean that these right come into existence for the first time only upon the sale of the ticket to the buyer. Such disability imposed upon the promoter by the Rules 18 necessary to create confidence in the participants about the promoter's bonafides in the Raffle Scheme and prevents the Scheme being viewed as a fraudulent or fishy affair. In other words a transfer of the rights from the promoter (grantor) to the buyer (grantee) is clearly involved in the sale of a lottery ticket. [369 C-E; 370 D-H; 371 A-D] 349 Further this right to participate in the draw under a lottery ticket remains a valuable right till the draw takes place and it is for this reason that licence agents or wholesalers or dealers of such tickets are enabled to effect sales thereof till the draw actually takes place and as such till then the lottery tickets constitute their stock-in- trade and therefore a merchandise. In other words, lottery tickets not as physical articles but as slips of paper or memoranda evidencing the right to participate in the draw must in a sense be regarded as the dealer's merchandise and therefore, goods, capable of being bought or sold in the market. They can also change from hand to hand as goods.
 Therefore, for the purpose of imposing the levy of sales-tax lottery tickets comprising the entitlement to a right to partlypate in a draw will have to be regarded as "goods properly so called. [371 D-H; 372 A] United States v. Moulder, (178) (Second series) Federal Reports 593 at 594 quoted with approval.
 
 2.6 It is true that this entitlement to a right to particlepate in the draw is an entitlement to beneficial interest which 18 of incorporeal or intangible nature but that cannot prevent lt from being regarded as goods. If incorporeal right like copy right or an intangible thing like electric energy can be regarded as goods expiable to sales tax there is no reason why the entitlement to a right to participate in a draw which is beneficial interest in movable property of incorporeal or intangible character should not be regarded as 'goods' for the purpose of levying sales tax. Lottery tickets which comprise such entitlement do constitute the stock-in-trade of every dealer and therefore his merchandise which can be brought and sold in the market. Lottery tickets comprising such entitlement, therefore would fall within the definition of "goods" given in the Tamil Nadu Act and the Bengal Act. [372A; 373 L-G] Commissioner of Sales Tax, M.P. v. Madhya Pradesh Electricity Board, Jabalpur, 11969] 2 SCR 939 applied.

 (The Court applied non-liquet on the alternative submission that legislative competence for enacting the impugned Amendments would also be there under Entry 62 of List II in the & Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.) 350 
 3.1 The impugned Notification GOMs. 219 dated March 31, 1984 issued by the State Government of Tamil Nadu is clearly violative of Article 301 read with Article 304 (a) of the Constitution. [374 C] 3.2 In A.T.B. Mehtab Majid and Co.'s case [1963] Suppl.
 2 SCR 435, the Supreme Court held that taxing laws can be restrictions on trade, commerce and intercourse, if they hampered free flow of trade and if they are not what can be termed to be compensatory tax on regulatory measure; that sales tax of the kind under consideration could not be side to be a measure regulating any trade or a compensatory tax levied for the use of trading facilities; that the sales tax which had the effect of discriminating between goods of one State and goods of another may affect the free flow of trade and it will then offend against of Article 304 but will be valid only if it comes within the terms of Article 304(a).
 Here, the real question is whether the direct and immediate result of the impugned Notification is to impose an unfavorable and discriminatory tax burden on the imparted goods (here lottery tickets of other States) when they are sold within the State of Tamil Nadu as against indigenous goods (Tamil Nadu Government lottery tickets) when these are sold within the State from the point of view of the purchaser and this question has to be considered from the normal business or commercial point of view and indisputably if the question is so considered the impugned Notification will have to be regarded as directly and immediately hampering free flow of trade, commerce and intercourse.
 Discriminatory treatment in the matter of levying the sales tax on i ported lottery tickets which are similar to the ones issued by the State Government so as to hamper free flow of trade, commerce and intercourse is writ large on the face of the impugned Notification. 1378 D-H; 379 A] Atiabari To Co. Ltd. y. The State of Assam and Ors., [19611 1 SCR 809; A.T.B. Mehtab Majid and Co. v. State of Madras and Anr., [1963] Supp. 2 SCR 435; A. Hajee Abdul Shakoor and Company. v.

 (Per Sabyasachi Mukharji, J.) (Concurring) 
 1.1 Both under the relevant provisions of the relevant Tamil Nadu Act and the West Bengal act, in order to attract the levy of sales-tax, there must be sale of goods i.e.
 transfer of property. In other words , both these Acts insist transfer of 351 property in goods. Article 366(12) of the Constitution gives an inclusive definition of "goods" indicating thereby goods" includes all materials, commodities and articles.
 Therefore, there must be transfer of property in the goods for a price, the concept has the same meaning which it has under the Sale of Goods Act, 1930- [379 E] 
 1.2 "Grant" is an agreement of some sort which creates rights in the grantee ant an agreement which transfers rights may be termed as assignment, but it cannot be said that such a grant/right, namely, the right to participate in the draw, in the facts ant circumstances of the case, existed in the grantor. [379 G-H; 380 A] Under the rules, the promoter is not able to participate in the draw or claim a prize in such a draw.
 Therefore, the right that is transferred to the purchaser of lottery ticket is not the same right which was existing in the grantor, in this case the promoters. By the sale by the promoter and purchase by the grantee of the ticket, there is no transfer of the same property namely the property which existed in the grantor namely disability from participating in the draw which is granted to the purchaser or the grantee of the lottery ticket. The transfer of right from the promoter-grantor to the buyer-grantee is involved in the sale of a lottery ticket but, the issue whether it is transfer of the same right which the promoter or grantor had or a larger or greater right created by the factum of transfer in favour of the grantee is a point of some complexity and there is no easy solution. However, the State can create such right for the first time and such transfer of the right by the State as a promoter would amount to a transfer of property and being in consideration of a price can be sale of goods. The right to participate in the draw under a lottery ticket remains a valuable right till the draw takes place and it is for this reason that licence agents or whole-salers or dealers of such tickets are enabled to effect sales thereof till the draw actually takes place and therefore lottery tickets, not as physical articles but as slips of paper or memoranda evidencing the right to participate in the draw can be regarded as dealer's merchandise and therefore goods which are capable of being bought or sold in the market. [380 D-H; 381 A-D] 
 1.3 The analogy of capital issue by Joint Stock Company is not appropriate. [381 A]
