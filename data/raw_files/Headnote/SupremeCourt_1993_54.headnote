 The Cooperative House Building Society Respondent No.1 in the appeal was formed with a view to provide house-sites to its members. A site was acquired but before the plots could be distributed among the members, disputes arose among them.
 Various groups in the society tried to pin control of the society's affairs and a number of suits were filed and several interim orders obtained.
 The Registrar of Cooperative Societies found that on account of the infighting among members the very object of the government in providing land on concessional rate to the society stood in jeopardy-, fed up with the unending disputes he passed an order forbidding holding of elections to the Committee of the Society.
 The aforesaid order of the Registrar was challenged in a writ petition. The Single Judge who heard the matter, made several attempts to resolve the differences between the parties but found no room for any settlement. He heard the Writ Petition and dismissed the same.
 A letters Patent Appeal was flied, the Division Beach also undertook 428 to settle the disputes. It succeeded partially, with the consent of the parties, the Division Bench appointed a former Judge of the High Court as the Administrator, to finalise the list of membership. He thoroughly examined all claims and prepared a list of 219 members, which was approved by the Court by order dated 19.8.85 and the Administrator was directed to proceed with the allotment of plots.
 Before the aforesaid directions could be complied with certain members made an application for review of the order dated 19.5.1986. A direction was sought that the Administrator prepare a fresh list following the 'simplified procedure' notified by the Registrar of Cooperative Societies through his letter dated 5.7.1977. The Division Bench accepted the Review Petition, and directed the Administrator by its order dated 17.5.1989 to prepare a fresh list. The Administrator prepared a list containing 221 members, and submitted his Report. This created a ticklish situation inasmuch as the total number of plots available was 210 whereas the number of members eligible was 221. Disputes again started as to the manner in which the plots should be distributed.
 The four appellants who are members of the Society, questioned the correctness of the Division Bench order dated 17th May, 1989 in their appeal to this Court contending that their names were found far above serial No. 210 in the list approved by the Court by its order dated 19th May, 1986, whereas their names came down to 216 to 219 in the list prepared by the Administrator on the basis of the 'simplified procedure', and that for that reason they may not be entitled to allotment of plots.
 Disposing of the Appeal, this Court, 
HELD : 1. The verification of membership has been done by the Administrator, a very responsible person, a former Judge of the Delhi High Court. One exercise by such a person is sufficient, two exercises are more than enough. It cannot be an external process. It has to stop at some stage, and it should stop now. If any person who has some claim to membership of the society has either not chosen to come forward and put forward his claim before the Administrator in response to the notices issued by him or has chosen not to question the rejection of his claim by the Ad.
 ministrator before the Delhi High Court or has failed to put forward his claim at least in these proceedings, it must be presumed that he has no legitimate claim to the membership of the society. [433B-C] 429 
2. When the society was initially formed the land allotted to it was not of much value. Several persons who initially became members either resigned or took back their deposits and walked out. Some did not respond to the notices of the society, and did not remit the amounts as and when called upon. Now that the land has become valuable, people appear to be coming forward with claims to membership. No value can be attached to such belated claims. [433D] 
3. In response to individual and public notices issued by the Administrator, at the time of preparing the first list, as many as 346 persons laid claim to membership. After a thorough scrutiny the Administrator rejected a large number of claims and finalised a list of 219 members. Even on the second occasion the Administrator went through an elaborate exercise and finalised the list of 221 members prepared by the Administrator and appended to his 10th report. It has to be treated as the final and conclusive list [433E-F] 
4. The Administrator shall carve out 221 plots in the place of 210 plots within a period of two months from today, with the help of an Architect or Engineer, as he may choose.
 He shall allot the same among the 221 members included in the second list by adopting an appropriate method i.e., by drawal of lots or by some other fair method. [433G, 434B]
