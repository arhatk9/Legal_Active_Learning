 One of the three methods followed by the respondent.
 (The Coffee Board), for releasing raw coffee seeds to the trade for internal consumption was by "pool auctions" in which only dealers registered with the Board were permitted to participate. The pool auction was conducted by a Sale Conducting officer (who was Chief Marketing Officer of the Board). Condition 8 of the Conditions of Sale provides, "telegraphic bids or telegraphic instructions regarding bidding will not be considered." Condition 6 provides, "the seller does not bind himself to accept the highest or any bid. He is not bound to assign any reasons for his decision and his decision shall be final and conclusive." The bids offered by the two appellants, who were registered dealers, at a pool auction were accepted by the Sale Conducting officer, even though the bids were not the highest. On their failure to take delivery of the stocks and to pay the bid money within the stipulated period, the Board, after giving due notice to the appellants re-sold the stocks two months later at another pool auction. The prices realised at the re-auction being much lower than the appellant's bids, the Board sought to realise the differences by way of suits.
 The appellants disclaimed liability to make good the loss to the Board mainly on the ground that there was no concluded contract between the parties in that the appellants had sent telegrams to the Board revoking their bids before the declaration of the results of the auction;
 that in one case in regard to five lots there was no concluded contract as the Board even under clause 6 had no power to accept a lower bid on receipt of a higher bid which it did; and that the appellants were not responsible for the loss which the Board had claimed as having arisen out of the resale of the stocks bid by them in that the loss was the result of deliberate bringing down of prices by the Board and further there was inordinate delay in holding the re- sale.
 The Board, on the other hand, alleged that Condition 8 did not permit telegraphic withdrawal or retraction of any bid and since the oral retraction had not been properly done to the officer concerned there was a concluded contract;
 Condition 6 was framed to prevent the mal-practice among dealers by cornering stocks by forming rings among themselves and puffing up prices to make unlawful gains to the detriment of the consumer and that lastly the loss which resulted in the resale of stocks was the result of fall in prices at the time of resale and therefore, was not unreal.
 885 Accepting the appellants' contention the trial court dismissed the Board's suit for recovery of loss. On appeal by the Board the High Court substantially upheld its contentions and decreed the suits.
 Dismissing the appeals.

 HELD: 1. (a) Condition No. 8 was wide enough to bar withdrawal or retraction of bids by telegrams. [891H] (b) On the face of it "instructions regarding bidding" would mean any instructions, not merely instructions by way of clarification, modification, amplification of bids but also withdrawal or retraction of bids. Such instructions by telegram would be impermissible. Having regard to the solemn procedure prescribed and followed by the Board any instructions by telegram which more often are cryptic and lack in authenticity on their face are rightly prohibited.
 The fact that nowhere else in the Conditions of Sale is the withdrawal or retraction of bids dealt with, would precisely be the reason why this Condition should be widely construed as including the topic of instructions regarding withdrawal or retraction of bids. [891E-G] 
 2. There is no force in the contention that there were no concluded contracts between the parties on account of oral withdrawal of the bids. Assuming that the oral retraction was made as claimed by the appellants, the fact that it was made to the Assistant Coffee Marketing Officer who had no authority to accept it (instead of to the Sale Conducting Officer who was in charge of the pool auction) made the retraction ineffective and of no consequence.
 [892C-D] 
 3. (a) An auctioneer can set his own terms and conditions for holding an auction. If he does so, it is these conditions that would govern the rights of the parties. [893G] (b) The Chief Marketing Officer was well within his rights in accepting the lower bids. When Condition 6 says that the seller is not bound to accept the highest bids, it necessarily implies that he can accept any lower bids. The words, "or any bid" after the words "the highest" are used not for emphasising that even the highest bid need not be accepted. The use of the words "or any bid" would be superfluous if the same consequence of holding a fresh auction was to ensure in the event of the highest bid being declined. By necessary implication power had been conferred on the Board or its Chief Marketing officer to accept a lower bid in preference to any higher bid. [894E-H] (c) The practice followed by the Board over a period long before the disputes arose showed that the parties to the pool auctions understood Condition No. 6 as conferring power on the Board or its Chief Marketing Officer to accept lower bids in preference to higher bids. More than all, the Condition was devised to put an end to the mal-practice of the dealers cornering stocks, puffing up prices and so on to the detriment of the consumer. [895A] 4.(a) The well accepted position in law on the question of mitigation of loss is that it does not give any right to the party in breach of the contract but is a concept to be borne in mind by the Court while awarding damages. The non- defaulting party is not expected to take steps which would injure innocent persons. Steps taken by him in performance or discharge of his statutory duties cannot be weighed against him. The question in each case would be one of reasonableness of action taken by the non-defaulting party.
 [897C] 886 In the instant case the various measures taken by the Board were to prevent mal-practice by dealers and to protect the interest of the consumers. In any event they were not directed against the defaulting dealers at the pool auction.
 At the earlier auction the Sale Conducting Officer decided to accept the lower bids in preference to the higher bids offered by the dealers who despite the oral warning issued by him against such a method, offered higher bids exceeding the average prices for the month. It was for this reason that at the re-sale the prices realised were lower than those offered by the appellants at the earlier pool auction.
 At the re-sale at any rate, only the highest bids were accepted and therefore, the loss arising from the re-sale was not unreal as claimed by the appellants. [898A-C] (b) On the facts of this case the re-sale had been held within a reasonable time. [898G]
