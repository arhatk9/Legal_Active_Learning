 The State Trading Corporation of India is a private limited company registered under the Indian Companies Act, 1956, with its head Office at Delhi and its entire capital is contributed by the Government of India. The Sales-tax Authorities of the States of Andhra Pradesh and Bihar sought to assess the Corporation to sales tax under their respective Sales Tax Acts and issued notices of demand. The Corporation claiming to be an Indian citizen filed petitions under Art. 32 of the Constitution for quashing the said proceedings on the ground that they infringed its fundamental rights under Art. 19(1) (f) and (g) of the Constitution. Preliminary objections having been taken by the respondents to the maintainability of the said petitions, the Constitution Bench hearing the matters referred the two following questions for decision by the special bench.
 "(1) Whether the State Trading Corporation, a company registered under the Indian Companies Act, 1956, is a citizen within the meaning of Art. 19 of the Constitution and can ask for the enforcement of fundamental rights granted to citizens under the said article; and (2) whether the State Trading Corporation is, notwithstanding the formality of incorporation under the Indian Companies Act, 1956, in substance, a department -,-id organ of the Government of India with the entirety of its capital contributed by Government; and can it claim to enforce fundamental rights under Part III of the Constitution against the State as defined in Art. 12 thereof.
 Held, (DAS GUPTA and SHAH JJ., dissenting) that the answer to the first question must be in the negative.
 Per SINHA, C. J., S. K. DAS, GAJENDRAGADKAR, SARKAR, WANCHoo and Ayyangar JJ. There can be no citizens of India not mentioned in Part 11 of the Constitution or by the Citizenship Act, 1955. These provisions are wholly exhaustive and contemplate only natural persons.
 Part III of the Constitution makes a clear distinction between fundamental rights available to "any person" and those guaranteed 100 to "all citizens", indicating thereby that under the Constitution all citizens are persons but all persons are not citizens Part II of the Constitution relating to 'citizenship' is clearly inapplicable to juristic persons and the provisions of the Citizenship Act, 1955, enacted by Parliament under Art. 11 of the Constitution, show that such persons are outside the purview of the Act.
 It cannot therefore, be said that either Part II of the Constitution or the Citizenship Act, 1955, confers the right of citizenship or recognises as citizen any person other than a natural person. They do not contemplate a corporation as a citizen.
 In none of the relevant decisions this Court gave its consi- dered judgment on the present issues and the question now raised are open questions.

 Ltd. v. State of Bihar, [1955] 2 S.C.R. 603, considered.
 'Nationality' and 'citizenship' are not synonymous. A corporation can claim nationality which is ordinarily determined by the place of its incorporation. But while nationality determines the civil rights of a natural or artificial person, particularly with reference to international law, citizenship is intimately connected with civic rights under municipal law. All citizens are, therefore, nationals of a particular State and enjoy full political rights but all nationals are not citizens and do not have full political rights.
 It was not correct to say that the word 'citizen' in Art. 5 was not as wide as in Art. 19 of the Constitution or that Part II of the Constitution supplemented by the provisions of the Citizenship Act, which deals with citizens, deliberately left out of account citizenship in relation to juristic persons. When the Constitution confers any particular right to be enjoyed by a citizen it uses the words "any citizen" or "all citizens" in clear contradistinction to those rights which are to be enjoyed by all, whether citizens or aliens, natural or juristic persons.
 There is no reason to think that the word 'citizen' in Art.
 19 is used in a different sense from that in which it is used in Part II of the Constitution.
 Per HIDYATULLAH J.-Both the questions must be answered in favour of the respondents.
 Before independence there was no law of citizenship in India. Under the British Nationality Act, 1948, Indians became Commonwealth citizens or British subjects without citizenship and were regarded as potential citizens of India. The Indian Constitution made provision for citizenship under which certain natural persons alone could be citizens of India and the Citizenship Act, 1955, excluded persons other than natural persons from citizenship.
 101 It is not correct to say that corporations were citizens before the Constitution. They enjoyed only such privileges under the municipal law which that law expressly conferred on them.
 The nature and personality of an incorporated company have their origin in a fiction of law. This personality arises from the moment of incorporation and from that date the persons subscribing to the memorandum of association or joining as members become a body corporate. But they cannot be said to Pool their status and even if all of them are citizens of India, the Company does not become a citizens of India.

 Driefontein Consolidated Mines Ltd., (1902) A. C. 484, referred to.
 The seven freedoms guaranteed by Art. 19(1) arc for the citizens of India. The Constitution in using the word "person", a word of larger import, in some other places makes its intention to exclude corporations clear.
 Chiranjit Lal Chowdhuri v. Union of India, [1950] S.C.R.
 869, explained.
 The precedents of the Supreme Court of the United States which hold that corporations are citizens of the State of incorporation for purposes of federal jurisdiction cannot be followed in India. The diversity of citizenship which has led to such rulings does not exist in India. As a corporation is a separate entity from its members, it is not possible to pierce the veil of incorporation to determine the citizenship of its members in order to give the corporation the benefit of Art. 19.
 The State Trading Corporation is not, therefore, a citizen either by itself or as the aggregate of Indian citizens.
 Its Indian nationality is not to be confused with citizenship of natural persons and the word 'citizen' in Art' 19(1) (f) and (g) can refer to no other than natural persons. The State Trading Corporation is really a department of Government behind the corporate veil.
 Per DAS GUPTA J.-The first question must be answered in the affirmative.
 It has been repeatedly laid down by this Court that in interpreting the Constitution a broad and a liberal and not merely the grammatical view should be taken. A syllogistic or mechanical approach has always to be avoided, more so when interpreting the Constitution. The attempt should be to reach the intention of the Constitution makers by examining the substance and give effect to that intention, if possible.
 So judged, it is clear that the Constitution makers when they used the word 'citizen' in Art. 19 had the intention that at least a corporation constituted wholly by citizens of India would get 102 the benefit of the fundamental rights enshrined in that There is -nothing in the Constitution that stands in the giving all citizens of India, whether forming a corporation the benefit of Arts. 19(1) (f) and (g).

 The first part of the second question should be answered in the negative and the second part in the affirmative.
 Per SHAH J.-In ascertaining the meaning of expressions used in a vital document like the Constitution of a nation,mechanical approach is impermissible. The Constitution is the declaration of the will of the people and should be interpreted liberally and not in a narrow or doctrinaire spirit. Such interpretation should be in accordance with the true purpose and intent as disclosed by the phraseology understood in its natural signification in the light of its setting and its dynamic character which is intended to fulfill the aspirations of the people.
 Citizenship means the members of a jural society investing the holder with all the rights and privileges enjoyed by its nationals and subjecting him to corresponding duties.
 Nationality links a person to a State and ensures his rights in international affairs. While a citizen is a national, every national is not always a citizen.
 Virginia L. Minor v. Reese Happersett, 21Wall. 162: 88 U.S.
 627, referred to.
 Under the English Common Law which formed the foundation of the Indian jurisprudence, a company or a corporation aggregate is a national of the State in which it is incorporated and is clothed with a personality given by the law of the land, capable of exercising rights arid entitled to protection a broad.

(1932) A.C. 288, Gasque v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue, L.R. (1940) 2 K.B. 36 and Kuenigl v. Donnersmark, L.R. (1955) 1 Q.B. 515, referred to.
 So also in India a juridical person is capable of exercising to the fullest extent a large majority of civil rights which natural persons may exercise as citizens, its incapacity to exercise other rights arises from the nature of its personality and constitution and not from any special restriction imposed upon it. The Constitution, as is apparent from various other Articles, afforded the widest protection to corporation as it did to natural persons.
 Unless 103 therefore, the language or the scheme of the Constitution is compulsive, it is impossible to put a limited connotation on the expression 'citizen' occurring in Art. 19(1).
 To say that Arts. 5, 6 and 8 and the law made under Art. 11 are exhaustive and there can be no citizen except those expressly covered thereby is to assume that there were no citizens in India before the Constitution, an assumption which is not warranted either by the language of the Constitution or the' history of our national evolution. The legislative history shows that British subjects of Indian origin held the status of citizens in British India and there was no statute before the Constitution which indicated even indirectly that a corporation aggregate could not be a citizen.
 Although this Court did not make any definite expression of opinion, it has consistently assumed that corporations aggregate are entitled to claim protection under Art. 19(1) as citizens.

 In numerous cases in this Court it was assumed, without contest, that a company is a citizen of India and competent to enforce fundamental rights under Art. 19(1)(f) and (g) of the Constitution.
 Case law referred to.
 In view of the fact that a company is invested with important fundamental rights under various other Articles of the Constitution and it is recognised as a person capable of holding and disposing of property and carrying on business, commerce and intercourse, it could not be held that the expression 'citizen' in Art. 19 was intended to be restricted to a natural person.
 A corporation is, however, distinct from its share-holders and even if all the shareholders are Indian Citizens, its claim to citizenship cannot be founded on that ground for that would lead to anomalous results.
 Salomon v. Salomon and Co. Ltd. L.R. (1897) A.C. 22, relied on.
 State of Bombay, v. R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala, I.L.R. [1955] Bom. 680, disapproved.
 The question whether a corporation is an agent or servant of the State must be decided on the facts of each case. In the absence of any statutory provision, a commercial corporation acting on its behalf, even if it is controlled wholly or partially by a Government department, will be presumed not to be a servant or an agent of the State. where, however, the corporation is performing in substance Governmental, and not commercial, functions, an inference will readily be made that it is an agent of the Government.

 Bank Voor Handel En Scheepvaart N. V. v. Administrator. of Hungarian Property, L.R. (1954) A.C. 584, held inapplicable.
 There is no warrant for the proposition that a department or an organ of the Union or the State, if it is a citizen, cannot enforce fundamental rights against the State as defined by Art. 12 of the Constitution.
