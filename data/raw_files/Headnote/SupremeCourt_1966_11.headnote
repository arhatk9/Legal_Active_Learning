HELD : (i) The word 'suit' includes an appeal from the judgment in between a suit.
 The only difference between a suit and an appeal is that an appeal "only reviews and corrects the proceedings 'in a cause already constituted but does not create the cause. In the present Act the intention is to give relief in respect of excessive interest in a suit which is pending and a preliminary decree in a suit of this kind does not terminate the suit. The appeal is a part of the cause because the preliminary decree which decree.[281 D-F] (ii)The words of s. 6 speak of a suit pending on the commencement of the Act and it means a live suit whether in the court of first instance, or an appeal court where the judgment of the court of first instance is being considered.
 It only excludes those suits in which nothing further needs to be done in relation to the rights and claim litigated, because an executable decree which may not be reopened is already in existence. The decision of the High Court was right in applying s. 3 of the Usurious Loans Act (as amended) to the case. [282 A, B] (iii)Ordinarily a court of appeal cannot take into account a new law, brought into existence after the Judgment appealed from has been rendered, because the rights of the litigants in an appeal are determined under the law in force at the date of the suit. Matters of procedure are however different and the law affecting procedure is. always retrospective. But it does not mean that there is an absolute rule of inviolability of substantive rights, If the new law speaks in language, which expressly or by clear intendment, takes in even pending matters, the court of trial as well as the court of appeal may give effect to such a law even after the judgment of the court of first instance. The distinction between laws effacting procedure and those affecting vented rights does not matter when the court is invited by law to take away from a successful plaintiff what he has obtained under a judgment.
