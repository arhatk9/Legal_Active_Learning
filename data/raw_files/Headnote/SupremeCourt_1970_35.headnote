 The 4th respondent was a union of workmen in one of the factories ,owned by the appellant company. By an agreement between the 4th respondent and the company a charter of workmen's demands was referred to adjudication by arbitrators under s. 1OA of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The arbitrators decided first the dispute relating to dearness allowance, leaving other disputes to be considered later. This Part I award was published in the Government Gazette under s. 17 of the Act. Aggrieved by the said award the company filed a writ petition under Art. 226-of the Constitution. The petition was dismissed by the High Court.
 The company applied to the High Court for leave to appeal to this Court. This was refused on the ground that the arbitration was not completed and therefore neither the award in question nor the High Court's order dismissing the writ petition was a final order within the meaning of Art.
 133(1) of the Constitution. Against the High Court's order refusing leave. the company, by special leave, applied to this Court.
 
 HELD : (i) Under sub-s. 4 of s. 10-A, the arbitrators submitted the Part I Award duly signed by all of them to the Government. As required by s. 17(1), the said. Part I Award was published in the manner prescribed therefore by the State Government and thereupon under s. 17(2) it became final and could not be called in question in any court in any manner whatsoever. Under s. 17A(1) the award became enforceable on the expiry of 30 days from the date of its publication. Therefore so far as the question of dearness allowance among other disputes, was concerned, Part I Award became final and binding on the parties. It was not an interlocutory order in the sense of any dispute in respect of its subject matter remaining to be finally adjudicated by the arbitrators or the rights of the parties in relation thereto remaining pending any further determination. [755 B- E] (ii) The petition filed by the appellant-company for a writ of certiorari and for quashing the said Part I Award under Art. 226 was a proceeding independent of the dispute between the parties. Such a writ proceeding was not an interlocutory proceeding nor the order dismissing it an interlocutory order leaving any question raised in the writ petition to be determined at any later stage. The) effect of the dismissal of the writ petition by the High Court was that the said Part I Award, Subject to any appeal to this Court, was not liable to be questioned on the grounds alleged in that writ petition and the appellant-company would be bound to pay to its workmen dearness allowance at the rates provided in that award. The controversy between the parties on questions raised in the writ petition -was finally determined and brought to an end as a result of the order ,dismissal. In view of the decision of this Court in Ramesh v. Seth Genadadal 753 the High Court must be said to be in error in holding that its order dismissing the writ petition was not a final order within the meaning of Art. 133(1) and that no appeal, therefore, lay therefrom in this Court. [755 F-G; 766 B-C] Ramesh v. Seth Gendadal [1966] INSC 5; [1966] 3 S.C.R. 198, applied.
 Mohanlal Maganlal Thacker v. State of Gujarat, [19681 2 S.C.R. 685, referred to.
