 The respondent was engaged in the business of collecting, forwarding and distributing goods carried by public carriers in Delhi. The Chief Commissioner, Delhi issued a notification under s. 68(2) (ww) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 whereby the respondent and those engaged in similar business were required to take out licences. The respondent filed a writ petition in the Punjab High Court challenging cl. (ww) of s. 68(2) and the aforesaid notification on various grounds and asking for an order quashing the notification. The High Court allowed the writ petition holding that as the rules frame under s. 68 can be made only for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of Chapter IV of the Act, and in Chapter IV there was no substantive provision requiring agents engaged in the business of collecting, forwarding and distributing goods carried by public carriers to take out licences, the legislature had no power to enact cf. (ww) of s. 68(2) authorising the framing of the rules for the licensing of such agents. The appellants came to this Court with certificate.
 HELD : The appeal must be allowed.
 Section 68(2) specifically enumerates the matter on which rules under the section can be made for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of Chapter IV. Clause (ww) of s. 68 (2) is an expression of the will of the legislature that rules for the licensing of agents engaged in the business of collecting, forwarding and distributing goods carried by public carriers may be made for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of Chapter IV. The proposition that the legislature must in the first instance incorporate in the Act a section requiring a class of per- sons to take out licences before it can enact a section authorising the making of rules for such licensing is unsound and must be rejected. Within the limits of their legislative powers, parliament and the State legislatures have plenary powers of legislation and they may delegate to an executive authority the power to make rules for the licensing of any class of persons.
