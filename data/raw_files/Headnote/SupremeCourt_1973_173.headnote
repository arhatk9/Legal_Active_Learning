 The two deceased, husband and wife, along with their daughter and servant were travelling by train. At a wayside station the two appellants and another co-accused, still absconding, got into the compartment armed with deadly wea- pons. The husband and wife were robbed and in the scuffle that followed both were fatally injured. After the arrest of the, accused they were identified by the daughter and the servant of the deceased. The accused were convicted by the trial court for the offences under sections 394 and 302 I.P.C.
 The High Court, holding inter alia, that in the test identification chart there was no specific mention about the assault by the first accused on one of the deceased, acquitted both the accused of the offence under s. 302 I.P.C.
 Dismissing the appeal of the appellants with respect to the offence under s. 394 and allowing the appeal by the State with respect to the offence under s. 3 02.
 
HELD : The use made by the judges of the High Court of the test identification chart was faulty. The test identification chart would not and could not be expected to contain a complete statement. The two accused were identified by the two eye-witnesses and they both spoke of the attack on one of the deceased by the second accused.
 It could not however,be said that the first accused did not cause injuries to anybody or that nobody caused any injury to the other deceased. The High Court also did not find that the first accused did not cause any injury to either of the deceased. [745E] If it was difficult to say which injury was caused by which of the accused, the natural inference would be that all the three accused caused one injury each on each of the deceased. As the injury caused by the weapons in the hands of the two accused were such as were enough to cause death, the two accused were equally guilty of murder. The fact that they could not have started with the intention of committing murder but only to commit robbery was not rele- vant. The injuries were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death and, therefore, the accused would be guilty of murder. [745 G-B] Considering the fact that there had been a long interval between the date of the offence and dismissal of the appeal and the mental agony undergone by the accused, the ends of justice would be met if sentence of life imprisonment was award.
