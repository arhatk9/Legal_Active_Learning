 On a petition of the assessee challenging the validity of Rajasthan Sales Tax Rules, the High Court passed an interim order that the assessee would keep proper accounts and file the prescribed returns, but that he should not be assessed till further orders. While the petition was pending an ordinance was promulgated validating the rules, and the assessee withdrew the petition. The sales tax officer sent a show cause notice and the assessee filed the return and deposited tax. The Sales Tax Officer assessed tax and imposed a penalty under s. 16(1)(b) of the Act and justified and imposition on the ground that the High Court did not say that the assessee was allowed to withhold the tax, but that on the contrary the order of the High Court showed that the assessee should have filed returns in time and according to s. 7(2) of the Act the Treasury challan of the deposit should have accompanied them. The assessee's appeal to the Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax (Appeals) was dismissed.
 The Sales-tax Officer, for a subsequent period, imposed another penalty on the same grounds. The assessee filed two writ petitions in the High Court which were allowed. In appeal 
HELD : (i) There had been no breach of s. 16(1) (b) of the Act, and consequently the orders imposing the penalties could not be sustained. [809 H] Till the tax payable was ascertained by the assessing authority under s. 10, or by the assessee under s. 7(2), no tax could be said to be due within s. 16(1)(b) of the Act, for, till then there was only a liability to be assessed to tax. [810 B-C] Rule 31 of the Rajasthan Sales Tax Rules comes into the picture only when an assessment has been completed. [810 D] (ii) Section 7(2) of the Act could not be attracted till the assessee filed the returns. [810 F]
