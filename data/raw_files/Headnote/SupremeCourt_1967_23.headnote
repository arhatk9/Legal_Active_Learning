 On February 28, 1963 the Government of Madhya Pradesh issued a memorandum whereby the age of retirement of its employees was raised from 55 to 58 years. Clause 5 of the memorandum however said that the appointing authority may require a Government servant to retire after be attained the age of 55 years on three months' notice without giving any reasons.
 The clause further said that this power was normally to be used to weed out unsuitable employees. The appellant who was a District and Sessions Judge in the service of the State Government would normally have retired at the age of 55 years in August 1963, but under the above memorandum his services were extended beyond that date. In September 1963 however, Government communicated to him an order that he was to retire on December 31, 1963. On December 6, 1963, a notification was issued by the State Government amending rule 56 of the Fundamental Rules applicable to the State of Madhya Pradesh. By the amended F.R. 56 the age of retirement of Government servants was raised to 58 years with effect from March 1, 1963. All the provisions of cl. 5 of the aforesaid memorandum of February 28, 1963 were not incorporated into the new rule by this amendment. The appellant filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging the order compulsorily retiring him on December 31, 1963. It was rejected and the appellant came, with certificate, to this Court.
 The questions that fell for consideration were : (i) Did the order compulsorily retiring the appellant cast a stigma on him in view of the language of cl. 5 of the memorandum and if so whether Art. 311 of the Constitution was attracted ? (ii) Was the Memorandum a, rule under Art. 309 of the Constitution ? (iii) If it_was not a rule, would not the appellant be liable to retire in August 1963? (iv) Were the All India Services (Death-cum-Retirement Benefits) Rules, 1958 applicable to the appellant by virtue of r. 7(2) of the Madhya Pradesh Judicial Service (Classification, Recruitment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 1955 ? 
HELD (i) Where there are no express words in the order of compulsory retirement itself which would throw a stigma on the Government servant, the Court would not delve into Secretariat files to discover whether some kind of stigma could be inferred on such research. Since in the present case there were no words of stigma in the order compulsorily retir- 497 ing the appellant, there was no removal requiring action under Art. 311 of the Constitution.

 (ii) The memorandum of February 28, 1963 contained merely executive instructions and was not a rule under Art. 309 of the Constitution. The only rule which the Government had made on the question of superannuation was by the notification of December 6, 1963. This rule would apply to the appellant and it did not empower the Government to retire Government servants over the age of 55 years on three months' notice without assigning any reason. As this rule would apply to the appellant from the date it came into force, the notice which had been served retiring him from December 31, 1963 must fall. [504 B-C] Shyam Lal v. State of U.P. [1955] 1 S.C.R. '26, distinguished..
 (iii) Though ordinarily the power of Government to extend the services of Government servants, as contemplated by the then existing F.R 56 is to be exercised in individual case under individual orders, there is nothing to prevent the Government passing a general order if it decides that all 'Government servants be retained up to a certain a . The memorandum of February 28, 1963 amounted to an order of Government under the then existing F.R. 56, retaining the services of all Government servants up to the age of 58 years subject to the conditions prescribed in the memorandum till an appropriate rule as to the, age of superannuation was framed. Therefore under this memorandum the appellant became entitled to continue in service beyond the age of 55 years and consequently he did not have to retire in August 1963. [504 F-505 C] (iv) Rule 7(2) of the Madhya Pradesh Judicial Service Rules, 1955 can only take in rules which applied to officers holding superior posts in the cadre of the Indian Administrative Service on the date it came into force in 1956. The Rule does not say that all future amendments to the rules relating to officers holding superior posts in the cadre of the Indian Administrative Service would also apply to District Judges. In these circumstances the respondent could not take advantage of the All India Service Rules, 1958, particularly of a rule which came into force in 1963.
