 The respondent's ancestors continuously enjoyed the watan property through the years since the 17th century when it was granted and performed the duties of the office of the watandar in spite of political changes in the country. After the death of the then holder of the watan in 1851, an enquiry into the rights of his son Bhimrao was started under the Bombay Rent Free Estates Act, 1852 and later in 1863 a settlement known as "Gordon Settlement" was made under section 15 of the Bombay Hereditary Offices Act, (Act III of 1874), whereby a sanad was issued by the British Government to the respondent's ancestor Bhimrao in 1872. The Sanad is in the standard form of a Gordan Sanad and says that the lands and cash allowances shall be continued in lineal succession from generation to generation on condition that the persons in enjoyment and their heirs shall be obedient to the British Government and act faithfully and honestly and shall go on paying to Government permanently every year the amount mentioned in the Sanad.
 In 1874 some of these watan lands were auction-sold in execution of a money decree obtained by the appellants' ancestors and as a result of a compromise decree obtained in 1912, the ancestors of the appellant, being decree holders, were allowed to be in possession of these lands during the life time of Bhimrao and his adopted son Ramasomappa.
 Bhimrao died in 1918 and Ramasomappa in 1944. Section 5 of the Bombay Hereditary Offices Act, 1874 forbids a watandar to alienate the watan property beyond his lifetime to any person not a watandar of the same watan. After Ramasomappa's death therefore the appellants ceased to have any right to continue in possession of the lands. Respondent Gurusangappa is Ramasomappa's son.
 Consequent on the coming into force of the Bombay Pargana and Kulkarni Watans (Abolition) Act, 1950 abolishing the watans, the watan lands were resumed and were made subject to the payment of land revenue subject to the provisions of section 4. Respondent Gurusangappa and also the appellants applied to the prescribed authority for regrant of the aforesaid watan lands under section 4 of the Act. Earlier to this an application made in 1947 made on behalf of respondent Gurusangappa under section 10 of the Bombay Hereditary Offices Act, 1874 when he was a minor was rejected.
 The appellants lost before all authorities under the Act who held that the respondent was the holder of the watan and was as such entitled to an order of regrant. The Mysore Revenue Appellant Tribunal, Belgaum however 117 set aside in revision the order of regrant in favour of the respondent. The High Court allowed the writ petition of the respondent challenging the order of the Revenue Tribunal and restored the order of regrant in his favour.
 Dismissing the appeal from the order of the High Court, the Court, ^ 
 HELD : (1) On the facts found by the authorities under the 1950 Act except the Revenue Tribunal the respondent would be clearly entitled to the Watan lands being regranted to him under section 4 of the Act. All the authorities including the Revenue Tribunal having held that the appellants were strangers to the watan and, therefore, could not ask for an order under section 4 in their favour and the appellants not having challenged this finding it has become final. [120E-F] Collector of South Satara and another v. Laxman Madhay Deshpande and others [1963] INSC 36; [1964] 2 SCR 48, followed.
 (2) The Sanad granted to Bhimrao in 1872 was on the basis that there was a watan and that Bhimrao was the holder of the watan. The Sanad of 1872 granted only the right to hold the watan lands free from full assessment. The Revenue Tribunal was wrong in thinking that the Sanad granted the royal share of the revenue. [120G-H] Ramasomappa Bhimrao Desai v. The Secretary of State for India in Council, 39 Bom. L. R. 851, explained and held inapplicable.
 (3) Section 10 of the Bombay Hereditary Offices Act, 1874 empowered the Collector to issue a certificate on the basis of which the respondent could bring an action against the appellants for recovery of possession of the lands. The rejection of the application under section 10 of the Act is not a matter relevant to the issue whether the respondent is entitled to a regrant of the watan lands under section 4 of the 1950 Act.
