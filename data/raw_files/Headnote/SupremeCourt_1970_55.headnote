 The appellant was engaged in the business of manufacture of sugar, in the respondent-State. It was in possession of Zamindari property. Part of the area in its possession consisted of two enclosures The factory buildings were situated in the inner enclosure and the outer was used for residential quarters, garages, kitchens, clubs, dispensaries, rest houses, out houses, office buildings, tubewell and water tank, godown, cattle shed, weighbridge house etc.
 Under the notification issued under the Bihar land Reforms Act, 1950, the Zamindari vested in the State but homestead lands and lands of the factory remained in the occupation of the appellant.
 On the question whether the outer enclosure was homestead land not liable to assessment under s. 5(1) of the Act or was liable to assessment under s. 7(1).
 
HELD : Under s. 5(1) an intermediary is entitled to retain possession of homestead lands as a tenant under the State free of rent; and under s. 7(1) an intermediary is entitled to retain possession as a tenant buildings or structures together with the lands on which they stand subject to payment of such fair and equitable ground rent as may be determined by the Collector if they are used as golas, factories or mills, for the purpose of trade, manufacture or commerce. The expression employed is 'used as' and not 'used for'. Therefore, merely because a factory has for the benefit of the workmen and managerial staff working in the factory, constructed buildings as quarters, clubs, kitchens, garage, dispensary, rest houses, out houses etc., they cannot be deemed to fall Linder s. 7(1) when they are not directly used as factory or mill buildings. The definition of 'factory' in the Factories Act whose object and scheme are entirely different, cannot be a guide in determining the meaning of the expression, 'factory' as used in Bihar Land Reforms Act.
