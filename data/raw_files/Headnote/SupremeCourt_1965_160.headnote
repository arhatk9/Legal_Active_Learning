 When s. 193 of the Code of Criminal Procedure prohibits the Court of Session, from taking "cognizance of any offence as a court of original jurisdiction" unless the accused is committed to it by a Magistrate or there is any other express provision of the Code, on the question whether the High Court is competent under s. 526(1)(ii) of the Code to transfer a case from the Court of a Magistrate to the Court of a Sessions Judge, 
HELD : (Per Sarkar & Dayal, JJ.) The High Court is competent.
 Cognizance of an offence as a court of original jurisdiction means the initiation of proceedings for the first time in a court and not in a subsequent inquiry or trial necessary for the disposal of the case. When a case is committed to the Court of Sessions, it proceeds with the trial of the case only when it considers the commitment good in law. It is in this context that Sessions Court has to take 'cognizance' of the offence as a court or original jurisdiction and it is such cognizance that is referred to in s. 193. The provisions of the various sections in Part B of Chapter XV of the Code dealing with initiation of proceedings also make out the difference between the taking of cognizance of a case and the subsequent inquiry and trial of the offences of which cognizance has been LA-en. 1567 B, C, D; 568 Al There are no reasons which could have induced the legislature to contemplate tile limiting of cl. (ii), of sub-s. (1) of s. 526 to the transfer of cages from the court of a Magistrate to the court of any other Magistrate of equal or superior jurisdiction. Further, when under the Code the High Court is competent to transfer a case from the court of a Magistrate to itself and try it would be incongruous to bold that the High Court is not competent to Transfer a case to the Court of Sessions. [568 D-E] The omission to provide specifically the procedure to be followed in the trial of a case transferred to the Court of Sessions by the High Court in the exercise of its powers under s. 526 of the Code will not make the transfer illegal, when the language of cl. (ii) of sub-s. (1) confers the power on the High Court of transferring a case from the Court of a Magistrate to a Court of superior jurisdiction.
 There is no difficulty in the Court of Sessions trying the case transferred to it in accordance with the provision of Ch. XXIII which deals with the procedure of trial& before the High Courts and Courts of Sessions. The Court of Session.-, has to follow the procedure laid down in this Chapter so far as that be applicable to the cases to be tried by it. The special procedure laid down for particular type of cases and proceedings will be followed in those cases as special provisions over-ride general Provisions of Chapter XXIII. [563 F; 564 C--E] Section 193, therefore, does not bar further proceedings by the Court of Sessions in a case transferred to it by the High Court. [568 C] 561 Per Ramaswami, J. (Dissenting) : The High Court has no power to transfer a case from the Court of a Magistrate to the Court of Sessions without a proper commitment having been made. [573 C-D] While s. 526(2) is an express provision with regard to the trial of the case transferred by the High Court to itself from any other criminal court other than the court of a Presidency Magistrate, section 526 does not expressly provide for the procedure to be followed by a Sessions Judge it, a case transferred to it by the High Court. it follows, therefore, that the legislature has not enacted any express provision to the control within the meaning of s. 193(1).
 [571 E-F] The language of s. 526(1) (ii) cannot be read in isolation and cannot be given effect to without regard to the mandatory provisions of s. 193. The powers of transfer given to the High Court under s. 526(1)(ii) must be interpreted as not to conflict with the language of s. 193.
