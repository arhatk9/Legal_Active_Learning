 The appellant was discharged from the post of combatant Clerk in the Indian Army on 9th June, 1953 and was re- employed shortly thereafter. His pay was re-fixed in the scale applicable. On 15th July 1960 the Government of India issued a general Order relating to re-employed ex-military personnel. Under the Order those entitled to its benefits would get fixed in the scale applicable to them by adding to the bottom of their scales increments equal to the total number of completed years of military service. The first respondent having exercised the option provided for in the Order, claimed that he was entitled to the benefit of the Order. The claim was rejected by the Government The first respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court. The writ petition was allowed and the High Court directed that the pay of the respondent be refixed from 2-3-1953. In appeals to this Court it was contended by Union of India :
 (i) that the order was not applicable to the first res- pondent as he was re-employed before 25-11-1958; (ii) that the order being an administrative direction was not justiciable and no writ lay; (iii) that the order not being retrospective in character, the respondent's pay should not have been fixed with retrospective effect from 2-7-53.
 
HELD :-(i) The general rule under the Order was that past cases of persons re-employed prior to 25-11-1958 would not be reopened. But the effect of clause (3) of paragraph (3) is to create an exception to the general rule in the case of persons re-employed before 25-11-1958 for an unspecified period or for a period which extends to the date of order and who have exercised their option in writing to be brought under the Order. The respondent having exercised his option was therefore entitled to the benefit of the order.
 (ii)Generally speaking an administrative order confers no justiciable right but this rule like all other general rules is subject to exceptions. To say that an administrative order can never confer any right would be too wide a proposition. There are administrative rights which confer rights and impose duties. it is because an administrative order can abridge or takeaway rights that this Court imported the principle of natural justice of audi alteram partem into this area., The order in question conferred upon the first respondent the right to have his pay fixed in the manner specified in the Order and that was part of the conditions of his service. There was no reason why this Court should not enforce that right. [755D] Sant Ram Sharma v. State of Rajasthan and another[1967] INSC 168; , [1968] 1 S.C.R. 111; and Union of India and Others v. M/s. Indo Afghan Agencies Ltd., [1967] INSC 267; [1968] 2 S.C.R. 366, 377, applied to.
 (3)The order was not retrospective in character. The High Court was therefore wrong in fixing the pay with retrospective effect from 2-7-1953.
 753 The direction could only be to fix the pay with effect from the date of the Order.
