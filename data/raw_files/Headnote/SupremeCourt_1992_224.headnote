 For filling up the posts of 32 vacancies of conductors in the Transport Undertaking under it, the appellant requested the Employment Exchange to sponsor names of eligible candidates and constituted a Selection board to prepare a Select list. The Selection Board interviewed 446 candidates sponsored by the Employment Exchange and prepared a Select List of 32 candidates on the basis of marks awardable for educational qualifications and performance at the interview. There was criticism that the select list was an amalgum of favouritism, nepotism and even corruption resorted to by members of the Selection board. The appellant got the select list examined which revealed that the select list was not prepared by the members of the Selection board fairly and judiciously, in that, the members had taken undue advantage of awarding marks in the interview to favour candidates of their choice although there was no evidence of corruption. Hence the appellant decided to constitute a new Selection Board to prepare fresh select list on the basis of only 15 per cent marks awardable to candidates or pull down merited candidates. Accordingly, the appellant cancelled the select list of candidates constituted a new Selection Board to prepare a fresh select list from out of candidates including those who had been interviewed by the earlier Selection Board and the criteria to be followed was that 85% marks would be awardable for educational qualifications and 15% marks for performance in interview.
 When the newly constituted Selection Board was about to interview the candidates, the respondents whose names found place in the cancelled select list approached the Central Administrative Tribunal seeking the setting aside of the order cancelling the select list and constituting a new Board. The Tribunal, on the ground of non-affording of opportunity to the members of the Selection Board before cancelling the select list, set aside the order issued by the appellant and directed the appellant to appoint in the available vacancies the candidates from the cancelled select list in preference to candidates from the select list prepared by the newly constituted Selection Board.
 Beingaggrieved by the Tribunal's order the appellant preferred the present appeal by special leave.
 On behalf of the appellant it was contended that affording of an opportunity to the members of the Selection Board before cancelling the select list being neither a requirement of law nor a requirement of any of the principles of natural justice, it could not have been made the sole ground for setting aside the order issued by the appellant.
 On behalf of the respondents, it was contended that the select list of candidates prepared by the earlier Selection Board has been cancelled by the appellant though there was no proof of corruption charges against the members of the Selection Board; and that an opportunity of hearing ought to have been given to the candidates in the select list before it was cancelled.
 Allowing the appeal, this court, 
HELD: 1. The order made by the appellant- Administration cancelling the select list cannot but be regarded athe right and just one. Such an order cannot be vitiated on the ground that it had been made without affording an opportunity of hearing to the members of the Selection Board who had prepared it. Further, such an order cannot be vitiated either because no direct evidence was made available to prove corruption charges against the members of the Selection Board in the matter of award of interview marks by them so as to tilt the balance in favour of candidates with poor educational qualifications and against the candidates with high educational qualifications or because there was no opportunity of hearing afforded to the candidates in theselect list to sustain it before its cancellation by the appellant-Administration. [318-c-f] 2.Affording of an opportunity of hearing by an Administration to the members of a Selection Board constituted by it, before cancelling a dubious select list of candidates for appointment to civil posts prepared by such Selection Board is not and cannot be a requirement of either law or any principle of natural justice. It is so for the reason that no member of a Selection Board. Besides, there is no personal right or interest of any member of a Selection Board which could be adversely affected by the Administration cancelling a select list of candidates prepared by the Selection Board when it is found to have been prepared by the Selection Board, in unfair and injudicious manner. [318-G; H 319-A] 
3. The select list, which was cancelled by the appellant-Administration was found by it to have been prepared in unfair and injudicious manner, in that the interview marks purported to have been awarded by the members of the Selection Board for the performance of candidates at their interview were either inflated to push up the candidates who had got poor marks for their educational qualifications or deflated to pull down the candidates who had got high marks for their educational qualifications. That select list was also found to have been prepared without adopting common eligibility criteria for all candidates. when the said reasons formed the basis for the appellant-Administration to cancel the select list, the fact that charges of corruption levelled against the members of the Selection Board in the preparation of that select list had not been established by direct evidence produced in that regard, can make no difference. [319-E-H] 
4. Since it is accepted that a candidate who finds a place in the select list as a candidate selected for appointment to a civil post, does not acquire an indefeasible right to be appointed in such post in the absence of any specific Rule entitling him for such appointment and he could be aggrieved by hes non-appointment only when the Administration does so either arbitrarily or for no bona fide reasons, it follows as a necessary concomitant that such candidate even if he has a legitimate expectation of being appointed in such posts due to his name finding a place in the select list of candidates, cannot claim to have a right to be heard before such select list is cancelled for bona fide and valid reasons and not arbitrarily.[321-B,C] Shankarasan Dash v.
