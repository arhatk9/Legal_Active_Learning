 The appellant, his wife, and his mother held a joint decree.
 Against an order dismissing the application for execution of the decree, the appellant alone appealed joining the other two as party respondents. Pending appeal his wife died.
 The High Court dismissed the appeal holding that because the heirs and legal representatives of the appellant wife were not brought on record within the period of limitation the appeal abated in its entirety. , The High Court was of the view that the power of the appellate court under 0. 41. r. 4 Code of Civil Procedure may be exercised only in those cases where there is a decree which proceeds upon a ground common to more persons than one and the appeal is filed by one-, or more of them but not all and other persons who are interested in the result of the appeal are not made parties to the appeal. Allowing the appeal, HELD: (i) Power of the appellate court under 0. 41, r.
 4, C.P.C. to, very or modify the decree of a Subordinate Court arises when one of the persons out of many against whom a decree or an order had been made on a ground which was common to him and others, has appealed, and that power may be exercised when other persons who were parties to the proceeding before the- Subordinate Court are either not impleaded as parties to the appeal or are impleaded as respondents. The power is not lost merely because the person who was jointly interested in. the claim has been made a party respondent and on his death his heirs have not been brought on the record.

 Rameshwar Prasad & Ors. v. M/s. Shyam Beharilal Jagannath & Ors. [1963] INSC 131; [1964] 3 S.C.R. 549, distinguished.
 (ii) Where in a proceeding a party dies and one of the legal representatives is already on the record in another capacity, it is only necessary that he should be described by an appropriate application made in that behalf that he is also on the record, as an heir and legal representative.
 Even if there are other heirs and legal representatives and no application for impleding them is made within the period of limitation prescribed by the Limitation Act the proceeding will not abate. On that ground also the order passed by the High Court cannot be sustained.
