 The respondent-assessee is a limited company carrying on the business of tea planting. A part of its tea estates was situated in Kerala and the other part was in Tamil Nadu.
 According to the assessee, the estate in question was working as one unit with one,factory and common accounts were maintained for the whole estate.
 For the assessment years 1956-57, 1957-58 and 1958-59, the Agricultural Income-tax Officer, Tamil Nadu, computed the Agricultural Income in accordance with the assessment made by the Central Income-tax Officer and took 60% of the income computed by the Central Income-tax Officer for the purpose of computation of Agricultural Income. For the assessment year 1960-61, however, the Agricultural Income-tax Officer felt that since the Kerala area of the estate yielded only 656 lbs. of tea per acre whereas the yield of Madras portion was 799 lbs. per acre, he took the valuation of the produce from the Madras portion as the gross receipt wherefrom he deducted the expenditure allowed by the Central Income-tax Officer and recalculated it from the Madras portion on the basis of acreage thereby showing a profit from the Madras portion and made his assessment accordingly. The computation of the Central Income-tax Officer, however, showed a loss for the entire estate.
 The Assistant Commissioner of Agricultural Income-tax upheld the order of Agricultural Income-tax Officer but the Tribunal set- aside the assessment, and remanded the case to Assistant Commissioner for certain matters. The departments further sought to reassess the assessee for the earlier 3 years also and issued notices. The assessee, thereupon, filed writ petitions challenging the order of reopening the assessment. A tax revision was also filed against the order of Agricultural Income-tax Appellate Tribunal in respect of the assessment for the year 1960-61. The writ petitions and the revision were allowed by the High Court and the order of reopening the assessment was quashed. As regards the assessment for the year 1960-61, the Agricultural Income-tax Officer was directed to make a revised assessment on the basis of the Central incometax Officer's computation which was considered by the High Court to be the proper basis for assessment of Agricultural Income-tax for the year 1960-61.
 On appeal, the Revenue strongly relied on s. 6 of the Madras Agricultural Income-tax Act and rules 7 and 8 framed under that Act. Dismissing the appeals, 
HELD : (1) Rules 7 and 8 made under s. 6 of the Madras Agricultural Income-tax Act have no application in the present case because r. 7 deals with Agricultural Income from tea grown and manufactured in the State of Madras. In the present case, though tea is grown in Madras, it is manufactured in Kerala which is outside that State.
 Therefore, r. 7 does not apply. Similarly r. 8 does not cover the case of tea which is manufactured in another State and not in the State of Madras Tea leaves 1017 alone can be the produce of a particular State but as such they have no value. They become valuable only after they are subjected to a special process, which takes place in Kerala. Therefore r. 8 has no applicability to manufactured tea. [1020 F] (ii)A very small area of the estate is in the State of Madras and even though that area is more fertile and gives much more yield than the area in Kerala, the entire estate has to be assessed as a whole and the High Court has rightly thought that Agricultural Income-tax Officer should accept the computation of the Central Income-tax Officer which is the only satisfactory basis for computation of agricultural Income-tax in respect of the estate, especially when, the Agricultural Income-tax Officer has not given satisfactory reasons for not accepting the Central Income-tax Officer's computation.
