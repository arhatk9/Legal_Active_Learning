 The appellant was one of the 19 candidates for the 11 members to be elected at the biennial election for electing members to Council of States from the constituency of elected members of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly, at the election held on 28th March, 1979.
 The election was to be in accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of single transferable vote. In all 421 members exercised their franchise. Eleven ballot papers were rejected by the returning officer as invalid and the 1st Respondent was declared elected in the 14th count.
 The appellant, thereupon, filed an election petition under section 81 of the 1951 Act before the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court for scrutiny and recount on the allegation of miscount. The appellant alleged that (i) the result of the election in so far as it concerns the returned candidate (i.e.) 1st respondent-has been materially affected by the improper rejection of valid votes by wrongly declaring them invalid as well as by improper reception of what otherwise would have been the invalid votes if the Returning Officer had been consistent in his approach, and, therefore, the election of the returned candidate not only should be declared void but in his place by a proper computation of votes, the petitioner should be declared elected to the 11th vacancy, (ii) there had been an improper rejection of the valid votes cast in her favour and that has materially affected the result of the election; and (iii) even though it was obligatory upon the Returning Officer to show all the ballot papers which he rejected as invalid, to the candidates and/or their counting agents, he only showed four out of the eleven ballot papers held invalid by him and did not show the rest of them. Even these four were wrongly rejected and cannot be said to be covered by Rule 73(2)(d) of the Election Rules. The High Court dismissed the election petition and hence the appeal by special leave.
 The appellant contended that (i) where the election is to be held in accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote, if the first preference is properly and ascertainably cast any 682 error in setting out the remaining preferences would not enable the Returning Officer to reject the whole ballot paper; and (ii) every unrequired mark, cutting, erasure cannot tantamount to any indication which would enable the voter to be identified but the writing or mark must be such that the voter can be and not merely might be identified and there is no such cutting mark or erasure within the meaning of Rule 73(2)(d) of the Conduct of Election Rules; 1961.
 Allowing the appeal, the Court ^ 
 HELD: 1:1. When a petition is for relief of scrutiny and recount on the allegation of miscount, the petitioner has to offer prima facie proof of errors in counting and if errors in counting are prima facie established, a recount can be ordered. If the allegation is of improper rejection of valid votes which is covered by the broad spectrum of scrutiny and recount because of miscount, petitioner must furnish prima facie proof of such error. If proof is furnished of some errors in respect of some ballot papers, scrutiny and recount cannot be limited to those ballot papers only. If the recount is limited to those ballot papers in respect of which there is a specific allegation of error and the correlation is established, the approach would work havoc in a Parliamentary constituency where more often 10,000 or more votes are rejected as invalid. [690 A-C] 1:2. Law does not require that while giving proof of prima facie error in counting each head of error must be tested by only sample examination of some of the ballot papers which answer the error and then take into consideration only those ballot papers and not others. This is not the area of inquiry in a petition for relief of recount on the ground of miscount. True it is that 'a recount is not granted as of right, but on evidence of good grounds for believing that there has been a mistake on the part of Returning Officer. Prima facie proof of error complained of must be given by the election petitioner and it must further be shown that the errors are of such magnitude that the result of the election so far as it affects the returned candidate is materially affected, then recount is directed. [690 C-E] 1:3. It is not the requirement of law that in respect of each ballot paper rejected as invalid a specific averment must be so ma e as to identify the ballot paper and the only those that can be correlated to the allegations in the petition specifically and not generally shall be recounted.
 That is contrary to the requirement of the Act and the Rules. [691 B-C] 2:1. A combined reading of Rules 37A(1), 73(2)(a) and 73(2)(b) of the conduct of Election Rules 1961, makes clear that when voting is in accordance with the proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote it is obligatory to cast the first preference vote for ensuring the validity of the ballot paper and the first preference vote must be so cast as not to leave any one in doubt about it. The remaining preferences are optional with the elector.
 He may or may not exercise his franchise for the remaining preferences. Rule 73(2) is exhaustive of the grounds on which a ballot paper at a voting at election by Assembly members shall be rejected as invalid and on a true and in depth reading of it, it does not transpire that the 683 failure to cast the remaining preferences would invalidate the ballot papers. This is so because under rule 37A(1) every elector has only one vote at an election irrespective of the number of seats to be filled. The vote is only one and even if there is more than one seat to be filled in, subsequent preferences may be indicated by the elector and it is optional with him not to exercise preferences outside his only one vote which he must cast by indicating unambiguously his first preference. [695 D-G] 2:2. If there is only one vote at such an election and the preferences are as many as there are seats chronologically to be indicated and failure to exercise preferences subsequent to first preference would not invalidate the ballot paper, it must follow as a corollary that if the elector has committed some error in exercising his preferences lower down the ladder the whole of the ballot paper cannot be rejected as invalid. Therefore, it must follow that not only such a ballot paper has to be held as valid ballot paper but its validity shall continue upto the stage in preferences where an error or confusion transpires which would not permit computation of subsequent preferences below the level of error. To illustrate the point if as in the present case the voter had option to exercise 11 preferences and if he has exercised his preferences 1 to 5 correctly and unambiguously and has committed an error in exercising sixth preference and it cannot be said with certainty for whom the sixth preferences vote was cast, the ballot paper has to be held valid in computation of votes upto and inclusive of the fifth preference and rejected for the preferences down below as if the elector has not exercised his further preferences which was optional with him. The ballot paper can thus be partially valid and this is the logical outcome of the system of voting. [695 F-H, 696 A-C-E] 3:1. Free and fair election being the fountain source of Parliamentary democracy attempt of the Returning Officer and the Court should be not to chart the easy course of rejecting ballot papers as invalid under the slightest pretext but serious attempt should be made before rejecting ballot papers as invalid to ascertain, if possible, whether the elector has cast his vote with sufficient clarity revealing his intendment. In this case, the Returning Officer has charted an easy course unsupportable by evidence and the High Court failed to exercise its jurisdiction of scrutiny of all ballot papers once a serious error has been pointed out in respect of two ballot papers out of a total of 11 invalid ballot papers. [700 E-G] 3:2 Rule 73(2)(d), provides that a ballot paper shall be invalid on which, there is any mark or writing by which the elector can be identified. Section 94 of the Representation of People Act, 1951 ensures secrecy of ballot and it cannot be infringed because no witness or other person shall be required to state for whom he has voted at an election. To ensure free and fair election which is pivotal for setting up a parliamentary democracy, this vital principle was enacted in s. 94 to ensure that a voter would be able to vote uninhibited by any fear or any undesirable consequence of disclosure of how he voted. As a corollary it is provided that if there is any mark or writing on the ballot paper which enables the elector to be identified the ballot paper would be 684 rejected as invalid. But the mark or writing must be such as would unerringly lead to the identity of the voter. Any mark or writing of an innocuous nature or meaningless import cannot be raised to the level of such suggestive mark or writing as to reveal the identity of the voter. There must be some causal connection between the mark and the identity of the voter that looking at one the other becomes revealed.
 Therefore the mark or a writing itself must reasonably give indication of the voter's identity. It may be that there may be extrinsic evidence from which it can be inferred that the mark was placed by the voter by some arrangement. [697 F-H, 698 A-D] Raghubir Singh Gill v. Gurcharan Singh Tohra & Others, [1980] INSC 119; [1980] 3 S.C.R. 1302; followed.
 Woodward v. Sarsons & Another, [1874-75] 10 L.R. (CP) 733, quoted with approval.
 3:3. The words "can be identified" in Rule 73(2)(d) cannot be interpreted to mean "might possibly be identified". The mark or writing which would invalidate the ballot paper must be such as to unerringly point in the direction of identity of the voter. In the absence of suggested mark or writing the ballot paper cannot be rejected merely because there is some mark or writing on the ground that by the mark or writing the voter may be identified. [698 D-F] Sohan Lal v. Abinash Chander & Others, [1953] 4 Election Law Reports, 55 approved.
 3:4. In the instant case, (i) there was specific averment in para 18 of the petition that the marks were not such as to lead to identity of the elector and that the ballot papers could not be rejected as invalid under rule 73(2)(d). This allegation is wholly substantiated by a casual look at the remaining nine ballot papers. The error is apparent; Once the error has been established the scrutiny and recount had to be ordered as a prima facie case of miscount is made out and, therefore, the decision of the High Court is liable to be set aside, (ii) As the High Court has not undertaken to examine the validity of each ballot paper it would not be proper for the Supreme Court to undertake the same for the first time here; (iii) the position of law having been made very clear, namely, that once an error is established it is not necessary that the pleadings must show error in respect of each individual invalid ballot paper, and a prima facie proof of error resulting in miscount having been established a scrutiny and recount has to be ordered. And the serutiny of invalid ballot papers must precede the recount; and (iv) there is no evidence of any prior arrangement between candidate and the voter regarding identity and (v) the ballot papers could not have been rejected on the ground mentioned in rule 73(2)(d), such marks, being in this case, some erasures or a bracket.
