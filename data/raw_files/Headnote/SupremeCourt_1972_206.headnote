 By the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 the Delhi Road Transport Authority Act, 1950, was repealed and the functions of the Authority were taken over by the Corporation. Every employee-. of the Authority stood transferred to and became an employee of the Corporation from January 1958.
 Under s. 92 of the Corporation Act the power of appointing municipal officers and other municipal employees to posts carrying a (minimum monthly salary of Rs. 350/- vest in the General Manager (Transport). Section 95(1) dealing with disciplinary matters provides that every officer or other employee shall be liable to be punished by such authority as may be prescribed by regulations. By the proviso to subsection (1) of s. 95 no officer or employee shall be reduced in rank, compulsorily retired, removed or dismissed by any authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed. Section 491 read with 504 empowers the General Manager (Transport) to direct by order that any power con- ferred or any duty imposed on him by or under the Act shall be exercised and performed also by any municipal officer specified in the order.
 Respondent No. 2 was originally employed as a driver in the Delhi Transport Authority. He became an employee of the Corporation from January 1958. The minimum monthly salary drawn by him was less than Rs. 350/-. After a disciplinary enquiry the Assistant General Manager removed the respondent from service with effect from May 16, 1963. The Labour Court, in an application under s. 33 (2) (b) of the Industrial Disputes Act, did not grant approval of the action on the ground that the General Manager alone could have removed him from service. The High Court confirmed this view. It was common ground that the General Manager (Transport) had by order issued in 1961 delegated his power to the Assistant General Manager to appoint and consequently, to remove from service a driver like respondent No. 2. In the appeal to this Court it was contended by the appellant Undertaking that the respondent was originally employed by the Manager of the Road Transport Authority constituted under the 1950 Act and on the repeal of that Act and the take over of the authority by the Corporation any officer of the appellant Undertaking competent to appoint or remove a driver was entitled to remove him from service; that the Assistant General Manager of the Undertaking could not be described as an authority subordinate to the Manager of the Delhi Road Transport Authority; and that in army event the Assistant General Manager had become an agent of the General Manager.
 Dismissing the appeal.

HELD : (i) Respondent No. 2 at the time of his absorption in January 1958, would be deemed to have been appointed under s. 92(1) (b) which would mean that he was appointed by the General Manager (Transport). Being so, appointed, no subordinate of his including the Assistant General Manager would be entitled to remove him in view of s. 95(1) proviso.
 The only consequence of the delegation of functions of the General Manager to the Assistant General Manager would be that if after 1961 the Assistant General Manager makes the appointment of a driver like respondent No. 2 he would no doubt be entitled to remove him from service. [118D-E] (ii)A protection which is given to an employee by statute cannot be nullified by rules and regulations authorised by the statute itself. If the Corporation itself could not have by a regulation destroyed the protection given by the statute to respondent No. 2, it would be inappropriate to say that General Manager by an order delegating his functions to the Assistant General Manager under s. 491 read with 594 the Corporation Act could destroy the protection.
 The true position in law is that while sections 491 and 504 read together authorised the General Manager (Transport) to delegate his powers-and functions to a subordinate they did not authorise delegation of his rank. What is involved in matters of appointment and removal is the status and rank of the employee and the status and rank of the authority taking action. When the proviso to sub-section (1) of s. 95 says that an officer and an employee shall not be dismissed by any authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed the subordination is of tank and not functions. [120D-H] R.T. Rangachari v. Secretary of State, 64 Indian Appeals, 40, referred to.
 Itis implicit in the statutory prohibition debarring removal by a,lesser authority, that the appointing authority has to personally apply its mind to the question of removal and cannot delegate such a function. The protection provided cannot be destroyed by importing concepts of agency. [121C]
