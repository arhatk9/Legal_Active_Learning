 The Respondent and several others were appointed as Inspectors of Excise (junior) on a purely temporary basis on 17.1.1968. The services of these 'local candidates" i.e.
 direct recruits appointed otherwise than in accordance with the General Rules or Special Rules, were regularised from 26.10.1971. Provisional seniority list prepared by the Department showed the seniority of these candidates from the date of their regularisation and not from their date of appointment. Despite objections from the candidates the said list was finalised. The Respondent challenged the seniority list by riling a Writ Petition before the High Court. The Writ Petition was disposed of with a direction to the appellants that the seniority list should be published afresh considering the claim of the respondent that his seniority should be counted from his date of appointment and not from the date of his regularisation.
 Again, the department published a provisional seniority list showing the seniority of the Respondent from the date of his regularisation. The Respondent filed another Writ Petition challenging the seniority list. The writ petition was dis- missed by a Single Judge holding that as per Rule IA of Karnataka Government Servants (Seniority) Rules, 1957 the said Rules were not applicable to a local candidate, in whose case the seniority would count only from the date of regularisation. On an appeal by the Respondent, the', Division Bench of the High Court set aside the judgment of the Single Judge and directed that seniority of the Respondent should be reckoned from the date of his initial appointment. Aggrieved by this judgment, the Department preferred the present appeal.
 267 268 The appellants contended that since the respondent was appointed to the post of Excise Inspector (junior) as a local candidate purely on ad hoc basis and so he was not entitled to count his ad hoc appointment for purposes of seniority.
 Allowing the appeal, this Court, 
HELD:1.1. The respondent was appointed as a local candidate through Employment Exchange in view of the specific sanction of the. Government for such ad hoc appointment. The terms of appointment in the context of sanction of the said posts by the Government clearly demonstrates that such appointment of the said respondent and other employees in 1968 was ad hoc appointment given to local candidates sponsored by the local Employment Exchange. It was only on October 26, 1971, the respondent became eligible to be recruited in the said Class III post,'and such appointment/or regularisation of his ad hoc appointment was made possible because of the framing. of the Karnataka State Civil Services (Special) Rules, 1970. [278D.E] 1.2.The respondent was not entitled to claim seniority from the date of his initial. appointment on ad hoc basis but he was only entitled to claim seniority from the date of his subsequent appointment or regularisation under the special rules. Under Rule 3 of the special rules, ,the respondent, having possessed the minimum qualifications prescribed by the said special rules for recruitment to Class III Posts and the respondent having been appointed on or after January 1, 1965 as a local candidate to a Class III post and having put in a continuous service of one year prior to October 1, 1970 was eligible to be appointed under the said special rules of recruitment and the respondent was given such appointment with effect from October 26, 1971. [278F-H;
 279A] 1.3.The respondent was entitled to be treated as direct recruit properly made under the said special rules of 1970 only from October 26, 1971 and the service rendered by him prior to the said date was only on the basis of ad hoc employment not made in accordance with the rules of recruitment. [279A] Direct Recruit Class II Engineering Officers'Association and others v. State of Maharashtra and others, AIR 1990 SC 1607 and Masood Akhtar Khan v. State of Madhya Pradesh, [1990] 4 SCC 24, relied on.
