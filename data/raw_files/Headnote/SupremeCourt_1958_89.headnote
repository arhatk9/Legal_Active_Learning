 There is no provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure which limits the wide discretionary power conferred on the High Court by s. 439- read with s. 435 Of the Code of Criminal Procedure to examine the correctness, legality or propriety of any finding, sentence or order passed by an inferior Court and, where it chooses to interfere either suo motu or at the instance of a party, it has thereunder the power, in the ends of justice, not only to bring the legal representative of a deceased party on record but also to consider the legality of the order of conviction even when the sentence inflicted may be a composite one of imprisonment and fine.
 Imperatrix v. Dongaji Andaji, (1878) I.L.R. 2 Bom. 564, approved.
 In Ye Nabishah, (1894) I.L.R. 19 Bom. 714, considered.
 Consequently, in a case where the accused petitioner, who was convicted under s. 420 Of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced to suffer one day's imprisonment, which really meant detention till the rising of the Court on the day the order was pronounced, and to pay a fine of Rs. 500/- and in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for six months, died during the pendency of the revision case in the High Court and his son applied to be substituted as a party in order that he could challenge the order of conviction and sentence and the High Court, holding that the principle Of s. 431 of the Code of Criminal Procedure applied, added him as a party but refused to consider the legality of the order of conviction and reduced the sentence.
 Held, that the High Court was in error in limiting its powers under S. 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on the analogy Of s. 431 of the Code, which in terms did not apply to a revision case, and its decision must be set aside.
