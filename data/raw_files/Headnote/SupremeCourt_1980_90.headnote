 The appellant Bai Dosabhai obtained two plots of land in Survey Nos. 59 and 63 at Vastrapur from her father-in- law, Jehangirji, by way of gift. On February 25, 1946, Dosabhai executed a deed styled "a deed of lease" in favour of Indu Prasad Dev Shankar Bhatt whose successors-in- interest are the respondents to this appeal. The vital terms of the lease were: The lessee was entitled to purchase the land at any time within seven years by paying the stipulated price of Rs. 1,29, 111-8-0 a fourth of which was paid in advance. Until the date of sale he was to pay certain stipulated rent. Two year's rent was paid in advance but if the sale took place within two years of the deed, the lessor would not be obliged to return a proportionate part of the advance rent paid by him. If there was default in payment of rent and if the default continued even after three months' notice had been given or if the lessor failed to pay the purchase price and get a sale deed executed in his favour, the lessor was entitled to call upon the lessee, by giving three months' notice, to pay the purchase price and take a deed of sale in his favour. If the lessee failed to comply with the notice the lessor was entitled to take possession of the land alongwith the structures thereon. After taking possession the lessor was bound to sell the same by public auction at the cost and risk of the lessee. If, at the auction, a price less than the stipulated price was fetched the lessee was bound to make good the deficiency to the lessor. If the price realised was more, the lessor was to pay the surplus to lessee. The amount of Rs. 32,277-14-0 paid by the lessee to the lessor as advance of one fourth of the consideration was to be given credit to the lessor.
 Since the lessee, in spite of three notices dated October, 25, 1950, March 7, 1951 and June 19, 1952 issued by the lessor calling upon the lessee to pay the balance of price within three months from the date of receipt of the notice. failing which a suit would be instituted to recover possession of the property and to sell it by public auction at the cost and risk of the lessee remained silent, the lessor, on November 21, 1952 filed a suit in the Court of the Civil Judge Senior Division Ahmedabad to recover rent for the period from January 23, 1950 to January 22, 1953 and for possession as well as damages in lieu of rent from January 22, 1953 onwards. The present plaintiff, the successor-in-interest of the original lessee who was defendant No. 4 in the suit filed a written statement pleading that he was a tenant as defined by the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act 1948, that his possession could not be disturbed and that the Civil Court had no jurisdiction to pass a decree for possession or for mesne profits. This plea was based on the circumstance that an amendment 763 which came into force on January 1, 1953 made the provisions of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, applicable to the suit lands. This Act, however ceased to be applicable to the suit lands on August 11, 1958, when the suit lands came to be included within the limits of the Ahmedabad Municipality. The suit filed by the lessor was decreed on December 30, 1955. In execution of the decree obtained by her, the lessor obtained possession of the lands on December 22, 1960.
 Immediately on the lessor obtaining possession, the lessee on January, 16, 1961, instituted the suit out of which the present appeal arose seeking (a) specific performance of the agreement dated February 25, 1940 by directing the lessor-defendant to execute a sale deed in his favour after receiving from him the balance of sale price of Rs. 96,833-10-0 and (b) in the alternative, to direct the defendant to sell the land by public auction to retain a sum of Rs. 96,833-10-0 out of the sale price and to pay the excess amount to the plaintiff. The first relief sought was subsequently given up. The lessor who had in the meanwhile entered into an agreement of sale in favour of Patel Singhvi 
 various grounds. The City Civil Court dismissed the suit on July 16, 1965, but on appeal by the plaintiff, the judgment of the Trial Court was reversed and it was decreed that the suit land should be sold by public auction, or by private treaty if the parties so agreed, in one lot or by consent of the parties in several lots within six months from the date of the decree. Out of the sale price fetched the defendant was first to reimburse herself to the extent of the balance of the original purchase price of Rs. 96,833-10-0 with interest at 9 per cent from January 23, 1953 and thereafter the remaining amount was to be equally divided between the plaintiff and the defendant. If the price fetched at the sale was less than Rs. 96,833-10-0, the defendant was to recover the deficit from the plaintiff. The decree in these terms was so granted by the High Court as it was thought that both parties had committed default and that the decree if granted in those terms would meet the end of justice. On the basis of the English equitable doctrine of 'conversion' which they held applied in India also, the High Court took the view that the deed dated February 25, 1946 had created an equitable interest in the land in favour of the plaintiff. The High Court also expressed the view that neither the provisions of the Bombay Tenancy Agricultural Lands Act nor the scheme made under the provisions of the Bombay Town Planning Act stood in the way of the plaintiff.
 The defendant preferred an appeal to the Supreme Court by special leave.
 Dismissing the appeal with modifications in the decree the Court, ^ 
 HELD : 1. The English doctrine of conversion of reality into personality cannot be bodily lifted from its native English soil and transplanted in statute-bound Indian Law.
 Many of the principles of English Equity have taken statutory form in India and have been incorporated in occasional provisions of various Indian Statutes such as the Indian Trusts Act, the specific Relief Act, Transfer of Property Act etc., and where a question of interpretation of such Equity based statutory provisions arise, the Court will be well justified in seeking aid from the Equity source.
 [770 H, 771 A-B] The concept and creation of quality of ownership, legal and equitable, on the execution of an agreement to convey immovable property, as understood in England is alien to Indian law which recognises one owner, i.e., the legal owner. [771 B-C] 764 The ultimate paragraph of Section 54 of Transfer of Property Act expressly enunciates that a contract for the sale of immovable property does not, of itself create any interest in or charge on such property. But the ultimate and penultimate paragraphs of s. 40 of the Transfer of Property Act make it clear that such a contract creates an obligation annexed to the ownership of immovable property, not amounting to an interest in the property, but which obligation may be enforced against a transferee with notice of the contract or a gratuitous transferee of the property.
 Thus the Equitable ownership in property recognised by Equity in England in translated into Indian law as an obligation annexed to the ownership of property, not amounting to an interest in the property, but an obligation which may be enforced against a transferee with notice or a gratuitous transferee. [771 C-E] The Indian Trust Act defines 'trust' and 'beneficial interest' and section 94 finally lays down "In any case not coming within the scope of any of the preceding sections, where there is no trust; but the person having possession of property has not the whole beneficial interest therein, he must hold the property for the benefit of the persons having such interest or the residue thereof (as the case may be), to the extent necessary to satisfy their just demands".
 Section 12(a) of the Specific Relief Act provides for enforcement of specific performance of contract, in the discretion of the Court, when the act agreed to be done is in the performance wholly or partly of a trust. Section 16 of the Act prescribes part performance of the contract, when that part of a contract which taken by itself can and ought to be specifically performed, stands on a separate and independent footing from another contract.

 2. In the instant case, as seen from the terms of the deed the right of the lessor basically is to get the full sale price of Rs. 1,29,111-8-0 either from the lessee or by selling the property by public auction if the lessee does not himself want to buy, the lessee however, making up any deficit. The lessor is under an obligation to sell the land to the lessee if the latter so desires within a period of seven years and pays the purchase price and, if he does not so desire, to sell the land by public auction and to recoup the balance of the stipulated price. The lessor is under an obligation to pay the excess price, if any, realized by the sale by public auction to the lessee. To sell the property by public auction is thus both a right and an obligation.
 The obligation of the lessee is to pay one fourth of the stipulated price in advance and to pay the balance if he desires to purchase the property or to pay the deficit if any, if the lessor is obliged to sell the property consequent on his failure to purchase. His right is to obtain a sale deed by paying the balance price or to get any excess amount realised at the public auction. Whatever happens, he is not entitled to get a refund of the advance of one fourth of the purchase price paid by him, and whatever happens, the lessor is bound to sell the property either to the lessee or by publication. [772 E-H, 773 A] The obligation of the lessor to sell the land by public auction and pay the excess price to the lessee is an obligation annexed to the ownership of the property, not amounting to an interest in the property, it is an obligation in the nature of a trust, and, therefore, an obligation which may be specifically enforced. [773 A-B] 765 
 3. The contention that the plaintiff could be compensated in terms of money and therefore the contract should not be specifically enforced does not appear from the terms of the contract. It is clear from the very nature and the terms of the contract and the facts and circumstances of the case that compensation or damages is not determinable.
 In fact the defendant, apart from not raising an appropriate plea, did not offer any evidence to prove what would be suitable compensation. [773 C-D] 
 4. The defendant did not commit any default in not paying the balance of the purchase price and taking a sale deed in his own favour. The defendant had the option to purchase the property if he so desired, but he was under no obligation to do so. [773 D-E] 
 5. It is true that the defendant claimed the benefits given to a tenant under the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act and resisted giving possession to the plaintiff.
 If under a bonafide mistaken belief that the statute had stepped in to give him higher rights than under the contract the defendant refused to deliver possession to the plaintiff until it was found by the Court that he had no such higher rights the defendant cannot later be denied even the rights under the contract on the ground that he had claimed higher statutory rights. A person claiming the benefits of a beneficent social legislation should not be denied his contractual rights, if he is found not to be entitled to the legislative benefits. [773 F-H] 
 6. Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act offered no impediment to the respondent-plaintiff's seeking to enforce the contract. The respondent/plaintiff became entitled to demand that the property should be sold by public auction only when the appellant/defendant obtained possession. On the date when the appellant defendant obtained possession of the property the Act was not applicable to the lands.
 Similarly the Gujarat Vacant Lands in Urban Areas (Prohibition of Alienations) Act, 1972, was in force for a limited period of one year only. While it prohibited alienation of land during that period it did not render the contract, which was earlier in point of time incapable of being performed after the Act itself expired. [773 H, 774 A- C] 
 7. It is true that Section 5(3) of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act 1976 prohibits every person holding vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit before the commencement of the Act from transferring such land or part thereof by way of sale, mortgage, gift, lease or otherwise until he has furnished a statement as prescribed by the Act and a notification has been published after the prescribed procedure has been gone through. The Act came into force subsequent to the passing of the decree by the High Court. While it is true that events and changes in the law occurring during the pendency of an appeal require to be taken into consideration in order to do complete justice between parties and so that a futile decree may not be passed. It is also right and necessary that the decree should be so moulded as to accord with the changed statutory situation. The right obtained by a party under a decree cannot be allowed to be defeated by delay in the disposal of the appeal against the decree, if it is possible to save the decree by moulding it to conform to the statutes subsequently coming into force.
