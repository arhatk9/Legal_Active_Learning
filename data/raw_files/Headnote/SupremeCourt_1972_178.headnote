 Rule 49 of the Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act, 1954, framed in exercise of the powers conferred by S.40 of the Act, provided that displaced person having verified claim in respect of agricultural land- had to be, as far as possible, paid compensation by allotment of agricultural land. By amendment No. XXXIX dated February 1960, the Central Government added an Explanation to rule 49 which stated that the expression 'agricultural land' meant agricultural land situated in a rural area. The Explanation was to be deemed always to have been inserted. on the question whether the Central Government ,had the power to give retrospective effect to the Explanation.
 
HELD : The Central Government acted in excess of its power in so far as it gave retrospective effect to the Explanation to rule 49.
 There is no provision in S.40 which, either expressly or by necessary implication, show that the Central Government had been vested with power to make rules with retrospective effect. The extent and amplitude of the rule making power would depend upon and be governed by the language of the section. An authority vested with the power of making subordinate legislation has to act within the limits of its power and cannot transgress the same. [900D] Cannapore Spinning and Weaving Mills Ltd. v.

 Ponnoose and Others etc. [1969] 2 S.C.C. 352, referred to.
 The fact that the rules framed tinder the Act have to be laid before each House of Parliament would not confer validity on a rule if it is made not in conformity with S.40 of the Act. The act of the Central Government in laying the rules before Parliament would not prevent the Courts from scrutinizing the validity of the rules and holding them to be ultra vires.
