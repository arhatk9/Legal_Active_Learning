 The respondents executed a simple mortgage for a sum of Rs. 12,000 in 1914. 'Later.. they sold half of the mortgaged property to the appellants. Out of the consideration a sum required to pay the amount (principal and interest) due to the mortgagees, was left with the appellants. The appellants took possession of the property conveyed, but did not make any payment to the mortgagees.
 The mortgagees brought a suit for the recovery of the amount due to them and in 1937, a final decree was passed against the respondents. The respondents then applied under the U.P. Encumbered Estates Act, and the liability was apportioned between the appellants and respondents. In 1943, the Collector took proceedings under that Act for-the liquidation of the debt and directed the respondents to execute a self-liquidating mortgage of three-fourths of their half-share for a sum of about Rs. 20,8000. The mortgage was executed on 25th February 1943. As a result, the respondents had to deliver possession of the three- fourths share of their property to the mortgagees. On 30th July 1943, they filed a suit for the recovery of about Rs.
 18000 and interest, representing the loss they sustained owing to the failure of the appellants to discharge the original mortgage of 1914.
 On the question whether the suit was time-barred, 
HELD : When a conveyance contains a covenant by a purchaser to pay off an encumbrance on the property sold it is nothing more than an implied contract of indeminity. In such a case, in addition to the right to bring an action to have himself put in a position to meet the liability which the purchaser has failed to discharge, the vendor has also a right to bring a suit on the contract of indemnity if, as a result of the purchaser's failure, the vendor incurs a loss.
 Under Art. 83 of the Limitation Act, 1908 which applies both to express and implied contracts of indemnity, the cause of actio n arises when the vendor was actually damnified.
 Therefore, in the present case, as the sale deed in favour of the appellants was a registered document, the respondents had six years under Art. 83 read with Art. 116, for bringing the suit., from 25th February, 1943, when they were actually damnified, and so the suit was within time. The mere fact that a mortgage decree was passed against the respondents in 1937 was not sufficient to start limitation against them as time starts running only when there is actual damnification.
