 During the accounting period 1962-63, the assessee paid Wealth Tax of Rs. 21,963/- in respect of the shares held by him and deducted this amount from his dividend income and interest as an expenditure allowable under S. 57(iii) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The I.T.O. rejected the claim on the ground that there was no connection between the payment of Wealth Tax and the earning of dividend income and both the Appellate Assistant Commissioner as well as the Tribunal confirmed the order of the I.T.O. The High Court, on a reference, also rejected the contention of the assesses.
 The appellant contended that the preservation of assets is incidental for earning income and that the assets themselves produce income. Therefore, payment of Wealth Tax was virtually a condition for earning income and default in payment of such tax will endanger the ownership of the asset and will gradually destroy the very Source of income.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD :(i) The Income Tax (Amendment) Ordinance of July 15, 1972 and the Income-Tax (Amendment) Act of 1972 have provided for disallowing the Wealth Tax paid as an expenditure in respect of incomes derived from other sources.
 (ii) Even apart from the amendment disallowing the deduction, the very nature of the income from dividends in respect of which deduction Wealth Tax is claimed does not, bear any relationship direct or incidental to the earning of that income and cannot be laid out or expended exclusively for the purpose of making or earning such income within the meaning of Sub-clause (iii) of S. 57 of the Act, or under the corresponding provisions of S. 10(2)(xv) of the Indian Income Tax Act 1922.

 The assessee therefore cannot treat the Wealth Tax Paid as an expenditure allowable under S. 57(iii) of the Income Tax Act 1961.
