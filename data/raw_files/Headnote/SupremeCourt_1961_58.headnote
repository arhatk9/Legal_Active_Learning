 In 1945 the Ruler of Panna granted a " Lambardari lease in certain villages to the appellant. By a notification dated January 1, 1954, issued under the Vindhya Pradesh Abolition of Jagirs and Land Reforms Act, 1952, the respondent resumed the appellant's right. The appellant contended that she was not a jagirdar within the meaning of the Act and the notification was without the authority of law. The respondent contended that the appellant was an " Ijaredar " and fell within the inclusive part of the definition of " jagirdar " in s. 2(1)(c).
 Held, that the appellant was not a jagirdar and her right under the Lambardari lease could not be resumed under the Abolition Act. In the context in which the word " Ijaredar " was used in S. 2(1)(C) it meant a person holding an Ijara which was a lease or farm of land revenue or other proprietary right as distinguished from other kinds of leases. The Lambardari lease granted to the appellant was not a mere-farm of land revenue but it conferred rights in the land itself. It was not a mere Ijara, the appellant was not a mere " Ijaredar " and was not covered by the definition of jagirdar in S. 2(1)(C).
