 D, a workman in the appellant company, was served with a notice on October 23, 1959, in which it was alleged that a number of articles had been spoiled due to his faults, and he was asked to show cause why the company should not take disciplinary action against him. In the enquiry held against him nobody except himself was examined to prove the charge. He was confronted with the reports of the superior and other persons made behind his back and simply asked why these persons would be making the reports against him falsely. On November 11, 1959, an order was made by the management dismissing him from the service of the company "for causing wilful insubordination or disobedience whether alone or in combination with another or others, for any orders of the superior of the management". The Industrial Tribunal, to which the dispute was referred, was of the view that the rules of natural justice had not been followed by the domestic tribunal ; and after examining the evidence adduced before it the Tribunal came to the conclusion that there was no sufficient material to hold that D was guilty of insubordination or disobedience for which the dismissal order purported to have been made, or in respect of the alleged damage done to the company's property. The Tribunal accordingly set aside the order of the dismissal and directed D's reinstatement. The appellant challenged the validity of the order of the Tribunal on the ground, inter alia, that it was not open to the Tribunal to go behind the finding arrived at by the domestic tribunal.
 Held that if an industrial employee's services are ter- minated after a proper domestic enquiry held in accordance with the rules of natural justice and the conclusions reached as 617 the enquiry arc not perverse, the industrial Tribunal is not entitled to consider the propriety or the correctness of the said conclusions, But, where, as in the present case, there was no proper enquiry, the Tribunal was justified in ignoring the findings of the domestic tribunal.
 An enquiry cannot be said to have been properly held unless (i) the employee proceeded against has been informed clearly of the charges leveled against him, (ii) the witnesses are examined-ordinarily in the presence of the cmployee-in respect of the charges, (iii) the employee is given a fair opportunity to cross-examine witnesses, (iv) he is given a fair opportunity to examine witnesses including himself in his defence if he so wishes on any relevant matter, and (v) the enquiry officer records his findings with reasons for the same in his report.
 Two of the workmen in the service of the appellant company had been appointed on March 10, 1959, but their services were terminated on January 15, 1960. A workman who had been in continuous service for not less than one year under an employer was entitled to certain benefits under s. 25F of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, and under s. 25B a workman who during a period of twelve calendar months had actually worked in an industry for not less than 240 days shall be deemed to have completed one year of completed service in the industry. It was found that the two workman had during the period of employment for less than II calendar months worked for more than 240 days.
 Held that the two workmen were not entitled to the benefits of s. 25F of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.
 Before a workman can be considered to have completed one year of continuous service in any industry it must be shown first that he was employed for a period of not less than 12 calendar months and, next that during those 12 calendar months he had worked for not less than 240 days. The requirements of s. 25B would not be satisfied by the mere fact of the number of working days being not less than 240 days.
