 The object of the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1952, is to provide for the regulation of certain matters relating to forward contracts, the prohibition of options in goods and for matters connected therewith. Section 6 of the Act provides that the Central Government may, if it is satisfied that it would be in the interest of trade and also in public interest to recognition to an association, grant recognition in such form and with such condition as may be specified and shall specify the goods with respect to which forward contracts may be entered into between the members of such association or through or with any such member.
 Section 14A(1), inserted by Amending Act 62 of 1960, provides that no association concerned with the regulation and control of business relating to forward contracts shall, after the commencement of the 1960 Act, carry on such business except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration granted- by the Commission, and s. 14B provides that on receipt of an application tinder s. 14A, the Commission may, after making such enquiry as it cons(lies necessary grant or refuse the certificate. Sections 15 to 18 of the Act. authorise the Central Government to impose restrictions as to commodities with respect to which business in forward contracts can be carried on. Rule 7A of the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1954, framed under the Act, pro%Tides that the certificate of registration granted to an association shall be in Form F, which states that the registration is granted subject to the conditions (i) that the association shall comply with such directions as may from time to time be given by the Forward Markets Commission, and (ii) that the association shall not conduct forward trading in any commodity other than those specified hereunder except with the previous approval of the Forward Markets Commission.
 The respondent was granted a certificate of registration under s. 14B with the second condition that it shall not commence trading in non-transferable specific delivery contracts in any commodity without obtaining the prior approval of the Commission. A direction to the same effect was also given by the Commission to the respondent in a letter.
 The respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court for quashing the condition and direction, and the High Court quashed them on the grounds : (1) While s. 6 gives power to the Central Government to specify goods in respect of which forward contracts may be entered into by the members of the recognised association, s. 14A is silent in regard to this matter implying that the Commission has no such power; (2) the conditions which the Commission could attach to the certificate of registration are only those which relate to the manner and method of carrying on the business of forward contracts, and the second condition imposed in the instant case did not relate to the manner or method of carrying on the business-, and (3) no power to impose such a condition could be implied as that would be repugnant to the power of Government to control, regulate or prohibit forward trade in respect of any commodities, vested in the Central Government under ss. 15 to 18.
 2 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD: Rule 7A is intra vires the rule-making power and it was open to the Commission to impose the second condition in the certificate of registration. The condition and direction are therefore valid. [8-D] (1) (a) The areas covered by s. 6 and s. 14A are different.
 The fact that an association is recognised by the Government would not enable it to carry on the business in forward contracts. For that purpose, a certificate under s. 14A is a sine qua non. The fact that Central Government has power to attach conditions as regards commodities in respect of which the business of forward contracts can be carried on is not in any way incompatible with the power of the Commission to impose conditions as respects the commodities in which the business can be conducted. The conditions in the market dealing with forward contracts do not remain static, and unless the Commission is invested with power to impose further conditions the object of constituting the Commission would be frustrated. The assumption by the High Court that when once conditions as to commodities have been laid down by the Government at the time of recognition, the power of the Commission to attach further conditions as to commodities in which transactions in forward contracts can be carried on would be repugnant to the power of the Government, fails to take note of changing conditions in the market. [6E-H] (b)Under s. 4(f) of the Act, the Commission has to perform such other duties and exercise such other powers as may be assigned to the Commission by or under the Act, or as may be prescribed. In interpreting the expression 'by or under the Act or as may be prescribed,' that is. where the court is concerned with the question whether it is legally competent for the Government to vest a particular power in a statutory body like the Commission, the proper rule of interpretation would be that unless the nature of the power is Stitch as is incompatible with the purpose for which the body is created, or unless the particular power is contra-indicated by any specific provision of the enactment bringing the body into existence, any 'power which would further the provisions of the Act could be legally conferred on it. In the instant case, r. 7A prescribes the conditions under which a certificate of registration can be issued and that authorises the incorporation of the second condition in certificate. [7A-C] I. P. Gupta v. W. R. Natu, [1962] INSC 136; A.I.R. 1963 S.C. 274, followed.
 (2) The power of the Commission under ss. 14A and 14B is plenary as-, regards the nature of the conditions which it can attach for regulating and controlling the business of forward contracts of a particular Association. A limitation that s. 14A only authorises conditions as to manner in which the business in forward contracts can be carried on, cannot be read into the section or from other provisions of the Act. The specification of commodities in respect of which business can be carried on is a condition concerned with the regulation and control of the business relating to forward contracts. [7D-F] (3)(a) The restrictions or prohibitions in ss. 15 to 18 are general and apply to all persons. They are not concerned with restrictions or prohibitions as regards commodities in respect of which business in forward contracts can be carried on by a particular association or its members. The Commission alone is invested with power to impose conditions, or prohibitions with regard to such commodities.
 Therefore, ss. 15 to 18 do not clash with the power of the Commission, and recognition of the power of the Commission will not derogate from the general power of the Government.
 Of course, the Commission, being a subordinate body, should act in conformity with ss. 15 to Is [7G-B] (b)The commodities in which the association can carry on the business of forward contracts is an integral part of its business. The very idea of setting up the Commission was to supervise and regulate such business, by imposing conditions subject to which alone the association can carry on the business. Conditions are nothing but qualifications, restrictions or limitations modifying, 3 or even destroying, to a certain extent. the right to carry on business. Therefore, the specification of commodities in which business can be carried on is condition relating to regulation and control of that business. [8B-C]
