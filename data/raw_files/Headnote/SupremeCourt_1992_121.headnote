 In response to an advertisement calling for applications for appointment of dealer of a fair price shop, the appellant and the respondent No.1 applied along with many others. Appellant, a Commerce graduate had experience in running fair price shop, whereas respondent No.1 has passed 10th class only. On the bsis of a brief interview, responent No. 1 was selected. Appellant moved Respondent No.3, but was not successful. Later, he preferred a Revision Petition before the Collector, who allowed his claim. Re- spondent No.1 challenged the said order before the High Court, which was allowed by a Single Judge and later con- firmed by a Division Bench. Aggrieved against the High Court's order, the appellant has preferred the present appeal.
 On behalf of the appellant, it was contended that there was no guideline indicating the nature of the interview which was the sole basis for making a choice for the settlement of the fair price shops.
 The respondents contended that less educated persons were given preference as they were handicapped by reason of lack of education as compared to better qualified applicants. It was further contended that since a highly educated person may get a better job, he may not be able to run the shop on a permanent basis.
 Allowing the appeal, this Court, 
 HELD : 1. The decision to prefer an uneducated person over an educated person amounts to allowing premium on ignorance, incom- 781 petence and consequently inefficiency. The only fault of the appellant is to have pursued his studies beyond 10th class.
 If he had discontinued his career as a student even earlier, say after passing 7th or 8th class, he would have been running the shop today. This clearly amounts to gross arbi- trariness and, therefore, illegal discrimination. Pursuing this line the State will have to be going in search of a more inefficient and illiterate or semi literate person and nobody knows where this process would end. On the assertion that a better qualified person has got a better chance to succeed in life, an intelligent applicant who can run the shop efficiently should be rejected and a dim witted fellow should be selected would be an absurd situation. [784 C-E] 
 2. That a better qualified person is not likely to stick to the job, is not spelt out by the Government Orders.
 In any event, with a view to ensure that a person not interested in running the business may not obtain the set- tlement of the shop merely on the basis of his qualifica- tions, care may be taken to impose appropriate conditions, by restricting the choice to local inhabitants, and, or requiring furnishing of guarantee for running the business for a minimum number of years. [784 F, G] 
 3. So far the interview fixed as the sole criterion in the present case, the same in the absence of guidelines leaves the matter to the whims of the individual officer holding the interview. The exercise of such unbridled power, will be clearly violative of Article 14. Therefore, the policy adopted by the State Government is unconstitutional.
