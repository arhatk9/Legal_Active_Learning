 For some years until 1952-53, the assessee was assessed as an individual in respect of income from a house that was admittedly Joint Hindu family property and income from a selling agency. He maintained only one set of accounts for income from both these sources. On December 19, 1952, a deed of partition was executed between the assessee and his three minor children who were represented by their mother.
 in the course of assessment proceedings for the year 1953- 54, the assessee claimed that an order under s. 25A be passed and separate assessments made on each of the members of the erstwhile family as from December 19, 1952.
 The Income Tax Officer rejected this claim, holding that merely because the income from ancestral property and self acquired property was not separately accounted for, the latter did not become part and parcel of Joint family property; he further held that there was no partition by virtue of the deed, but simply a direct or indirect transfer made by the assessee of his own self-acquired property within the meaning of s. 16(3) (a) (iv).
 The Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the Appellate Tribunal confirmed the view taken by the Income-tax Officer, but, upon a reference made to it, the High Court held that the deed executed in December 19, 1952, amounted to a valid partition and was not a transfer within the meaning of s.
 16(3) (a) (iv).
 It was contended on behalf of Revenue that the only evidence that all assets and liabilities including the agency business were transferred to the joint Hindu family was a recital in the partition deed itself and there was no antecedent blending of the self-aquried property with ancestral property before it was partitioned among the parties. All the clauses of the deed took effect on the signature of the deed and no amount of time elapsed between the alleged blending and partition.
 
HELD : From the time when instructions were given that the selfacquired property was to be treated as joint family property in the deed to be executed, the property assumed the character of the Joint family property. On execution, the deed became evidence of a pre-existing fact, i.e of throwing a self-acquired property into the hotch-potch. [110 G] The High Court was right in holding that the partition proceeded on the basis that the self-acquired property was made available for partition along with the only item of joint family property. That itself constituted proof that antecedent to the partition, however short the interval, there was blending of the self acquired property of the assessee with his ancestral joint family property. The result was that at least on December 19, 1952, antecedent to the partition, the properties became impressed with 107 the character of joint family property. There was a partition on December 19, 1952. Thereafter, the properties allotted to the shares of the assessee and his divided song were held by them in severalty. [110 H; 111 A.
