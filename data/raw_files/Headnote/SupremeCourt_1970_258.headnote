 At the time of dismissing an appeal by the appellant against the finding by the High Court that the appellant was guilty of a corrupt practice under s. 123(4) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, the Supreme Court directed that S an editor, publisher and printer of a daily newspaper, Mahakoshal which published the offending material relevant to the personal character or conduct of one of the candidates, should be given a notice to show cause why he should not be named under s. 98.
 At the hearing pursuant to the notice issued by the High Court, S admitted that he was the registered printer, publisher and editor of the newspaper in the record of the Press Register at the relevant time and that the offending material was published in the, Mahakoshal; but he claimed that it was so printed without his knowledge, that he had left the entire management of the newspaper with T, and did not himself come to learn about the publication until after the election petition was filed. After hearing further evidence, the High Court accepted the plea set up by S.
 In the appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of two interveners who had undertaken the defence of the appeal that S was liable to be named under s. 98, (i) in view of the provisions of section 7 of the Press and Registration of Books Act, 1867, and the fact that S was the registered printer, publisher and editor of the newspaper; (ii) because in certain proceedings taken in the High Court for committing the editor of the same newspaper for contempt of court for publishing certain scurrilous matter concerning a Civil Judge in 1962, S had admitted his responsibility for the publication and tendered an apology; (iii) because on October 24, 1963, the first respondent had addressed a letter to S inviting his attention to the publication of the offending matter in April May, 1963, which was the subject matter of the election petition, requiring him to disclose the identity of the writer within three days and stating that otherwise S would be assumed to be the author of the publication; S had no reply to the said letter.
 HELD : The order passed by the High Court must be confirmed.
 (i) Section 7 raises a presumption that a person whose name is printed in a copy of the newspaper is the editor of every portion of that issue. However, this presumption may be rebutted by evidence. In a charge under s. 123(4) of the Representation of the People Act, the presumption under s' 7 would come with greater or, less force, according to the circumstances, to the aid of a person claiming that the editor was res- 3-L807Sup.CI/71 258 ponsible for the publication and that the, publication was to the knowledge of the editor. The High Court had accepted the testimony of S and T to the effect that T was in sole management of the newspaper at the relevant time and no reason was shown why this Court should not agree with this conclusion. Granting that there was close association between the appellant and S, and even granting that Mahakoshal was exclusively carrying on propaganda on behalf of the appellant, unless there was evidence to prove the S had either authorised the publication of the offending matter, or had undertaken to be responsible for all the publications made in the Mahakoshal, no inference that the offending publications were made to the knowledge and with the consent of S may be raised. [262 E-G; 264 E] A proceeding for naming a person who is found responsible for publication of offending matter is in the nature of a quasi-criminal proceeding. In an appeal against the order of the High Court holding on appreciation of evidence that a person charged before the High Court is not proved to be guilty of a corrupt practice, this Court does not normally proceed to reappraise the evidence, unless the High Court has misconceived the evidence or the conclusion is perverse or so basically faulty that. interference by this Court is attracted, of the procedure adopted by the Court has resulted in miscarriage of justice or for similar reasons.

 (ii)The position taken by S in the contempt proceedings was not inconsistent with the case set up by him in these proceedings. Although responsibility for publication was accepted by him, he had clearly stated that the publication of news-item from the correspondents were attended to by the sub-editors and that he generally laid down the policy of the newspaper and gave general directions. He admitted his responsibility because he was the Chief Editor and not because he personally had, with knowledge published the article which constituted contempt of Court. [265 D] (iii) If the story of S that he came to know of the offending publications for the first time after the petition was filed is accepted, failure to repudiate the publications after the election petition was filed will not lead to an inference against S that he was responsible for the publications.
