 The appellants workmen of the respondent claimed that for the two years 1964 and 1965 they were entitled to bonus at the maximum rate of 20% of their annual wages while the respondent contended that there was no available surplus and consequently the liability to pay bonus for these two years could not exceed the minimum of 4% of the wages. The management, inter alia, claimed deductions: (1) with respect to interest charged by the London office on advances made by the London office to the respondent-branch during those two years; (2) provision for gratuity and other contingencies;
 and (3) income tax calculated without taking into account the bonus which would be payable to the workmen.
 The Tribunal allowed the claims.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD: (1) (a) The amounts claimed as interest are really payments by the branch of the company to its head office. A payment of interest could be justified only on the basis that the head office was a creditor and the branch office a debtor.,. But a company could not be a creditor and its own debtor simultaneously. The interest paid really represented amounts of money transferred by the respondent-branch to the head office, and similarly, the advances made by London office to the respondent-branch were amounts which continue to be used by the company for its own business at a different place. [544F] (b) This is also made manifest by the proviso to item 1 of the Third Schedule to the Act. In the deduction of the current liabilities any amount shown as payable by a company to its head-office whether towards any advance made by the head-office or otherwise, or any interest paid by the company to its head-office is not to be treated as a deductible liability, because, the advance made by the head office is also treated as a part of the investment by the company. [545D] (c) Under s. 23 of the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965, there is a presumption as to the correctness of the statements and particulars contained in the balance-sheet and the profit and loss account of a company, if the accounts had been properly audited by qualified auditors. The presumption, however, is confined to the accuracy of the statements and particulars contained in the balance sheet and the profit and loss account. If any item in the accounts is wrongly shown as expenditure, when on the face 541 of it is not so, the court is not! bound to hold that. the method adopted 'in preparing the accounts is correct simply because the auditors raised no objection. [544H-545C] Therefore, in the calculation of gross profits for purposes of bonus the sums deducted as interest for the two years must be added back since they were wrongly shown as deductible expenditure in calculating the profit and loss.
 (2) The provision for gratuity, and other contingencies such as furlough salary, passage, service and commission. in the present case, was made in respect of existing and known liabilities, though, in some cases the exact amount could not be ascertained. It was not a case where it was an anticipated loss or anticipated expenditure which would arise in the future. Such provision is, not a reserve at all and it could not be added back under item 2(c) of the Second Schedule to the Act. It was therefore rightly shown by the respondent as a deductible expenditure in calculating profit and loss. [547D] Metal Box Co. v. The Workmen, [1968] INSC 197; [1969] 1 S.C.R. 750, followed.
 (3).The calculation of the amount of income-tax shown as expenditure, without taking into account the bonus which would be payable to the workmen under the Act, was correctly done in accordance with the decision of this Court in the Metal Box Company case.: In that case, the question was determined on the interpretation of ss. 6(c) and 7 of the Act, and the amendments made by the Payment of Bonus (Amendment) Act,, 1969 do not make any change in the law bearing on the question, as laid down by this Court.
