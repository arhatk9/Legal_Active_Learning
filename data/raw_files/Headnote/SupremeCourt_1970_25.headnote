 After investigation of a complaint filed by the Respondent against the Appellant making certain allegations, the Deputy Superintendent of Police who carried out the investigation, submitted a report to the Deputy Inspector- General under whom the investigation was carried on, to the effect that there was, insufficient evidence against the Appellant and furthermore that the Respondent's case against the Appellant was false. On a "protest petition" filed by the Respondent. the Sub-Divisional Magistrate passed an order directing the Police to submit a charge sheet. The High Court rejected an application in revision filed against this order On appeal to this Court, 
 HELD : Allowing the appeal : The provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code do not empower the Magistrate to ask the police to submit a charge-sheet. If, however, the Magistrate is of opinion that the report submitted by the police requires further investigation, the Magistrate may order investigation under section 156(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code Directing a further investigation is entirely different from asking the police to submit a charge-sheet.
 Furthermore, section 190(1)(c) of the Criminal Procedure Code empowers the Magistrate to take cognizance of an offence notwithstanding a contrary opinion of the police.
