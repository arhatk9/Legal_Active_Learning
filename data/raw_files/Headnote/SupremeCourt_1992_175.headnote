 The appellant was appointed as Director, AIIMS, with effect from 18.2.1979 for a period of five years or till he attained the age of 62 years whichever was earlier. With effect from 19.2.1980 he was confirmed in the said post.
 On 24.11.1980 the appellant was prematurely retired from service in public interest by giving him three months pay and allowances, in lieu of notice.
 The appellant challenged the order of the Institute- Body filing a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India before the High Court.
 The respondents contended before the High Court that the appellant was retired under Regulation 30(3) of the All Institute of Medical Sciences Regulations, 1958 in public interest after he attained the age of 55 years; that Fundamental Rule 56(j) was also applicable to the AIIMS employees by virtue of Regulation 35 of the Regulations;
 that even if Regulation 30(3) was not attracted, the Institute had the power to prematurely retire the appellant, in public interest, under Fundamental Rule 56(j) and that despite the fact that the appellant was on a tenure post there was no bar to prematurely retire him by invoking either Regulation 30(3) of Fundamental Rule 56(j).
 The appellant on the other hand contended before the High Court that the post of Director of the AIIMS is a tenure post under the Recruitment Rules of the Institute and he was appointed to the said post by way 568 of direct recruitment; that his tenure could not be cut short by bringing in the concept of superannuation or premature retirement which was alien to a tenure post.
 The High Court dismissed the writ petition, against which the present appeal by special leave was filed before this Court.
 The appellant reiterated the contentions made by him before the High Court, in this appeal.
 On the question, "whether the incumbent of the post of Director, AIIMS could be pematurely retired before the completion of his tenure?" Allowing the appeal of the employee-doctor, this Court, 
 HELD 1.01. `Tenure' means a term during which an office is held. It is a condition of holding the office. Once a person is appointed to a tenure post, his appointment to the said office begins when he joins and it comes to an end on the completion of the tenure unless curtailed on justifiable grounds. Such a person does not superannuate, he only goes out of the office on completion of his tenure.
 The question of prematurely retiring him does not arise.
 [577F] 1.02. Under the Recruitment Rules the post of Director of the AIIMS is a tenure post. The said rules further provide the method of direct recruitment for filling the post. These service-conditions make the post of Director a tenure post and as such the question of superannuating or prematurely retiring the incumbent of the said post does not arise. The age of 62 years provided under proviso to Regulation 30(2) of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences Regulations, 1958 only shows that no employee of the AIIMS can be given extension beyond that age. This has obviously been done for maintaining efficiency in the Institute-Services. [577C] 1.03. Simply because the appointment order of the appellant mentions that "he is appointed for a period of five years or till he attains the age of 62 years", the appointment does not cease to be a tenure-post. Even an outsider (not an existing employee of the AIIMS) can be selected and appointed to the post of Director. Can such person be retired prematurely curtailing his tenure of five years? Obviously not. The appointment of the appellant was on a five years tenure but it could be curtailed in the event of his attaining the age of 62 years before completing the said tenure. The 569 High Court failed to appreciate the simple alphabet of the service jurisprudence. [577D-E] 1.04. Concept of superannuation which is well understood in the service jurisprudence is alien to tenure appointments which have a fixed life span. The appellant could not therefore have been prematurely retired and that too without being put on any notice whatsoever. [577G-H] 1.05 Since the appellant has since attained the age of 62 years, there is no question of reinstating him in the office of the Director of the AIIMS. He shall, however, be entitled to his salary less the non practising allowance, for the period from December 1, 1981 to January 21, 1984.
