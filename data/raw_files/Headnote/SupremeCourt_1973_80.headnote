 The appellant Textile Mill had a statutory obligation, as a factory, under the provisions of Section 46 of Factories Act and the Rules made thereunder for maintaining a canteen for its workers. The appellant entrusted the management of the canteen to a cooperative society. The workers of the canteen demanded additional wages and dearness allowance in terms of certain awards claiming that they were the employee of the appellant within the meaning of Clauses (13) and (14) of Sec. 3 of the Bombay Industrial Disputes Act, 1938 as amended by Gujarat Legislature in 1962. The workers contended that the running of the canteen was an ordinary part of the undertaking of appellants, since it was a statutory obligation for the appellant to do so. The appellant on the other hand contended that the cooperative society was neither the agent nor the contractor of appellant.
 Rejecting the appeal, 
HELD : Under the Factories Act, it was the duty of the appellant to run and maintain canteen for the use of its employees. Under clauses (13) and (14) of Section 3 as amended in 1962, the definition of an employee is extended by a fiction of law and certain employees are recognised as statutory employees. The workers in question fall under the said definition. [972B] Ahmedabad Mfg. & Calico Printing Co. Ltd. and Ors. v. Their Workmen. [1963] INSC 85; [1964] 2 S.C.R. 838, relied upon.
