 The property in suit belonged to what was known as the Tanjore Palace Estate. The appellant became owner of the property in 1936 by virtue of a sale on foot of a mortgage decree obtained by his father in a suit of 1926. The respondent bad been in possession of the property by virtue of a lease deed dated July 30, 1932, and on August 13, 1936, he got a lease of the property for two years from the appellant. Under the Madras Estates Land Act, 1908, as amended by the Third Amendment Act of 1936, occupancy rights vested in a person who was in direct and actual possession of the Land on June 30, 1934. The respondent instituted a suit against the appellant for the grant of a patta in occupancy right on payment of a fair rent. The appellant pleaded that the provisions of the Act were not applicable to the property in suit on the ground, inter alia, that as it was a part of the Tanjore Palace Estate it could not be considered to be an estate within the meaning of the term in the Act. The history of the Tanjore Palace Estate showed that after the Rajah of Tanjore died in 1855, leaving no male heirs, the Government seized all his properties.
 Subsequently, in 1962 the private properties of the Rajah were "relinquished" and "restored" by the Government to the widows of the Rajah. The appellants contention was that the manner in which the properties reverted to the widows of the Rajah in 1862 after an act of State showed that it was not a case of a fresh grant by the Government but a restoration of the status quo ante, so that the widows enjoyed both the warams, as before.
 Held, that the act of State having made no distinction between the private and public properties of the Rajah the private properties were lost by that of State leaving no right outstanding in the existing claimants. The Government order was thus a fresh grant due to the bounty 422 of the Government and not because of any antecedent rights in the grantees.
 The words "relinquished" or "restored" in the Government order did not have the,legal effect of reviving any such right because no rights survived the act of State. The root of title of the grantees was the Government order.
