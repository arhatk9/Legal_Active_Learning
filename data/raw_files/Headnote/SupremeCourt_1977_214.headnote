 The State of Gujarat issued a notification under s. 4 of the Land Acquisition Act on 23-5-1958. The public purpose mentioned was for the construction of houses for co- operative society. An erratum was issued pointing out that the Co-operative Society was of the backward class people.
 Thereafter, notification under s. 6 was issued on 13-8-1960 in which Also it was declared that the land was resumed for the public purpose of providing housing facilities for the backward class people. The respondent filed a suit on 8-2- 1961, challenging the validity of the notification under s.
 4 and 6 and praying for perpetual injunction.
 The City Civil Court dismissed the suit. The High Court, however, allowed the respondent's appeal on the ground that the acquisition was not for a public purpose within the meaning of s. 6 of the Act as the intention declared by the Government to pay the amount of subsidy in respect of the acquisition was, by necessary implication, abandoned.
 Allowing the appeal by certificate, 
HELD : (1) Before the trial court no plea was taken that the appellant abandoned its intention to pay part of the compensation to be awarded for the acquisition. It was therefore not permissible for the High Court to decide the controversy on a plea which was not taken at all and which was not the subject matter of any issue at the trial. In fact the six contentions raised before the High Court also did not include the question of abandonment. The High Court therefore committed an error of law in deciding the appeal on the finding of abandonment of the original intention of the State Government to pay a part of the compensation.
 Even otherwise there was no real basis for the High Court's finding about the abandonment of the intention of the State Government to pay a part of the compensation. [180 B-D] (2)The High Court committed obvious error of law in arriving at its finding an(.] its finding of fact could not be sustained. [180 D] (3)The High Court was wrong in relying on the non- publication of the award because, as early as 1961, the respondent had filed a suit and an order was made by the trial court restraining the appellants from disturbing and obstructing the possession of the respondent. The evidence clearly showed that the State Government had taken a clear decision to pay a part of the compensation for the cost of acquisition. The fact that the- State had preferred the present appeal 'clearly showed that it had not abandoned its intention to make the acquisition on payment of a part of the compensation out of public revenue.
