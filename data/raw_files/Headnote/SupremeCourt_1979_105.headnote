 In the ex parte departmental enquiry conducted against the appellant who was under detention under the Prevention of Violence Act, 1970 the Enquiry officer held the alleged charges proved and on the report of the enquiry officer, the management of the Ist respondent company terminated the services of the appellant and gave one month's wage in lieu of notice. Since an industrial dispute was then pending before the Tribunal, an application was made under section 33(2)(b) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 seeking approval of the Industrial Tribunal to the action of the management terminating the services of the appellant. On a notice issued by the Tribunal to the appellant in the Jail, he submitted his written statement. The Tribunal was of the opinion that the enquiry was conducted in violation of the principles of natural justice and hence vitiated.
 Accordingly by its Award dated 1 5th September 1973, the Tribunal rejected the application for approval of the action terminating service of the appellant made by the Company.
 The Writ Petition preferred by the Company against the said Award was dismissed and the decision of the Tribunal was upheld.
 In the Letters Patent Appeal No. 80/74, preferred by the Company, a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court held that after the Industrial Tribunal adjudicated upon the preliminary issue whether the enquiry was in accordance with the principles of natural justice and having held against the company it was incumbent upon the Industrial Tribunal to give an opportunity to the employer to lead evidence to prove the charges alleged against the workman and as the issue about the validity of the enquiry was not decided as a preliminary issue and as thereafter no opportunity was given to tho employer it would be necessary to remand the matter to the Industrial Tribunal for giving an opportunity to the employer for further evidence, if so advised and then finally dispose of the application made by the employer under section 33(2) (b) of the Industrial Disputes Act.

 Allowing the appeal by special leave, the Court ^ 
 HELD: l. Both on precedent and on principle, it is undeniable that there is no duty cast on the Industrial Tribunal or the Labour Court while adjudicating upon a penal termination of service of a workman either under Section 10 1166 or under Section, 33 to call upon the employer to adduce additional evidence to substantiate the charge of misconduct by giving some specific opportunity after decision on the preliminary issue whether the domestic enquiry was all held, or if held, was defective in favour of the workman. Cooper Engineering Ltd. case is not an authority for the proposition that every ease coming before the Labour Court or Industrial Tribunal under Section 10 or Section 33 of the Act complaining about the punitive termination of service following a domestic enquiry that the Court or Tribunal as a matter of law must frame a preliminary issue and proceed to decide the validity or otherwise of the enquiry and then serve a fresh notice on the employer to adduce further evidence to sustain tho charges if it so chooses to do.
 Cooper Engineering Ltd. ease [1975] INSC 170; [1976] 1 SCR 361 merely specifies the stage at which such an opportunity is to be given, if sought. It is both the right and obligation of the employer, if it so chooses to adduce additional evidence to substantiate the charges of misconduct. It is for the employer to avail of such opportunity by a specific pleading or by a specific request. If such an opportunity is sought in the course of proceeding, the Industrial Tribunal or the Labour Court, as the case may be, should grant the opportunity to lead additional evidence to substantiate the charges. But if no such opportunity is sought nor there is any pleading to that effect no duty is cast on the Labour Court or the Industrial Tribunal suo motu to call upon the employer to adduce additional evidence to substantiate the charges. [1192B-E] In the present case, there was neither a pleading in which any such claim for adducing additional evidence was made, nor any request was made before the Industrial Tribunal till the proceedings were adjourned for making the Award ar d till the Award was made. The case squarely falls within the ratio of Delhi Cloth & General Mills Co., [1972] INSC 11; [1972] 3 SCR 29 which laid to lest the ghost of any obligatory duty cast on a quasi-judicial authority viz. Labour Court or Industrial Tribunal to notify one of the parties to the proceedings before it, what it should do or what are its rights and by what procedure it should prove its case, even when the party is a well entrenched 'employer ably assisted by the best available talent in the legal profession.
 Therefore, the Division Bench of the High Court was clearly in error in granting such a non-sought opportunity at the stage of the Letters Patent Appeal. [1183G-H, 1192F-G] 
 2. Precedents make it clear that a quasi-judicial Tribunal is under no such obligation to acquaint parties appearing before it about their rights more so in an adversary system which these quasi-judicial Tribunals have adopted. Therefore, it is crystal clear that the rights which the employer has in law to adduce additional evidence in a proceeding before the Labour Court or Industrial Tribunal either under Section 10 or Section 33 of the Act questioning the legality of the order terminating the service must be availed of by the employer by making a proper request at the time when it files its statement of claim or written statement or makes an application seeking either permission to take a certain action or seeking approval of the action taken by it. If such a request is made in the statement of claim, application or written statement, the Labour Court or the Industrial Tribunal must give such an opportunity. If the request is made before the proceedings are concluded, the Labour Court or the Industrial Tribunal should ordinarily grant the opportunity to adduce evidence. But if no such request is made at any stage of the proceeding there is no duty in law cast on the Labour Court or the Industrial Tribunal. to give such a l opportunity and if there is no such obligatory duty in law, 1167 failure to give any such opportunity cannot and would not vitiate the proceedings.

 3. The challenge to penar termination of service of a workman by the employer whose undertaking is governed by the Industrial Disputes Act is likely to come before a Labour Court or Industrial Tribunal or National Tribunal for adjudication either by way of a reference under Section 10 or by way of an application by the employer under Section 33 Preceding domestic enquiry is implicit in both the situations. Where a workman is accused of misconduct a domestic enquiry has to be held against him in accordance with the provisions contained in the Standing orders governing the industrial establishment or in the absence of such Standing order in accordance with the principles of natural justice. After such a domestic enquiry is held it would be open to the employer to impose a penalty including one of termination of service howsoever styled. If it the time of imposition of penalty no other industrial dispute between the employer aud its workman as comprehended by s.
 33 is pending before any of the authorities mentioned in that section it would be open to the workman to approach the appropriate Government to refer he industrial dispute arising out of termination of his service to an appropriate authority under the Act. But if at the relevant time a situation obtains such as is comprehended by s. 33, namely, pendency or a conciliation proceeding before a conciliation officer or a board or of any proceeding before an arbitrator or a Labour Court or Tribunal or National Tribunal in respect of an industrial dispute touching the workman of the employer, the employer before his order terminating service of the workman becomes effective has. to seek either prior permission or subsequent approval of the action, as the case may be, under s. 33 [1172D-H] When the dispute comes before the Industrial Tribunal by way of a reference under s. 10 it is the aggrieved workman who has sought adjudication of the industrial dispute arising from the termination of his service. When the matter comes before the appropriate authority under s.
 33 it is the employer who has moved for permission or approval of its intended action.[1173A-B] Where the reference is at the instance of a workman under s. 10 the Tribunal would call upon the workman to file his statement of claim and thereafter the employer would be called upon to file its written statement. Rule 10B of the Industrial Disputes (Central) Rules., 1957 provides that within two weeks of the date of receipt of the order of reference, the party representing workmen and the employer involved in the dispute shall file with the concerned authority a statement of demands relating only to the issues an are included in the order of reference and shall also forward a copy of such statement to each one of the opposite parties involved in tho said dispute. similarly, when the employer seeks permission for taking the intended action or seeks approval of the action taken by it under s. 33 it has to make an 1168 application as provided by rule 60 in either Form J or K as the case may be. Both the forms require that the necessity for and circumstances, in which the proposed action is taken or is intended to be taken must be clearly and specifically set out and either express permission should be sought before taking the intended action or an approval of the already taken action must be sought. [1173B-E] 
 4. The Labour Court or Industrial Tribunal to which either a reference under Section 10 or an application under Section 33 for permission to take an intended action or approval of an action already taken is made, would be exercising quasi-judicial powers, which would imply that 3 certain content of the judicial power of the State is vested in it and it is called upon to exercise it. [1189A-B] Bharat Bank Ltd: v. Employees of Bharat Bank Ltd, [1950] INSC 20; [1950] SCR 459; referred to.
 
 5. A quasi-judicial decision presupposes an existing dispute between two or more parties and involves presentation of their case by the parties to the dispute and if the dispute between them is a question of fact, the ascertainment of the fact by means of evidence adduced by the parties to the dispute and often with the assistance of arguments by or on behalf of the parties on the evidence.
 Parties are arrayed before these quasi judicial Tribunals.
 either upon a reference under s. 10 or s. 33. There is thus a lis between the parties. There would be assertion and denial of facts on either side. With the permission of the Tribunal and consent of the opposite side, parties are entitled to appear through legal practitioners. before these quasi-judicial Tribunals. The system adopted by these Tribunals is an adversary system, a word as understood in contra-distinction to inquisitorial system. The Labour Court or Tribunal has to decide the lis between the parties on the evidence adduced before it. While it may not be hide bound by the rules prescribed in the Evidence Act it is nonetheless a quasi-judicial Tribunal proceeding to adjudicate upon a lis between the parties arrayed before it and must decide the matter on the evidence produced by the parties before it. It would not be open to it to decide the lis on any extraneous consideration. Justice, equity and good conscience will inform its adjudication. Therefore, the Labour Court or the Industrial Tribunal has all the trappings of a Court. [1189B-D, 1190C-E] If such be the duties and functions of the Industrial Tribunal or the Labour Court, any party appearing before it must make claim or demur the claim of the other side and when there is n burden upon it to prove or establish the fact so as to invite a decision in its favour, it has to lead evidence. [1190E-F] Cooper v. Wilson, [1937] 2 K.B. 309; quoted with approval.
 M/s.Dalmia Dadri Cement Ltd. v. Its Workmen, [1970] Labour and Industrial Cases 350; referred to.
 
 6. The quasi-judicial Tribunal is not required to advise the party either about its rights or what it should do or omit to do. Obligation to lead evidence to establish an allegation made by a party is on the party making the allegation. The test would be who would fail if no evidence is led. It must seek an opportunity to lead evidence.
 Allegation which is not pleaded, even if there is evidence in support of it, cannot be examined because the other side has not notice of it and if entertained it would tantamount to granting an unfair 1169 advantage to the first mentioned party. The pleadings before such Tribunals have not to be read strictly, but the pleadings must be such as to give sufficient notice to the other party of the case it is called upon to meet. The rules of fair play demand that where a party weeks establish a contention which if proved would be sufficient to deny relief to the opposite side, such a contention has, to be specifically pleaded and then proved. But if there is no pleading there is no question of proving something which is not pleaded. [1190 FH,1191 AB] This elementary principle does inform industrial adjudication. If an application is made by the employer under Section 33, as it is required to be made in the prescribed form all facts are required to be pleaded. If a relief is asked for in the alternative that has to be pleaded. In an application under s. 33 the employer has to plead that a domestic enquiry has been held and it is legal and valid. In the alternative it must plead that if the Labour Court or Industrial Tribunal comer, to the conclusion that either there was no enquiry or the one held was defective, the employer would adduce evidence to substantiate the charges of misconduct alleged against the workman. Now, if no such pleading in put forth either at the initial stage or during the pendency of the proceedings there arises no question of a sort of advisory role of the Labour Court or the Industrial Tribunal unintended by the Act to advise the employer, a party much better off than the workman, lo inform it about its rights, namely, the right to lead additional evidence and then give an opportunity which never sought. This runs counter to the grain of industrial jurisprudence. Undoubtedly if such a pleading is raised and an opportunity is sought, it is to be given but if there is no such pleading either in the original application or in the statement of claim or written statement or by way of ,an application during the pendency of the proceedings there is no duty cast by law or by the rules of justice, reason and fair play that a quasi judicial Tribunal like the Industrial Tribunal or the Labour Court should adopt an advisory role by informing the employer of its rights, namely, the right to adduce additional evidence to substantiate the charges when it failed to make good the domestic enquiry ,and then to give an opportunity to it to adduce additional evidence.
 This, apart from being unfair to the workman, is against the principles of rules governing the procedure to be adopted by quasi judicial Tribunal, against the grain of adversary system and against the principles governing the decision of a lis between the parties arrayed before a quasi judicial Tribunal.
