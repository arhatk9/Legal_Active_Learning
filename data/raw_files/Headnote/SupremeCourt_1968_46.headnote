 The appellant was appointed to the Secretary of State, Service known as the Indian Police in 1937. On June 29, 1965 while he was working as a Deputy Inspector-General of Police in Bihar, an order was made, by the State Government placing him under suspension pending an enquiry. Later, this order was partially amended by the Central Government which itself passed an order of suspension in view of the pending enquiry. The appellant challenged these orders by a writ petition It was contended by him that he had never become a member of the Indian Police Service which was constituted in August 1947, therefore the All India Service (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1955, did not apply to him and consequently the enquiry directed under rr. 4 and 5 could not be instituted against him under these rules, that in any case in view of r. 55 of the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1930, which applied to him by virtue of Art. 314 of the Constitution, the Bihar Government had no power to order an enquiry against him as it was not the authority entitled to pass an order of dismissal removal or reduction in rank; only the Central Government could have, have ordered the inquiry. It was further contended that if the enquiry itself had been invalidly instituted, the order of suspension automatically became invalid. The High Court dismissed the petition. On appeal to this Court, 
HELD : dismissing the appeal, On the passing of the Indian Independence Act. the appellant ceased to be a member of the service constituted by the Secretary of State but he continued to serve the Government of India and the Province of Bihar, as a result of which certain rights relating to conditions of service and disciplinary matters, which were earlier applicable to him, were preserved. At the time when the Indian Police (Cadre) Rules, 1950, were framed, the appellant was not a member of any regularly constituted service and his position remained the same until, under the Indian Police Service (Recruitment) Rules, 1954, he was included in the Indian Police Service and again became a member of a regularly constituted service; he could be competently included in that service, because on that date he was only holding a cadre post, but was not a member of any other regular service. Consequently, the contention that the Rules of 1955 did not apply to the appellant must be rejected, because, when those Rules cam.-- into force, the appellant was already a member of the Indian Police Service. [229 H230 D] Those persons, who were appointed to the Indian Police under the Crown before Independence, ceased to be members of any regularly con- 225 stituted Service when the Indian Independence Act came into force in 1947. Under the agreement that was entered into by the new Indian Government with the British Government, provision was made that members of the previous Secretary of State's Service could continue to serve the Government of India on a provincial Government and certain rights were preserved to them if they continued to do so. There was, however, no provision that the old Secretary of State's Service would continue, so 'hat with the passing of the Indian Independence Act, Secretary of State's Police ceased to exist.

 541, R. P. Kapur v. Union of India & Anr. [1964] S.C.R. 431, referred to. Under Art. 314 of the Constitution, the right that continued to enure to the benefit of the appellant was that the enquiry to be held in his conduct must comply with the requirements of r.
 55 of the Rules of 1930. An enquiry ordered under the Rules of 1955 is in no way detrimental to the interest of the person against whom the enquiry is held as compared with an enquiry under r. 55 of the Rules, of 1930. Under both sets of Rules, the enquiry could be ordered by the authority under whom the person concerned happened to be serving, so that the order made by the Bihar Government for enquiry did not in any way violate the rights which the appellant possessed under r. 55 of the Rules of 1930 and which were preserved to him by Art. 314 of the Constitution, The preliminary enquiry under r. 55 of the Rules of 1930 was not required to be initiated or to be held by the Secretary of State in the case of a member of an All India Service, and it was only at the subsequent stage when the order of dis- missal had to be passed that the Secretary of State was required to give an opportunity of showing cause to the officer concerned under s. 240(3) of the Government of India Act. The language used in r. 55 shows that that rule is only concerned with the holding of an enquiry and lays down the procedure for the enquiry. It does not at all deal with the question of passing an actual order of dismissal, removal or reduction. It is clear that that rule was confined to making provision for an enquiry where after, if an order of dismissal had to be made, the appropriate authority under s. 240(2) of the Government of India Act, 1935 had to take up the proceedings and pass the final order. The expression "authority concerned" in r. 55 in these circumstances, must clearly be interpreted as referring to the authority under which the officer concerned happens to be serving at the relevant time.
