 In 1955, a large amount was due to a corporation from a firm which was then its sole selling agent., As a result of an agreement between the. appellant, the corporation, and the firm, the appellant undertook to discharge the liability of the firm in consideration of its being appointed the sole selling agent in place of the firm. In 1956, an indenture was executed by the corporation and the appellant relating to the appointment of the appellant as sole selling agent, and in this indenture, it was agreed that the corporation should be authorised to retain an amount equal to 1/7 ,of the trade discount due to the. sole selling agents with a minimum of Rs. 50,000 a year, for discharging the liability, so that, the amount payable to the sole selling agents would be the amount payable as trade discount minus the aforesaid amount retained by the corporation. Clause 13 of the indenture provided that, the selling agents shall have no claim whatsoever to any such amounts retained out of the normal trade discount and adjusted in the account of the firm as 'if the amount so retained was not payable to "hem.
 For the assessment year 1956-57, out of the commission payable to the appellant as selling agents the corporation retained a sum under the contract for adjustment against the outstanding dues of the firm. The appellant, in its statement of account, credited the full an-.,-)Lint of commission to its profit and loss account, and the sum retained by the corporation was shown as a deduction therefrom. The Department, the Appellate Tribunal and the High Court on reference, disallowed the deduction on the ground that it was a capital expenditure and not a revenue expenditure and held that the amount was liable to tax.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court.
 
HELD : (1) The answer to the question whether the money paid was a revenue expenditure or capital expenditure does not depend upon whether the amount paid is large or small or whether it was paid in a lumpsum or by instalments. It depends upon the purpose for which the payment had been made and the expenditure incurred. If the object of making the payment is to acquire a capital asset the payment would partake of the character of a capital payment even though it is not made in a lumpsum but by instalments over a period of time. If any such asset or advantage for the enduring benefit of the business 'is thus acquired or brought into existence it would be immaterial whether the source of the payment was capital or the income of the concern or whether the payment was made once for all or was made periodically.
 On the contrary, payment made in the course of and for the purpose of carrying on business or trading activity would be revenue expenditure even though the payment is of a large amount and was not to be made periodically. The aim and.
 object 20-L172SupCI/73 1078 of the expenditure would determine the character of the expenditure whether it is a capital expenditure or a revenue expenditure. The source or the manner of the payment would then be of no consequence. [1082 C-H] Assam Bengal Cement Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax, West Bengal [1955] 27 I.T.R. (34 on p. 45) and P. B. Divecha (Deceased) and After Him His Legal Representatives and Another v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Bombay City 1 [1963] 48 I.T.R. 222, followed., (2) In the present case, the appellant got the sole selling agency in consideration of its agreeing to pay the amount which was then due from the firm to the corporation. If the appellant paid the amount in a lump sum in consideration of its being appointed the sole selling agent the payment would have constituted capital expenditure as it was an amount paid for acquiring or bringing into existence an asset or advantage for the enduring benefit of the business. The fact that the amount was paid not in a lump sum but was paid in instalments through deductions out of the commission due to the appellant would not make any difference. [1082A-C] (3) Even if under cl. 13 of the indenture the appellant could not make any claim to the amount which had been retained by the corporation it would make no material difference so far as the true nature of that amount was concerned. The amount was deducted by the corporation 'in pursuance of the agreement entered into by the appellant with the corporation and the firm, according to which, the appellant had to pay that amount in the form of deductions out of its commission in consideration of being appointed the sole selling agent. It was not a case of the appli- cation of income to discharge a liability incurred in the course of running the business but a liability undertaken for the purpose of acquiring the sole selling agency right which was an asset of a capital nature.
