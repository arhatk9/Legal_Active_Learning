 The Assistant Superintendent of Commercial Taxes paid a surprise visit to the shop of the appellant where he found two sers of account books. He took them up and started looking into them. The appellant snatched away both the books. An attempt by the orderly peon of the Assistant Superintendent to recover the books was foiled by the appellant. The appellant was tried and convicted for an offence under s. 353 of the Penal Code for using criminal force to deter a public servant from discharging his duty.
 Held, that the appellant was properly convicted under s. 353 Penal Code. The snatching of the books amounted to use of force; the snatching necessarily caused a jerk to the hands of the officer which caused motion to his hands within the meaning of s. 349 of the Penal Code. The Officer was entitled under the Bihar Sales Tax Act, and the Rules to pay a surprise visit to the shop of the appellant without giving him any notice and the appellant was bound to show him his account books. The officer was lawfully in possession of the account books and the appellant had no justification to snatch them away. The officer was naturally annoyed at this and accordingly the act of the appellant amounted to use of criminal force.
 A seizure of the books under s. 17 of the Sales Tax Act would be valid only if the reasons for the seizure were recorded by the officer. But the present case was not one of seizure. Merely holding books found lying in a shop for perusing them does not amount to their seizure.

 distinguished.
 420 The act of the appellant amounted to an offence under s. 26 (1) (h) of the Sales Tax Act also and for his prosecution under that section sanction of the Commissioner would have been necessary. His act was an offence both under that section and under s. 353 of the Code. He could be prosecuted for either or both these offences. The offence under s. 353 of the Penal Code was a graver offence than the one under s. 26 (1) (h) and in choosing to prosecute the appellant under s. 353 the prosecution could not be charged with acting colourably to obviate the necessity of obtaining the sanction.
