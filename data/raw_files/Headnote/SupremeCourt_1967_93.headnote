 By an assignment deed, the assignors, tenant of a premises in Bimbay, carrying on shoe business therein, assigned to the petitioners the whole of the business, as a going concern together with the tenancy and occupancy rights of the premises. It was, also, recited that no consideration was paid for the transfer of the tenancy rights, but they were transferred as incidental to the sale of the business as a going concern. The petitioners, thereafter, carried on in the premises their business as importer-, of foreign liquor, provisions, and medicines. The premises were requisitioned under s. 6(4)(a) of the Bombay Land Requisition Act far a public purpose alleging that it was a case of suppressed vacancy. The Petitioners filed a writ petition in this Court challenging the requisition on the grounds that (i) the assignment was permitted under cl. (2) of it notification issued by the Government under the proviso to s. 15(1) of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, and it proper construction of the relevant provisions in the Requisition Act, which were to be read harmoniously with the provisions of the Rent Act, would make it clear that there was no question of any vacancy having arisen, in this case, so as to give jurisdiction to the respondents to requisition the premises and (ii) the provisions of the Requisition Act were unconstitutional as infringing the petitioner's 'rights under Arts. 19(1)(f) and (g) of the Constitution.
 HELD : The petition must be dismissed.
 (i) Section 6 of the Requisition Act gives power to the State Government to requisition vacant premises and,, it is, in that context, that Explanation (a) to this section, has to be understood. Under the Explanation, there will be deemed to be a vacancy if a tenant assigns or transfers. in any manner, his interest in the premises. Section 15 of the Rent Act, can not be read into any part of the Requisition Act, much less with s. 6 of the latter Act. Under s. 6 of the Requisition Act, notwithstanding the fact that an assignment of tenancy rights may have been made, which is permissible under the Rent Act, such an assignment can be deemed to create a vacancy of the premises, -so as to give jurisdiction to the State Government to requisition the same. There is no question of the Legislature, having given something to the petitioner, under the Rent Act, by permitting an assignment. under s.
 15, and taking it away by Requisitioning the premises, under s. 6 of the Requisition Act. [479A-D] The Rent Act was created for the purpose of amending and consolidating the law relating to the control of rent, and repairs of certain premises, of rates of hotels and lodging houses and of evictions. The fact 467 that the assignment claimed by the petitioner may come under cl. (2) of the Notification, will only enable the petitioner to be in occupation of the Premises under the Rent Act and the assignment of tenancy rights in his favour will not become illegal or unlawful, as it otherwise would, under s.
 15(1) of the Rent Act. The Requisition Act was passed to provide for the requisition of land, for the continuance of requisiton of land and certain other purposes. The various provisions, in this-Act, relate to the circumstance under which requisition of land can be made, for a public purpose, and the procedure to be adopted for the same, as well as the payment of coin compensation, and deals with a matter, so totally different from that dealt With by the Rent Act. The two Acts cannot be considered to be in pari maieria. [478C- H] (ii) The Requisition Act, does not deal with trade, or business, as such, and hence, the constitutionality of that Act. having regard to Art. 19(1) (g), does not arise for consideration. The assignment, claimed by the petitioners, must be regarded only as a colourable device, for really obtaining a transfer of tenancy rights, which is otherwise prohibited by s. 15(1) of the Rent Act. The transaction, in question. is not saved by clause 2 of the Notification. As the petitioners cannot claim any rights, on the basis of the assignment deed, either in respect of tenancy rights, or to carry on any business there, it follows that they cannot complain that any fundamental rights, under Art. 19(1) (f) or (s), of the Constitution, have been infringed.
