 Where a notification under s. 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 is invalid, the Government may treat it as ineffective and issue in its place a fresh notification under s. 6.
 Nothing in s. 48 of the Act precludes the Government from doing so. The cancellation of the earlier notification is only a recognition of the invalidity of that notification.
