 In a petition under Article 227 filed by the respondent, the High Court quashed an order of the Labour Court. The appellant then filed before the High Court a petition praying for the issue of a certificate under Art. 132(1) and Art. 133 of the Constitution for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. The petition was returned to the appellant with the intimation that it should be presented at Chandigarh and not at Delhi. The appellant thereafter did not proceed with that petition but applied for and was granted ex-parte special leave to appeal under Article 136.
 It was contended on behalf of the respondent that the special leave granted to the appellant was liable to be revoked and it was obtained without complying with the provision of Order 13 r. 2 of the Supreme Court Rules, whereby when an appeal lies to the Supreme Court on a certificate issued by a High Court or other tribunal, no application to the Supreme Court for special leave ran be entertained unless the High Court or the tribunal concerned has first been moved and it has refused to grant the certificate; and furthermore special leave had been obtained without applying for exemption from moving the High Court for a certificate.
 
HELD : In view of the provisions of Order 13 r. 2 which is a mandatory rule, no application for special leave to appeal in this case could be entertained unless the High Court had first been moved and refused to grant the certificate.
 Under Order 45 r. 1 of the Supreme Court Rules, this Court could, for sufficient reasons shown, excuse the applicant from compliance with the requirements of Order 13 r. 2; but no such application for exemption had been made. The special leave to appeal obtained in contravention of Order 13 r. 2 was therefore liable to be revoked. [267 G, H; 268 Al Union of India v.
