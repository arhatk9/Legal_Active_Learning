 The Delhi Administration issued a notification under s. 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, stating that certain land was needed for a public purpose. The appellant-Society filed an objection under s. 5A that a part of the land belonged to a religious trust. The Land Acquisition Collector then called for a report, but later, without any consciousness of his having done so, submitted his report to the Delhi Administration stating that the appellant had raised an objection and the decision may be taken after inspection of the site. The Delhi Administration did not give any hearing to the appellant but issued the declaration under s. 6 including the land with respect to which the appellant filed objection.
 The appellant challenged the s. 6-notification and a Single Judge of the High Court quashed it. On appeal, the Divisional Bench came to the conclusion that the appellant should have been given an opportunity of being heard and directing the Delhi Administration to give an opportunity of being heard to the appellants adjourned the disposal of the appeal.
 The first respondent thereafter heard the appellant and rejected its objection. The Divisional Bench then took up the appeal and dismissed the writ petition holding that it was not necessary that the Land Acquisition Collector should have heard the appellant under s. 5A.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, and quashing the declaration under s. 6, 
HELD : (1) The power to hear the objection under S. 5A is that of the Collector and not of the appropriate Government;
 and the duty of affording such opportunity of being heard by the Collector under the section is mandatory. Therefore, a decision by the Government on the objection, when the Collector afforded no opportunity of being heard, to the objector, would not be proper.[599D-E] (2)Merely because the Government may not accept the Collector's recommendation, it could not be said that he need not make his recommendation and leave it to the Government to decide the matter. The fact that the Collector is not the authority to decide on the objection does not exonerate him from his duty to hear the objector and make his recommendation. [599E-F] (3)The Divisional Bench of the High Court was wrong in holding that the objection was only a question of law and that therefore the Collector could decline to make his report and leave it to the appropriate government to decide the question. The objection raised is a mixed question of law and fact and the Land Acquisition Collector should have inquired into it and his failure to do so would show that he declined to exercise his jurisdiction under the section.
 When a procedure is prescribed by the legislature, it is not for the Court to substitute a different one according to its notions of justice. [600C-E]
