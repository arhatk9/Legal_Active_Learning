 The husband of the appellant-late Rajendra Kumar had earlier to the marriage with her, contracted a marriage with one Sarla Gupta. Both Rajendra Kumar and Sarla Gupta, filed suits against each other praying for a decree of divorce, which were decreed on April 8, 1963 granting the divorce.
 The marriagewith the appellant Lila Gupta was solemnised on May 25, 1963 i.e. after amonth and 17 days from the date of the decree divorce. Rajendra Kumar expired on May 7, 1965. Disputes arose in consolidation proceedings between the appellant claiming as widow of Rajendra. Kumar and respondents who were brothers and brothers' sons of Rajendra Kumar about succession to the Bhumidari rights in respect of certain plots of land enjoyed by Rajendra Kumar in his life time, the latter challenging the status of the appellant to be the widow of Rajendra Kumar on the ground that her marriage with Rajendra Kumar was void having been contracted in violation of the provisions contained in the proviso to s. 15 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The final authority Deputy Director of Consolidation upheld the claim of the appellant and this decision was challenged by the respondents in six petitions filed under Article 227 of the Constitution in the High Court of Allahabad. The learned Single Judge before whom the petitions came up for hearing was of the opinion that the marriage of Rajendra kumar with the present appellant on May 25, 1963, being in con travention of the proviso to s. 15 was null and void and accordingly allowed the writ petitions. the division Bench dismissed the further appeals by the. appellant, confirmed the order of the learned single Judge and granted a certificate under Article 133(1)(c).
 Allowing the appeals, the Court 
HELD : (1) Examining the matter from all possible angles and keeping in view the fact that the scheme of the Act provides for, treating certain marriages void and simultaneously some marriages which are made punishable yet not void and no consequences having been provided for in respect of the marriage in contravention of the proviso to s. 15 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 it cannot be said that such marriage would be void. In the instant case, as the marriage of the appellant, even though in contravention of the provisions of Section 15 is not void, she cannot be denied the status of wife and, therefore the widow of deceased Rajendra Kumar and in that capacity as an heir to him. [937 D-F] (2)A comprehensive review of the relevant provisions of the Act unmistakably manifests the legislative thrust that every marriage solemnised in contravention or one of other condition prescribed for valid marriage is not void. These express provisions in the Act would show that Parliament was aware about treating any specific marriage void and only specific marriages punishable. This express provision prima facie would go a long way to negative any suggestion of a marriage being void though not covered by s. 11 such as in breach of proviso to S. 15 as being void by necessary implication. The net effect of it is that at any rate Parliament did not think fit to treat such marriage void or that it 'is so opposed to public policy as to make it punishable. [929 A-B, F-G] 923 (3) While enacting the legislation the framers had in mind, the question of treating certain marriages void and provided for the same. It would, therefore be fair, to infer as legislative exposition that a marriage in breach of other conditions the legislature did not intend to treat as void while prescribing conditions for valid marriage in s. 5, each of the six conditions was not considered as sacrosanct as to render marriage in breach of each of it void. Even where a marriage in breach of a certain condition is made punishable under s. 18 of the Act, yet the law does not treat it as void. The marriage in breach of the proviso is neither punishable nor does s. 11 treat it as void. It would not be fair to attribute the intention to the legislature that by necessary implication in casting the proviso in the negative expression, the prohibition was absolute and the breach of it would render the marriage void. If void marriages were specifically provided for it is not proper to infer that in some cases express provision is made and in some other cases validness had to be inferred by necessary implication. It would be all the more hazardous in the case of marriage laws to treat a marriage in breach of a certain condition void even though the law does not expressly provide for it. [930 D-E, G-H. 931 A] In the Act there is a specific provision for treating certain marriages contracted in breach of certain conditions prescribed for valid marriage in the same Act as void and simultaneously no specific provision having been made for treating certain other marriages in breach of certain conditions as void. In this background even though the proviso is couched in prohibitory and negative language, in the absence of an express provision it is riot possible to infer nullity in respect of a marriage contracted by a person under incapacity prescribed by the proviso. [931 D-E] (5) Undoubtedly, the proviso opens with a prohibition that "It shall not be lawful" etc. It is not an absolute prohibition violation of which would render the Act a nullity. A person. whose marriage is dissolved by a decree of divorce suffers an incapacity for a period of one year for contracting second marriage. For such a person it shall not be lawful to contract a second marriage within a period of one year from the date of the decree of the Court of first instance. While granting a decree for divorce, the law interdicts and prohibits marriage for a period of one year from the date of the decree of divorce. The inhibition for a period does not indicate that such marriage would be void. While there is a disability for a time suffered by a party from contracting marriage, every such disability does not render the marriage void. [931 F-G] (6)The interdict of law is that it shall not be lawful for a certain party to do a certain thing which would mean that if that act is done it would be unlawful. But whenever a statute prohibits a certain thing being done therebymaking it unlawful without providing for consequence of the breach,it is not legitimate to say that such a thing when done is void becausethat would tantamount to saying that every unlawful act is void. [931 G-H, 932 A] (7)Undoubtedly, where a prohibition is enacted in public interest its violation should not be treated lightly. A valid Hindu marriage subsists during the life time of either party to the marriage until it is dissolved by a decree of divorce at the instance of either party to the marriage. A decree of divorce break-. the marriage tie. Incapacity for marriage of such persons whose marriage is dissolved by a decree of divorce for a period of one year was presumably enacted to allay apprehension that divorce was sought only for contracting another marriage or to avoid dispute about the parentage of children. There was some such time lag provided in comparable divorce laws and possibly such a proviso was, therefore, considered proper and that appears to be the purpose of object behind enacting the proviso to s. 15. It appears to be purely a regulatory measure for avoiding a possible confusion. If it was so sacrosanct that its violation would render the marriage void, it is riot possible to appreciate why the Parliament completely dropped it The proviso to s. 15 is deleted by s. 9 of the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976. The net result is that now since the amendment parties whose marriage is dissolved by a decree of divorce can contract marriage soon thereafter provided of 924 course the period of appeal has expired. This will reinforce the contention that such marriage is not void.
 The fact that neither spouse could until the time for appealing had expired, in no way affects the fall operation of the decree. It is a judgment in rem unless and until a court of appeal reversed it, the marriage for all purposes is at an end. [932 C-H, 933 A, E-F] Chandra Mohini Srivastava v. Avinash Prasad Srivastava & Anr. [1966] INSC 219; [1967] 1 SCR 864; Marsh v.
 Marsh, AIR 1945 PC 188 referred to.
 (8)To say that such provision continues the marriage tie even after the decree of divorce for the period of incapacity is to attribute a certain status to the parties whose marriage is already dissolved by divorce and for which there is' no legal mention. A decree of divorce breaks the marital tie and the parties forfeit the status of husband and wife in relation to each other. Each one becomes competent to contract another marriage as provided by s. 15.
 Merely because each one of them is prohibited from contracting a second marriage for a certain period it could not be said that despite them being a decree of divorce for certain purposes the first marriage subsists or is presumed to subsist. Some incident of marriage does survive the decree of divorce; say, liability to pay permanent alimony but on that account it cannot be said that the marriage subsists beyond the date of decree of divorce. Section 13 which provides for divorce terms says that a, marriage solemnised may on a petition presented by the husband or the wife be dissolved by a decree of divorce on one or more of the grounds mentioned in that section. The dissolution is complete once the decree is made, subject of course, to appeal. But a final decree of divorce in terms dissolves the marriage. No incident of such dissolved marriage can bridge and bind the parties whose marriage is dissolved by divorce at a time posterior to the date of decree. [933 F-H, 934 A] (9) An incapacity for second marriage for a certain period does not have effect of treating the former marriage as subsisting. During the period of incapacity the parties cannot be said to be the spouses within the meaning of cl.
 (i), sub-s. (1) of s. 5. The 'spouse' has been understood to connote a husband or a wife which term itself postulates a subsisting marriage. The 'spouse' in sub-section (1) of s.
 5 cannot be interpreted to mean a former spouse because even after the divorce when a second marriage is contracted if the former spouse is living that would not Prohibit the parties from contracting the marriage within the meaning of (cl) (i), sub-s. (1) of s. 5 by its very context would not include within its meaning the expression 'former spouse'.
 [934 B-C] (10)A mere glance at s. 15 of the Act and s. 57 of the Indian Divorce Act would clearly show that the provisions are not in pari materia. [935 E] Warter v. Warter, [1890] 15 Probate Division 152; J. Battie v. G. E. Brown, AIR 1916 Madras 847; Turner v. Turner, A.I.R. 1921 Cal. 517;
 Jackson v. Jackson, ILR 34 Allahabad 203 explained, Uma Charan Roy v. Smt. Kajal Roy, AIR 1971 Cal. 307 overhead.
 (11)Under the Mohammadan law after the divorce the traditional law did not permit a divorced wife to contract second marriage during the period of Iddat and in the past such marriage was considered void. The discernible public policy behind treating such marriage void was confusion about the parentage of the child, if the woman was pregnant at the time of divorce. The marriage was treated void interpreting a certain text of the Hanafi law. Recent trend, however, is that under the Mohmadan Law a marriage of a woman undergoing iddat is not void but merely irregular.
 [936 F-H] If public policy behind prohibiting marriage of a woman undergoing iddat and persons who are prohibited from marrying for a period of one year from the date of the decree dissolving their marriage is the same, viz., to avoid confusion about the parentage of the child which may have been conceived or the divorce sought to be obtained only for contracting second marriage, then the same conclusion may follow that such regulatory prohibition if violated or contravened could not render the marriage void. [937 B-C] 925 Muhammad Hayat v. Muhammad Nawaz, [1935] 17 L.R. Lah. 48 followed.
 (12)Voidness of marriage unless statutorily Provided for is not to be inferred. A reference to Child Marriage Restraint Act would also show that the child Marriages Restraint Act was enacted to carry forward the reformist movement of provision of the Child Marriage Restraint Act punishable, simultaneously it did not render the marriage void. [937 C- D] Pathak, J (concurring) :
 (1)No doubt. the question of the validity of a marriage deserves an especial care and the greatest caution must be exercised before a marriage is declared void. The contention that unless the statute specifically declares a marriage to be a nullity, it cannot be pronounced so by the Courts is not correct. The intrinsic evidence provided by the language of. the statute the context in which the provision finds place and the object intended to be served is of equal validity. [938 G-H, 939 A] The argument that the proviso to s. 15 of the Hindu Marriage Act is directory and not mandatory because a marriage solemnised in violation of it has not been declared a nullity by the statue cannot be accepted. [939 F] Catterall v. Sweetman, (1845) 9 Jur. 951, 954;
 Chichester v. Mure (falsely called Chichester), (1863)3, Sw. & Tr., 223; Rogers, otherwise Briscoe (falsely called Halmshaw) v.
 Halmshaw, (1864)3, Sw. & Tr. 509; explained and distinguished.
 (i)A marriage performed in violation of the proviso to s.
 15 of the Hindu Marriage Act is not void. [940 D] (a)The object behind the restraint imposed by the proviso to s. 15 is to provide a disincentive to a hasty action for divorce by a husband anxious to marry another woman, and also the desire to avoid the possibility of confusion in parentage of the child by her husband under the earlier marriage. [939 G-H] 59th Report of Law Commission of India P. 29 referred to.
 (b)A statutory provision may be construed as mandatory when the object underlying it would be defeated but for strict compliance with the pro"vision. No serious discouragement is provided by the proviso to s. 15 to a husband anxious to marry another woman, The impediment provided by the proviso to s. 15 is a temporary one and ceases on the expiration of the period of one year. The proviso proceeds on the assumption that the decree dissolving the marriage is a final decree, and merely attempts to postpone the remarriage. It does not take into account the defensibility of the decree in virtue of an appeal. The defensibility of the decree because an appeal has been provided is a matter with which the main provisions of s. 15 is concerned. Further evidence that the proviso to s. 15 is directory only is provided by its deletion altogether by Parliament by the Marriage Laws Reforms Act, 1976. [940 A-C] Umacharan Roy v. Smt. Kajal Roy, AIR 1971 Cal. 307 disapproved.
 (b)The intention to safeguard against a confusion in parentage is perhaps based on the principle in Mahommedan Law which places a ban on marriage with a divorced or widowed woman before the completion of her iddat. A marriage performed during the period of Iddat is an irregular marriage only and not a void marriage. In the instant case, the marriage of Rajendra Kumar with the appellant is not void and she is entitled to be considered as his wife. [940 C-D & F] 926 Mohammad Hayat v. Mahammad Nawaz, (1935) 17 L.R. 17 Lah. 48 applied.
 (iii)The two tests sought to be employed in the construction of the proviso to s. 15, that is to say that a marriage although in violation of. the statute is not void because the legislature has not expressly declared it to be so and also because the legislature has made no provision for legitimating the offspring of such a marriage need to be viewed with caution. These are tests which could equally be invoked to the construction of the main provision of section 
15. The conclusion that provision is directory and not mandatory does not necessarily follow. [940 G-H] The main provision' of s. 15 provides that when a marriage has been dissolved by a decree of divorce, either party to the marriage may marry again, if there is no legal right of appeal against the decree or, if there is such a right of appeal, the time for appealing has expired without an appeal having been presented, or an appeal having been presented has been dismissed. In other words, the right to remarriage shall not be exercised before the decree of divorce has reached finality. The English Law and the decisions of the Australian High Court and Indian High Courts which involved the application of s. 57 Indian Divorce Act indicate that a marriage solemnised before the expiry of the period of limitation for presenting an appeal or where an appeal has been presented, during the pendency of the appealmust be regarded as a void marriage. [941 A-B] The main provision of s. 15 of the Hindu Marriage Act, which bears almost identical resemblance to the relevant statutory provisions in thecases 'mentioned above, would perhaps attract a similar conclusion in regard to its construction.
 At the lowest, there is good ground for saying that a contention that a marriage solemnised in violation of the main provision of s. 15 is a nullity cannot be summarily rejected.
