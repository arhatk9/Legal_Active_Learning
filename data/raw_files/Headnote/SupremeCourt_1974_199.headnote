 A person aggrieved by an order promoting a junior over his head should approach the court within six months, or at the most, within a year after such promotion, though there is no period of limitation for the exercise of powers under Art.226 Except in exceptional cases, it would be a sound and wise exercise of discretion for the courts to refuse to exercise their extra-ordinary powers under the article in the case of persons who do not approach expeditiously for relief and who stand by and allow things to happen and then approach the court to put forward stale claims and try to unsettle. settled matters. [357-G 358-A].
 In the present case, the appellant did not challenge promotions of his juniors over his head as Divisional Engineers and Superientending Engineers. But 14 years after the first promotion of a junior over him in 1957, he filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging the promotion.
 It is difficult for the Government to consider now whether any relaxation of the rules should have been made in the appellant's favour in the year 1957. The conditions that were prevalent in 1957 cannot be reproduced now.
 Entertaining such petitions is a waste of time of the court and impedes its working in considering legitimate grievances and the High Court rightly dismissed the petition. 1357 C-F;
