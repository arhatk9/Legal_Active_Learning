 Pursuant to two orders of detention under s. 3(1) (a) (iii) of the Maintenance of internal Security Act, 1971 the petitioner was detained on the ground that he was indulging in adulteration of essential foodstuffs and was in possession of donkey dung, sawdust, gypsum, ICI colours and coloured plastic paper used and intended for use in adulteration of foodstuffs; that the samples of foodstuffs sold by him, on examination were found to contain highly adulterated material; that the recovery of huge quantity of adulterated foodstuffs and adulterated material which is un- hygenic and injurious to public health proved that by indulging in the business of manufacture, sale and storage for sale of such essential commodities he had been acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies essential to the community and that he could not be prevented from doing so by prosecution under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act. Before the confirmation of the order of detention by the Government the petitioner filed a habeas corpus petition before the High Court, which was dismissed. In a petition under article 32 of the Consti- tution it was contended (i) that the grounds of detention were non-existent; (ii) that the grounds communicated to the detenu did not have a direct nexus with the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community; and (iii) that in an affidavit filed before the High Court the District Magistrate relied upon an earlier prosecution and conviction of the petitioner under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, but failed to mention this ground in the order of detention, in consequence of which the grounds communicated were vague.
 Dismissing the petition, 
HELD : (1) It cannot be said that the grounds of detention were non-existent. On the report of the public analyst the chilli powder and haldiwhole would be deemed to be adulterated articles of food falling within the definition of cl. (c) and (f) respectively and Amchoor within the definition of cl. (b) and (c) of s. 2(1) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954. In the light of the information received by the detaining authority that the petitioner had been systematically adulterating foodstuffs on a large scale, the discovery in bulk of extraneous matter stored in the premises which could be used for adulteration could not be said to be irrelevant. [477 H; 478 A-B] (2)(a) Supplies in the context of s. 3(1)(a) (iii) means supply of essential commodities or foodstuffs in a wholesome form. It does not mean the supply of their adulterated substitutes. Engagement in the process of adulteration of foodstuffs meant for sale is an activity highly prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community, more so when it is done in an organised manner and on a large scale. [478 F-G] Misri Lal v. The State A.I.R 1951 Pat. 134 F. B. over-ruled, and Hari Ram v. State (1974) 25, Raj. Law Weekly p.- 26 approved.
 (b) Food adulteration activity particularly of an organised kind is an activity prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community which may justify an order of detention under s. 3(1) (a)(iii) of the Act. One of the primary necessaries of life is food; one of the elementary obligations of a welfare state is to ensure food to its citizens. The concepts of "Supplies" and services" intermingle in the discharge of that obligation by the State. Maintenance 471 of sale of pure food stuffs to the public is both a 'supply" and a "service'. A person who sells adulterated food to the people not only evinces a tendency to disrupt the even flow of essential supplies but also interrupts service to the community.

 1999 of 1973 decided on 21-8-1974 referred to.
 (c) one broad test for the exercise of the power which the detaining authority may keep in View, particularly in a case of adulteration of foodstuffs is whether the material before it about the activities of the person sought to be detained in the proximate past and present, is such as to enable it to make a reasonable prognosis of the probability of that person to behave similarly in the future. In the present case on the material before him the District Magistrate could reasonably be satisfied that unless detained, the detenu would be likely to continue the food adulteration activity in the future and it was, therefore, necessary to detain him. [481 B & D] (3) The mere fact that all the details of his previous prosecutions and their results or his conviction were not conveyed to the detenu did not contravene art. 22(5) of the Constitution and s. 8(1) of the Act. All these fact were within the knowledge of the detenu. There was sufficient indication in the first as well as the second order of detention about the previous prosecution of the petitioner for food adulteration offences. What constitutes the substance of the grounds is the factum of the raid and the discovery of adulterated chilli powder, Amchur, Haldi and a large quantity of odd materials such as sawdust, donkey dung etc. which, in the opinion of the detaining authority, were suspected adulterants. The presence of these suspected adulterants in bulk, safely stored in tins may not by itself amount to an offence under the penal law but it was a relevant circumstance which could be taken into account by the detaining authority in reaching its subjective satisfaction.
