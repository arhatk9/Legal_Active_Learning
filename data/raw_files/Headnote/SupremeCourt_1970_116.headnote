 Possession of an area of land in Himachal Pradesh including some land belonging to the respondent was taken in December 1963 by the Deputy Commissioner and the land was handed over to the Air Force Authorities. Subsequently, on March 31, 1964, a notification under s. 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, was published., Thereafter by a composite notification under s. 6 and s. 17(1) & (4) dated May 16, 1964, the State Government declared that the land was needed for a public purpose" that since it was required urgently, the enquiry under s. 5-A of the Act was dispensed with, and that possession of the land would be taken under s. 17(1) of the Act after the expiry of 15 days of the notice under s. 9(1) of the Act. The Collector then served notices under s. 9 in June 1964. On October 5, 1965, the State Government published an order cancelling the notifications dated March 31, 1964 and May 16, 1964, for acquisition of the land. The respondent filed a writ petition and prayed that the notification dated October 5, 1965, be quashed and that a writ of mandamus be issued directing the authorities to discharge their duties in law to determine compensation for compulsory and urgent acquisition. The petition was allowed by the Judicial Commissioner.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that under s. 21 of the General Clauses Act, the State had the power to cancel the notifications at any time and that s. 48 of the Land Acquisition Act did not trench upon that power; furthermore, where the Government had obtained possession illegally or under some unlawful transaction and notification under sec. 17(1) was issued, the land did not vest in the Government 'free from all encumbrances; and that the notification issued by the State Government under Sec. 17(1) and (4) was without authority because it did not recite that the land notified was "waste or arable".
 
HELD : Dismissing the appeal, When possession of-the land is taken under s.17(1) of the Land Acquisition Act the land vests in the Government.
 There is no provision by which land statutorily vested in the Government reverts to the original ,owner by mere cancellation of the notification under s. 17(1). Although the government may cancel or rescind notifications under section 4 and 6 of the Land Acquisition Act a notification under s. 17(1) cannot be cancelled nor can it be withdrawn in exercise of the powers under Sec. 48 of the Land Acquisition Act. Any other view would enable the State Government to circumvent the specific provision by relying upon a general power in the General clauses Act, [415 H, 417 C-E] State of Madhya Pradesh and Ors. v. Vishnu Prasad Sharma & Ors [1966] INSC 42; [1966] 3 S.C.R. 557, referred to.
