 Section 6 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, makes every dealer liable for payment of tax under the Act on all sales- effected by him in the course of interstate trade or commerce. A sale of' goods can be held to have taken place in the course of interstate trade under s. 3 (a) if it can be shown that the sale has occasioned the movement of goods from one State to another, that is, if, (i) there is a sale, (ii) there is actual movement of goods from one State to another, and (iii) the sale and movement of the goods formed integral parts of the same transaction. A sale being. by the definition in the Act, transfer of property, to be exigible to tax under the Act it must be shown that tie movement was the result of a covenant or incident of the contract of sale' The movement of goods which takes place independently of acontract of sale would not fall within the ambit of s. 3(a). There must be acontract of sole preceding the movement of goods from one State to anotherand the movement of goods should have been caused by and be the result of that contract of sale. If there was no contract of sale preceding the movement of goods the movement can obviously be not ascribed to a contract of sale nor can it 'be said that. the sale has occasioned movement of goods from one State to the other. [471F-473B] In the present case, the appellant was a manufacturer of refrigerators in Faridabad. Presene refrigerators. were sold with three different trade marks. The sale of each brand was made through a separate distributor in Delhi appointed for that purpose and the appellant entered into an agreement with each of the three distributors. The appellant dealer was bound to sell each of the brands of the refrigerator to one of the distributors. The price of the refrigerators was to be fixed mutually as agreed upon between the appellant and his distributors from time to time. The prices were not settled for each individual machine but periodically. The goods were manufactured in the factory at Faridabad and excise clearance pass was obtained after the payment of excise duty for the transport of goods from the factory to the appellant's godown in Delhi. The excise pass was in favour of self. During the transport of the goods from Faridabad to Delhi the octroi at the barrier was paid by the appellant. At the destination the goods were received by the staff of the appellant and taken to their godown. The purchase orders were placed by the three distributors after the goods reached the Head- office of the appellant at Delhi. In pursuance of the orders given by the distributors the Delhi staff gave delivery of the goods at Delhi under a challan prepared at Delhi. The property in the goods passed at Delhi to the distributors after delivery. The price of the goods was received by the appellant at Delhi and deposited in the appellant's account in its Delhi bank. The refrigerators were also exported putside India.
 The High Court, in a reference by the Tribunal, held that the distribution agreements constituted agreements 'of sale, that the refrigerators moved from Faridabad to: Delhi in pursuance of the agreements of sale, and that the appellant was therefore liable to pay sales-tax under s. 3(a) of the Act.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 464 
HELD (1) The three agreements between the appellant and the distributors were merely agreements for distribution and did not constitute contracts of sale. [480B-C] (a)The number of refrigerators which were to be purchased by each of the distributors was not specified in the distribution agreements nor did the agreements contain the price which was to be charged for each refrigerator. In two of the distribution agreements the minimum number of refrigerators which had been agreed upon to be purchased by the distributors was mentioned but the exact number of refrigerators to be sold by the appellant to those two distributors was still left to the volition of the appellant. The mode of dealing between the parties was that orders were placed by the distributors with the appellant after the refrigerators had reached the appellant's sale- office and godown in Delhi. The price of refrigerators was also to be mutually agreed upon from time to time. The sales by the appellant to the distributor thus depended upon the future agreement between the parties from time to time.
 Therefore, it was the orders which were placed in Delhi by the distributors and the acceptance thereof by the appellant that resulted in the mutual agreement of sale. The distribution agreement with each distributor only provided the framework within which the different contracts of sale were to be entered into by the distributor with the appellant, and the distribution agreement and contract of sale were distinct transactions. [474B-G] (b)It is not correct to say that the distributor with whom the first agreement was entered into was bound to purchase all the products of the appellant. The words 'the sale would be as mutually agreed upon from time to time' Would lose all significance if that was the intention of the parties. Also, the facts that subsequently two other distribution agreements were entered into with two others and that the appellant was in a position to export its products to foreign countries during the assessment year, show that there was no such agreement. [474G-475B] (c)There was no appropriation towards the agreement with each of the distributors, at Faridabad by affixing the name plates to the refrigerators, and hence, there was no sale of refrigerators at Faridabad. There was no evidence to show that. the name plates were actually affixed at Faridabad and not at Delhi. Even if they were so affixed there was nothing to prevent the appellant from changing them because the three different brands of refrigerators were in all respects identical and the name plates were also easily interchangeable. of the sale of the-refrigerators in favour of the distributors had already taken place at Faridabad and the refrigerators had be-en appropriated there would not have arisenany occasion for the placing of a subsequent order in Delhi by a distributor. But in fact orders in respect of the various refrigerators were placed by the distributors only in Delhi after they had been transported to the Delhi sale-office and godown of the appellant. Since there was no appropriation at Faridabad, there was no legal bar to the changing of name plates by the appellant till such time as orders were placed by the distributors after inspection at Delhi. In answering the question whether the transactions constituted sales in the course of interstate trade or commerce the Court should look not merely at the distribution agreement but should also pay regard to the entire course of dealings between the parties. [475 B-H] (d)Apart from the fact that the distribution agreements could not be construed as contracts of sale there is no material to show that there was any assent, expressed or implied, by the distributors, to the appropriation of the refrigerators by the appellant at Faridabad; and hence s. 23 of the Sale of Goods Act is not applicable. No authority was given by the distributors to the appellant to appropriate the goods at Faridabad, Further the appellant was not, under the terms of the contract, authorised to do some act or thing with reference to the refrigerators which could not be done until the refrigerators were appropriated.
 [477 H-478H] (2)There was no movement of refrigerators from Faridabad to Delhi under a contract of sale. [476G] 465 (a)If there is a choice before the parties of so arranging their matters that lift one case they would have to incur liability to, pay tax and in the other case the liability to pay tax would not be attracted, they would Prefer the latter course'There is nothing illegal or impermissible to a party so arranging its affairsthat the liability to pay tax would not be attracted or would be reduced. [476C-D] The appellant could have sold the refrigerators at either of the two places, Faridabad or Delhi. But liability to pay tax under the Act would arise if the sale of the refrigerators to distributors were to take place at Faridabad and the movement of refrigerators from Faridabad to Delhi were to take place under the contract of sale. So, the parties expressly stated in each of the three distri- bution agreements that it would be in Delhi that the sale would take place to the distributors and the property therein would pass to them. In fact, it was in Delhi that the orders were placed by the distributors, the goods were delivered to the distributors, and the price of the refrigerators was paid. Hence it could not be said that the transport of the refrigerators from Faridabad to Delhi was in pursuance of a contract of sale. The appellant had a godown and sale office in Delhi and there is no evidence that it had a godown in Faridabad. The movement of the goods from Faridabad to the appellant's godown in Delhi can therefore be ascribed only to the fact that the appellant had a godown facility in Delhi. [476D-G] (b)The inclusion of the charges for the transport of refrigerators from Faridabad to Delhi in the price payable by the distributors would not show that the movement of refrigerators from Faridabad to Delhi was occasioned by the contract of sale. The price payable by the distributors was the aggregate of the ex-factory price of refrigerators and the transportation charges. As the exfactory price of the refrigerators was fixed from time to time and as the agree- ments with the distributors provided that the sale of the refrigerators as well as the delivery thereof to the distributors 'would take place in Delhi the distribution agreements provided that the transportation charges would be added to the exfactory price of the refrigerators in calculating the amount payable by the distributors to the appellant. Further, in two of the distribution agreements it was provided that the liability of the appellant for any shortage or damage would cease only after the goods had been inspected by and delivered to the distributors at Delhi. In the 3rd agreement it was provided that the appellant would accept no responsibility for shortage or damage during transit, but even in that case, it was not the distributor but the insurer who would have to bear the loss and the transit insurance expenses were borne by the appellant.
