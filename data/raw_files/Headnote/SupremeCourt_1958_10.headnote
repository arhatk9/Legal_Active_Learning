 The appellant was the manager of a bidi factory which had contracts with certain independent contractors, known as Sattedars, for the supply of bidis. The Sattedars undertook to supply the bidis by manufacturing them in their own factories or by entrusting the work to third parties, a' a price to. be paid by the management after delivery and approval. The Inspector of Factories found working in the appellant's factory certain Sattedars and their coolies who had come to deliver bides manufactured by them. The appellant was prosecuted and convicted under s. 92, Factories Act for violation of the provisions of ss. 62 and 63 for failure to maintain the register of adult workers and for allowing the workers to work in the factory without making beforehand the entries of their attendance in the register :
 Held, that the Sattedars and their coolies were not workers within the definition in S. 2(1) of the Act and, therefore, the noninclusion of their names in the register or the absence of entries in regard to them therein did not constitute an offence under s. 92 of the Act. To determine whether a person employed is a worker the test is whether or not the employer had control and supervision over the manner in which the work was to be done. The Sattedars were not under the control of the factory management and could manufacture the bidis wherever they pleased. The coolies were neither employed by the management directly nor were they employed by the management through the Sattedars.
