 The appellant filed a suit on the promissory note claiming that the first respondent failed to deliver the goods, that the agreement therefore did not ripen into a pledge, and that consequently, he was entitled to recover the amount advanced by him. It was found on the evidence., that the goods were delivered to the appellant, and that he was it pledgee thereof.
 On the question whether the appellant was entitled to a decree in view (A his denial of the pledge and his failure to offer to redeliver the goods, 
HELD : The appellant would not be entitled to a decree on the promissory note and also retain the goods found to have been delivered to him and to be in his Custody. [240 F.G] Section 176 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, deals with the rights of a pawnee and provides that in case of default by the pawner the pawnee has (1) the right to sue upon the debt and to retain the goods as collateral security, and (2) the right to-sell the goods after reasonable notice of the intended sale to the pawner. So long, however, as the sale does not take place, the pawner is entitled to redeem the goods on payment of the debit. Therefore, the right to sue on the debt assumes that be is in a position to redeliver the goods on payment of the debt, and if by denying the pledge or otherwise, he has put himself in a position whereby he is not able to redeliver the goods, he cannot obtain a decree.
