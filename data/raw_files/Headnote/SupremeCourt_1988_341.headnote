 Pursuant to consolidation proceedings initiated under the East Punjab Holdings (Consolidation and Prevention of Fragmentation) Act, 1948, a scheme of repartition was framed, and the respondent-land owner was allotted alternative lands in lieu of his original holdings. The appellants-tenants who were in actual possession and were actually cultivating prior to consolidation two different parcels of land in the original holding of the land owner, as non-occupancy tenants, were not put back in possession of the corresponding parcels in the substituted lands.
 The tenants initiated proceedings under section 21 j26 of the Consolidation Act. The Consolidation Officer upheld their claim and passed orders on 28.4.1960 that corresponding parcels in the substituted lands should be restored to the tenants.
 The land owner instituted two separate suits challenging the orders of the Consolidation Officer as without jurisdiction. The trial court and the lower appellate court held that the Civil Courts had no jurisdiction to entertain the suits. In the second appeals, the High Court held that the Civil Courts had jurisdiction to entertain the suits.
 and remanded the cases.
 Upon remand, the Trial Court repelled the contention ot' the land-owner that the orders passed by the Consolidation Officer were without jurisdiction. The Lower Appellate Court confirmed the judgment and order of the Trial Court and, inter alia, rejected the contention of the land owner that the tenants should have pressed their claim when partition and re-partition Schemes were being framed under Sections PG NO 738 PG NO 739 14 to 21 of the Consolidation Act.
 The High Court, in second appeal, however took the view that the Consolidation Officer had no jurisdiction to exercise powers under section 26 of the Consolidation Act, that no right was created In favour Or mortgagees, lessees or holders of encumbrances In respect of original holdings under section 26 read with Rule 13, and that such rights must be determined before the scheme is confirmed and if this has not been done the holders of such encumbrances cannot seek any relief under section 26 read with rule 13 or any other provision.
 Allowing the appeals, it was, 
 HELD: (l) The Act contemplates the allotment of substituted lands in lieu of lands comprised in original holding on repartition only to two categories of landholders namely the landowners and the occupancy tenants. [748E] (2) So far as the allotment of land is concerned it is either to the 'land owner' or to the occupancy tenant' who would under the Act become the owner in his own right having regard to the statutory provision for extinguishing the rights of the land owner in such land as is in possession of the occupancy tenant. [748G-H] (3) So far as this basic scheme for allotment of the lands on repartition is concerned it does not take into account any rights of non-occupancy tenants, mortgagees, or holders of other encumbrances with which the original holdings of the land owners or the occupancy tenants were already burdened. [748H; 749A] (4) So far as non-occupancy tenants are concerned the only provision which the Legislature has designed is Section 26 relating to encumbrances of the land owners and tenants. [749A] (5) So far as non-occupancy tenants or mortagees and other holders of encumbrances in respect of pre- repartitioned original holdings are concerned, their rights stand transferred by virtue of the operation and effect of the statutory provision embodied in section 26 itself from the 'original holding' to the 'substituted holding' allotted to the land owners and the occupancy tenants under the scheme. (750C-D] (6) Section 26 has been enacted with a view to provide for a statUtory fastening of the right which subsisted in favour of the mortgagee or the non-occupancy tenant of the PG NO 739 holder of other encumbrances, to the new holding which the land owner (or the occupancy tenant) is allotted under the scheme of consolidation and re-partition made Pursuant thereto. [750E-F] (7) On a true reading of section 26 read with Rule 13, a right has indeed been created in favour of an encumbrance holder including a non-occupancy tenant. And jurisdiction has been conferred on the Consolidation Officer to put the holder of the encumbrance in possession of the corresponding parts of the substituted holding allotted to the land owner in lieu of his original holding if he was in posession of the original holding. [750H; 751A] (8) The High Court was wrong in taking the view that section 26 does not create any independent right and that if deals only with the rights of such persons to whom land is allotted under the scheme and the repartition made pursuant thereto. [751A-B] (9) The High Court failed to realize that in fact section 26 would come into operation only subsequent to ;md only upon the re-allotment to the original owner being made and he being put in possession of the substituted holding in lieu of the original holding upon repartition. [751A-B] Munshi v. Bhagwan, R.S.A. No. 81-T of 1961 decided by the Delhi High Court on 29.4.1964 referred to.
