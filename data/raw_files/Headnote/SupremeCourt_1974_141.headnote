 The appellants were tried for the offence of murder but were acquitted on the ground that there was no reliable and convincing evidence against them. The High Court reversed the judgment of acquittal and convicted and sentenced them.
 On the question whether the High Court was in error in reversing the finding of acquittal recorded by Sessions Judge.
 Allowing the appeal.
 Held : The High Court was in error in reversing the judgement of the court. The Sessions Judge had given convincing and cogent reasons in support of his conclusions. The view taken by him can, by no means, be described as unreasonable. Even if the High Court felt that on the material on record a different view was also possible, that fact did not justify interference with the judgment of acquittal. If two conclusions can be reached on the basis of the evidence on record the High Court should not interfere with the finding of acquittal recorded by the trial court. [679-D] In an appeal under s. 417 Cr. P.C. against an order of acquittal, the High Court has full power to review at large the evidence on which the order of acquittal was founded and to reach the conclusion that upon the evidence the order of acquittal should be reversed. No limitation should be placed upon that power unless it be found expressly stated in the Code, but in exercising the power conferred by the Code and before reaching its conclusion upon fact the High Court should give proper weight and consideration to such matters as (1) the view of the trial judge as to the credibility of the witnesses; (2) the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused, a presumption certainly not weakened by the fact that he has been acquitted at his trial; (3) the right of the accused to the benefit of any real and reasonable doubt; and (4) the slowness of an appellate court in disturbing a finding of fact arrived at by a judge who had the advantage of seeing the witnesses.
 The High Court should also take into account the reasons given by the court below port of its order of acquittal and must express its reasons in the judgment which led it to hold that the acquittal was not justified. Further, if two conclusions can be based upon the evidence on record, the High Court should not disturb the finding of acquittal recorded by the trial court. It would follow as a corollary from that, that if the view taken by the trial court in acquitting the accused was not unreasonable the occasion for the reversal of that view would not arise. [678.
