 The appellant was owner of two plots. In one of the plots a rice mill was constructed by the partnership in which he was a managing partner. For taking a loan he hypothecated the mill and the plots with U.P. Financial Corporation which sanctioned a loan of Rs. 4,28,000, but disbursed only Rs. 3,78,660 to him. Due to non-cooperation of other partners, lack of working capital and failure of the Financial Corporation to release the balance loan the mill landed into a rough weather. Consequently 617 defaults were committed in repayment of loan. The appellant requested the Corporation to release the vacant hypothecated plot to enable him to negotiate for private sale to pay off his debt and also stated that he was ready and willing to pay the outstanding amount of Rs. 5,03,165 towards principal and interest in full satisfaction under "one time settlement scheme". The Corporation rejected his request and exercising its power under section 29 of the State Financial Corporations Act, 1951 took possession of the hypotheca, invited tenders for its sale and without giving any notice or opportunity to the appellant accepted the tender of Rs. 2,55,000 given by respondents 3 to 5.
 Pursuant to the sale the 3rd respondent took possession of the property and invested a large sums for the improvement of the mill. The appellant filed a writ petition in the High Court which was dismissed. Against the decision of the High Court the appellant filed an appeal in this Court.
 Allowing the appeal, this Court, 
 HELD :1. Section 29 of the State Financial Corporations Act confers very wide power on the Corporation to ensure prompt payment by arming it with effective measure to realise the arrears. Every wide power, the exercise of which has far reaching repercussion, has inherent limitation on it. It should be exercised to effectuate the purpose of the Act. [629D-E] 1.1. The Corporation has been given statutory right to take over possession and management of the defaulting unit or hypotheca or both including the right to sell and realise the loan or advance due from the unit or debtor. The Corporation is an instrumentality of the State. The Corporation or its employees or officers are bound to act reasonably and fairly in dealing with the property of the debtor. The exercise of the power or discretion in its dealing would be subject to the same constitutional or public law limitation as the Government. The Corporation also equally must conform its action with the same standard that meet the test of justness, fairness, reasonableness and relevance. [628G-H] Kasturilal Laxmi Reddy v. State of J & K, [1980] INSC 118; [1980] 3 S.C.R. 1338, referred to.
 1.2. Sub-section 4 of section 29 treats the Corporation "to be a trustee" of the debtor or person claiming title through him. It saddles the Corporation or the officer concerned with inbuilt duties, responsibilities 618 and obligations towards the debtor in dealing with the property and entails him to act as a prudent and reasonable man standing in the shoes of the owner. Therefore, when the property of the debtor stands transferred to the Corporation for management or possession thereof which includes right to sell or further mortgage etc., the Corporation or its officers or employees stand in the shoes of a debtor as trustee and the property cestue que trust. They are bound to exercise their power in good faith in selling or dealing with the property of the debtor as an ordinary prudent man would exercise in the management of his own affairs to preserve and protect his own estate. Their acts should be reasonable, just and fair which must meet the eye and the offer accepted must be competitive and every attempt should be made to secure as maximum price as possible to liquidate the liabilities incurred by the industrial concern or the debtor under the Act.

 1.3. It is not mandatory as a matter of law, to observe the process of taking over strictly. Defaults in payment of loan may attract Section 29. But that alone is insufficient either to assume possession or to sell the property.
 Neither should be resorted to unless it is imperative. Even though no rules appear to have been framed nor any guideline framed by the Corporation was placed, yet the basic philosophy enshrined in Section 24 has to be kept in mind.
 Rationale of action and motive in exercise of it has to be judged in the light of it. Lack of reasonableness or even fairness at either of the two stages render the take over and transfer invalid.
 [630F, 629H, 630A-B] 1.4. In the instant case, the Corporation was guilty of not acting in accordance with law either at the stage of take over or in transferring the unit. [630B] 619 1.5. The attitude adopted by the Corporation was contrary to the spirit and scheme of section 24 of the Act.
 Section 24 of the Act requires the Board to discharge its function on business principles, due regard being had to the interest of industry, commerce and general public. Instead of agreeing to receive five lacs in lump-sum as offered by the appellant it opted for two lacs fifty thousands tendered by the purchaser that too in four yearly instalments. It was neither business principle, nor in the interest of commerce and industry, nor good of general public. This solicitous attitude, at the expense of the appellant, appears to be unjust and unfair and no reasonable prudent owner would accept such an offer.
 [626C, 625F; 626A-B; 635G; 636A] 1.6. Section 29 does not exclude the application of the principles of natural justice. Before accepting the tender of the third respondent, an opportunity should have been given to the appellant as to why such an offer of the third respondent be not accepted. No bonafide actions have been taken or attempted by the Corporation. The sale of the property is vitiated by unjust and unreasonable act on the part of the Corporation and is liable to be set aside. The appellant is not bound by the sale or the subsequent acts of the purchasers claiming through them.
 [636A, C-D, F] The Corporation should immediately resume possession of the hypotheca sold. It will be open to the appellant to pay the entire liability and have the hypotheca redeemed as per contract. If the appellant fails to do so, the Corporation can sell the same in open auction, after giving wide publicity in the press. [636G, 637A] 
 2. The financial corporations under the State Financial Corporations Act were visualised not as a profit earning concerns but an extended arm of a welfare state to harness business potential of the country to benefit the common man. They deal with public money for public benefit. Their approach has to be public oriented, helpful to the loanee, without loss to the Corporation. Endeavour should be to adjust and accommodate as business considerations require the sick unit to function for benefit, both of the general public and the Corporation. The Corporation, therefore, should honour their commitments of releasing entire loan timely except for very good reasons which should be intimated before hand to enable the unit holder to comply with shortcoming if any. In the absence 620 of completion of it, the proceedings for recovery under section 29 may not be justified. [625F-G, 630D-F] 
 3. The following necessary directions are issued to be observed by the Financial Corporations while exercising power under section 29:- (A) Every endeavour should be made, to make the unit viable and be put on working condition.
 If it becomes unworkable.
 (B) Sale of a unit should always be made by public auction.
 (C) Valuation of a unit for purposes of determining adequacy of offer or for determining if bid offered was adequate, should always be intimated to the unit holder to enable him to file objection if any as he is vitally interested in getting the maximum price.
 (D) If tenders are invited then the highest price on which tender is to be accepted must be intimated to the unit holder.
 (E) If unit holder is willing to offer the sale price, as the tenderer, then he should be offered same facility and unit should be transferred to him. And the arrears remaining thereafter should be re-scheduled to be recovered in instalments with interest after the payment of last instalment fixed under the agreement entered into as a result of tendered amount.
 If he brings third parties with higher offer it would be tested and may be accepted.
 (F) Sale by private negotiation should be permitted only in very large concerns where investment runs in very high amount for which ordinary buyer may not be available or the industry itself may be of such nature that by normal buyers may not be available. But before taking such steps there should be advertisements not only in daily newspapers but business magazines and papers.
 (G) Request of the unit holder to release any part of the property on which the concern is not standing of which he is the owner should normally be granted on condition that sale proceeds shall be deposited in loan account.
 [634H, 635A-G] 621 
 4. `Business' is a word of wide import. It has no definite meaning. Its perceptions differ from private to public sector or from institutional financing to commercial banking. [625F] 
 5. The law consists of body and soul. The letter of the law is the body and the sense and reason of its is the soul quia ratio legis est enima legis. In other words, like a nut the letter of the law represents the shell and sense and the purpose of its Kernal. The law intends to serve the purpose. Justice is both the cause and effect, the origin and the legitimate end of law. One will receive no benefit from the law, if the ratio and the letter of law defeats its purpose. [629C] 
 6. In legislations enacted for general benefit and common good the responsibility is far graver. It demands purposeful approach. The exercise of discretion should be objective. Test of reasonableness is more strict. The public functionaries should be duty conscious rather than power charged. Its actions and decisions which touch the common man have to be tested on the touchstone of fairness and justice. That which is not fair and just is unreasonable. And what is unreasonable is arbitrary. An arbitrary action is ultra vires. It does not become bona fide and in good faith merely because no personal gain or benefit to the person exercising discretion should be established. An action is mala fide if it is contrary to the purpose for which it was authorised to be exercised.
