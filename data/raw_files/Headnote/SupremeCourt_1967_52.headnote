 The appellant, who was carrying on business in liquor in his hotel under an annual licence issued by the Excise and Taxation Commissioner under s. 20 of the Jammu and Kashmir Excise Act, 1958, had applied for a fresh licence for another year. Meanwhile, the Excise Department received complaints from the inhabitants of the locality objecting to the location of the bar in that locality. The complaints were inquired into and the appellant was informed by the Commissioner that the licence would not be issued unless he shifted the premises of his hotel to some other approved locality. A writ petition filed by the appellant for quash- ing the order was dismissed by the High Court.
 In appeal to this Court., 
HELD : (i) Dealing in liquor is business, and a citizen has a fundamental right to do that business under Art. 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. But the State can make a law imposing reasonable restrictions on the right, in public interests, under Art. 19(6). (57 D-E] Dealing in noxious and dangerous goods does not cease to be business, though the nature of the goods may be a ground for imposing a restriction on the activity. [53 F; 54 C] T. B. Ibrahim v.

 Since the instant case was one of issuing a licence, s. 20 of the Excise Act applies. As the Excise and Taxation Commissioner had made a bona fide enquiry and came to the conclusion that the locality was not suitable far carrying on business in liquor, for relevant reasons, it could not he said that his order was arbitrary or unreasonable. [58 B] (ii) Section 22 of the Act deals with cancellation of a licence and does not control s. 20. [58 C] K.K.NARULA V. J. & K. STATE (Subba Rao, C.J.) 51
