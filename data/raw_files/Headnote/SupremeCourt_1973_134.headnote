 The Land Acquisition Officer awarded compensation for certain land acquired and the method adopted by him for valuing coconut and orange topes was to capitalise the net income from those topes at 20 years' purchase. On reference,. the Subordinate judge, though he increased the estimated yield from the trees, accepted that the capitalisation should be at 20 years purchase. On appeal, the High Court also held that the method of capitalisation was a fair method for arriving at the market value.
 Dismissing the appeal by the State to this Court.
 
HELD : The approved method for valuing orchards is to capitalise their net income at a number of years' purchase which has- to be fixed with reference to the nature of trees and other circumstances. [310 G] In the present case, the Land Acquisition Officer found that all the fruit bearing trees would yield for more than 20 years, and therefore, the method of capitalisation was a fair method.
