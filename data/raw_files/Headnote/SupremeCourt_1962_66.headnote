 The respondents were holders of inams in a village called Goteru, one of the Mokhasa villages which were included in the assets of the Zamindari at 'the time of the permanent settlement in 1802. The inams themselves were pre- settlement inams and were riot included in the assets of the Zamindari. The respondents had leased out seine of the lands comprised in their inams to the appellant for a fixed period, and in the suits instituted against the latter after the expiry of the period of the leases for ejecting them from the Holdings in their possessions, they pleaded, inter alia, that they had got occupancy rights in the suit lands inasmuch as the inams were part of an estate and that, therefore, they were not liable to be ejected. They contended that by reason of the amendments made in s.
 3(2)(d) of the Madras Estates Land Act, 1908. in 1936 and 1945, these minor inams being within the village of Goteru were estates under s. 3(2)(d), read with Explanation (1) of the Act. It wits not disputed that Goteru village was included in the Mokhasa sanad of 1802 and that the Mokhasa grant was an estate.
 Held, that the minor inams in the present case were not grants of whole villages and were not, therefore estates within the meaning of s. 3(2)(d) of the Madras Estates Land, 1908.
 The crucial test to find out whether a grant amounted to an estate as defined under s. 3(2)(d) of the Act was whether at the time of the grant the subject matter was a whole village or only a part of it. If it was only a part of a village, then the amending Act made no difference and such a part would not be an estate within the meaning of the term ; but if the grant was of the whole village and a named one, then it would be an estate.
