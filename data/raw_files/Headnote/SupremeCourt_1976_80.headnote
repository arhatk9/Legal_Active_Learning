 The appellant submitted a sales-tax return showing the taxable turnover. The assessing authority, while checking the accounts, discovered an undisclosed turnover. He added that sum to the turnover and then assessed sales-tax on that turnover. The appellant did not file any appeal against the assessment order. The Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax issued a notice to the appellants in exercise of suo motu power of revision under s. 32 of the Madras Sales-tax Act to show cause why a penalty should not be imposed in respect of the undisclosed turnover. While challenging the exercise of this power the appellant alternatively prayed for exemption in respect of a sum representing works contracts which, they alleged, did not amount to sale of goods. The first ground was rejected. On the second ground it was held that since the appellants did not file an appeal in the regular course against the assessment order they were not entitled to exemption. On appeal, the Appellate Tribunal allowed the claim for exemption on the ground that it represented works contract.
 The High Court in revision set aside the order of the Tribunal granting exemption.
 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD : The suo motu power of revision of the Deputy Commissioner in s. 32 is wide and can be exercised both in favour of the revenue as well as the tax-payer in order to correct any error or illegality committed by the assessing authority in his order of assessment. [860D] State of Kerala v. K. M. Cheria Abdulla and Company (1965) 16 S.T.C. 875 [1964] INSC 215; [1965] 1 S.C.R. 601 and The Swastik Oil Mills Ltd. v. H. B. Munshi Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax, Bombay (1968) 21 S.T.C. 383 referred to.
 But in the present case the Deputy Commissioner was right in refusing to exercise his revisional power in favour of the appellants and the High Court was right in reversing the order of the Appellate Tribunal. At no stage of the proceedings before the assessing authority did the assessee bring it to the assessing authority's notice that a substantial portion of the turnover related to works contracts and as such exempt from liability to tax.
 Secondly, the appellants acquiesced in the order of assessment passed by the assessing authority and did not prefer any appeal. In face of the decision of this Court in State of Madras v. Gannon Dunkerley and Co. Ltd. [1958] INSC 35; [1959] SCR 379 the appellants cannot plead that they did not claim exemption under the mistaken impression that the transactions amounted to sale of goods. [860 E G; 861 B]
