 HELD: The application of the appellant for permit was not maintainable as the appellant was not a registered cooperative society when the application was made, though it was registered at the time when the applications were considered and disposed of by the Regional Transport Authority. [409E] Since the appellant was not 3 registered cooperative society can the date of the application there was no person in the eye of the law who could file a valid application under s.46 of the Motor Vehicle Act. When an application for permit is filed by a person it has to be published and objections invited but if such an application is filed on behalf of a non-existent person it is impossible for objectors to state the reasons for their objections. Though the appellant had applied for registration there was no certainty that registration would be granted. [409GH] Kali Kinkar Kundu v. Sadluan Chandra Dey, A.I.R. 1971 Calcutta 171 and Azad Motor Transport Cooperative Society Ltd v. State Transport Appellate Authority, Misc. Petition No. 489 of 1966 decided on 17-11-1966 by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur (Unreported), referred to.
 (2) Though the rival applicant did not challenge the grant of the permit in favour of the appellant on the ground that the appellant was not a registered society, such a plea was entertained and considered by the Appellate Authority without any objection from the appellant. Further, the appellant, in its writ petition did not contend that it was not open to the Appellate Authority to entertain and consider the plea as it was not raised by the rival applicant before Appellate Authority or the High Court at any previous stage of the proceedings. Even in the application for special leave the appellant had not taken such a ground. Therefore, the appellant could not be allowed to contend, at the stage of arguments, that the Appellate Authority and the High Court went wrong in entertaining the plea. [409C-E]
