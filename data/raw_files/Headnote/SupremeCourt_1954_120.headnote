 The appellant company, having its registered office in Calcutta and its factory and laboratory in the District of 24-Parganas in West Bengal, carried on the business of manufacturing and selling sera, vaccines, biological products and medicines. It was registered as a dealer under the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act: Its products having extensive sales throughout India and abroad were despatched from Calcutta against orders accepted by the appellant company in Calcutta. It had no agent or manager in Bihar nor any office or laboratory in that State. A notice under s. 13(5) of the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 194,7 was issued by the Bihar Sales Tax authorities calling upon the appellant company to apply for registration and to submit returns showing its turn over for a period between the 26th of Janu- ary, 1950 and 30th September 1951. The appellant company denied its liability on the grounds inter alia that it was not resident in Bihar, it carried on no business there and none of its sales took place in Bihar. It characterized the notice ' under s. 13(5) as ultra vires and illegal and called upon the Sales Tax authorities to cancel it forth-, with. The Bihar Sales Tax authorities maintained that all sales in West Bengal or in any other State under which goods had been delivered in the State of Bihar as a direct. result of the sale for the purposes of consumption in that State were liable to Bihar Sales Tax. Ultimately the appellant company presented before the High Court ,at Patna a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution claiming the reliefs mentioned above. The High Court dismissed the. petition holding that it was not maintainable. On appeal under a certificate 77 604 under Art. 132(1) of the Constitution:- Held, (per curiam) (i) that the High Court was not right in holding that the petition under Art. 226 was misconceived.
 In so holding the High Court overlooked the fact that the petitioners' contention was that the Act, in so far as it purported to tax a non-resident in respect of inter-State sales or purchases of goods was ultra vires the Constitution. There are various provisions in the Act laying down certain conditions, which dealers must comply with or submit to. They constituted restrictions on the fundamental right guaranteed to every citizen of India by Art. 19(1)(g) of the Constitution and these onerous conditions could not be justified as reasonable restrictions within the meaning of clause (6) of Art. 19 and further the remedy under the Act cannot be said to be adequate and was indeed useless if the Act providing for such remedy was itself ultra vires and void:
 (ii)that there is nothing in the Constitution which prevents the Supreme Court from departing from a previous decision of its own if the court is satisfied of its error and its baneful effect on the general interests of the public.
 
Held, per S. R. DAS, ACTING C. J., VIVIAN BOSE, BHAGWATI and
 JAFER IMAM JJ. (JAGANNADHADAS, VENKATARAMA AYYAR and B. P.
 SINHA JJ., dissenting) that the present is a fib case for reviewing the previous majority decision of the Supreme Court in The State of Bombay v. The United Motors (India) Ltd. ([1953] S.C.R. 1069), in view of several circumstances relating to the case.
 
Held, per S. R. DAS, ACTING 0. J., VIVIAN BOSE, BHAGWATI and
 JAFER. IMAM JJ. (JAGANNADHADAS, VENKATARAMA AYYAR and B.P.
 SINHA JJ., dissenting). The operative provisions of the several parts of Art. 286, namely clause (1)(a), clause (1)(b), clause (2) and clause (3) are intended to deal with different topics and, one cannot be projected or read into another and therefore the Explanation in clause (1) (a) cannot be legitimately extended to clause (2) either as an exception or as a proviso thereto or read as curtailing or limiting the ambit of clause (2).
 The sales or purchases made by the appellant company which were sought to be taxed by the State of Bihar actually took place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce.
 Parliament not having by law otherwise provided, no State law could, therefore, tax these sales or purchases, that is to say, Bihar could not tax by reason of clause (2) although they fell within the Explanation and other States could not tax by reason of both clause (1)(a) read with the Explana- tion and clause (2).
 What is an inter-State sale or purchase continues to be so irrespective of the State where the sale is to be located either under the general law when it is finally determined what the general law is or by the fiction created by the Explanation. The situs of a sale or purchase is wholly irrelevant as regards its inter-State character.
 605 Until Parliament by law made in exercise of the powers vested in it by clause (2) of Art. 286 provides otherwise, no State can impose or authorise the imposition of any tax on sales or purchases of goods when such sales or purchases take place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce and the majority decision in The State of Bombay v. The United Motors (India)Ltd.. ([1953] S.C.R. 1069) in so far as it decides to the contrary cannot be accepted as well founded on principle or authority.
 In view of the above interpretation upon Art. 286 the charging section of the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1947 read with the relevant definitions cannot operate to tax inter-State sales or purchases and as Parliament has not otherwise provided, the Act, in so far as it purports to tax sales or purchases that take place in the course of interState trade or commerce, is unconstitutional, illegal and void.
 The Act imposes tax on subjects divisible in their nature but does not exclude in express terms subjects exempted by the Constitution. In such a situation the Act need not be declared wholly ultra vires and void for it is feasible to separate taxes levied on authorised subjects from those levied on exempted subjects and to exclude the latter in the assessment of the tax.
 Held (per JAGANNADHADAS, VENKATARAMA AYYAR and B. P. SINHA JJ.). The scheme of Art. 286(1)(a) is, that it fixes the situs of the sales with a view to avoid multiple taxation and for that purpose it divides them into two categories- inside sales and outside sales and enacts that a State cannot tax an outside sale. When in the same context the Explanation declares that a sale in the course of inter- State trade must be deemed to have taken place in the State in which the goods are delivered for consumption, its purpose is clearly to take it out of inter-State trade and stamp it with the character of an intrastate sale.
 Whether regard is had to the object of the enactment or its language, the Explanation must be held to authorise the imposition of tax by the delivery State.
 Article 286(2) applies to sales in the course of inter-State trade. The sales which fall within the Explanation are intrastate sales. The grounds covered by this two provisions are distinct and separate. Each has operation within its own sphere, and there is no conflict between them.
 According to the view expressed by Bose J. in The State of Bombay v. The United Motors (India) Ltd. ([1953] S.C.R.
 1069) and by Das J. in State of Travancore-Cochin v.
 Shanmugha Vilas Cashew Nut Factory ([1954] S.C.R. 53) Article 286(2) controls the Explanation. This cannot be sustained on the language of the enactment. The Explanation is not expressed to be subject to Art. 286(2). Nor does the latter contain the words "notwithstanding anything contained in the Explanation to Art. 286(1)(a)". These are simple and familiar expressions used by the legislature when it intends that a particular provision in the Statute should be subject to or override 606 another. Nor is there anything in the language of the explanation providing that its operation is not to be in praesenti but contingent on Parliamentary legislation under Art. 286(2). To construe, therefore, Art. 286(2) as controlling the Explanation, one must import into-the Statute words which are not there and thereby cut down the operation of the Explanation which on its terms is of equal authority and potency with Art. 286(2).
 The impugned Act in so far as it authorises the imposition of tax on sales falling within the Explanation to Art.
 286(1)(a) is neither ultra vires the powers of the State Legislature nor bad on the ground that it is extra- territorial in its operation.
 Per JAGANNADHADAS J. The only reasonable construction of Art. 286(1)(a) taken with the Explanation is that this provision while intended to prohibit taxation by States on outside sales was also meant to demarcate the boundary between inside sales and out., side sales and to assimilate one particular category of outside sales into the field of inside sales and to make it available for taxation by the consuming State.
