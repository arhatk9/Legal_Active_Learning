 The appellant agreed in writing to sell a ginning factory situated in Madhya Pradesh and the agricultural land on which,it stood, to the respondent for a sum off Rs. 43,077.
 The land in question stood entered in the revenue records in the name of the appellant's brother. The respondent made part payment at the time of the execution of the agreement and promised to pay the balance by a fixed date. On the ground that the balance was not paid on the due date, the appellant rescinded the contract and commenced an action in the Court of the District Judge. The defence of the respondent was that he had made arrangements to pay the balance of the agreed amount and had offered to pay it was the appellant who had failed to fulfill his part of the agreement inasmuch as he had not taken steps to get deleted the name of his brother from the revenue records. The trial court decreed the suit but the High Court reversed the decree. The appellant filed the present appeal with certificate. Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD, : The respondent was entitled to rely on the doctrine of part performance in S. 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, and s. 70(8) of the Madhya Pradesh Land Revenue and Tenancy Act, 1950 was not a bar to that defence. Section 70(8) only requires that not only the conditions prescribed by s. 70 but registration of sale deed in accordance with the land of registration for the time being in force is a condition required to be complied with before a sale is deemed valid. There was no sale in the present case and the respondent was not relying on any sale. He was relying upon a contract of sale and the equity for defending his possession against the claim made by the appellant. [858 B- D] There was in the present case a contract to transfer for consideration immovable property by writing signed by the appellant from which the terms necessary to constitute the transfer could be ascertained with reasonable certainty. In part performance of the contract the respondent had taken possession of the property and he had in pursuance thereof paid an amount of Rs. 22,011. The contention raised on behalf of the appellant that the act done in pursuance of the contract must be independent of the terms of the contract could not be accepted. The first three conditions for the defence of part performance to be effectively set up by. the respondent therefore existed. [859 B] The fourth condition in s. 53A-that the transferee has performed or is willing to perform his part of the contract- was also satisfied in the case because:
 855 (i) In considering whether a person is willing to perform his part of the contract the sequence in which the obligations under a contract are to be performed must be taken into account. By virtue of s. 4 of the Transfer of Property Act the chapters and sections of the Transfer of Property Act which relate to contracts are to be taken as part of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. If therefore under the terms of the contract obligations of the parties have to be performed in a certain sequence, one of the parties to the contract cannot require compliance with the obligations by the other party without in the first instance performing his own part of the contract which in the sequence of obligation is performable by him earlier.
 (ii) The appellant had expressly undertaken to have the revenue records rectified by securing the deletion of his brother's name from the revenue records, and it was further an implied condition of the contract that the appellant would secure the sanction of the Collector to the transferor under s. 70(4) of the Madhya Bharat Land Revenue and Tenancy Act, 66 of 1950. The first condition was not fulfilled in due time and the second condition was never fulfilled. The repeat of Act 66 of 1950 by the Madhya Pradesh Land Revenue Code, 1959 did not have retrospective operation.
 (iii) In view of the arrangement made by the respondent it was clear that he had at all relevant times made necessary arrangements for paying the amount due, but so long as the appellant did not carry out his part of the contract the respondent could not be called upon to pay the balance of the price. It must therefore be held that the respondent was at all times ready and willing to carry out his part of th contract. [859 E-H] Motilal & Ors. v. Nanhelal and Anr. LR. 57 I.A. 333, Mrs.
