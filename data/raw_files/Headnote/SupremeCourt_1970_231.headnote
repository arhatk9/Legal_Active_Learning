 The respondent firm sent a parcel containing gold coins which been purchased for Rs. 2465-14-0 by post from Bombay to Bikaner. After adding Rs. 9-1-6 for insurance and profit at 1% the value came, according to the respondent, to Rs. 2499-11-6. The parcel was insured for the round figure of Rs. 2500. When it was lost in transit the respondent filed a suit 'for Rs. 2474-15-6 to be paid by the Union of India represented by its posal department. The Union of India resisted the claim on the ground what under s. 6 of the Indian Post Office Act, 1898 read with r. 81 (g) made thereunder the liability to pay compensation could arise only if the plaintiff had declared the actual value of the contents on the date of the insurance. It was pointed out that in the present case neither the admitted purchase price of the coins nor the claim in the plaint amounted to Rs.
 2500 and thus there was a discrepancy between the value declared and the actual or market value of the goods. The contract was therefore not enforceable. The Single Judge as well as the Full Bench of the Court of Small Causes accepted the argument on behalf of the Union of India. However, the High Court took the view that the burden of proving that the market ,value of the gold on the day of posting was different from the value declared was on the insurer which in the present case the insurer had failed to discharge.
 The Union of India, by special leave, appealed to this Court.
 
HELD: The statutory provisions of the Act and the rules have to be construed and read in a reasonable manner. The rules seem to ensure that the insured should not make a declaration in excess of the market value so as to avoid frauduent dealings. Nor can the insured get more compe nsation than the market value. But this does not and cannot mean that any innocent and insignificant misstatement by the insured of the actual value which has to be the market value on a particular date and at the place of posting can lead to the startling result that he becomes wholly disentitled to receive any compensation. The market in articles like gold and bullion exists only in large towns and the value fluctuates from day to day and from hour to hour. it may be sometimes impossible for any person sending gold or bullion by,post after getting it insured to ascertain the exact value on a particular date. This does not mean that he is completely absolved from the responsibility of ascertaining it but if he gives a value which is approximately the same as the market value the insurer cannot take up the position that owing to an insignificant difference the insured cannot recover the compensation. [709 F-710 B] In the present case the High Court found that no evidence of any kind regarding the market rate of gold prevailing on the date of posting was on record. On general principles which were rightly relied on by the High 707 court, it was for insurer to lead evidence On that point and show that according to the market rate prevailing on that date the value could not be Rs. 2500. The mere fact that the respondent was under the impression or had stated in the plaint that value of the gold was less than Rs. 2500 was not sufficient to absolve the insurer from proving that the value which was declared Rs. 2500 was not the market value on the date and at the place of posting. The appeal must accordingly be dismissed. [710 C-E]
