 The appellant was a public limited company carrying on banking business. For the calendar year 1958, which was the previous year relating to the assessment year 1959-60, the appellant claimed allowance by way of development rebate under proviso (b) of s. 10(2) (vi) (b) amounting to Rs.
 1,37,836 in the computation of its business income. The admitted facts of the case were that during the accounting year the appellant had transferred a sum of Rs. 6 lakhs from the profit and loss account to the reserve fund; this was sufficient to meet the requirements of S. 17 of the Banking Companies Act, 1949 as well as of proviso (b) to s. 10(2) (vi) (b) of the Income-tax Act, 1922; but no separate reserve fund as required by proviso (b) to s. 10(2) (vi)(b) had been created. It was contended by the appellant that as the transfer to the reserve was sufficient to meet the requirements of s. 17 of the Banking Companies Act, 1949 as well as proviso (b) to s. 10(2) (vi-b) of the Act, in substance, if not in form, it had complied with the requirements of law and therefore it was entitled to the allowance claimed. The assessing authorities as well as the High Court, upon a reference, held against the appellant.
 On appeal to this Court.
 
HELD : The High Court had rightly held that the appellant, was not entitled to the, allowance by way of development rebate claimed. [350 A-B] The creation of reserve contemplated by proviso (b) to Explanation (2) to s. 10(2)(vi-b) is a condition precedent for obtaining the allowance of development rebate. The appellant had admittedly not created any such separate reserve. [350 D] The reserve contemplated by s. 17 of the Banking Companies Act, 1949 is a separate reserve. The amount transferred to that reserve cannot be utilised for business purposes. The reserve contemplated by proviso (b) to s. 10(2)(vi-b) of the Act is an independent reserve. The amount to be transferred to that reserve is debited before the profit and loss account is made up. That amount is required to be credited to a reserve account to be utilised by the assessee during a period of ten years for the purposes of the business of the undertaking. The nature of the two reserves are different.
 They are intended to serve two different purposes. [350 E-H] C.I.T. v. Veeraswami Nainar and Ors., 55, I.T.R. 35;
