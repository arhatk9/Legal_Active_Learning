 The respondent entered into the service of the appellants December 9, 1961 at a monthly salary of Rs., 400. On April 30, 1962 she was given notice of termination of her services. She thereupon raised an industrial dispute which was referred by the Government of Orissa to Industrial Tribunal, The respondent alleged before the Tribunal that the termination of her services was improper, mala fide and an act of victimisation. The case of the appellant was that the respondent had been appointed on Probation for six months, and her work having been found unsatisfactory she had been -discharged in terms of the contract. the Tribunal held that the termination of the respondent's services was mala fide and awarded her two Years salary, namely Rs. 9,600 as Compensation. In appeal to this court on behalf of the management by special leave.
 
HELD : (i) If the discharge of an employee hag been ordered by the management in bona fide exercise of its power, the Industrial Tribunal will not interfere with it, but it is open to the Industrial Tribunal to consider whether the order of termination is mala fide of whether it amounts to victimisation of the employee or an unfair labour practice or is so capricious or unreasonable as could lead to -the inference that it had been passed for ulterior motives and not in bona fide exercise of the power arising out of the contract. In such a case it is open to the Tribunal to interfere with the order of the management and to afford proper relief to the employee. [437 C-E] (ii) The respondent could not be said to have been discharged in the .terms of the contract. There was no Standing Order of the company with regard to punishment for misconduct. In the absence of any Standing Order the unsatisfactory work of an employee may be treated as misconduct. When the management discharged -the respondent for alleged unsatisfactory work it should be taken that the discharge was -tantamount to punishment for alleged misconduct. If this was so, the management was not justified in discharging the respondent without holding Proper enquiry. Even before the Labour court no evidence was adduced by the management to show that the work of the respondent was. unsatisfactory. In these circumstances the discharge of the respondent was mala fide and she was entitled to compensation. [437 F-H] (iii) There were no special circumstances in the case to justify the ,award of two Years' salary as Compensation. It was sufficient to award :Rs. 4,800. [439- A]
