 The respondent who was the landlord of certain premises in Surat, filed a suit for the eviction of the petitioners, who were the tenants, on the ground of non payment of rent.
 The petitioners filed a written statement in which they raised a dispute regarding the standard rent, and also con- tended that they had raised such a dispute, within the time allowed by law that is, one month of service of the suit notice., The trial court as well as the appellate court found that a dispute regarding standard rent was not raised within one month of service of the suit notice and held, following a decision of the Gujarat High Court, that the respondent was entitled to recover possession under s.
 12(3)(a) of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates (Control) Act, 1947. The High Court of Gujarat also rejected the petitioners' revision petition. Thereupon, the petitioners filed an application in this Court, for special leave, contending that the High Court of Bombay had held that it was sufficient if the dispute regarding standard rent was raised in the written statement, and that, in such a case eviction could not be ordered under s. 12(3) (a); and since there was a direct conflict between the High Courts of Gujarat and Bombay an important question of law relating to the scope and applicability of s. 12(3) (a) arose. This Court granted special leave and stay.
 The respondent filed an application for revocation of the grant of special leave on the ground that the averments in the special leave petition gave the impression that the attention of the Gujarat High Court was drawn to the decision of the Bombay High Court, while in fact, it was not so, and that therefore the petitioners had misled this Court.
 
HELD: Assuming that the grounds in the special leave application gave the impression that the attention of Gujarat High Court was drawn to the decision of the Bombay High Court, it could not be stated that there was any misstatement or untrue averment in the grounds. The contention raised was a legal contention, and there was no other manner in which a party could draw the attention of this Court to the conflict between the two High Courts.
 [405E-G].
 It is but proper that if a party wants to have a particular legal position settled in a High Court, reconsidered on the basis of a different view taken by another High Court, he should draw the attention of the High Court, when the question is raised, to the conflicting decisions. Even if he has omitted to do so it cannot be said that when the correctness of the judgment so given, is concerned before this Court he should not be allowed to challenge the decision on the ground that another High Court has taken a different view. Such A ground on a legal point should not be confused 398 or mixed up with averments regarding material facts or matters of importance. [405G-H; 406A-C].
 The statements in the special leave petition could not be considered to be untrue or false on material facts or matters of importance, and therefore, the prayer for revoking the special leave would have to be rejected.
