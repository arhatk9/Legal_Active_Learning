 Respondent Laloo and three others were charged, convicted, and sentenced to death for the commission of the offence of murder under section 302 IPC read with section 34 IPC of the deceased Babu Jaleshwar Singh under bright moonlight and at about 8 p.m. On 24.9.1974, while he was accompanied by the three eye witnesses, Ram Surat (PW 1), Subhan Sain (PW 2), Bansidhar (PW 3). The prosecution case was; (a) that there was a long standing enmity between the accused and the deceased Jaleshwar Singh who was a leading land owner and agriculturist of Mangalpura and the Pradhan of that village for over 18 or 20 years before the date of occurrence; (ii) that the deceased had stated in his complaint Ex. KA-13 dated 14.2.1973 that the accused and the one Chandrika Mallah were planning to kill him due to election and litigation enmity and were collecting money for that purpose amongst themselves; (iii) that the accused and others had moved two complaints for the removal of the deceased as Pradhan of Mangalpura; that while the first complaint had been rejected by the Sub-divisional Officer, Ballia on 10.5.1974, the second 544 complaint was pending enquiry before that Officer at the time of his death and factually the deceased accompanied by PWs 1 to 3 was returning after attending the case posted on that day; (iv) that while they were returning, at the end of the Moonj jungle situate about 1-1/2 furlongs away from Mangalpura village the accused respondents attacked the deceased with the tamancha (country-made pistol) and daos (long heavy knives used for slaughtering goats and cutting wood); (v) that it was Lalloo who fired with his tamancha and the deceased fell down after receiving injury on his chest and on his exhortion to severe his neck the others Ganga Dayal Gond, Sri Kishun Chamar and Jagan Nath Godaria pounced upon the deceased and cut the neck; (vi) that when PWs 1 to 3 shouted in disapproval of what the respondents were doing, Lalloo pointed his tamancha towards them and threatened to kill them and getting frightened they ran towards Gosainpur and after informing Ayodhaya and Sheo that the respondents had attacked the deceased they rushed to Mangalpura where they met Kharag Bahadur (PW 6) and others and informed them also about the attack on the deceased by the respondents accused; (vii) that the first information report was written by Raghubans Tiwari (PW 16) of Mangalpura with the particulars furnished by PW 1 at the spot at about 9 p.m. On 24.9.74, and later handed over by PW 1 at Bansidh Police Station, PW 15; (viii) that PW 15 left the police station along with PW 1 and others for the scene of occurrence at 1.30 a.m. On 25.9.74 and began his investigation at the spot at 4 a.m.; (ix) that the headless body was identified to be that of the deceased Jaleshwar Singh by PWs 1,3,6 and 16 and Bachchalal (PW 5) - all of whom belonged to Mangalpura; (x) that autopsy on the body bf the deceased disclosed, incised wound severing the neck completely, multiple gun shot wounds on the upper part of the front chest, and abraded contusions over the upper part of the hip; and (xi) that the doctor opined that death was due to severence of the neck by a sharp-edged and heavy cutting weapon and that the injury to the neck was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.
 For coming to the conclusion as to conviction and sentence, the Trial Court accepted the evidence of PWs 1 to 3 who were Examined as eye witnesses and also the evidence of PW 5 and 6 and relied upon the First Information Report given by PW 
1. But on appeal, the Learned Judges of the High Court suspected the genuineness of the First Information Report as being that of PW 1 for the reason that it was quite long and contained all the details, rejected the evidence of PWs 1 to 3 about the occurrence and acquitted the respondents, although they found that the 545 factum of the occurrence of the crime, the prosecution case with A regard to its time and the weapons used in the assault fully corroborated by medical evidence while the recovery of blood fixed the venue of the crime. Hence the appeal by the state.
 Allowing the appeal and while confirming their convictions, the Court altered the sentence of death passed on them to that of K imprisonment and ^ 
HELD: 1.1 A thorough and careful analysis of the evidence on record shows that the evidence of PWs 1 to 3 are true and reliable and that they were present at the scene and at the time of the commission of the offence. And this is not a case where two views of the evidence available on record are possible. [555 D-F] 
 1.2 It cannot be said that if there are ten pieces of circumstantial evidence in a case, an inference that the investigating officer did not have honest belief in the truth of the proceedings nine pieces of circumstantial evidence, merely because he had brought on record even the tenth piece of circumstantial evidence. [551 E-F] 
 1.3 Exhibit Ka-1 is the only first information report in the case and that it was scribed by PW 16 at the spot on the basis of particulars furnished by P.W. 1 at 9 p.m. and handed over by P.W.1 at the police station at about 11.30 p.m. On the same day and that only after a case had been registered on the basis of that first information report, P.W.15 left the police station along with P.W.1 and others at 1.30 a.m. On 25.9.1974 and reached the scene of occurrence at 4 a.m. To contend that PW 1 is not the author of the first information report and it was recorded at the police station at 11 a.m. On 25.9.1974 on the evidence of P.W.16 who is a self-condemned witness who had been treated as hostile to the prosecution will not only be inconsistent but also incorrect. If it had been recorded only at that time it is improbable that copies thereof would have been delivered by PW 14 to the higher authorities in the morning of 25.9.1974. [553 B,D] 
 1.4 No adverse inference can be drawn from the cross- examination of PW 15 to the effect that the first parcha of the case diary which is dated 25.9.1974 bears the signature of the Deputy Superintendent of police and endorsement of his office has made on 28.9.1974 and without the seal of that office. That there was delay in the receipt of the copies of relevant records from the 546 police station in the office of the Superintendent of Police though even according to the evidence of PW 16 which is unreliable the first information report was in existence at least at 11 a.m. On 25.9.1974 is incorrect. [552 G-H, 553 A- B] 
 1.5 The facts that P.W.1 was seen by PW 6 soon after the occurrence, and he got the first information report scribed by PW 16 at 9 p.m. On 24.9.74 itself and handed it over at the police station at 11.30 p.m. On the same day and accompanied PW 15 from the police station to the scene of occurrence at 1.30 a.m. On 25.9.74 probablise the evidence of PW 1 that he had gone to Ballia on 24.9.74 and left that place for Mangalpura by a bus along with the deceased. [553 G-H, 554 A B] 
 1.6 The name of PW 1 not finding a place in the order sheet of the Trial Court at Ballia is not a sure base for holding that he could not have gone to Ballia on 24.9.1974.
 Equally the evidence of PW 2 to the effect that much jungle falls in the first route and therefore people go by that route only during the day time while the second route which is plain is normally taken by the commutors during night is convincing. The High Court failed to take note of the fact that it was night time and PW 2 would have had the company of the deceased and PW8 1 and 3. Further the examination of PW 15 at Mangalpura by PW 1 to 3 on 25.9.1974 itself also probablises their presence and witnessing the occurrence of the crime. PW 1 alone belongs to Mangalpura while PWs 2 and 3 belongs to different villages. PWs 2 and 3 are independent witnesses and PW 1 is a respectable witness as he is a member of the Gram Sabha and President of the Co-operative Society, though admittedly he was the pairokar of the deceased in the case for which he had gone to Ballia on 24.9.1974 which has a little importance.
