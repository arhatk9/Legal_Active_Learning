 The undertaking and business of the assessee-company were taken over by the Government and the assessee was paid compensation. The assessee submitted a return', claiming that it had earned no income from its business, since it was taken over by the Government. The Income-tax Officer brought to tax a certain sum, disclosed by the assessee's audited accounts as its taxable business income during that part of the year before it closed the business. This order was upheld by the Assistant Commissioner and the Appellate Tribunal with certain reduction in the amount. On reference the High Court answered the question against the Revenue.
 In appeal to this Court :- HELD : The assessee was liable to be taxed.
 Under S. 10(1) of the Income-tax Act, tax is payable by an assessee under the head "Profits and gains of business, profession or vocation" in respect of profits or gains of any business, profession or vocation carried on by him.
 There is nothing in the Act which supports the assessee's argument that for profits of the business to be taxable, the business must be actively carried on for the whole of the previous year, or till the end of the previous year. Under the scheme of the Act, whenever an assessee receives in the course of his business money or money's worth, income embedded therein accrues or arises to him, and becomes subject to an ambulatory charge. If at the end of the previous year, on making lip accounts there is nooverall income, the charge does not crystallize, because there is no incomeon which the charge of tax may settle.

 Commissioner of Income-tax, Gujarat v. Ashokbhai Chimanhhai [1964] INSC 227; [1965] 1 S.C.R. 758. explained.
 The Department was not seeking to tax either the whole or any part of the compensation received by the assessee and the discussion as to what the compensation received by assessee was intended to replace was not relevant in determining whether the profits which accrued or arose to the assessee prior to its closure of the business.
