 In response to a notice dated 3rd April 1948, under s. 34 of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, the assessee submitted returns for the assessment years 1944-45 and 1945-46. The Income-tax Officer dropped proceedings for the former year and determined the net taxable income for the latter year.
 The see appealed first to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and then to the Appellate Tribunal. The Tribunal allowed the appeal in part, held that a portion of the profit determined was assessable in the assessment year 1944-45 and observed, that the Income-tax Officer was at liberty to take appropriate action. The Income-tax Officer again issued a notice under s. 34 after obtaining the sanction of the Commissioner, as required by the Amending Act 48 of 1948 (passed on 8th September 1948, but made retrospective from 30th March 1948), in respect of the assessment year 1944-45. He brought to tax, the amount determined by the Tribunal as the profit of the year. The assessee's appeals to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the Appellate Tribunal were unsuccessful. The High Court, on a reference, held in favour of the assessee holding that the; reassessment under s. 34 for the year 1944-45 was not valid. The Commissioner appealed to the Supreme Court.
 
HELD : The first return submitted by the assessee was a valid return under s. 22(3). The Department could not therefore, ignore it and issue notice under s. 34 on the assumption that there had been an omission or failure on the part of the assessee to make a return under s. 22. [884 B-C;
 887 C] Section 22(3) permits an assessee to furnish a return at any time before the assessment is made, that is, before the time mentioned in s. 34(3). It need not be a voluntary return in the sense that it must be suo motu. If the first notice under s. 34 was held to be bad because the Commissioner'& sanction was not obtained as required by the amendment of 1948, it did not follow that a return made in pursuance of it must also be treated as bad. If a return otherwise valid is filed by an assessee before the receipt of a valid notice under s. 34, it has to be treated as a valid return within s. 22(3).
