 The petitioners were detained under the Act for acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community. In the one case, the ground of detention was that the petitioner in collusion with his father had hoarded foodgrains, that he had no licence as required by the anti-hoarding control Order and that he was likely to withheld or impede supply of foodstuffs or rationed articles essential to the community.
 In the other case, the grounds were that the petitioner and his associates had smuggled 115 bags of rice covered by coal by engaging lorry without any valid permit or authority and in violation of control order and tried to frustrate the food and procurement policy of the Govt. and thus acted in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies and services Annual to the community. The petitioners challenged the respective orders of detention as having been made for a collateral purpose and contended that The Act was violative of Articles 14, 19, 21 and 22 of the Constitution of India. Dismissing the Writ petitions, 
HELD : (1) Article 14 is inapplicable because preventive detention and Prosecution are not synonymous. The purposes are different. The authorities are different. The nature of proceedings is different. In a prosecution an accused is sought to be punished for a past act. In preventive detention, the past act is merely the material for inference about the future course of probable conduct on the part of the detenu. [787H] The principles which can be broadly stated are these.
 First, merely because a detenu is liable to be tried in a criminal court for the commission of a criminal offence or to be proceeded against for preventing him front committing offences dealt with in Chapter VIII of the Code of Criminal Procedure would not by itself debar the Govt. from taking action for his detention under the Act. Second, the fact that Police arrests a person and later on enfargs him on bail and initiates steps to prosecute him under the Code of Criminal Procedure and even lodges a first information report may be no bar against the District Magistrate issuing an order under the preventive detention. Third, where the concerned person is actually in jail custody at the time when an order of detention is passed against him and is not likely to be released for a fair length of time, it may be possible to contend that there could be no satisfaction on the part of the detaining authority as to the likelihood of such a person indulging in activities which would jeopardise the security of the State or public order. Fourth, the mere circumstance that a detention order is passed during the pendency of the prosecution will not violate the order.
 Fifth, the order of detention is a precautionay measure. It is based on a reasonable prognosis of the future behaviour of a person based on his past conduct in the light of the surrounding circumstances. [788B-F] 779 Borjahan Gorey v.

 (ii) The Constitution has conferred rights under Art. 19 and also adopted preventive detention to prevent the greater evil of elements imperilling the security, the safety of a State and the welfare of the nation. It is not possible to think that a person who is detained will yet be free to move or assemble or form associations or unions or have the right to reside in any part of India or have the freedom of speech or expression. A law which attracts Art. 19 therefore must be such as is capable of being tested to be reasonable under clauses (2) to (5) of Art. 19. [784C-E] On the assumption that the Act which is for preventive detention, may be tested with regard to its reasonableness with reference to Art. 19, Sec. 3 of the Art is to be interpreted in the light of various existing statutes which deal with various acts mentioned in Section 3. The section provides for the detention of persons to prevent likely acts of come or acts which fall within its ambit. [785A-D] A. K. Gopalan v. The State of Madras, [1950] INSC 14; 1950 SCR 88 and Rustom Cavasjee Cooper etc. v. Union of India & other (Bank Nationalization case) [1970] INSC 18; (1970) 3 SCR 530 referred to.
 It is an established rule of this Court that a detenu has a right to be apprised of all the materials on which the order of detention is based or approved. The only exception is as provided in clauses (6) and (8) of Art. 22 where it is not necessary to disclose facts which may be against the public interest to disclose. [785D-E] Procedural reasonableness flows from Art. 19. Principles of natural justice are an element in considering the reasonableness of a restriction where Art. 19 is applicable.
 There is an obligation on the State and the Advisory Board to consider the representation of a detenu. There should be a real and proper consideration. The duty to consider the representation does not mean a personal hearing or the disclosure of reasons. There cannot be any abstract stan- dard or general pattern of procedural reasonableness. The nature of the right infringed, the underlying purpose of the restrictions imposed, the extent and Urgency of the evil sought to be remedied thereby the disproportion of the imposition, the prevailing conditions at the time, all provide the basis for considering the reasonableness of a particular provision. Fairness denotes abstention from abuse of discretion. Even if Art. 19 be examined in regard to preventive detention it does not increase the content of reasonableness required to be observed in respect of orders of preventive detention. [786E-H] (ii) Art 22(5) speaks of liberty and making a representation. The combined result of clause (4), (5) & (6) of Art. 22 is that a procedure which permits representation will give all the facts before the Board.
 Art. 22(5) shows that the law as to detention is necessary.
 The requirements of that law are to be found in Art. 22 which gives the mandate as to what will happen in such circumstances. The Article lays down substantive limitations as well as procedural safeguards. The principles of natural justice in so far as they are compatible with detention laws find place in Art. 22 itself and also in the Act. [785H-786B; 787D-E] Section 8 of the Act which casts an obligation on the State to consider the representation affords the detenu all the rights which are guaranteed by Art 780 22(5). The section is in complete conformity With Art.
 22(5) because it follows the provisions of the Constitution.
 The Govt. considers the representation to ascertain essentialy whether the order is in conformity with the power Linder the law. The Board. on the other hand, considers whether in the light of ,he representation there is sufficient cause for detention. [785G; 786H-787B] Sec. 14 of the Act clothes the authority with the power of revoking or modifying the detention order at any time. Such a power which is for the benefit of the detenu carries with it the duty to exercise that power whenever and as soon as changed or new factors call for the exercise of that power.
 This shows that the authorities can consider new facts or changed circumstances. [785C-D] Fagu Shaw v. State of West Bengal [1973] INSC 251; AIR 1974 S.C. 613 referred to.
 For the foregoing reasons, the Act does not suffer from any constitutional infirmity. [788F]
