 An electricity undertaking was purchased by M (respondent No. 1 herein) and by a notification of the Bihar Government dated 13-4-1945 he was made the sole licensee. A partnership of five persons formed to purchase and run the said undertaking was in 1950 enlarged to consist of ten partners, P, who held a one-anna share in the partnership filed a suit in 1954 for dissolution of the partnership and rendition of accounts, impleading as defendants the other nine partners including M., He also impleaded as Defendant No. 10 T to whom he had allegedly sold 3 pies share,out of his one-anna share. J and his two brothers share in P's one-anna share in the partnership. According to them Ps share was held on behalf of a Hindu joint Family of which they had been members. They challenged the alleged transfer of 3 pies share to T. The trial court impleaded and his brothers at Defendants 12 to 14. M consisted P's suit by claiming that he was the sole or proprietor and licensee of the concern, that the alleged partnership was in contra- vention of the Electricity Act and invalid, so that the plaintiff and the other defendants had no lawful claim to the assets of the partnership. The suit Was decreed and Defendants 12 to 14 were held entitled to a 6 pies share.
 M's own separate suit for a declaration that he was sole proprietor was dismissed by, the Court. M filed appeals against the decision in both the suits. The High Court allowed his appeals and held the partnership to be illegal and M to be the sole proprietor of the concern. The present appellants filed appeal, in this Court. J and his brothers were impleaded in the appeal arising out of P's suit. But after J's death in 1969 his legal representatives were not impleaded by the appellants within the period of limitation.
 M contended that the appeals had abated, not only against J but as a whole.
 
HELD: Per Vaidialingam and Palekar JJ :-The appeals could not be proceeded with and must be dismissed.
 As pointed out by this Court in Nathu Ram's case it is' not correct to say that the appeal abates against the other respondents. Under certain circumstances the appeal may not be proceeded with and is liable to be dismissed. But that is not because of the procedural defect but, as Mulla has pointed out, it is part of the, substantive law. No exhaustive statement can be made as to the circumstances under which an appeal in such cases cannot proceed. But the courts, as pointed out in the above decision, have applied one or the other of three tests. The Court will' not proceed with an appeal (1) when the success of the appeal may lead to the court's coming to a decision which will be contradictory to the decree which had become final with respect to the same subject matter between the appellant and the deceased respondent (2) when the appellant could not have brought the action for the necessary relief against those respondents alone who are still before the Court and (3) when the 64 decree against the surviving respondents, if the appeal succeeds, be ineffective that is to say it could not be successfully executed. These three tests as pointed out by this Court in Pandit Sri Chand's case are not cumulative tests. Even if one of them is satisfied the Court may dismiss the appeal. [69C-F] The Slate of Punjab v. Nathu Ram [1961] INSC 203; [1962] 2 S.C.R., 636, applied. Ors.[1966] INSC 34; , [1966] 3 S.C.R. 451 at 455, referred to.
 At the time of filing his suit P was no longer the Karla of the family and could not represent the interest of Defendants 12 to 14. When in the suit Defendents 12 to 14 were made parties and after contest between them and P their share had been awarded to them as against P, it would be idle to say, as was contended on behalf of the appellants that for the purposes of the appeals Defendants 12 to 14 would not be necessary parties. In the present appeals the Court had to proceed on the footing that J had been declared to have a share in the partnership assets in his own right.
 It is settled law that a suit brought for partnership accounts after a necessary party defendant has been omitted, is liable to be dismissed. The same consideration applies to an appeal arising out of a-suit for dissolution of partnership and accounts. Having regard to the clear position of law in this respect the failure to bring on record the heirs or legal representatives of deceased J-one of the sharers in the subject matter of the suit-must inevitably lead to the dismissal of the appeal. That bring the case squarely in the second test referred to in the decision of this Court in Nathu Ram's case. [71D; 72E; 73B;
 D-E; 74C] Ramdoyal v. Junmenjoy Coondoo, I.L.R. 14, Cal. 791, Amir Chand v. Baoji Bhai, A.I.R. 1930 Madras 714, Rai Chander Sen v. Gangadas Seal and others, 31 Indian Appeals 71 and Kunj Behari Lal v. Ajodhia Prasad, XXI I.L.R. Lucknow 453, referred to.
 In all such cases even the first test would be satisfied.
 There is a High Court decree which says that neither J nor anybody else was entitled to a share in the subject matter as against M who is held to be the sole proprietor of the business. If the present appellants were to succeed it would lead to the Court's coming to a decision. That the deceased J was entitled, to a share in the subject matter of the 'suit as against M and the other alleged partners-a decision which would be in conflict with the decision of the High Court and will be contradictory to it though it has become final with respect to the subject matter between M and the deceased respondent. [74D-E] Per Mathew J., (dissenting)- It was a fallacy to think that if, these appeals were allowed the only course open to this Court would be to pass a decree reversing the decree of the trial court which gave a share to J. This Court can very well pass an effective decree for dissolution of the partnership and declare the shares to which the partners are entitled in the partnership, leaving the legal representative of J and defendants 12 to 14 to a separate suit to work out their rights in the one anna share of P. Under Order 41 rule 33 of the Code of Civil Procedure this Court, as appellate Court, has power to pass any decree or make any order as the case may require The case therefore did not satisfy the first test mentioned in Nathu Ram's case. [79E-G] 65 It is settled law that when the manager of a joint family becomes partner in a firm the other members of the family do not thereby become partners therein although they might have interest in his share in the partnership. The appellants could have brought an action for dissolution of partnership and for rendition of accounts and obtained an effective decree without J on the array of parties Defendants 12 to 14 had no right to a share in the partnership assets. It was the one anna share of P that was divided between them and P.
 That understanding must precede the process of judging whether J was a necessary party to the suit or to these appeals. Looked at in this manner the second test in Nathu Ram's case was also not satisfied in this case. [80A-81B] Apart from the above consideration there was no abatement of the present appeals in view of the decision of this Court in Mahabir Prasad's case. [81C] Mahabir Prasad v, Jage Ram and Others. [1971] INSC 3; [1971] 1 S.C.C. 265, applied.
