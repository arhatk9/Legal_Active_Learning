 Consequent to the re-structuring of the Assam Rifles Force in 1962 a separate Unit known as Central Record and Pay Accounts Office (C.R. and P.A.O.) was created at the Headquarters of the force. Pursuant to the recommendation of the Third Central Pay Commission the staff at the Headquar- ters were given higher pay scales than those attached to the Battalions/Units.
 The Petitioners sought parity in emoluments with their counterparts working at the Headquarters by filing a peti- tion before the Central Administrative Tribunal contending that; (i) the C.R. and P.A.O. Unit situated at the Headquar- ters was not a part of the Headquarters establishment but was a separate Unit; and (ii) there is no difference either in the nature of work and duties of the two or in their qualifications and that the services of the staff at the Units/Battalions are transferrable to the Headquarters. The Tribunal rejected the claim of the petitioner holding that the C.R. and P.A.O. is a different unit and not a part of the establishment of the Headquarters and its staff are enjoying the scale of pay allowed to the staff of the Head- quarters since its inception. Hence this appeal.
 Allowing the appeal, this Court, 
 HELD: 1. There is a contradiction between the finding recorded by the Tribunal that the C.R. and P.A.O. at the Headquarters is quite a "distinct" establishment from the range Headquarters/Battalions, and the justification made by it of the higher emoluments of the staff at the Headquarters on the ground that they are enjoying the same as allowed to the other staff of the Headquarters since its inception.
 [731C-D] 1.1. If the C.R. and P.A.O. at the Headquarters is a differ- ent 728 unit and not a part of the Headquarters, then the staff attached to the office at the Headquarters is not entitled to emoluments higher than those drawn by the staff of the Units/Battalions. [731D] 
 2. The payment of higher emoluments to the said staff merely on the ground that the establishment is at the place where the Headquarters is situated, is discriminatory as against the staff at the Units/ Battalions since it is no way different from the other Units. [731E] [Matter remanded to the Tribunal for recording a finding on (i) whether the qualifications for appointment at the two establishments viz. C.R. and P.A.O. at the Headquarters and the Units are different, (ii) whether the nature of the duties and responsibilities of the Ministerial staff at the Headquarters is of a higher order than that of those at the Units/Battalions, and (iii) whether transfer of the staff from the Units/ Battalions to the Headquarters was done arbitrarily and without applying any test.
