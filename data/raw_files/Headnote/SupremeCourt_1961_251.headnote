 One K filed an application for the grant of letters of administration with the will attached. This will gave the entire property to K, a distant relation of the testator, subject to K maintaining the testator's widow and sister;
 other relations including the testator's daughter were completely left out. There were other suspicious circumstances surrounding the will viz., that the testator's signatures were not his usual signatures and were not in the same ink as the rest of the will and that the testator used to sign blank papers for use in his cases in court and used to send them to his lawyer through his servants. The will was later registered without the testator appearing before the sub-registrar and the sub-registrar only sending his clerk to the residence of the testator for the purpose. Out of 16 persons who signed the will as attesting witnesses only 4 were produced to prove the will. The trial court held that the will was duly executed and attested and ordered the issue of letters of administration with the will annexed to K. 'On appeal the High Co t affirmed the order of the trial court holding that the suspicious circumstances were dispelled by the registration of the will.
 Held, that the due execution and attestation of the will were not proved. In view of the suspicious circumstances it was the duty of the propounder of the will to prove due execution and attestation by satisfactory evidence which would lead the court to the conclusion that the suspicious circumstances had been dispelled. This he had failed to do.
 The four attesting witnesses produced were interested and unreliable; none of the independent witnesses who bad signed the will were produced. The mere fact that the will was registered was not by itself sufficient to dispel the suspicions without scrutiny of the evidence of registration.
 Registration would dispel the doubt as to the genuineness of the will only if it was made in such a manner that it was brought home to the testator that the document of which he was admitting execution was a will disposing of his property and the testator thereafter admitted its execution and signed in token thereof. In the present case, the regis- tration was done in a perfunctory manner and the evidence did not establish that the testator knew that the document the 196 execution of which he admitted before the sub-registrar's clerk was his will. The witnesses produced to prove registration, even if they are treated as attesting witnesses, failed to prove due execution and attestation of the will.
