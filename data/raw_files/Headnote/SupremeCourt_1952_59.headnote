 The petitioner was served with an order of detention on the 20th October, 1951, and, after a reference to the Advisory Board, the Government confirmed the detention and specified 31st March, 1952, as the date up to which the detention was to continue, On the 20th March, 1952, the detention was extended till the 30th September, 1952, and on the 22nd September, 1952, the detention was again extended up to the 31st December, 1952. It was contended on behalf of the petitioner that the Government bad no power on 22nd September, 1952, to extend the detention beyond the 1st October, 1952, as the Preventive Detention (Second Amend- ment) Act of 1952, even though it had received the assent of the 117 906 President in August 1952, came into force only on the 30th September, 1952 :
 Held, (i) that the order extending the period of detention made on the 22nd September could not be justified under the provisions of s. 22 of the General Clauses Act, 1897; the word " order" in the said section means an order laying down directions about the manner in which things are to be done under the Act and the section does not mean that a substantive order against a particular person can be made under a provision of an Act before that Act has come into force.
 (ii) The words "the order" in s. 11-A of the Preventive De- tention (Second Amendment) Act, 1952, do not refer to the initial detention order, as no period of detention could legally be specified in that order, but to the order of detention as eventually confirmed under s. 11(1) of the Act and the detention of the petitioner could not therefore be treated as automatically extended up to the 1st April, 1953, -Under the provisions of s. 11-A by reason of the fact that in the initial order for the detention of the petitioner no period of detention had been specified.
 (iii) The detention of the petitioner could not continue after the 30th September, 1952, by force of the provisions of s. 11-A(2) of the Preventive Detention (Second Amendment) Act, 1952, merely because the date on which the petitioner's detention was to expire, namely, the 30th September, 1952, happened by accident or coincidence to be identical with the date on which the first Amendment Act (Act XXXIV of 1952) was to expire, for s. 11 - A(2) merely provides that if a shorter period is specified in the order, the detenu would be entitled to be released.
 (iv) The expression "shorter period" in s. 11-A (2) means a period which does not extend up to the 1st April, 1953, or Lip to the end of the period of 12 months mentioned in the section and does not mean a period ending before the 30th September, 1952.
 (v) The detention of the petitioner after the 30th September, 1952, was therefore illegal.
