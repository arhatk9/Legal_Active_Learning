 In December, 1968 the respondent applied for an import licence for importing stainless steel for the licensing period 1968-69. The registration certificate certified that he was engaged in the manufacture of hospital and surgical instruments and household utensils of stainless steel. Ac- cording to the import policy for 1968-69 no priority was available for household utensils. Since the number of applicants for import licences for stainless steel, which was a sensitive item, was very large instructions were issued in January 1969 that the applications should be scrutinised carefully after asking for information from applicants as to details of end products to be manufactured by an applicant. In May 1969 the respondent stated that the hospital requisites intended to be manufactured by him were surgical bowls, spittoons and trays. The Chief Controller, Imports and Exports. issued instructions that only 'medical and surgical equipment and appliances' should have priority and not other types of hospital equipment such as bowls, trays, jugs etc. In April 1970, after a review of the situation the Chief Controller issued instructions to consi- der the respondent's application in terms of the licensing policy for 1970-71.
 The respondent filed an application for the issue of a writ of mandamus and the High Court allowed it directing that the respondent's application may be dealt with in terms of the 1968-69 import policy.
 In appeal, on the question whether the application should be considered in accordance with the policy in force when the licence was granted or when the application was made.
 
HELD : No case had been made out for a mandamus to consider the respondent's application in terms of 1968-69 policy, since there was no undue leaches or delay in dealing with the respondent's application. and the instructions of the Chief Controller to consider the application in terms of 1970-71 policy was in accordance with para 91 of Chap. IV of the Import Trade Control Handbook of Rules and Procedure (1968).
 [18 B-C] Speedy disposal of applications for import licences is of great importance in order that available foreign exchange may be, utilized without delay; but, it is also to be borne in mind, that in the present stage of our industrial development. imports requiring foreign exchange have to be controlled and regulated to prevent abuses of import quota. This inevitably requires proper scrutiny of various applications for import licences. In granting licences for imports, the authority has to keep in view various factors which may have impact on imports of other items of relatively 2 greater priority in the larger interests of the overall economy of the country which must be the supreme consideration. Moreover, in view of s. 3 (1) (a) of the Imports and Exports Control Act, 1947 and cl. 6(1)(a) of the Imports (Control) Order, 1955, an applicant has no vested right to an import licence in terms of the policy in force at the time of his application. [9 B-E; 16 B-E; 17 A-H] The respondent's application included household utensils which was not a priority item and since clarification was asked for the application could not be disposed of during 1968-69. The details of end-products furnished by him contained items which were non-priority end-products and hence. the application had to be kept pending until completion of its examination, and the time taken for such examination was not unreasonable.
