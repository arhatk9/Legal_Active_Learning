 Under cl. 6 of the Woollen Yarn (Production and Distribution) Control Order, 1960, the Textile Commissioner, with a view to secure proper distribution of woollen yarn, issues directions to a manufacturer of or dealer in yarn to sell woollen yam to manufacturers of hosiery to whom quotas are allotted. The quotas are allotted on the basis of con- sumption during the basic period 1956-1959.
 The appellant, first respondent and another were partners doing hosiery business, and the partnership was dissolved on 31-3-1959. After the dissolution, the three partners were doing hosiery business separately. The firm name belonged to the appellant under the deed of dissolution and he obtained quota in the firm name. The first respondent filed a suit for a declaration that he was entitled to draw 1-1/3 of the quota allotted to the appellant.
 The High Court, in Letters Patent Appeal, decreed the suit.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD: A declaration can only be founded on a legal right and the first respondent had no such legal right. [602C-D] (a) After the dissolution of the partnership each partner was entitled to ask for a quota for himself which would be considered on its merits. [602A-D] (b) Even if the appellant claimed the quota on the basis of past performance during the years 1956-59, it lay within the power of the Textile Commissioner to allot to the appellant the quantity he thinks fit and proper and the respondent can have no proprietary claim to the appellant's quota. [601H;.
 602A, B-C] (c) The quota granted to the appellant was in his individual business right and was his own property. It was not and could not be an asset of the partnership. Quota is a licence and a matter of privilege. The fact that it was granted in the firm name does not convert it into a partnership asset, because the name belongs to the appellant. [601G-H]
