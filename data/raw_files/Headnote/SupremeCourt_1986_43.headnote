 Under item 9(b) of the third Schedule to the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1957 tanned hides and skins, (which were not subjected to tax as untanned hides and skins), when purchased by a manufacturer in the State at the point of purchase e by the manufacturer and in all other cases at the point of purchase by the last dealer who buys them in the State, sales tax on the turnover calculated at the rate of 2 paise in the rupee was payable. In respect of the interstate sales Sales Tax under the Central Sales Tax was also leviable under the Central Sales Tax Act.
 The appellant purchases raw hides and skins in the State of A.P., tan the same and mostly used to sell such tanned hides in the course of inter-State trade. The first Respondent by his order dated 30th January, 1969 had assessed the appellants' inter-State sales turnover at Rs.
 16,23,194.29 and levied a tax of Rs. 48,695.82 under the Central Act. The local purchase turnover of raw hides was assessed at Rs. 7,92,585 and a tax of Rs. 23,777.66 was also levied. The appellant, therefore, filed a Writ Petition No.
 3464/71 in the A.P. High Court for declaring (i) that no tax could be levied or was leviable under the Central Sales Tax Act on the inter-State sales of tanned hides which have already suffered tax at the untanned stage. The High Court having dismissed the Writ Petition, the appellant has come in appeal by Special Leave.
 Dismissing the appeal, the Court, 970 ^ 
 HELD : 1.1 When a taxing statute was not imposing rates of tax on imported goods different from rates of tax on goods manufactured or produced, article 304 h d no application. So long as the rate was the same, article 304 was satisfied. When the rate is applied the resulting tax might be somewhat higher but that did not contravene the equality clause contemplated by article 304 of the Constitution. In the instant case, the tax being at the same rate, article 304(a) is not offended.[975 G-H] Rattam Lal & Co. and Anr. v. The Assessing Authority & Anr.,[1969] 2 S.C.R. 544 discussed and applied.
 
 1.2 The levy by the State Act is in consonance with the scheme of Central Act. By sub-section (2) of section 8 of the Central Act, the tax payable by any dealer on high turnover in so far as the turnover of any part thereof relates to the sale of goods in the course of inter-State trade or commerce not falling under sub-section (1), shall be at the rate specified in subsection (2) of section 8.
 These goods do not fall in subsection (1) of section 8. [976 C-D] The effect of an imposition of tax might work differently upon different dealers namely, those who use imported tanned goods and those who purchase these locally and tan these locally and then sell in the course of inter- State sales. Put that effect cannot be said to be arising directly, or as an immediate effect of the imposition of the tax. Therefore there cannot be any question of violation of article 304(a) of the Constitution.[1977 C-E] 
 1.3 The imposition, in this case, was in implementation of the central Act. There is no prohibition under Article 304 of the Constitution of the Parliament for imposition of any tax. The embargo that was placed by Article 304 of the Constitution was on the Legislature of a state. [977 E-F]
