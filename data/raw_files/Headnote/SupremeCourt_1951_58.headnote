 The Hindu Law of Inheritance (Amendment) Act (Act II of 1929) which introduced the son's daughter, daughter's daugh- ter, sister and sister's son between the grandfather and the paternal uncle in the order of succession applies only to the separate property of a Hindu male who dies intestate.
 It does not alter the law as regards the devolution of any other kind of property owned by a Hindu male and does not purport to regulate succession to the property of a Hindu female at all. The Act cannot therefore be invoked to determine the heirs of a Hindu female in respect of her stridhan property.
 The property of a Hindu female who dies as a maiden goes in the first place to her uterine brothers, then to the mother and then to the father, and on failure of the mother and father, it goes to the nearest relations, that is to say, to the sapindas of the father and in their default the sapindas of the mother, both in the order of propinquity.
 Under the Mitakshara law of succession as well as the Mayukha law the paternal uncle's son is entitled to succeed to the property of a Hindu in preference to sister's sons.
