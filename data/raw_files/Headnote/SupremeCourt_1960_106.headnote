 Where two rival unions of workmen in a public utility con- cern, a sugar industry, present demands covering the entire body of workmen and while one of them carries on conciliation proceedings with the employer the other commences a strike, any settlement, arrived at in such conciliation proceedings must bind all the employees under S. 18(3)(d) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, and the strike must, on a reasonable construction of the provisions of S. 22(1)(d) of the Act, amount to a contravention of it and must be illegal under S. 24(1)(1) of the Act.
 It was not necessary, in order to bind the workmen to the settlement arrived at before the conciliator, to show that they belonged to the union which took part in the conciliation proceedings, since the policy underlying s. 18 of the Act is to give an extended operation to such a settlement.
 The Associated Cement Company Ltd., Porbandar v. Their Workmen, [196O] 3 S.C.R. 57 and M/s. New India Motors (P) Ltd. v. K. T. Morris, [1960] INSC 50; [1960] 3 S.C.R. 350, referred to.
 Consequently, where the courts below, on an erroneous view of the law, acquitted certain workmen of the offence of subversive activity for joining an illegal strike under s.
 11 of the West Bengal Security Act, 1950, on the ground that the rival union to which they belonged was not a party to the conciliation proceedings, such acquittal must be set aside.
