 On May 21, 1966 the Income Tax Officer issued a notice to the petitioners under section 226 (3) (i) of Income Tax Act, 1961, stating that according to the books of accounts of B.R. Sons Ltd. (the assessee) the petitioners owed them Rs. 76 thousand odd and that this amount should be paid by them to the Department against arrears of tax due from the assessee. In reply the petitioners stated that it was not they who owed the assessee but it was the assessee who owed them a large amount. The Income Tax Officer directed the petitioners to file a sworn affidavit setting out their pleas.
 In the sworn affidavit filed on their behalf by the accountant of the petitioners the above contentions were reiterated. But the Income Tax Officer stating that an examination of the assessee's books of account showed that the facts stated in the affidavit were false in material particulars held the petitioners personally liable to make payment to the extent of their liability to the assessee. On January 11, 1967 the Income Tax Officer wrote to the petitioners that since they had not furnished any particulars to rebut his conclusion that the affidavit was false and also because they had failed to pay up the amount due from them to the assessee they were held to be an "assessee in default" within the meaning of section 226 (3) (x) of the Act.
 In the petitioner's writ petition seeking to quash the action of the Department to attach their immovable property the High Court held that although it was necessary for the Income Tax Officer to have mentioned the amount due from the petitioners to the assessee, since the petitioners knew what the amount referred to by the Income Tax Officer was, no prejudice could be said to have been caused to them and that the notice issued to them was not invalid on that account;
 and (ii) the Income Tax Officer was justified in treating the petitioners as "assessee in default" for non-payment of the amount due and owing 2 from them to the assesse, (iii) but since no recovery certificate as required under section 222 of the Act had been issued by the Income Tax Officer the recovery proceedings were invalid.
 In the appeal to this Court, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The view of the High Court that by reason of non-specification in the notice dated May 21, 1966 of the amount due from the petitioners to the assessee no prejudice had been caused to the petitioners was correct. At no time did the petitioners complain that the notice did not specify the amount alleged to be due from them to the assessee or that it was vague and indefinite. In fact they replied to the notice on merits and filed a sworn affidavit. Secondly in his letter dated December 31, 1966 the Income Tax Officer pointed out to the petitioners that the assessee had a credit balance of over Rs. 8 lakhs as on May 24, 1966.
 Therefore the petitioners had clear notice of what the amount alleged to be due from them to the assessee was. [8 G-9C] 
 2. (a) It is not necessary under clause (vi) that the statement on oath contemplated in that provision should be made only by the person to whom the notice under clause (i) is issued. It is sufficient if the objection to the requisition contained in the notice is made by the person to whom the notice is sent and such objection is supported on oath by a person competent to make such statement. [10 B] (b) Merely because the affidavit was sworn by the accountant of the petitioners it was not open to the Income Tax Officer to disregard the affidavit. The accountant had obviously knowledge of the state of account between the petitioners and the assessee and was competent to make a statement on oath in regard to the position of such account.
 [9 E] (c) If the Income Tax Officer discovers that a statement made on oath is false in any material particulars the garnishee is made personally liable to the Income Tax Officer to the extent of his own liability to the assessee on the date of the notice or to the extent of the assessee's liability for arrears of tax, whichever is less. [10E-F] 
 3. (a) For reaching an objective conclusion that in his opinion the statement on oath made on behalf of the garnishee is false in any material particulars the Income Tax Officer would have to give notice to the party concerned, hold an enquiry for determining whether the statement on oath is false and if so in which material particulars and what amount is in fact due from the garnishee to the assessee. In such an enquiry he would have to follow the principles of natural justice and reach an objective conclusion. [11 B-C] (b) Once a statement on oath is made on behalf of the garnishee that the sum demanded is not due from him to the assessee the burden of showing that the statement is false is on the Revenue which would be bound to disclose to the garnishee all such evidence or material on which it proposes to rely. The Revenue should also show on the basis of relevant evidence that the statement 3 on oath is false. It is only then that personal liability for payment can be imposed on the garnishee under clause (vi). [11 D-E] In the instant case, after receiving the affidavit of the accountant, the Income Tax Officer, without giving any notice and without holding any enquiry, straightaway reached the conclusion that the statement in the affidavit was false and held the petitioners personally liable under clause (vi). [11 F,12 A] Although the Income Tax Officer did set out in the notice dated December 31, 1966 the reasons for reaching this conclusion he did not offer any opportunity to the petitioners to show that the reasons that weighed with him were not correct. His decision was therefore invalid. Notice dated December 31, 1966 and January 11, 1967 must therefore be set aside. [12 E-F]
