 The appellants-assessees were assessed as individuals under Section 23(3) of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922, for the assessment year 194243. The incomes assessed included the cash credits in their personal accounts in the books of a company. On the basis of the said incomes, an assessment order was made under the provisions of the Excess Profits Tax .Act, and the tax so determined was deducted in computing the total income assessable under the Income Tax Act.
 While the assessees' appeals against the inclusion of the cash credits were pending before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, notices were served on the assessees under Section 34(lA) of the Act for the assessment years 194041 to 1947-48. The assessees applied to the Central Board of Revenue for settlement under sub-section (lB) and this was accepted. Subsequently the appeals were dismissed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner.
 Thereafter, consequent on the dismissal of the Revenue's appeals against the Appellate Assistant Commissioner's order allowing the assessees' appeals under the E.P.T. Act and the Tribunal's order becoming final, the Income Tax Officer, passed order under Section 35(6) rectifying the assessment order under the Income Tax Act, relating to assessment year 194243, and withdrew the deduction allowed earlier by him on account of the Excess Profit Tax.
 180 On appeal by the assessees, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner held that in view of the settlement, it was not open either to the Revenue or to the assessee to disturb the finality of the tax liability. However, the Tribunal held that the orders of rectification purported to have been passed under Section 155(3) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 were really orders passed under Section 35(6) of the 1922 Act and hence no appeal could lay against such order and that the Appellate Assistant Commissioner's orders were without jurisdiction.
 The assessees' applications under Section 256(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, were treated by the Tribunal as applications under Section 66(1) of the 1922 Act, and dismissed as barred by limitation.
 The assessees' writ petitions for quashing not only the orders of the Tribunal but also the rectification made by the Income Tax Officer were dismissed by the High Court.
 Dismissing the appeals, preferred by the assessees, this Court, 
HELD: 1.1. The High Court was right in holding that the settlement order did not preclude the Income Tax Officer from passing the order of rectification. [184D] 1.2. The deduction allowed in the original assessment proceedings on account of the Excess Profits Tax was not the subject matter of either the notice issued under sub- section (1A) of Section 34 or of the order of settlement made under sub-section (1B) of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922. The appeals under the E.P.T. Act were allowed by the A.A.C. subsequent to the acceptance of settlement under Section 34(lB). The question of withdrawing the deduction granted earlier on account of the Excess Profits Tax arose only after the Appellate Assistant Commissioner allowed the appeals preferred by the assessee under the E.P.T. Act, by virtue of which no Excess Profits Tax was payable by the assessees. In these circumstances, the bar contained in sub-section (ID) of Section 34 does not come into play.
 Once the liability of the assessees under Excess Profits Tax Act was held to be nil, the deduction given earlier had to be withdrawn and it was accordingly withdrawn under Section 35(6) of the Act. [186B-C] 
13. In these circumstances, it is not necessary to decide whether no appeal could lie from the order of rectification under Section 35(6) and 181 whether the Appellate Tribunal had no power to condone the delay in a reference application under Section 66(1).
