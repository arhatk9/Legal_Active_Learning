 The assessee company floated a subsidiary company during the relevant previous year and transferred to that subsidiary company various shares held by it at a certain rate.. The authorities under the Income-tax Act, 1922, held that the assessee and its subsidiary were two different legal entities, that the transaction was a bona fide transaction and that the assessee had not made any secret profits out of that transaction. The Income-tax officer, however, valued the shares transferred at the market rate and held that the assessee company must be deemed to have made a profit. In appeal, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner set aside the order of the Income-tax Officer and remitted the case to him for finding out whether the assessee had really made any profits from the transaction. The Tribunal dismissed the appeal of the Income-tax Officer against that order, summarily, on the ground that the Income-tax Officer had not taken the necessary pleas that the decision of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner was incorrect in law. On reference, the High Court held that the order of the Tribunal was an interlocutory one and that an application to make a reference to the High Court did not lie.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court.
 
HELD: (1). The Tribunal, instead of dealing with the substance of the matter had been unduly influenced by procedural technicalities. The conclusion of the Tribunal that the appeal memorandum was not in accordance with law was also not correct as no specific formula is necessary for seeking relief at the hand of any court or tribunal if the necessary grounds are taken. [955D-E] (2) But the view of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner was correct and there was no necessity to decide whether the Tribunal erred in dismissing the appeal summarily. [958F-G] It is a well accepted principle of law that an assessee can so arrange his affairs as to minimise his tax burden.
 Hence, if the assessee in this case arranged its affairs in such a manner as to reduce its tax liability by starting a subsidiary company and transferring its shares to that subsidiary company and thus forgoing part of its own profits and at the same time enabling its subsidiary to earn some profits, such a course is not impermissible under law.
