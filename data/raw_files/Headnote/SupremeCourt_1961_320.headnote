 ^ Held, that in consonance with the decision in the Associated Companies Ltd's case the income-tax deduction must be calculated on the amount which represents the balance after deducting the full statutory depreciation allowed from the gross profit.
 Held, further that the rate allowed for return on working capital is to 2 to 4% which is at the discretion of the Tribunal and the Supreme Court usually will not interfere with the discretion exercised by the Tribunal in a particular case.
 Held, further that for the purpose of returns on working capital, the working capital cannot include a sum which was either borrowed or was in deposit with the company on which the company was paying interest. The company cannot claim further interest on the borrowed amount which has been used as working capital, for it has already paid interest on it to those from whom it was borrowed and this has been taken into account as expense in arriving at the gross profit. Where borrowed money is used as working capital there is no question of giving any further return on this borrowed money.
 The return on reserves used as working capital can only be given on moneys belonging to the company which are used as working capital.
 Held, also, that where there is a dispute with regard to the claim for bonus by the workmen for a particular year and the fact that no evidence as to rehabilitation was led in that particular year will not preclude the company from leading evidence as to the amount which should be allowed to it as prior charges on account of rehabilitation, in any subsequent dispute as to bonus relating to subsequent years.
