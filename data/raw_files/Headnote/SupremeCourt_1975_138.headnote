 Under s. 49(1) and (2) of the Electricity Supply Act, 1948, the legislature has empowered the State Electricity Board to frame uniform tariffs and has also Indicated the factors to be taken into account in fixing uniform tariffs Under. sub-s. (3), the Board may, in the special circumstances mentioned therein, fix different tariffs for the supply of electricity, but, in doing so, sub-s. (4) directs that the Board is not to show undue preference to any person. Under s. 59 the Board shall not, as far as practicable carry on its operations at a loss and shall adjust its charges accordingly from time to time.
 Certain consumers of electricity had entered into agreements for the supply of electricity for their manufacturing purposes at specified rates for specified periods . Some of the agreements were entered into with the State Governments and the others with the State Electricity Boards. In one of the agreements there was an arbitration clause. On account of the increase in the operation and maintenance cost, due to various causes which caused loss to the State Electricity Boards, the Boards wanted to increase the charges in all the cases. the consumers challenged the competency of the Boards to do so by petitions in the respective High Courts. The High Court sustained the Boards claim, in some cases, under Ss. 49 and 59, and in others, held that the Board was incompetent to do so. In the case of the consumer where there was the arbitration clause, the High Court refused to entertain the petition on account of the clause.
 In appeals to this Court by the aggrieved consumers and the Boards ^ 
 HELD: (1) The agreements with the State Governments must also be treated as agreements entered into with 'the Boards. Section 60 of the Act provides that all contracts entered into by or with the State Government for any of the purposes of the Act, shall be deemed to have been entered into by or with the Board. One of the primary purposes of the Supply Act is to provide For the supply of electricity.
 An agreement for supply of electricity to a consumer is.
 therefore, an agreement for one of the purposes of the Supply Act and s. 60 has application to such an agreement.
 [78G-H] 2(a) Fixation of special tariffs under s 49(3) can be a unilateral Act on the part of the Board but more often it would be the result of negotiations between the Board and the consumer and hence a matter of agreement between them.
 Therefore, the Board can, in exercise of the power conferred under the sub-section, enter into an agreement with a consumer stipulating for special tariff for supply of electricity for a specific period of time. The agreements for supply of electricity to the consumers must therefore be regarded as having been entered into by the Boards in exercise of the statutory power conferred under s. 49(3).
 [81E-F. H-82B] 71 (b) When a public authority is entrusted by a statute with a discretionary power to be exercised for the public good, it cannot, when making a private contract in general terms, fetter itself in the use of that power or in the exercise of such discretion. This principle is attracted when an attempt is made to fetter in advance the future exercise of statutory powers otherwise than by 'the valid exercise of a statutory power. Where a statutory power is exercised to enter in o a stipulation with a third party which fetters the future exercise of other statutory powers, where such stipulation is made, not as part of a private contract in general terms, but in exercise of a statutory power. he exercise of the statutory power would not be held to be invalid as a fetter on the future exercise of other statutory powers. If it were so held, it would render the statutory power meaningless and futile. Therefore, where a stipulation in a contract is entered into by a public authority in exercise of a statutory power, then, even though such stipulation fetters the subsequent exercise of the same statutory power or future exercise of another statutory power it would he valid and the exercise of such statutory power, would protanto stand restricted. The public authority would not, in such a case. be free to denounce the stipulation as a nullity and claim to exercise its statutory power in disregard of it. except, where there is an overriding statutory provision which, expressly or by necessary implication, authorises the public authority to set at naught in certain circumstances, a stipulation though made in exercise of :1 statutory power.

 (c) In the present ease, `the agreements were entered into with the consumers in exercise of the statutory power to fix special tariffs under s. 49(3) and therefore there could be no question of such stipulation being void as fettering or hindering the exercise of the statutory power under that provision These stipulations did not divest the Board of its statutory power or fetter or hinder its exercise. In fact, they represented 'he exercise of the statutory power Once the agreements were made containing the stipulations they were binding as having been validly made in exercise of the statutory power, and it was not competent to the Board to override them. The Board could not enhance the charges in breach of these stipulations, for that would negate the existence of the statutory power in the Board under s. 49(3 ) to fix the charges for a specific period of time. [85E-86B] (d) The Board was also not competent to enhance the charges under the guise of fixing uniform tariffs because, sub-s. (1) of s. 49 is subject to sub-s (3) and once special tariffs were fixed under sub-s. (3) there could be no question of fixing uniform tariffs applicable to the consumer under sub-s. (1) . Such .. power could not be exercised in derogation of the stipulation fixing special tariffs under sub-s (3). [86B-C] (e) If the stipulations as to charges were not binding and the Board could enhance the charges unilaterally in disregard of them the consumer would also be free to repudiate the stipulations. 'the stipulations as to charges are inseverable from the rest of the agreements and if "these stipulations are disturbed and the charges are revised unilaterally by the Board the agreements could no.
 bind the consumer. [86C-E] (f) Further, on the contention of the Board i would be impossible for a consumer to enter into an agreement with the Board for supply of electricity at a certain specified rate. But 'that could not have been intended by the legislature because, far from promoting the object of electric development and industrial growth in the State it would act as a regressive factor. [86E-F] 3 (a) A marginal note to a section cannot afford any legitimate aid to the construction of the section but it can be relied upon as indicating the drift 72 of the section to show what the section was dealing with.
 The marginal note to s. 59 reads 'General Principles for Board's finance'. This shows that the section is intended to do no more than to lay down general principles for the finance of the Board. It merely enunciates certain guidelines which the Board must follow in managing its finance. [86H-87B] (b) Under the section the Board is directed as far as practicable not to carry on its operations at a loss and to adjust its charges accordingly from time to time. The legislature has deliberately and advisedly used the word as far as practicable," because, since the Board is a statutory authority charged with the general duty of promoting coordinated development of general on supply and distribution of electricity within the State, with particular reference to such development in areas not for 'the time being served or adequately served by any licensee, it might suffer loss in carrying on its operations, as it might have to give special tariffs to consumers in undeveloped or sparsely developed areas, and sometimes to industrial consumers for accelerating the to of industrial growth, even though such special tariffs might not be sufficient to meet the cost of generation, supply and distribution of electricity. [87B-E] (c) Where, by a stipulation validly made under s. 49(3) the Board under a contractual obligation not to charge anything more then a specified tariff it would not be practicable for it to enhance its charges if it finds that is is incurring operational loss. To do something contrary to law in violation of a contractual obligation, can never be regarded as 'practicable'. the Board can adjust its charges under s. 59 only in so far as the law permits it to do so, that. is, where it is not fettered by a contractual stipulation from doing (4) (a) Under s. 57 of the Act a Iciness can, notwithstanding any agreement entered into with the consumer, enhance the charges for sale of electricity in order to earn a reasonable return by way of profit. The difference in language between s. 59 and s. 57 shows that s.
 59 does not confer any power on the Board to enhance the charges for supply of electric y in disregard of a contractual stipulation entered into under s. 49(3). [87G- 88C] (b) The 6th Schedule of the Act is, by a fiction enacted in s. 57, deemed to be incorporated in the licence e of every licensee and it enables the Licensee to adjust its charges for the sale of the electricity by enhancing them so that it earns a reasonable return as profit; but the definition of 'licensee' in s. 2(6) does not include the State Electricity Board. it has been expressly taken out of the category of licensee for the purpose of the Supply Act.
 [99C-E] (5) (a) The cost is not the sole or only criterion for fixing tariff. [87E-F] Maharashtra State Electricity Board v. Kalyan Borough Municipality [1968] INSC 34; [1968] 3 S.C.R. 137, followed.
 (b) There may be certain consumers who may have to be supplied electricity at special tariff less than the cost, having regard to the geographical area or the nature or purpose of the supply. That is why the adjustment of the charges would have to be left to the discretion of the Board to be made in such manner as it thinks fit, and since cost is not the sole or only criterion for fixing tariff, the Board would be free not to enhance the charges in case of some consumers even though such charges may be less than their costs. If that be so, it must follow, a fortiorari, that there is nothing in s. 59 which requires the Board 'to enhance the charges in a case where it has bound itself by a contractual stipulation not to claim anything more than certain specified charges. [88C-E] (6) If the power to enhance the rates unilaterally in derogation of the contractual stipulation does not reside in any provision of the Supply Act it cannot be created by regulations under s. 79(j) of the Act. Either this power can be found in some provisions of the Supply Act or it is not there at all. Regulations, in the nature of subordinate legislation, cannot confer authority on the Board to interfere with contractual rights and obligations unless the 73 power to make such regulations is vested in the Board by some provision of the statute expressly or by necessary implication. Therefore, it would not make any difference whether or not the Board has made any regulations under .
 79(j). [92H-93B] (7) The arbitration clause provided that "any dispute or difference arising between the consumer and the supplier o, their respective electric engineers, as to the supply of electrical energy hereunder or the pressure thereof as as to the supplier or the consumer respectively to determine the same or any question, matter thing arising hereunder shall be referred to a single arbitrator who shall be mutually agreed upon by both parties".
 The claim of the Electricity Board to enhance the charges under ss. 49 and 59 and the 6th Schedule to the Supply Act, is not a question matter or thing arising under the agreement is a claim founded on the provisions of the Supply Act and such a claim falls outside the ambit of the arbitration provision. [98E-H] (8) (a) But since the Board also claimed that it has the power to claim the additional levy under another clause of the agreement, which provided that the. tariff and conditions of supply mentioned in the agreement shall be subject to any revision that may be made by the supplier.
 The question whether the Board had power under that clause to enhance the charges is a question arising under the agreement. All the contentions raised by the consumer against the claim of the Board are also covered by the arbitration agreement, and therefore, there is no reason why the consumer should not pursue he remedy of arbitration and instead invoke the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court under t. 226. [99F-100E] (b) When an authority takes action which is within its compence, it cannot be held to be invalid merely because it purports to be made under a. wrong provision, if it can be shown to be within its power under any other provision. The Board claimed originally power under ss. 49 and 59 and the 6 h Schedule of the Supply Act, but if it has power under a clause of the agreement, the enhancement could be justified by reference to that power.
