 The respondent retired from the service of the appellant State on 19.5.1973. His pension and gratuity were ultimately paid to him on 14.8.75 i e. after a delay of more than two years and three months. A suit for the recovery of interest at the rate of 12% per annum by way of liquidated damages for the delayed payment was decreed by the District Court allowing interest at 6% only. In appeal by the State (there being no cross appeal) the High Court confirmed the decree. Hence the special leave petition.
 Dismissing the petition, the Court, ^ 
 HELD: 1:1 Pension and gratuity are no longer any bounty to be distributed by the government to its employees on their retirement but have become under the decisions of the Supreme Court, valuable rights and property in their hands and any culpable delay in settlement and disbursement thereof must be visited with the penalty of payment of interest at the current market rate till actual payment [477C-D] 
 1.2 In the instant case, though the respondent claimed 12% interest and unfortunately District Court allowed only 6% per annum, since the respondent acquiesced in his claim being decreed at 6% by not preferring any cross objections in the High Court, it would be improper for the Supreme Court to enhance the rate to 12% per annum. [478C-D] 
 1.3 Under Rule 186 of the Treasury Code a duty is cast on the Treasury officer to grant to every retiring Government servant the last pay certificate which, in this case had been delayed by the concerned officer for which neither any justification or explanation had been given. The claim 477 for interest is therefore in order and the State Government has rightly been saddled with a liability for the culpable neglect in the discharge of his duty by the District Treasury Officer who delayed the issuance of the LPC.
