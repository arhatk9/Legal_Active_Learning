 Ordinance XXV of 1948, issued by the Raj Pramukh of the then State of, Saurashtra, was amended by Ordinance XXXIX of 1948 and Ordinance LXIV of 1949, with the result that matters relating to land revenue in the State were governed by the Bombay Land Revenue Code. Section 52 of the Code gives power to the Collector for fixing the assessment of the amount to be paid as land revenue on all lands, Chap. VIII deals with the procedure for 'survey', and Chap. VIII-A deals with the procedure for 'settlement'. In 1951, the Saurashtra Barkhali Abolition Act, 1951, for abolition of Barkhali tenure was passed. Section 18 of the Act provided for payment of cash annuities as compensation to Barkhaii tenure-holders calculated on the basis of the assessment in respect of the land in possession of the tenants of such holders. Such assessment in relation to any land, until the village in which such land is situate is surveyed and settled, is defined in s. 19(l) and has to be determined by the Mamlatdar after holding an inquiry under s. 19(2).
 The appellants, who were Barkhali tenure-holders, were paid instalments of anuity till 1959 on the basis of Assessment determined under s. 19(l) and (2).- In 1959, the existing r.
 17 of the Saurashtra Land Revenue Rules framed under the Bombay Land Revenue Code was deleted and a new rule was substituted. This rule laid down the method to be adopted by the Collector for fixing the assessment under s. 52 of the Code, but the procedure did not involve any survey or settlement under Chaps. VIII and VIll-A of the Code. In pursuance of this rule, the Collector determined under s. 52 of the Code, the assessment payable on the lands which were held under Barkhali-tenure by the appellants. The Government then paid annuity under s. 18 of the Abolition Act on the basis of the Collector's assessment instead of continuing payment on the basis of the assessment made by the Mamlatdar under s. 19 of the Act. This was challenged by the appellants unsuccessfully in the High Court.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD:Under s. 19 of the Abolition Act, the assessment made by the Mamlatdar under that section continues in force until there is a survey and settlement- in accordance with Chaps. VIII and VIII-A-of the Code, and there having been no such survey and settlement of the villages of the appellant, the assessment made by the Mamlatdar continued to be the assessment for purposes of the Abolition Act.
 Therefore, the Government was not justified in varying the payment of annuity under s. 18 of the Act. [300 G-H] up.CI(NP)170-9 294 (a)By virtue of s. 2(v) of the Barkhali Abolition Act and S. 2(33) of the Saurashtra Land Reforms Act, 1951, all words and expressions, used, but not defined in the Abolition Act, have the meanings assigned to them in the Bombay Land Revenue Code. The words 'surveyed' and 'settled' are not defined in the Abolition Act, but the expression 'survey settlement' is defined in the Code as including a settlement made under the provisions of Chap. VIII-A of the Code.
 Therefore, at the time when the Abolition Act was passed, the only manner of 'survey which was laid .down by any law applicable in the State was that contained in Chap. VIII of the Code, and the only manner of settlement was that contained in Chap. VIII-A; that is, the words 'surveyed' and 'settled' used in s. 19 of the Abolition Act were intended to refer to the survey and settlement under Chaps.
 VIII and VIII-A of the Code. The Legislature envisaged that, in areas in which there had been no survey and 'settlement in accordance with Chaps. VIII and VIII-A such operations would be undertaken. But, for the intervening period, the Legislature, in s. 19 of the Abolition Act, laid down a convenient and summary method- of assessment by the Mamlatdar, which was to be treated as the assessment until the village in which the land is situate is surveyed and settled. The Legislature did not intend that the Mamlatdar's assessment should be superseded by that of the Collector under s. 52, because, that section does not at all envisage a survey and settlement. [297 F-H; 298 B-G] (b)If the Legislature intended such a supersession, the Legislature would have laid down that the Mamlatdar's assessment shall remain effective until an assessment is made under the Code without making any reference to survey or settlement. [298 H] (c)Further, s. 52 of the Code envisages assessment on all lands, while s. 19 of the Abolition Act refers to survey and settlement of a village. Since there could be assessment of revenue on lands without survey or settlement. of the village, such an assessment could not supersede that of the Mamlatdar under s. I). [299 D-F] (d)Moreover, r. 17 requires a very limited action by the Collector in classifying and comparing lands for purposes of assessment and is a mere exercise of a summary power by him until a proper survey and settlement is made. The Legislature having granted to the Mamlatdar summary power to make an assessment until there was a regular survey and settlement, could not have intended it to be superseded by another summary assessment by the Collector under s. 52 of the Code.
