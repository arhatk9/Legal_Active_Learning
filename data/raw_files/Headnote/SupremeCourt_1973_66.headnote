 For the assessment year 1961-62 the assessee-a tea company, was assessed to income-tax under r. 24 of the Income-tax Rules on its profits as per its Profit and Loss Account with certain modifications. In the expenses debited in its accounts only the expenses for raising thatch, bamboo, fuel etc. grown in the tea estate and used in the tea business were included. The assessee contended that the market value of the agricultural produce grown in the tea estate and utilised by the assessed in the tea business, which had been assessed at 100% to agricultural income-tax, must be taken into consideration in the computation of the allowable expenditure. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner, the, Tribunal and the High Court, on reference, held in favour of the assessee Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : in the matter of computing the agricultural income it was not necessary that the agricultural produce should be sold and profit of gain made from such sale, before it is considered as agricultural income. it is sufficient if the assessee gets any benefit from the produce, and what is to be taxed is the market value of the benefit received by the assessee and not the costs incurred by the assessee for raising the agricultural produce in question. If the assessee has to pay agricultural income-tax on the market value of the agricultural produce raised in his estate and used in his tea business, it stands to reason, that while determining the deductible expenditure incurred for the purpose of his business, the same rule, namely, the market value of the produce used for the tea business should be taken into consideration, because, in terms of money, what he expended was the market value of the produce used in connection with his business. The fact that he used his own goods is immaterial. [891 F-H] Dooars Tea Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Agricultural Income,tax, West Bengal, [1962] XLIV I.T.R. 6, referred to.
