 The services of Respondent No. 2, a permanent clerk in the Bombay Electric Supply and Transport Undertaking, which is run by the appellant Were terminated from the close of work on January 23, 1968 as her record of service was unsatisfactory. The communication dated January 20, 1968 was from the Executive Assistant to the General Manager and it also stated that she should be paid one month's wages in lieu of notice and would also be eligible for all the benefits as might be admissible under the Standing Orders and Service Regulations of the Undertaking. The appeal preferred by her against this order to the Assistant General Manager having remained unsuccessful, she made an application before the Labour Court under Section 42 (4) of the Bombay Industrial Relations Act contending that the order terminating her services was invalid, as it was not passed by the competent authority as envisaged by the Standing Order and that the so called Executive Assistant to the General Manager had no authority to terminate her services because no validity sanctioned post of that designation existed on 20th or 23rd. January, 1968. It was also contended that the aforesaid order besides being mala fide, was violative of the principles of natural justice in as much as the same was passed without holding any enquiry. The Labour Court dismissed the application. The respondent, s appeal before the President of the Industrial Court was however allowed. The Industrial Court held that the impugned orders bore only the initials of the General Manager and therefore it was passed by an authority which was lacking in authority, the wording "unsatisfactory service record" cast a stigma and was patently punitive attracting the nonobservance of Standing Order No. 26 which did not create an absolute right in the management to terminate the services of an employee for misconduct without holding an enquiry or giving her a fair opportunity of being heard. A Writ application filed by the appellant was dismissed holding inter alia that the fact that Standing Order 26 required reasons to be mentioned in the order terminating the services of an employee did not mean that an order of dismissal on the ground of misconduct could be converted into an order of discharge simpliciter by mentioning therein the nature of misconduct.
 Allowing the appeal by special leave, the Court 
HELD : 1. Whether a written document or order bears full signatures or only initials of the competent authority does not, make any significant difference nor does the affixation of signature by initials on a document or order detract from its authenticity unless the law or the rule specifically requires full signature to be affixed thereto to make it authentic. [1005 E1F] In the instant case : (a) the impunged order terminating the respondent's services was in fact and in reality passed by the General Manager himself who was the competent authority as defined by clause (e) of Standing Order 3 and was merely communicated by his Executive Assistant to the respondent;
 (b) since it is established on the record that the impugned order 1001 was in fact and in reality made by the General Manager and there is nothing to indicate that it was not consciously made by him, it could not have been ,quashed on the ground that it was passed by an incompetent authority. [1005 C, 6- H] 
2. The question whether a particular order terminating the service of an employee is by way of punishment or not has to be determined on the facts and circumstances of each case and the form of the order is not decisive of the matter.
 [1006 B] Under Standing Orders, two powers are given to the management; one is the power to impose punishment for misconduct after a disciplinary inquiry under clause (2) of the Standing Order 21 read with Standing Order 23 and the other is the power to terminate the service of an employee by one calendar month's written notice or pay in lieu thereof under Standing Order 26. The question is as to which power has been exercised by the Management in ,a particular case and this question has to be determined _having regard to the substance of the matter and not its form. Now, one thing must be borne in mind that these are two distinct and independent powers and as far as possible, neither should be construed so as to emasculate the other or to render it ineffective. One is the power to punish an employee for misconduct while the other is the power to terminate simpliciter the service of an employee without any other adverse consequences. [1006 B-D] 
3. Proviso (i) to clause (1) of Standing Order 26 requires that the reason for termination of the employment should be given in writing to the employee when exercising the power ,of termination of service of the employee under Standing Order 26. Therefore, when the service of an employee is terminated simpliciter under Standing Order 26, the reason for such termination has to be given to the employee and this provision has been made in the Standing Order with a view to ensuring that the Management does not act in an arbitrary manner' The management is required to articulate the reason which operated on its mind in terminating the service of the employee. But merely because the reason for terminating the service of the employee is required to be given-and the reason must obviously not be arbitrary, capricious or irrelevant-it would not necessarily in every case make the order of termination punitive in character so as to require compliance with the requirement of clause (2) of Standing Order 21 read with Standing Order 23.
 Otherwise, the power of termination of service of an employee under Standing Order 26 would be rendered meaningless and futile, for in no case it would be possible lo exercise it. Of course, if misconduct of the employee constitutes the foundation for terminating his service, then even if the order of termination is purported to be made under Standing Order 26, it may be liable to be regarded as punitive in character and hence attracting procedure of clause (2) of Standing Order 21 read with Standing Order 23, though even in such a case it may be argued that the management has not punished the employee but has merely terminated 'his service under Standing Order 26. [1006 D-H] In the present case, the order of termination cannot be regarded as punitive in character so as to invoke the, applicability of clause (2) of Standing Order read with Standing Order 23 reason given for terminating the service of the respondent was unsatisfactory record of service. No misconduct was alleged against the respondent. nor was any misconduct made the foundation for passing the impugned order of termination. The order of termination was clearly not passed by way of punishing the respondent for Any misconduct. The view that the service of the respondent was not satisfactory was undoubtedly based on past incidents set out in the record but for each of these incidents punishment in one form or another had' already been meted out to her and it was not by of punishment for any of these incidents, but because as gathered from these incidents her recorded of service was unsatisfactory that her service was terminated by the management under standing order 26. 26 [1006 H, 1007 A-B] 13 -329 SCI/78 1002 Even if the view were taken that the impugned order of termination of service of the respondent was punitive in character and could not have been. passed save and except as a result of a disciplinary inquiry heldunder clause (2) of Standing Order 21 read with Standing Order 23, theimpugned order cannot be struck down as invalid the ground of non-compliancewith the requirement of the Standing Orders, since respondent no. 2 availed of the opportunity open to her before the Labour Court when the appellant adduced.' sufficient evidence justifying the action taken by the management. The appellant produced satisfactory evidence to show that the impugned order terminating the service of the respondent was justified and hence the impugned order must be sustained despite its having been passed without complying with the requirements of clause (2) of Standing Order 21 read with Standing Order 
23. No distinction can be made between cases where the domestic enquiry is invalid or defective and those where no enquiry has in fact been held as required by the relevant Standing Orders and in either case it is open to the employer tojustify his action before the Labour Tribunal by adducing all relevant evidence before it.
