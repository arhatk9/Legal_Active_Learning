 The appellant and four others were charged under s. 120B I.P.C. and ss. 420, 511, 467, 468 and 471 read with s. 120B of I.P.C. The trial court convicted the appellant and awarded a cumulative sentence of 3 years' rigorous imprisonment and imposed a fine and in default two years rigorous imprisonment. In appeal the High Court was of the view that the appellant had committed an offence punishable under s. 419 read with s. 109 I.P.C., even if the other charges, for which he had been convicted, may not be established. On this view and relying on the power of the court to convert his conviction to appropriate sections of the Penal Code, the High Court substituted for the conviction recorded by the trial court a conviction under s.
 419 read with s. 109 I.P.C. and reduced the sentence to two years' rigorous imprisonment, while maintaining the fine.
 The Court did not examine the evidence relating to the offences for which the appellant had been convicted by the trial court and did not record any findings on the facts which, according to the prosecution. constituted the commission of those offences. The court found that the appellant had at least abetted the execution of one false affidavit of G, which in fact was signed by some person other than G and that person was wrongly identified by the appellant before the Oath Commissioner, and, as such, the appellant was held guilty of abetting the offence of read with s.109 I.P.C. Setting aside the conviction, 
HELD : The High Court lost sight of the fact that no charge under s. 419 readwith s. 109 I.P.C. was framed against the appellant in the trial court. In addition the appellant, when questioned under s. 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, after the prosecution evidence had been recorded, was not asked to explain the evidence relating to a charge of cheating the Oath Commissioner. Though there was mention of commission of forgery of affidavits, mere mention of the commission of that offence could not possibly lead the appellant to infer that he was liable to be convicted for abetting the offence of cheating the Oath Com- missioner. [180 H-181 B] Further in the instant case the facts found did not constitute the offence of cheating at all. The finding of fact recorded only showed that the Oath Commissioner was induced to attest the affidavit by the deception practised by the appellant in wrongly identifying a person. The act done by the Oath Commissioner of attesting the affidavit could not, however, possibly cause any damage or harm to the Oath Commissioner in body, mind, reputation or property.
 The Oath Commissioner 179 was obviously not induced to deliver any property to anybody by this wrong identification, nor was he induced to consent that any person. should retain any property. [182 A-C] In approving the sentence of two years' imprisonment in default of payment of fine, the High Court, made an order which was clearly, illegal and in contravention of s. 65 I.P.C. The High Court made no order with regard to imprisonment in default; but, by upholding the fine awarded by the trial court, the High Court impliedly affirmed the imprisonment to be undergone in default of payment of fine.
 In affirming this sentence of imprisonment in default of payment of fine, the High Court failed to, notice that the sentence of imprisonment in default became illegal when the conviction was altered to one under s. 419 read with s. 109 I.P.C. Under that section the maximum sentence of imprisonment than can be awarded is three years and, consequently, under s. 65 I.P.C. the maximum term of imprisonment in default of payment of fine that could be prescribed was nine months, being one-fourth of three years.
 [182 G] [The case was remitted to the High Court for rehearing in respect of the offence for which the appellant was convicted by the trial court.]
