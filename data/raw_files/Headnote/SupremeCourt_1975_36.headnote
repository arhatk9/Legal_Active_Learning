 In the election to the State Legislative Assembly the respondent was declared elected and the appellant, the congress candidate filed an election petition challenging the election on various grounds, one of which was that the respondent was guilty of corrupt practice under s. 123(4) 'of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, in that certain pamphlets were published by him or with his consent.
 The petition was dismissed by the High Court, Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : I (a) There is no substance in the preliminary objection of the respondent that the election petition should have been dismissed on the ground that it did not comply with the requirements of s. 83 of the Act and that the evidence of printing the pamphlets, in any event, should not have been admitted. [553D-F] The charge against the respondent in the election petition was that the respondent was responsible for the publication of the pamphlets and not their printing. Evidence regarding printing was only relied upon to corroborate the evidence regarding distribution of the pamphlets. )"en s. 123(4) speaks of publication it means distribution. Therefore, failure to give particulars of the printing in the affidavit in support of the election petition cannot lead to the dismissal of the petition; nor could evidence regarding it be shut out. The proviso to s. 83(1) lays down that where the petitioner alleges any corrupt practice the petition should also be accompanied by an affidavit in the prescribed form in support of the allegation of such corrupt practice and the particular,-, thereof. It does not say that the allegation of corrupt practice and particulars thereof should be given in the affidavit. The election petition contains the ,allegations of corrupt practice and particulars thereof. The Form 25, which is the one prescribed under r. 94A of the Conduct of Election Rules also show.,; that this was the intention of the Legislature.
 In the present case the affidavit filed in support of the election petition is in accordance with that prescribed form. [553F-H] Virendra Kumar Saklecha v. Jagjivan, [1972] INSC 91; [1972] 1 SCC 826 and Krishan Chander v. Ram Lal, [1973] 2 SCC 789, referred to.
 (b) Furthermore, according to s. 86 of the Act only petitions which do not comply with the provisions of ss. 81, 82 and 117 are liable to be dismissed. [555C] (2) The High Court was wrong in rejecting wholesale every bit of evidence adduced on behalf of the appellant. Even taking the evidence adduced on behalf of the appellant of only non-congress witnesses. that evidence establishes that the people who got printed the various pamphlets are close supporters of the respondent. Those persons had no special grievance against the appellant but all the pamphlets have been printed with the definite purpose of harming the chances of the appellant in the election and thereby aiding those of the respondent. The plan and the direction could therefore have come only from one source and that is the respondent. Hence, it must be held that the respondent was guilty of the corrupt practice under s. 123(4) in respect of the pamphlets. [561D-E, G; 562C]
