 The appellant concern was closed on tile ground that it incurred heavy losses. Thereupon the workmen raised an industrial dispute and they were awarded retrenchment bene- fits. About two years later the appellant concern was re- opened. But only some of the former werekers re-employea along with some new recruits. The wages were lower than before. The workers put forward certain damands including for the demand for absorption of those of the workmen who were not re-employed when the mill was reopened and for payment to them of compensation for unemployment from the date of reopening. An industrial dispute having arisen the Government constituted a single Member Tribunal and made a reference of the disputes to that Tribunal. Thereafter the Member retired. The Government then purporting to act under s. 7 (1) of the Industrial Dispute Act, 1947 and in supercession of the previous notification constituted a single Member Tribunal. This Tribunal to which no fresh reference was made proceeded with the adjudication of the dispute. Apart from the demands already made the workers contended before the Tribunal that they were entitled to the benefits under s. 25 (H) of the Industrial Disputes Act, as amended by the Industrial Disputes (Amendment) Act, 1953.
 The appellant contended that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the dispute 846 and that s. 25 (H) was not available to the former workmen who had been retrenched. The first contention of the appe.
 llant was rejected. Even though the second contention was accepted the tribunal made an order in favour of the workmen on the ground that though they cannot claim the statutory benefits of s. 25 (H) the principle of social justice underying that section entitled them to receive salaries and allowances from the date of reopening the mill. The appellant preferred an appeal to the Industrial Appellate Tribunal. On the dismissal of that appeal the appellant filed a writ petition before the High Court of Bombay. The High Court summarily dismissed that petition but a certificate was granted to appeal to this Court.
 The appellant reitrated before this Court the two con- tentions stated above.
 Held, that sub-s. (1) of s. 7 of the Industrial Disputes Act empowers the Government to constitute a Tribunal. But merely constituting a Tribunal for adjudication of disputes is not enough. It has also to act under s. 10 and make a specific reference to it of each dispute for adjudicition.
 Without such a reference the Tribunal does not get any jurisdiction to adjudicate upon any dispute.
 The provisions of s. 25 (H) cannot apply to workmen who had been retrenched before this section came into force. The provision not being retrospective no tribunal has jurisdic- tion on the basis of its own conception of social justice to apply it or its underlying "principle" to a dispute which arose before the provision came into force.
