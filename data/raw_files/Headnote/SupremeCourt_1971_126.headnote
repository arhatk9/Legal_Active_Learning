 The respondent Corporation was originally constituted as a Borough under the Bombay Municipal Boroughs Act, 1925 having been converted into a Corporation in 1962. The Borough owned several buildings in the area of its jurisdiction and some of these were given on lease to the appellants in 1953.
 The leases were renewed in 1955. Neither in the original leases nor in the fresh leases was there any mention of the liability of the tenants to pay the house tax. Subsequent to the execution of the fresh leases bills were received from the respondent by the appellants calling upon them to pay the house tax imposed in respect of the buildings belonging to the respondent which were on lease with the appellants. The appellants filed a suit challenging the legality of the imposition of this house tax. The main ground taken was that the Municipality could not impose a house tax on buildings owned by itself. The trial court held that the respondent was not competent to levy from the tenants any sum in excess of the agreed rents and that in the circumstances of this case notice under s. 206-A of the Act was not necessary. The Additional District Judge in appeal agreed that the levy was not valid but held the suit not to be maintainable for want of a notice under s. 206-A.
 The High Court in second appeal held that the levy was valid and that a notice under s. 206-A was necessary. In appeal by special leave to this Court, 
HELD: There is nothing in the scheme of the Act to indicate that buildings belonging to the municipality itself cannot be subjected to the house-tax which can be imposed under s. 73 of the Act. The language of s. 85 specifically envisages imposition of such a tax on buildings belongIng to the municipality. It clearly lays down that such a tax shall be leviable primarily from the actual occupier of the property on which the tax is assessed, even if he holds it on a lease from the municipality. The fixation of such responsibility primarily on the occupier holding a building on lease from the municipality could only be laid down on the basis that the buildings owned by the municipality can be subjected to the tax. Once the tax is imposed on such a building it would be payable by the occupier if he holds it as a lessee of the municipality. There is nothing anomalous in such taxation because the tax is not levied by the municipality on itself but on the lessee.
 [On the above view the court did not find it necessary to decide whether before the filing of the suit by the appellants a notice under s. 206-A of the Act was necessary.]
