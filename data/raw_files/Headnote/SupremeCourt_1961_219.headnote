 During the assessment year 1946-47, the assessee was carrying on speculative business in bullion at Delhi. It entered into transactions in the nature of forward transactions with parties at Bhatinda (in the Patiala State outside the taxable territories of British India) in which it suffered losses. The assessee claimed deduction of these losses in the computation of its income.
 Held, that the losses incurred in Bhatinda could not be taken into account in computing the income of the assessee in British India. Under the third proviso to s. 5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, that part of the business of the assessee in which the losses occurred at Bhatinda was to be deemed to be a separate business, and consequently the losses incurred in non-taxable territory could not be taken into consideration for purposes of Excess Profits Tax. The language of the third proviso to s. 5 was one of exclusion and made the Act inapplicable to profits etc. of the part of the business which arose in non-taxable territories.
