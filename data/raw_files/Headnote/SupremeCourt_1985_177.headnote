 The Respondent-assessee in the Civil Appeals had an unabsorbed business 1088 of Rs. 67534 and unabsorbed depreciation of Rs. 1,78,154 at the end of assessment year 1950-51. The respondent's income without taking into account the current depreciation was Rs. 50,624 in 1951-52 and Rs.
 64332 in 1952-53. The amount of current depreciation was, however, Rs. 58,140 in 1951-52 and Rs. 44,580 in 1952-53.
 The respondent contended before I.T.O. that before deducting the current depreciation from the above profits the unabsorbed 1088 of the earlier year 1950-51 should be first set off. The I.T.O. held that the carried forward 1088 could not be given priority over the current year's depreciation in the matter of set off and completed the assessment Accordingly. Aggrieved by the order of I.T.O., the respondent preferred appeals for both the years before the A.A.C. who accepted the same holding that unabsorbed carried forward business 1088 should be set off first in each year before deducting the current year's depreciation. On further appeals by the appellant Revenue the Appellate Tribunal restored the order of the I.T.O. But, the High Court in a reference at the instance of the respondent-assessee answered the question in favour of the assessee. Similar question of law arose for decision in the Tax Reference Case.
 Counsel for the Revenue contended before the Supreme Court That on proper construction of the proviso (b) to s.
 10(2) (vi) read with the proviso (b) to s. 24(2) of the 1922 Act (equivalent 557 to 8.32(2) read with 8.72(2) of the 1961 Act), it is apparent that unabsorbed carried forward losses of the earlier years have been given priority over unabsorbed depreciation of the earlier years but not over the current year's depreciation for, under proviso (b) to 8. 10(2) (vi) it is the carry forward (actual words used are 'added to') of unabsorbed depreciation to the following previous year that is made subject to the proviso (b) to 8. 24(2), that is to say, the preference given to the unabsorbed carried forward losses of the earlier years under proviso (b) to 8.
 24(2) is over the unabsorbed depreciation and not over the current depreciation. On the other hand, counsel for the assessees strongly relied upon the legal fiction arising from the deeming provision contained in priviso (b) to 8.
 10(2) (vi) of the 1922 Act and S. 32(2) of the 1961 Act as a result whereof the unabsorbed depreciation is not merely carried forward to the following previous year but is deemed to be the depreciation for that year and, therefore, contended that this entire aggregate depreciation is made subject to proviso (b) to 8. 24(2) of the 1922 Act or to s.
 72(2) (of the 1961 Act). Counsel urged that his legal fiction must be given full effect without any reservation and, therefore, between the aggregate amount of depreciation and the unabsorbed carried forward losses priority has to be given to the latter in the matter of set off.
 Allowing the appeals and answering the question in the Tax Reference against the assessee, ^ 
 HELD: 1.1 The unabsorbed carried forward losses cannot be given preference over current depreciation in the matter of set off in computing an assessee's income for any particular assessment year. 1567 
 1.2 A close scrutiny of the relevant provisions of the 1922 Act as also the 1961 Act clearly shows that the computation of income under the head "profits and gains of business" of any particular assessment year is required to be done after making certain allowances specified in sub-s.
 (2) of 8.10 of the 1922 Act and after allowing certain deductions in accordance with the provisions contained in 
88. 30 to 43-A of the 1961 Act; in other words it is the net profits and gains after the specified deductions are made that are subjected to tax; one of such deductions pertains to depreciation allowance at the prescribed rate of percentage of the written down value of the business asset;
 and this is provided in s. 10 (2) (vi) of the 1922 Act in 8.
 32(1) of the 1961 Act. Upto this stage of computation no question of either carry forward of unabsorbed depreciation of the earlier 558 years or carry forward of unabsorbed business losses of earlier years arises. In other words, the normal accountancy principle has to be applied in arriving at the net income from, business for that year by debiting the Current year's depreciation. The question is whether any deviation from this normal rule of accountancy is contemplated by proviso (b to s. 10(2) (vi) read with proviso (b) to s. 24(2) of the 1922 Act or by s. 32(2) read with s. 72(2) of the 1961 Act and it is here that the aspect of proper construction of these provisions arises. [565 E-H, 566 A] 
 1.3 It is clear that proviso (b) to 8. 10(2) (vi) of the 1922 Act 18 in two parts and provides for two things;
 its first part provides for a carry forward of unabsorbed depreciation and its second part provides for clubbing the said carried forward depreciation with the current year's depreciation and deeming the aggregate to be the current year's depreciation. However, carrying forward to the unabsorbed depreciation ant the teeming provision in proviso (b) is not absolute but is subject to the proviso (b) to s.
 24(2). had proviso (b) to s. 24(2) not been enacted by the Legislature the-result would have been that the aggregate depreciation would have been deducted first out of the profits and gains in preference to unabsorbed business losses which might have been carried forward under s. 24(2) but as such losses can be carried forward only for limited number of years the assessee would in certain circumstances have in his books losses which he might not be able to set off even within the time limit during which the set off is permitted. In order to prevent such a situation the legislature enacted proviso (b) to s.24(2). And proviso (b) to 8. 24(2) expressly states "where depreciation allowance 18 under clause (b) of the proviso to clause (vi) of sub-s.2 of s.10 also to be carried for rd, effect shall first be given to the provisions of this sub-section. In other worts, lt clearly provides that in the matter of set off the unabsorbed business losses of the earlier years will have preference over unabsorbed depreciation that is required to be carried forward under proviso (b) to s. 10(2) (vi) and no preference over the current depreciation is intended. Since the provisions of the 1961 Act are in pari materia with the corresponding provisions under the 1922 Act the same conclusion must follow under the 1961 Act.

 134 ITR 56 559 (2) It is true that proviso (b) to s.10(2) (vi) creates a legal fiction and under that fiction unabsorbed depreciation either with or without current year's depreciation is deemed to be the current year's depreciation but it is well settled, as has been observed by Supreme Court in Bengal Immunity Company Ltd. v. The State of Bihar [1955] 2 SCR 603 at p. 606 that legal fictions are created only for some definite purpose and these must be limited to the purpose and should not be extended beyond that legitimate field. Clearly, the avowed purpose of the legal fictions created by the deeming provisions contained in proviso (b) to s. 10(2) (vi) is to make the unabsorbed carried forward depreciation partake of the same character as the current depreciation in the following year, so that it is available unlike unabsorbed carried forward business 1088, for being set off against other heads of income of that year.
