 The three appellants were prosecuted for various offences under the Indian Penal Code and acquitted by the trial court. On appeal, the High Court of Punjab convicted one of the appellants under ss. 330 and 348 of the Code and all the appellants under s. 201 of the Code while acquitting them in respect of the charge under s. 304. The sentence passed under s. 201 was three years rigorous imprisonment each, the court holding that the appellants had removed evidence of the offence culpable homicide. In appeal to the Supreme Court by special leave, the appellants contended that the only offences proved to have been committed were under ss.
 330 and 348 and therefore the fourth paragraph of s. 201 applied and under it the sentence could not exceed one- fourth of the longest term of imprisonment of the offences under ss. 330 and 348 which worked out at one year and nine months. The contention of the respondent State on the other hand was that the term of imprisonment that could be imposed under s. 201 did not depend on the actual offence committed the evidence of which had been destroyed but on what the accused believed that offence to have been and therefore the sentence imposed in the present case was fully within its terms. It was stressed that the words in the first paragraph of s. 201 were "knowing or having reason to believe that an offence had been committed," but in the second paragraph the words were "knows or believes to have been committed." 
HELD (Per Rajagopala Ayyangar and Bachawat, JJ.) (i) The expression "knowing or having reason to believe" in the first paragraph and the expression "knows or believes" in the second paragraph are used in the same sense. If it be supposed that the word "believes" was used in a sense different from the expression "having reason to believe", it would be necessary for the purpose of inflicting punishment upon the accused to prove that he "believes" in addition to "having reason to believe". We cannot impute to the legislature an intention that an accused who is found guilty of the offence under the first paragraph would escape punishment under the succeeding paragraphs unless some additional fact or state of mind is proved. [324 A-D] (ii) If the contention of the State were to be accepted, the erroneous belief or delusion of the accused would furnish the measure of punishment 2nd he would be punishable under the second paragraph with imprisonment extending to seven years. On this interpretation it is possible that a person who removes the evidence of an offence may be liable to a heavier punishment than the person who committed the main offence as when the actual offence committed is under s. 323 but the accused under s. 201 removes the blood-marks caused by the offence in the belief that they were caused by murder. It does not stand to reason that s. 201 provides for punishing a minor offence more severely than the principal offence. [325 B-D] 317 Chinna Gangappa, In re : I.L.R. (1931) 54 Mad. 68, considered and interpreted.
 (iii)The word "offence" wherever used in the first, second, third and fourth paragraphs of s. 201 means some real offence which in fact has been committed and not some offence which the accused imagines to have been committed.
 In the present case it had not been established that the offence under s. 304 was committed by the appellants or by anybody else. Only offences under ss. 330 and 348 I.P.C.
 has been proved to have been committed. [324 G-H] (iv)By the same act, namely, burning of the dead body of Raja Ram, the appellants caused the evidence of two offences namely s. 330 and 348 to disappear. Taking a strict view of the matter it must be held that by the same act the appellants committed two offences under s. 201. But normally, no court should award two separate punishment& for the same act constituting two offences under s. 2o1. Under s. 330 the maximum punishment is seven years' imprisonment and therefore the accused are liable to a maximum of one- fourth of seven years' imprisonment i.e. one year and nine months. [327 A-C] Per Sarkar, J.-(i) There is no reason to dispute the proposition that there must first be an actual offence in order that there may be evidence of it which is destroyed.
 But this does not furnish an answer to the contention for the State. Suppose an offence is committed but is believed to be of a graver nature than it actually is. There can be no objection in principle in such a case to a law which makes the punishment of the person who destroys the evidence of that offence to depend on what he believed it to have been. [320 C-F] (ii)But even if the interpretation suggested for the state were accepted the sentence imposed in the present case could not be upheld. In order that that interpretation might assist the State it has to be shown that the appellants believed that an offence under s. 304 had been committed so that the case could he brought under paragraph 3. The High Court had not come to a finding that an offence under S. 304 had been committed by the appellants, in fact they were acquitted of that charge. The most that can on the facts be reasonably said against the appellants is that they knew or believed that an offence of grievous hurt had been committed under s. 325. The longest term of imprisonment for that offence being seven years, the appellants could at the most given under the fourth paragraph of s. 201 one-fourth of that term, namely, one year and nine months.
