 The Kerala Additional Sales Tax Act, 1978 sought to impose an additional sales tax at 10% of the rate of tax already imposed under the Kerala General Sales Tax Act, 1963, on all taxable sales and purchases in the State.
 The assesses challenged before the High Court, the levy of additional sales tax in respect of their inter-state sales on the ground that the said levy could not be considered as a levy under the sales tax law of the appropriate State within the meaning of Section 8(2-A) of the Central Sales Tax Act, and for the purpose of levying Central Sales Tax only the rate of tax as per the original Kerala General Sales Tax Act, 1963 shall be taken into account. It was also contended that the rate of tax on interstate sales payable under Section 8 of the Central Sales Tax Act cannot be increased by any amendment or legislation by the State.
 The High Court having upheld the challenge, the State has preferred the present appeals by special leave.
 On the question whether the additional tax levied could also be considered as sales tax under the Sale tax law of the State, for the purpose of Central Sales Tax levy.
 141 Allowing the appeals, this Court, 
HELD :1.1 The definition provided by Section 2(i) of the Central sales Tax Act does not say that the sales tax law or the general sales tax law which levies taxes on sale or purchase of goods shall be under a single enactment. What is relevant is whether the tax partakes the character of sales tax or purchase tax. Any other construction would restrict the applicability of Section 8(2-A) of the Central Sales Tax Act to the sales tax law that was in force in 1956 when the Central Sales Tax Act came into force and any amendment to the local law would not have any effect on the applicability of that provision. If a particular intra-state sale transaction in a particular assessment year is subjected to a particular rate of tax that automatically gets reflected in and had to be taken into consideration for finding the rate and the applicability of Section 8(2-A) or section 8(2) (b) of Central Sales Tax Act. [146F-G; 147-A] 
 1.2 Instead of an additional Sales Tax Act, if the legislature has simply amended the Kerala General sales tax Act by varying the rate, automatically that will come in for consideration and application of the provision of Section 8(2) (b) and 8 (2-A) of the Central Sales Tax Act. For this purpose amendment of the State Act is not considered as an amendment of the Central Sales Tax Act. But since the rate applicable to the intra-state sales at a particular point of time is a relevant consideration for finding out the rate of tax on inter-state sale the amendment of the State Act automatically has the effect of changing the rate provided under Section 8 of the Central Sales Tax Act. That is not to say that the Central Act is amended by the State Legislature. The rates of tax in certain cases under the Central Act are linked to the rates fixed under the local Acts and that is how the amendment of the local Act affects the rates under the Central Act. It is still the Central Act that is applied but only for purposes of fixing the rate of tax leviable under the Central Sales Tax Act, the provisions of the local Act are looked into. So construed there is not doubt that in all cases where the rate of tax under the local law is less than four per cent that will be the rate applicable to the inter-state sales of the same commodity if the provisions of Section 8(2-A) of the Central Sales Tax Act are applicable. The dealer undoubtedly would be paying at the rate as enhanced by the Additional Sales Tax Act and therefore that will be the rate that is including the additional tax, that is to be taken into consideration for finding out the applicability of Section 8(2-A) of the Central Sales Tax Act and the rate of tax in respect of his inter-state sales turnover. Therefore the respondents are liable to pay sales tax at the rate including the additional sales tax in respect of their inter-state sale under the Central Sales Tax assessment orders.
 142 
 1.3 For the purpose of applicability of Section 8(2-A) of the CST Act one has to look to the rate of tax applicable for the time being under the local Act and not a rate of tax which was applicable under the local Act at the time when the CST Act was enacted. Any amendment in the local Act ultimately will have a reflection in the assessment of the inter-state sales. [147A-F] 
 1.4 However, where a notification has been issued under Section 8(5) of the Central Sales Tax Act, the amendment to the State Act will not have any affect on the notification.
