 Section 9 of the Legal Practitioners Act, 1879, entitles a duly enrolled Mukhtar to "Practise" in any Civil Court, and s. 11 thereof empowers the High Court to make rules declaring .what shall be deemed to be the ,functions, powers and duties" of Mukhtars practising in the subordinate Courts. Rule 2 framed under s. 1 1 lays down that a Mukhtar shall not be allowed to address any Civil Court except for the purpose of "stating the nature. and effect of his application or to offer any legal argument or to examine any witness" without the leave of the Court. The petitioners contended that r. 2 was in excess of the rule-making power under s. 1 1 and was an unreasonable restriction on their rights under Art. 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution.
 Held, that ss. 9 and 1 1 of the Act must be read together and the right to "practise" given under s. 9 cannot be dissociated from the "functions, powers and duties of Mukhtars" as contemplated under s. 11. In declaring what shall be the functions, powers and duties of a Mukhtar the High Court may by its rules so delimit them as to regulate their right of practice in the Civil Courts, and such delimitation is no violation of their fundamental right to practise the profession as allowed under the Act.
