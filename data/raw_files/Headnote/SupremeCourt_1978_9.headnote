 
HELD : The notice issued to the Editor of the Times of India calling upon 'him to show cause why proceedings under Art.
 129 of the Constitution for contempt of the Supreme Court should not be initiated against him in respect ,of the statements made criticizing the judgment of this Court in A.
 D. M. Jabalpur v. S. Shukla (A.I.R. 1976 SC 1207) should be dropped. It is not ;a fit case where formal proceedings for contempt should be drawn up [582 A-B] Beg. C. J. (dissenting) There cannot be a grosser or clearer case of contempt of court than the implications of this document. [586 C] 1.The obvious suggestion and threat held out to Judges of the Court is that they will be maligned and punished if they could not in future so decide ,cases as to protect the interests or voice the opinions of whatever political or other sort of group those who have signed the document mentioned in the newspaper may represent. It implies nothing more nor less than blackmail to demoralise upright judges. People who could indulge in it certainly do not represent those who say that law, as found in the Constitution, must always be declared by Judges fearlessly and honestly. [586 A-C] 2.It is a serious matter if persons in the position of those whose names' are ,,given in the offending news item containing a vituperative attack upon a particular judgment of this Court are really signatories of the document. The attack is primarily irrational and abusive, even if it is partially based on ignorance and 'the rest on misconception.
 [582 E-F] 3.It may be that some people go on making assertions about judgments of this Court without reading or under standing them. But, the way in which this 'has been going on, as a part of a consistent scheme to malign the Court and its Judges, shows that their intention is to deliberately shake the confidence of the public in this Court In any case, this would be the result it nothing is done to check such a campaign of vilification. [583 E-F] 4.To blame and abuse the Judges after shutting one's eyes to what may be the shortcomings of his own case or the law, as it exists, may be forgiven ;in a certain type of litigant blinded by personal feelings. But, if those who ,purport to act pro bono publico to protect the Constitution and the law conduct themselves in this fashion and, if responsible daily newspapers publish what could be regarded, in addition to being defamatory and abusive, as gross contempt of this Court, such people should be reminded of what the law says about it and what their duties are to the Court, to the public and to individuals maligned. [586 C-D] 5.Even if the case could be one in which two views were possible on any ,question, no newspaper could be allowed to describe one of the two views as a misdeed' and suggesting that Judges should have held what they could not honestly believe to be correct in law. It was stated that the Judges who gave such decisions would be ostracised in other countries. Those who drafted the document seemed to be aware of the perils of their irresponsible language. They, therefore, took shelter behind some article in a foreign newspaper presumably based on sources interested in distortion or no better informed and with no better motives than those quoted in the news item.
