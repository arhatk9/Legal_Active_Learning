 Under Section 14(1) of the Tamil Nadu Shops and Establishments Act, 1947, "no person employed in any establishment shall be required or allowed to work for more than eight hours in any day forty-eight hours in any week, and under Section 31", where any person employed in any establishment is required to work overtime, he shall be entitled, in respect of such overtime work, to wages at twice the ordinary rate of wages." In the establishment of Philips India Ltd. which switched over to five p days of week, with effect from March 29,1965 the total number of working hours per week was fixed at 39 hours with a daily working hour of 7-3/4 hours from Monday through Thursday and 8 hours on Friday. The company also Introduced the rate of overtime payment at 1 1/2 time the ordinary wages for work done over and above the maximum number of working hours per week as well as for working on holidays. This rate was admissible for overtime work done beyond 39 hours per week but this was subject to an important condition that whenever the total working hours exceed either 8 hours per day or 48 hours per week, the employees were entitled to over time at twice the ordinary wages as mandated by Section 31 of the Act. In the establishment of the State Bank of India which is governed by the Desai Award, the daily working hours from Monday to Friday was 6-1/2 hours a day and 4 hours on Saturday, totaling a weekly 36-1/2 hours. The rate of overtime allowance was 1-1/2 times the wages for every quarter of an hour of overtime work done for which payment have to be made, 492 Claim petitions were filed by the employers of Philips India Ltd., and the State Bank of India before different Labour Courts under Section 33(c)(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 inviting the Labour Court to compute the monetary benefits in respect of overtime allowance for the work done beyond the prescribed hours of work per week in terms of section 31 of the Act. Their contention was that they were entitled to overtime wages at double the rate of ordinary wages for work done in excess of 39 hours/36-1/2 hours a week.
 Though the matters were before two operate Labour Courts and were decided at different intervals, both the Labour Courts held that Section 14 of the Act does not prescribe number of working hours per day but it merely specified maximum number of working hours that can be introduced by an employer in an establishment governed by the Act. But once the employer chooses to prescribe working hours per day or total number of working hours per week less than permissible under section 14, the rate of overtime allowance as prescribed in section 31 would be applicable to the workmen notwithstanding the fact that the prescribed number of working hours per day or total number of working hours per week were less than the maximum which the statute permitted. Accordingly, both the Labour Courts computed the monetary benefits by granting overtime allowance at the rate of double the ordinary wages and the difference between what was paid by the employer in each case at 1-l/2 times the ordinary wages and what became payable as per the Courts order was directed to be paid to each employee, Aggrieved thereby the company and the Bank filed in all five writ petitions questioning the correctness of the said decision, Due to a conflict of opinion in the matter of interpretation of Sections 14 and 31 by two earlier decisions of the Madras High. Court, the matter was referred to a Division Bench, The High Court called in aid Section 50 of the Act to observe that if the existing right and privileges of an employee in any establishment are more favourable to him than those created by the Act, the same were preserved and held; (i) that once the employer prescribed daily working hours as well as the weekly total, work rendered in excess of the proscribed working hours would constitute overtime work and when the statute prescribes the rate of overtime work, it is obligatory upon the employer to make payment at the statutory rate, (ii) that even if Section 14(1) was interpreted as prescribing normal working hours and that work in excess of the normal working hours so prescribed would constitute overtime which would attract Section 31, yet once the employer prescribed hours less than the statutorily permissible working hours, any work done beyond the prescribed working hours would be overtime work and the rate of overtime work should be governed by Section 31 of the Act, The High Court accordingly dismissed all the petitions.
 Hence the appeals by special leave, Allowing the appeals, the Court ^ 
 HELD:1.1 A bare perusal of Section 14(1) of the Tamilnadu Shops 493 and Establishment Act, shows that it prescribes a ceiling on working hours. Obviously, it cannot be interpreted to mean that the employer must provide maximum number of working hours as therein set out in the establishment governed by the Act. It is open to the employer to prescribe working hours for a day and total number of working hours for a week less than the ceiling prescribed by the statute. Section 14 puts an embargo on the employers' right to prescribe working hours beyond therein prescribed subject however, to its liability to pay higher rate of wages for the overtime work done. [500B-C] 
 1.2 The proviso to Section 14(1) makes it very clear that the upper limit fixed by the substantive provision can be exceeded up to the ceiling fixed by the proviso and not beyond in any case. This is a prohibition in public interest for safeguarding the health which may be adversely affected by fatigue, stress and strain consequent upon continuous work daily or for total number of hours in a week. This simultaneously ensures a weekly off day even if the employer prescribes number of working hours as provided in Section 14(1).
 [500D-E] 
 1.3 Section 14(1) upon its true construction permits an employer to prescribe daily working hours not exceeding 8 hours a day and total number of working hours at 48 in a week. By the proviso the employer can take ; overtime work and that the bar imposed by sub-section (1) of Section 14 may be breached to the extent provided in the proviso, if the working hours do not exceed 10 hours in any day and total number of working hours at 48 in a week. 8 hours a day and 48 hours in a week would constitute normal working hours. Anything in excess of 8 hours a day but not exceeding 10 hours a day and 48 hours a week and not exceeding 54 hours a week will constitute overtime. [500E-G] 
 2.1 The expression used in Section 14(1) is "no such person" meaning thereby that person, who would be required to work 8 hours a day or 48 hours a week, may be allowed to work in excess of that limit subject to payment of overtime wages. [500H] 
 2.2 The expression "such person" in the proviso to Section 14 refers to person who is required to work for 8 hours a day and 48 hours a week.
 [502B] 
 2.3 The expression "such establishment" in the proviso to Section 14 would indicate that establishment which has prescribed the working hours as set out in the main part of the section namely, 8 hours a day and 48 hours in a week.
 In such an establishment overtime work for such a person would only be that work which would be done in excess of either 8 hours a day or 48 hours a week. Such overtime work has to be compensated at twice the ordinary rate of wages prescribed in Section 31. [502C-D] 
 2.4 The expression "such overtime" can refer to one contemplated by the proviso to Section 14(1? and no other.
 Reading Sections 14 and 31 together 494 a scheme emerges. The statute first puts an embargo on the power of the employers to prescribe normal working hours, not exceeding 8 hours per day and 48 hours per week. The proviso makes it obligatory to pay overtime wages for work in excess of the prescribed hours as set out in Section 14(1).
 [502D-E] 
 2.5 The employer would ordinarily prescribe wages for normal working hours. Once the wages for normal working hours per day and cumulative for the week or month are prescribed, they would be styled as ordinary rate of wages.
 Thus the employer will be liable to pay to the employee wages at the ordinary rate of wages for prescribed hours of work as permissible in Section 14(1) and whenever he takes work in excess of the prescribed hours of work the rate for overtime work prescribed by Section 31 would come into play [502F-G] 
 3.1 The canon of statutory construction is that the statute must be read as a whole. This is a general rule applicable to all statutes and known as "construction ex visceribus actus or the "elementary rule" or "settled rule".
 The only recognised exception to this well-laid principle is that it cannot be called in aid to alter the meaning of what is of itself clear and explicit.

 It is undoubtedly true that Section 14(1) does not prescribe normal hours of work but merely puts an embargo on the employers' right to prescribe daily and weekly hours of work beyond permissible under the statute. But where the statute itself prescribes such permission hours of work and also makes it obligatory to pay overtime wages and prescribes rates, it can only mean work in excess of the maximum hours of work permissible under the statute which alone would attract the rate of payment for overtime work "Such overtime work" in Section 31 would and would only mean overtime as understood in the proviso to Section 14(1) which has reference to maximum hours of work permitted by Section14(1). This is how the statute has to be read as a whole.
 [506D-F] 
 3.3 Applying this well-laid canon of construction, the expression "rate of overtime wages" in Section 31 has to be understood and interpreted in the light of the provision contained in Section 14(1) read with its proviso. By reference to the statutory provisions and unhampered by precedents, it becomes clear that when normal working hours as permitted by Section 14(1) are prescribed by establishment for his employees working in the establishment to which the Act applies, wages for work in excess of such prescribed hours of work will have to be paid at the rate prescribed in Section 31. The framers of the 495 statute provided the whole scheme by first putting an embargo on the maximum number of working house payable at ordinary rates and then permitting overtime work up to the ceiling, simultaneously making it obligatory to pay overtime wages at the rate prescribed in the very statute. [503D-F] 
 3.4 Where the employer prescribed working hours per day or total number of hours of work per week less than the maximum permissible under the statute, in the absence of the definition of that term in the Act, any work taken in excess of the prescribed hours of work would be overtime work and the employer would be liable to pay some compensation but not necessarily the statutory compensation which would be attracted only when the employer takes work in excess of the maximum hours of work prescribed by the statute. In such a situation the rate of wages payable would be as to what ought to be the rate of wages payable. Such a rate must be the subject matter of agreement between the parties or an award by industrial adjudication. Any work taken for a period in excess of the maximum permissible under the statute would indisputedly attract the statutory rate of overtime of wages.
