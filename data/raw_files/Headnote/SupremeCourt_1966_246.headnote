 The appellant was the tenant of certain land which was "rented land" within the -meaning of s. 2(f) of the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act III of 1949, and which was taken by him for the purpose of a firewood stall. The respondent filed 'an application for the ejectment of the appellant from the land mainly on the ground that he needed the land himself to erect a residential house and claimed that he was entitiled an order of ejectment under s.
 13(3)(a)(ii) of the Act. The landlord could an order of ejectment under s. 13(3)(a)(ii) of the Act. The Rent Controller dismissed the application on the view that the landlord could only obtain an order under s. 13 (3) (a) (ii) to have the land vacated if he needed it for a business purpose. However, the Appellate authority allowed the appeal holding that it was open to the landlord to get a tenant ejected whatever may be the purpose for which he required the land for his own use. The decision was upheld in revision by the High Court.
 On appeal to this Court, 
HELD : As the respondent landlord required the land not for business or trade principally but only for constructing a house for himself, he was not entitled to-eject the 'appellant under s. 13(3)(a)(ii). [55 D] Although sub-sclause (a) of s.13(3)(a)(ii) which provides for the landlord to be put in possession of the land if he requires it "for his own use" is not qualified, the fact that sub-cls. (b) and (c) 'require that the landlord should not be in possession of any rented land for his own business and should not have given up possession of any other rented land, i.e., land which he was principally using for business, shows that he can only take advantage of sub- cl.(c) if he is able to show that he requires the rented land for business. Otherwise the restrictions contained in sub-cl. (b) and sub-cl. (c) would become meaningless.
 Reading sub-cls. (a) (b) and (c) together there can be no doubt that sub-cl. (a) is restricted to land required for business or trade. [54 G-55 G] Municipal committee, Abohar v. Daulat Ram, I.L.R. [1959] Punjab 1131; overruled.
