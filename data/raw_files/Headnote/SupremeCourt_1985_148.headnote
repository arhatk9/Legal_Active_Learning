 The respondent-Firm was a Roller Flour Mills and held a licence under the Wheat Roller Flour Mills (Licensing and Control) Order, 1957. Clause 3 of the said Order provides that no owner or person in charge of a roller Mill shall manufacture or cause to be manufactured any wheat product except under and in accordance with the terms and conditions of a licence issued under the Order. The licence was an annual licence renewable from year to year and liable to suspension or cancellation in the event of contravention of the Control Order or any of the conditions of the licence.
 The licensee was required to abide by any directions issued by the licensing authority in regard to purchase of wheat, the extraction of maida, suji and rawa and also in regard to the distribution or disposal of the wheat products.
 Wheat is supplied to the respondent under the orders of the Government of India. The respondent grinds the wheat and supplies maida and suji emerging from that process to the holders of permits issued by the District Food and Supplies Officer.
 The respondent was assessed for the years 1964-65 to 1967-68 to sales tax under the Punjab General Sales Tax Act, 1948 on the turnover of the supplies effected by it. During the assessment proceedings it was contended that the transactions entered into by it did not constitute "sales" within the meaning of the Act and as such sales tax should not be levied. The assessing authority relying on the decision in the Excise and Taxation Officer (Assessing Authority) Hissar and Another v. Jaswant Singh [1971] 27 S.T.C. 582 rejected the pntention and assessed the firm. The assessment orders were maintained in appeal and in second appeal also.
 15 At the instance of the assessee, the High Court called for a reference and held that as the respondent was obliged to follow the instructions of the concerned authority in regard to the purchase of wheat, or the extraction of maida, suji and rawa as well as in regard to the distribution and disposal of such products, it followed the decision in Food Corporation of India & Another v. State of Punjab & Others [1971] 27 S.T.C. 582 and took the view that there was no 'sale'.
 In the appeal to this Court on the question whether the transaction affected by the respondent fall within the definition of "sale" under Clause (h) of Sec. 2 of the Punjab General Sales Tax Act, 1948.
 Allowing the appeals ^ 
 HELD: In Vishnu Agencies (Pvt.) Ltd. etc. v. Commercial Tax Officer "Others etc. [1977] INSC 240; [1978] 2 S.C.R. 433, this Court held that notwithstanding the conditions imposed by the statutory framework of the Control Order within which the dealer operated the transaction effected by him must clearly be regarded as sales. The instant case is covered by that decision. The transactions effected by the respondent are 'sales' liable to tax. The Judgment of the High Court is set aside. The question referred to the High Court is answered in the affirmative in favour of the appellant and against the respondent. [19 D-F]
