 The Assessee was a Hindu Undivided Family. The father of the Karta of the HUF died in an air crash. On his death a sum of over Rs. 2 lakhs was received by the Karta from the Insurance Company on account of the insurance policy covering the life of his father. The income derived from the said amount was treated as his personal income and assessed in his personal assessment, and it continued to be assessed in the personal assessment of the Karta even after formation of the HUF on his marriage and the birth of a son. This position continued till the assessment year 1959-60.
 For the first time in the assessment year 1960-61 the Income Tax Officer treated the income from the insurance amount as that of the HUF and assessed the income in the hands of the HUF. Being aggrieved the assessee appealed and the Appellate Assistant Commissioner set aside the assessment holding that the income was the personal income of the Karta and not of the HUF.
 The Revenue preferred an appeal to the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. A similar appeal was also preferred to the Tribunal by the Revenue for assessment year 1962-63.
 Both the appeals were disposed of by a common order, whereby it was held that the income in question was that of the HUF and was liable to be assessed as such.
 The Tribunal referred to the High Court at the instance of the assessee-HUF the question, "whether the amount received from 851 the Insurance Company on account of the accident Insurance Policy covering the risk of his father was correctly treated as ancestral property." The assessee also filed applications for injunction and stay under section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure invoking the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court.
 In the applications for stay it was contended that for the subsequent years 1963-64 & 1964-65 similar appeals had been filed by the Revenue, before the Tribunal and were pending, that for the assessment years 1965-66 to 1969-70 the orders of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner were against the assessee and the assessee-HUF had preferred appeals to the Tribunal which were also pending, that in the said appeals preferred by the assessee HUF, on application by the assessee the Tribunal had granted stay of recovery of the tax demanded, on the condition that the assessee should furnish adequate security, that since the matter relating to the two assessment years (1960-61 and 1962-63) were before the High Court under section 66(1) of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922/section 256(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 similar order of stay should be granted by the High Court because prejudice would be caused to the assessee if in spite of full tax being paid by the karta in his personal assessment, the HUF is asked to pay tax over again in respect of the same income.
 The Revenue opposed the aforesaid applications for stay, contending in its counter-affidavit that under the provisions of the Income Tax Acts of 1922 and 1961 the High Court exercised only an advisory or consultative jurisdiction, and consequently had no jurisdiction or power to grant stay of the recovery of tax as prayed for in the application, and that grant of stay by the High Court and this court had in fact been prohibited by the two Acts of 1922 and 1961.
 The High Court rejected the preliminary objections raised by the Revenue and granted stay of realisation of taxes. It found that there should be stay on terms and granted stay on condition that the assessee should furnish adequate security for the said amount to the satisfaction of the concerned Income Tax Officer.
 In the appeals to this Court: on the question of jurisdiction of the High Court and Supreme Court to grant stay or pass interim orders in pending references under section 66 of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 and section 256 of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
 Allowing the Appeals to this Court, 852 ^ 
 HELD : 1. The High Court in answering a question under section 66 of 1922 Act or section 256 of 1961 Act does not exercise original, appellate or revisional jurisdiction but only advisory jurisdiction. [866 C; 870 C] 
 2. Rendering advice on the question of law referred to the courts has nothing to do with the recovery of tax or granting stay in respect of the same. [870 G] 
 3. It cannot be said that the High Court has inherent power or incidental power in the matter of a reference pending before it to grant stay of realisation or to grant an injunction. That must remain within the jurisdiction of the appellate authority and pendency of a reference does not detract from that jurisdiction of the Appellate Authority.
 The High Court was, therefore in error in the instant case in exercising its jurisdiction by passing an order for stay of realisation under section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in a pending reference. The High Court could have exercised its power if the Appellate Authority had not properly exercised its jurisdiction, not in reference jurisdiction but by virtue of its jurisdiction under Art.
 226 or Article 227 of the Constitution of India in appropriate cases. But that was not so in the instant case.[870 H - 871 B] Sridhar v. Commissioner of Wealth Tax, 153 at 543, at 547; Dwarka Prasad Baja v. Commissioner of Income Tax, West Bengal-I, 126 I.T.R. 219. approved.
 Polisetti Narayana Rao v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Hyderabad, 29 I.T.R. 222, over-ruled.
 
 4. In answering questions or disposing of references either under section 66 of 1922 Act or section 256 of 1961 Act, the High Courts do not exercise any jurisdiction conferred upon them by the Code of Civil Procedure or the Characters or by the Acts establishing the respective High Courts. In respect of certain matters jurisdictions exercised by the High Court must be kept separate from the concept of inherent powers or incidental powers in exercising jurisdiction under section 66 of 1922 Act or section 256 of 1961 Act. Section 66 of Income-tax Act of 1961 is a special jurisdiction of a limited nature conferred not by the Code of Civil Procedure or by the Charters or by the special Acts constituting such High Courts but by the special provisions of Income-Tax Act 1922 or 1961 for the limited purpose of obtaining High Court's opinion on questions of law. In giving 853 that opinion properly if any question of incidental or ancillary power arises such as giving an opportunity or restoring a reference dismissed without hearing or giving some additional time to file paper book, such powers inhered to the jurisdiction conferred upon it. But such incidental powers can not be so construed as to confer the power of stay of recovery of taxes pending a reference which lie in the domain of an appellate authority. The concept of granting stay in a reference ex debito justitiae therefore, does not arise. That concept might arise in case of the Appellate Authority exercising its power to grant stay where there is no express provision. Ex debito justitiae is to do justice between the parties.

 5. In an appropriate case, if the assessee feels that a stay of recovery pending disposal of the reference is necessary or is in the interest of justice, then the assessee is entitled to apply before the Appellate Authority to grant a stay until disposal of reference by the High Court or until such time as the Appellate Authority thought fit. But in case the Appellate Authority acted without jurisdiction or in excess jurisdiction or in improper exercise of the jurisdiction, then the decision of such Appellate Authority can be corrected by the High Court by issuing appropriate writs under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution. [869 H - 870 B] 
 6. Prior to 1918, there was no provision for reference to the High Court at all in respect of any decision by the revenue authorities. In Act VII of 1918, section 51 contained this provision under which the Chief Revenue Authority was empowered to refer a case to the High Court when any questions arose regarding the interpretation of any of the provisions of the Act or of any rule made thereunder.
 The said authority could do so 854 (i) either suo motu (ii) on reference from a subordinate authority or (iii) on the application of the assessee. This is no part of the Civil or appellate or revisional jurisdiction of the High Court. [858 G-H] 
 7. Section 66 of the Act of 1922 provides that within certain time either at the instance of the assessee or at the instance of the Revenue, the Tribunal might refer a question of law for the opinion of the High Court. It also empowered the assessee to make an application to the High Court in case the Tribunal refused to refer the question after drawing up a statement of case. Section 66A provides for reference to be heard by Benches of High Courts and appeals in certain cases to this Court. Under Section 256 of 1961 Act, the provision of reference to the High Court is the same as under section 66 of 1922 Act. [859 B, F, 860 C] 
 8. Once certain words in an Act of Parliament had received a judicial construction in one of the superior courts, and the legislature repeated these without any alteration in a subsequent statute, the legislature must be taken to have used them according to the meaning which a court of competent jurisdiction had given to them. This rule of interpretation affords only a valuable presumption as to the meaning of the language employed in a statute. Where a judicial interpretation is well settled and well recognised the rule ought doubtless, to receive effect, but must be a question of circumstances whether Parliament was to be presumed to have tacitly given statutory authority to a single judgment of a competent court so as to render that judgment, however, obviously wrong unexaminable by the Highest Court.
