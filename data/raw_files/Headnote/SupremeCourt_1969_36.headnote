 The respondent was recruited as a constable in undivided Punjab in 1934 and in 1946 became an Assistant Sub- Inspector. In 1950 he was posted at Delhi. In 1955 he was confirmed in the above rank by the Senior Superintendent of Police, Delhi. In 1957 there was an accusation against him of having received illegal gratification in a case he was investigating, whereupon after a summary inquiry the Superintendent of Police (City) Delhi passed an order of censure against him. On a review of this order under r.
 16.28 of the Punjab Police Rules, 1934 the Deputy Inspector General of Police passed an order cancelling the order of censure and further ordered that the respondent should be dealt with departmentally. The conduct of the departmental inquiry was entrusted to the Superintendent of Police Central District, New Delhi who asked the District Magis- trate for the necessary sanction under r. 16.38 of the Punjab Police Rules 1934. On receiving the sanction the Inquiry Officer proceeded with the inquiry and found that the allegations against the respondent were substantially true. After a show cause notice he passed an order in 1958 dismissing the respondent from service. An appeal against the order of dismissal was rejected by the Deputy Inspector General and the subsequent revision was dismissed by the Inspector-General. The respondent there upon filed a writ petition in the Punjab High Court for quashing the dismissal order. The petition was dismissed by the Single Judge but the Division Bench held that the dismissal order could not be sustained in view of the fact that the inquiry was made in contravention of Ch. XVI r. 38 of the Punjab Police Rules. The Delhi Administration appealed to this Court.
