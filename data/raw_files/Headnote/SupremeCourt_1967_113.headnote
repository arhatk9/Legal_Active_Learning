 On July 1, 1949 the assessee who carried on business in Mysore State brought into his books of account an opening cash balance of Rs. 1,87,000. The Income-tax Officer held that out of the above sum Rs. 1,37,000 was the assessee's income from undisclosed sources. The assessee's explanations were rejected by the Income-tax Officer and in appeal by the Assistant Commissioner. The Appellate Tribunal considered that on the facts of the case it was not unlikely that on the relevant date the assessee had some cash but held Rs. 50,000 to be income from undisclosed sources observing : "[Counsel] for the assessee also stated that his client was prepared to be assessed on Rs. 50,000".
 In reference the High Court held that the Tribunal's conclusion was based on no evidence. The assessee appealed.
 
HELD : The function of the Tribunal hearing an appeal is purely judicial. It is under a duty to decide all question of fact and law raised in the appeal before it : for that purpose it must consider whether on the materials relied upon by the assessee his plea is made out. The Tribunal cannot make arbitrary decisions. Its order in the present case without recording any reasons in support of the estimate of unaccounted income could not, therefore, be sustained. There was also substance in the assessee's plea that evidence in his favour had not been properly considered and that his case had not been fairly tried.
