 The Government of Madras applied the provisions of the Madras Estates Rent Reduction Act, 1947 to the lands in the village Mallinadhapuram on the ground that the grant was of the whole village and hence an estate within the meaning of S. 3(2)(d) of the Madras Estates Land Act, 1908. The respondent and another person served a notice under S. 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure upon the Government of the State of Madras in which they challenged the above mentioned notification and asked the Government not to act upon it.
 Out of the two persons who gave the notice, the respondent alone filed the suit. The trial court held that the original grant was not of the entire village and was not so confirmed or recognised by the Government of the Province of Madras and therefore as it was not on "estate" within the meaning of S. 3(2)(d) of the Madras Estates Land Act the Madras Rent Reduction Act., 1947 did not apply to it. But the suit was dismissed on the ground that although two persons had given the notice under S. 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure, only one person had filed the suit. The High Court agreed with the trial court that the grant was not of an entire village but it also held that the notice was not defective and the suit was maintainable as it was a representative suit and the permission of the 946 court underOrder 1, r. 8 had been obtained in this case.
 The High Courtgranted the respondent the relief prayed for by him. Against theorder of the High Court, the appellant appealed to this Court.
 
HELD,(i) The suit was not liable to be dismissed. There was in thecircumstances of the case no illegality even though notice was given by two persons and the suit was filed by only on-,. The right to institute a representative suit can be exercised by one or more persons having an interest which is common with others and thatcan be exercised with the permission of the court. If the court grants permission to one person to institute a representative suitand if the person had served the notice under S. 80, the circumstances that an other person had joined him in serving the notice but did not join him in the suit, is not a sufficient ground for regarding the suit as defective.
 (ii)The permission of the court has to be obtained for in- stituting a representative suit and not for serving the notice. The Code of Civil Procedure contains no machinery for granting permission to a party seeking to serve a notice upon the Government or a public servant.
 (iii) The lands in dispute did not constitute an estate within the meaning of S. 3(2)(d) of the Madras Estates Land Act, 1908, and therefore the Madras Rent Reduction Act, 1947 did not apply to them.
