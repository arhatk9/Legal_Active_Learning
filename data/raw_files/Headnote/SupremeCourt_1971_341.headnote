 In 1957, the respondent, who was working as an Assistant Geologist in Class III Service, was sent on deputation as Vice-Principal of the School of Mines, in the State From 15th February, 1958, he was also doing the duties of the Principal. In September, 1958, the State Government appointed him as officiating Principal but on 3rd April 1959 modified the order and appointed him as temporary Officiating Principal with effect from the 15th February, 1958. On 9th January, 1967, the Mysore Education Department Service Rules were published by which appointment of the respondent, with effect from 15th February, 1958 was regu- larised. The appellant, who was the Principal of a Government Polytechnic, and was in Class 11 Service, contended that the respondent's appointment was in breach of the Mysore State Civil Services (General Recruitment) Rules, 1957, and the Mysore Education Department Services (Technical Education Department Recruitment) Rules, 1964, and offended Arts, 14 and 16 of the Constitution.
 The High Court held that the respondent was a local candidate within the meaning of the Mysore Government Seniority Rules, 1957, and therefore his appointment could be regularised with effect from any date.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) Rule 3 of the Mysore State Civil Services (General Recruitment) Rules, 1957, which were in force from February 1, 1958, speaks of the method of recruitment to the State Civil Service by competitive examination, or by selection, or by promotion. The respondent's appointment was not by competitive examination nor was it a case of direct recruitment either in the year 1958 or at any time.
 If it were a case of direct recruitment there would have been advertisements for the post, and candidate would have been selected on merit. [808 E-H] (2)The appointment of the respondent could not be said to be by promotion because, under r. 4 of the 1957 Rules, it should be on the basis of merit and suitability or on the basis of seniority-cum-merit from among persons eligible for promotion. Moreover, the State contended that it was not a case of promotion, but was a case of selection on the basis that the respondent was the only person fit for the post.
 [806 E-G; 811 C-D] (3)It is true that the rules of recruitment were not made until 1964. Even sothe three'-methods of recruitment are specific. If it is a case of electionit should have been after consulting the Public- Service commission orthe Advisory or Election Committee, or' the ;appointing authority, and should have been made after inviting applications. 'To say that the 800 appellant was the only eligible candidate, is to deny the rights of others to apply. [805 F; 808 E-H] (4)Rule 16 of the 1957 rules provides for relaxation of rules relating to appointment and qualifications, and one of the instances of relaxation is when the Government, for reasons to be recorded in writing, appoints an officer holding a post of equivalent grade by transfer from any other service of the State. But, in the present case, the respondent did not belong to a grade which Could be said to be equivalent, within the meaning of r. 8(1) of the Rules, to that of the Principal of School of Mines. Therefore, it could not be a case of transfer. In fact, the rule was neither available, nor acted on the present case. [806 G-H;
 807 A-C] (5)The State Government has no power to make a rule for regular rising an appointment under Art. 309 of the Constitution, since the Article speaks of rules for appointment and general conditions of service, Regu- larisation of appointment by stating that "notwithstanding any rules the appointment is regularised" strikes at the root of existing rules prescribing promotion, selection or competitive examination as methods of recruitment.
 Therefore the regularisation was in violation of the Article. [808 A-D] Champaklal Chimanlal Shah v. Union of India, [1964] 5 S.C.R.
 190 and State of Mysore v. Padmanabhacharya, [1966] 1 S.C.R.
 994, referred to.
 (6)(a) The contention that a rule under Art. 309 for regularisation would itself be a form of recruitment read with reference to the power under Art. 162 is unsound, because regularisation is not a form of appointment. [809 G] (b)In the present case, the regularisation with effect from February 15, 1958, notwithstanding any rules cannot be said to be in exercise of the power under Art. 162.
 Articles 162 and 309 operate in different areas, and when the Government acted under Art. 309 they cannot be said to have acted also Linder Art. 162 [809 G-H; 810 A-B] (c)If the appointment itself was in infraction of the Rules or in violation of the provisions of the Constitution, the illegality cannot be regularised.. Ratification or regularisation is possible of an act which is within the power and province of the authority and there has been some noncompliance with procedure which does not go to the root of the appointment. Article 162 does not confer either the power of regularisation nor the power to make rules for the recruitment or conditions of service. There may be a rule for person or one post, but rules are meant for recruitment and conditions of service, and not for the purpose of validating illegal appointments or promotions or transfer.
 [810 B-D; 814 D] B.N. Nagarajan & Ors. v. State of- Mysore & Ors. [1966] 3 S.C.R. 682, followed.
 (7)(a) The High Court erred in holding that the respondent was a local candidate within the meaning of the 1957 rules.
 A local candidate is a temporary government servant not appointed regularly as per rules of recruitment to that service. But two government servants cannot be appointed substantively to the same permanent post at the same time except as a temporary measure. The respondent, in the present case, was a permanent government servant and was on deputation having a lien on his post as Assistant Lecturer Geology when he was appointed to officiate as Principal.
 Therefore, it cannot be said that he was substantively appointed to the post of Principal. If the respondent was appointed as 801 a temporary measure to the post of Principal, it would not therefore be as a local candidate, but as a Government servant appointed to another post as a temporary measure.
 [810 D-E; 813 A-C] (i)Moreover the orders of appointment as officiating Principal in September 1958 and the modified order in April 1959, state that proposals to fill the post by advertisement through the State Public Service Commission should be forwarded. They show that the respondent was not treated as a local candidate, but was appointed as a temporary measure till proper appointment is made through the State Public Service Commission from persons possessing the necessary qualifications. [811 G-H] (8)When the State Public Service Commission agreed for regularisament ofthe respondent, but only to regularise the appointment to the post of Principal. [813 F-G] (9)The High Court was wrong in holding that the appointment of the respondent did not offend Arts. 14 and 
16. Under the 1964-rules the recruitment for the post was by promotion from the cadre of Heads of sections or by direct 'recruitment and Principals of Polytechnics and Heads of sections belonged to a common cadre and should have been considered for the appointment. As the appellant and others were not given equal opportunity and treatment in regard to the appointment, there was discrimination. [814 F-H; 815 A- F]
