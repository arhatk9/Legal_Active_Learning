 The appellants were convicted under s. 5 of the Bombay Prevention of Gambling Act 1887. Appellant no. 6 was also convicted under s. 4 of the Act. In the appeal, the Sessions Court on an appreciation of evidence came to the conclusion that the prosecution had failed to establish that appellant no. 6 was deriving any profit or gain by way of charges for the use of the room of the office in which gaming was taking place and that accordingly it was not a 'common gaming house' within the meaning of s. 3(ii), and therefore the offence committed by appellant no. 6 would not fall under s.
 
4. It, however, recorded a finding of guilt against all the appellants for an offence under s. 5 seeking support from s.7, which provides for presumptive proof of keeping or gaming in a common gaming house. This view was affirmed by the High Court.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, ^ 
 HELD: 1. An offence under s. 5 can be committed only provided the persons concerned were gaming or were present for the purpose of gaming in a 'common gaming house'. [615F] 
 2. What was held to be 'not' a 'Common Gaming House', having regard to the fact that evidence adduced by the prosecution was considered unacceptable could not have been held to be a common gaming house by recourse to the presumption under section 7. What is not a 'common gaming house' in fact in the light of evidence cannot become a common gaming house by reason of a presumption. [615C-D] 
 3. The Sessions Court was in error in convicting the appellants for an offence under Section 5 which can be committed only provided 614 the persons concerned were gaming or were present for the purpose of gaming in a 'common gaming house'. The High Court was in error in failing to appreciate the import of the said finding recorded by the Court on the basis of the appreciation of evidence. [615F-G]
