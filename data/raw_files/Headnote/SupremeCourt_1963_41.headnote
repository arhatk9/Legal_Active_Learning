 The appellant was appointed on probation, for one year as Programme assistant on May 3, 1994 on condition that his services might be terminated without any notice and cause being assigned during that period. He agreed and joined service on these terms on July 4, 1932, he was called upon to show cause why his services should not be terminated and as the explanation given was not satisfactory, his services were terminated after August 31, 1952. On an application moved under Art. 226 of the Constitution the High Court dismissed the application and held that the appellant was not entitled to the protection of Art. 311 (2) of the Constitution, that in. 49 and 55-B of the Civil Services Rules did not apply and that he was governed by the contract of his service.
 Held, that in the present case the appellant was a probationer and the termination of his service was not by way of punishment and could not amount to dismissal or removal within the meaning of Art. 31 1. As a probation he, would .be liable to be discharged during that period subject to the 136 rules in force in that connection and as Explanation 2 to r:
 49 had been deleted long before the action was taken, he was not entitled to the protection of Art. 311.
 Purushottam Lal Dhingra v. Union of India, [1958] S. C. R.
 828 and State of Orissa v. Ran Narain Das [1961] 1 S.C.R.
 606, referred to.
 Held, further, that r. 53-B would apply to the appellant and was not excluded by r. 3 (a). The purpose of a notice under r. 55-B was to ascertain, after considering the explanation which a probationer may give, whether he should be retained or not and in such a case it would be sufficient compliance with that rule if the grounds on which the probationer is considered unsuitable for retention are communicated to him and any explanation given by him with respect to those grounds was duly considered before an order was passed. In the present case therefore, the appellant was given the opportunity as envisaged by r. 55-B and the appeal therefore, must be dismissed.
