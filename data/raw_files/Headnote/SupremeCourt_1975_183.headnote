 A notification was issued by the State Government under s. 4 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927 declaring that it decided to constitute some land as a reserved forest. The appellant preferred a claim under s. 6 of the Act before the Forest Settlement Officer stating that he had sirdari rights over certains plots of the land included in the notification, to which claim the Divisional Forest officer filed an objection. The Forest Settlement Officer recorded an order on May 9, 1955 that the appellant had proved his claim. The respondent alleged that the order made by the Forest Settlement Officer admitting the claim of the appellant was passed without any notice to it, and in its absence, and that it came to know of the order on April 24, 1956 on which date the Forest Settlement Officer passed another order. The State filed an appeal under s. 17 of the Act "against the order dated 24th April, 1956". The prayer made in the petition was 'this appeal be allowed and the orders of the Forest Settlement Officer admitting the claim of the respondent be set aside with costs." The Appellate Tribunal, to which the appeal was preferred, held that the period of limitation should run from April 24, 1956 and not from the date of the first order.
 In a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution, the appellant challenged the order of the Appellate Tribunal on the ground (i) that the order of May 9, 1955 was set aside though the appeal was directed not against that order but against the order dated April 24, 1956 which was not an appealable order under the Act and (ii) assuming the appeal was also directed against the earlier order, it was barred by limitation. The High Court held that since the prayer made in the petition of appeal was for setting aside the "orders" of the Forest Settlement Officer, the appeal must be held to have been preferred against both the orders and the appeal against the order recorded on May 9, 1955 was not barred by limitation because the said order must be deemed to have been passed on April 24, 1956 when the forest Department came to know of it.
 Dismissing the appeal.

 HELD : (1) Though the date of the earlier order was not mentioned in the petition of appeal, there can be no doubt that the appeal was also directed against that order. The prayer made in the petition of appeal referred not only to 'orders' in the plural but also described them as orders admitting the claim of the respondent, though of course the order dated April 24, 1956 was not one admitting the claim and as such, was not appealable. [496A-B] (2) The High Court was right in holding that the impugned order should be deemed to have been passed on April 24, 1956 when the Forest Department came to know of it and the right of appeal granted to the Department should be determined on that basis. [498C] Section 17 provides a right of appeal from an order passed by the Forest Settlement Officer under s. 11 and lays down a time limit of three months from the date of the order for presenting the appeal. In this case the order under s.
 11 was recorded by the Forest Settlement Officer on May 9, 1955 and the appeal under s. 17 filed on July 20, 1956 was obviously long out of time if the impugned order could be said to have been made on May 9, 1955 when it was recorded.
 [494DE, H] This section does not state what would happen if the Forest Settlement Officer made an order under s. 11 without notice to the parties and in their 493 absence. It would be absurd to think that in such a case if the aggrieved party came to know of the order after the expiry of the time prescribed for presenting the appeal from the order, the remedy would be lost for no fault of his. It is a fundamental principle of justice that a party whose rights are affected by an order must have notice of it. This principle is embodied in Order XX r. 1 of C.P.C. Though the Forest Settlement Officer adjudicating on the claims under the Act is not a court, yet the principle which is really a principle of fair play and is applicable to all tribunals performing judicial or quasi-judicial functions, must also apply to him. [497E-F] Municipal Board, Pushkar v. State Transport Authority, Rajasthan & Ors. [1963] Supp. 2 S.C.R. 373 held inapplicable.
 Raja Harish Chandra Raj Singh v. The Deputy Land Acquisition Officer, A.I.R. 1961 S.C. 1500, referred to.
