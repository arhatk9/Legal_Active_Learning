 Rule 2 of Order 21 of the Supreme Court Rules states that where an appeal lies to the Supreme Court on a certificate issued by the High Court, no application to the Court for special leave to appeal shall be entertained unless the High Court concerned has first been moved and it has refused to grant the certificate. Rule 1 of Order 47, however, confers powers on the Court to dispense with any of the requirements of the Rules and to pass appropriate orders in exercise of its inherent powers.
 The appellants moved the High Court for a certificate under Art. 134(1)(c) of the Constitution but later withdrew it. The High Court rejected the application as withdrawn.
 The appellants then moved this Court stating that the High Court rejected their application on "merits" but not "as being out of time" and obtained ex parte special leave.
 Dismissing the appeal and revoking the leave to appeal, ^ 
 HELD : (1) The requirement of r. 2 of O.21 has not been complied with. Withdrawal of the application by the appellants showed that they abandoned the idea of moving the Supreme Court. [325D] (2) Rule 2 of Order 21 is by itself mandatory. The fact that its compliance may be excused by the Court in appropriate cases does not affect the mandatory character of the Rule. This is a case which does not merit invoking the inherent powers of the Court for dispensing with the requirements of the Rules, particularly so when the appellants had made a definitely wrong statement in the special leave application with regard to their earlier application for leave in the High Court.
