 The Returning Officer after counting of votes announced that the petitioner had been duly elected to Bihar Legislative Assembly from Islampur Constituency and issued a certificate of election in Form 22 under Rule 66 of the Conduct of Elections Rules 1961 in his favour. However, the declaration in Form 21C was not prepared under clause (a) of Rules 64 and sent to the required authorities. The Returning Officer, subsequently discovered that The ballot papers of one booth had not been counted and after taking into account those votes issued a notice cancelling the election of the petitioner. A declaration in Form 21C was then prepared declaring the fourth respondent elected and a fresh certificate in Form 22 was issued .
 The petitioner challenged the election of the fourth respondent under Article 226 of the Constitution. The High Court held that the writ petition was not maintainable because of the bar imposed by clause (b) of Article 329 and that an election petition was the proper remedy.
 In Special Leave Petition to this Court it was contended: (1) that the petitioner is entitled Lo maintain the writ petition, since the process of election was completed as soon as the counting of votes was concluded and a certificate of election in Form 22 was granted certifying that the petitioner had been elected and (2) the Returning Officer had no power to cancel the election of the petitioner and declare the fourth respondent elected .
 533 Dismissing the Special Leave Petition, ^ 
 HELD:1. When Section 66 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 provides that the result of the election shall be declared in the manner provided by the Act or the Rules made thereunder, the declaration can be effected in the manner expressed in Rule 64 of the Rules only either in Form 21C or 21D, as the case may be. [536 B-C] In the instant case, the announcement by the Returning Officer that the petitioner had been elected has no legal status because the declaration in Form 21C had not yet been drawn up. Even the grant of the certificate of election in Form 22 cannot avail because Rule 66 contemplates the grant of such certificate only after the candidate has been declared elected under section 66. [536 C-D] 
 2. The Writ Petition cannot be entertained. The process of election came to an end after the declaration in Form 21C was made and the consequential formalities were completed.
 The bar of clause (b) of Article 329 came into operation thereafter and an election petition alone was maintainable.
 [536 E-F] 
 3. The process of election set forth in the Representation of People Act, 1951 consists of several stages and towards the end it requires a declaration of the result of the election. Section 66 of the Act provides that when the counting of votes has been completed the Returning Officer must declare forthwith the result of the election "in the manner provided in the Act or the Rules made thereunder.' Thereafter, under section 67 the result of the election is reported by the Returning Officer to the authorities and the declaration is published in the Official Gazette. [535 C-D] 
 4. The procedure for declaring the result of the election 18 set forth in Rule 64 of the Conduct of Election Rules 1961 which provides that the declaration envisaged by the law that a candidate has been elected is the declaration in Form 21C or Form 21D. The declaration in Form 21C is made in a general election and the declaration in Form 21D is made when the election is held to fill a casual vacancy.
