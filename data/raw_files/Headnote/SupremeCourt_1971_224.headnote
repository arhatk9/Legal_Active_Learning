 Section 2(g) of the Expenditure Tax Act, 1957, before its amendment by the Finance Act, 1959, defined 'dependent' to mean "where the assessee is an individual, his or her spouse or child wholly or mainly dependent on the assessee for support and maintenance". After the amendment 'dependent' meant "where the assessee is an individual, his or her spouse or minor child, and includes any person wholly or mainly dependent on the assessee for support and maintenance".
 The appellant was assessed as an individual to expenditure tax for the assessment years 1959-60, 1960-61 and 1961-62.
 After the completion of the assessment, the Expenditure Tax Officer issued notice under section 16 of the Act calling upon the appellant to file supplementary returns for the three years on the ground that he had reason to believe that the appellant's expenditure had escaped assessment or had been under assessed. The assessments were sought to be reopened for including the expenditure incurred by the wife of the appellant. The appellant, thereupon, filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging the reopening of the assessments on various grounds. The petition was dismissed.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended : (1) the appellant's wife, who admittedly had her own properties and assets and had substantial income therefrom could not be regarded as 'dependent' within the meaning of section 2(g) (i) and, therefore, her expenditure could not be included under section 4(ii) for computing the expenditure of the assessee; (2) that there was no reasonable basis for making a distinction between an assessee, who was an individual and an assessee which was a Hindu undivided family; (3) that the action of the Expenditure Tax Officer in reopening the assessments under s. 16(a) was wholly arbitrary and illegal;
 that there had been no omission or failure on the part of the assessee to make a return of his expenditure or to disclose fully and truly all material facts; and the Act was void for want of legislative competence.
 Dismissing the appeal.
 
HELD : (1) The Act divided the assessees into well known classes, namely, an assessee who was an individual and an assessee which was a Hindu Undivided Family. The two cases were dealt with separately in s. 2(g) and in s. 4(ii).
 Where the assessee was an individual on& bad to look for his "dependent" in cl. g(i) and where the assessee was a Hindu Undivided Family the "dependent" had to be. found in cl.
 (g)(ii) of section 2. After the amendment cl. g(i) of s. (2) under went a complete 471 change. Before the inclusive part of the definition the meaning of the word "dependent" had been clearly and completely specified. The legislature stopped short of making the spouse or the minor child "dependent on the assessee for support and maintenance" and employed those words only for the new category of persons who came to be included, namely, any one who was neither the spouse nor the minor child of the assessee but was otherwise wholly or mainly dependent on him for support and maintenance. In the absence of any ambiguity in the language employed in the first part of s. 2(g) (i) the plain meaning had to be taken.
 The whole construction of that clause left no room for doubt that in the first part, no question of dependence in fact arose and the spouse or the minor child simpliciter had to be treated as a "dependent"., [477 A-H; 480 B-C] Commissioner of Expenditure Tax, Madras v. T. S. Krishna, 78 
 1. T. R. 541 and Rajkumar Singhji v. Commissioner of Expenditure Tax, M.P., 78 I.T.R. 405, disapproved.
 M. N. Patwardhan v. Commissioner of Expenditure, Tax, Poona, 78 I.T.R.338, referred to.
 No double taxation would be involved if the meaning of the word "dependent" as given in the first part of s. 2(g) (i) was to be applied without qualifying the same with what followed. The charging section 3, only subjected to tax the expenditure incurred by an individual or a Hindu Undivided Family., Once the expenditure incurred by both the assessee as an individual and the spouse had been included in his or her assessment of expenditure tax, it could not be again subjected to tax in the assessment of the other spouse.
 There was nothing in the Act which did away with the principle that in the absence of express provision the same item will not be taxed over again. [478 E] (2)The High Court was right in coming to the conclusion that in tax legislation where the incidence of the tax fell differently upon different classes of assessees, as in the present case, it could not be said that there was legislation without any classification or that there was no rational relation to the object. Because some classes are taxed higher than the others, or some are given concessions while others are not, it cannot be held that there had been discrimination within the meaning of art. 14. [479 B-D] (3)Though the impression created by the notices which were issued and the correspondence which followed between the assessee and the Expenditure Tax Officer was that the notice had been issued under s. 16 (a) of the Act, in the writ petitions and in the returns which were filed both sides were quite clear that the matter was not confined to only clause (a) of section 16(1) and clause (b) figured prominently.. The pleadings in the writ petitions covered both clauses of s. 16 and, in any case, the Expenditure Tax Officer had made a positive averment that the information with regard to expenditure incurred by assessee's wife became available to him only on 5th May, 1962. Thus the notices were issued on that date were within the period of 4 years which was the limit prescribed with regard to Acts under clause (b) the limit being more in respect of clause (a). It was no where controverted in the High Court that the requisite information came into possession of the Expenditure Tax Officer only on 5th May, 1962. [482 E] (4)Entry 97 in List I which is the residuary entry covered the tax of the kind imposed by the Act.
