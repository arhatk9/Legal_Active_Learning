 An agent sued his principals for rendition of accounts for the period of the agency. The principals also filed a suit claiming enforcement of a promissory note the agent had executed in their favour. The agent pleaded an oral agreement by which the principals were not to enforce the promissory note during the period of the agency and unless the sum remained due and payable after accounting. The trial court granted a decree on the promissory note bat directed that it should be adjusted against any sum found due after accounting in the agent's suit. The principals went to the High Court and failing there appealed to this Court. It was contended on behalf of the appellants that (1) an agent was not entitled in law to sue his principal for accounts and (2) the parole agreement could not be proved in view of s. 92 of the Indian Evidence Act.
 
HELD:(i) Though an agent has no statutory right for an ac- count from his principal nevertheless there may be special circumstances rendering it equitable that the principal should account to the agent. Such a case may arise when all the accounts are in the possession of the Principal and the agent does not possess accounts to enable him to determine his claim for commission against his principal. The right of the agent may also arise in an exceptional case when his remuneration depends on the extent of dealings which are not known to him or where he cannot be aware of the extent of the amount due to him unless the accounts of his principal are gone into. In the special circumstances of the present case the agent was entitled to sue his principals for accounts for the material period.
