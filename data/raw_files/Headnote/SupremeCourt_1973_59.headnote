 The appellant was in 1934 first appointed as a constable in the erstwhile State of Gwalior and was promoted in 1945 to the post of SubInspector. In May 1948 the rulers of Gwalior, Indore and certain other States formed under a covenant executed by them, a new State, called the United States of Madhya Bharat. The appellant was allowed to work as a Sub-Inspector in the new State of Madhya Bharat but his name was centered from the very beginning, that is from May 1948, in the list of 'provisionally absorbed servants,' and remained so during all material times. By a notification, dated December 15, 1948, the Madhya Bharat Government published rules, called the 'Retrenchment Terms' which were revised by another notification dated July 9, 1949. In the said notification principles were laid down for the selection of Government Servants for retrenchment. The appellant was retrenched by an order signed by the Deputy Inspector-General, Central Range, on the ground that the appellant had a consistent bad record under retrenchment category 2 of the Retrenment Terms. In appeal the Inspector-General confirmed the said order also under categories 4 and 7 of the said Terms, that is, besides the ground of a consistently bad record, also on the ground of the appellant not possessing the minimum qualification prescribed for the post, and on the ground that the appellant for reasons considered adequate by the Government, could not be absorbed in the Madhya Bharat service. The writ petition filed by the appellant challenging this order was dismissed by the High Court on the ground of delay, though Art. 311 of the Constitution was held to be attracted. In 1960 the appellant filed a suit relying on Art. 311. The trial court decreed the suit. The High Court however allowed the State's appear.. By special leave the appellant appealed to this Court and contended : (i) that on the construction of the said Retrenchment Terms the impugned order amounted to one of dismissal, attracting the provisions of Art. 311; and (ii) that since the ground of consistent bad record amounted to a stigma, and could not therefore be relied on in support of the order, the order fell and could not be sustained on the ground of lack of minimum educational qualification.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) The classification of persons in the seven categories was clearly made to select persons 'from out of those who were in excess of the requirements of the new State. Since they were not to be absorbed, they could not be said to have been the employees of the new State and Art.
 311 therefore could not apply to their cases. The claim of the appellant that the impugned order amounted to punishment or that for that reason Art. 311 was attracted was clearly misconceived. [801B] 795 (ii) The respondent-State had relied upon the categories 2, 4 and 7, as ground for the impugned order. So far as category 4 was concerned, there can be no doubt that the appellant did not have the minimum educational qualification required for the post of a Sub-Inspector. Since that was so, he' would also fall in category No. 7, that is, as a person who could not, for reasons considered adequate by the Government, be absorbed in the service of the new State.
 Even if therefore, category 2 could not for some reason or the other be taken into consideration, categories 4 and 7 were relevant and valid. The mere fact that the Government could not avail of category 2 did not mean that it could not rely on the other two grounds. The reason is that this was not a case of subjective satisfaction, where on failure of one of the grounds it would be impossible to predicate whether the relevant authority could have reached its satisfaction only on the basis of the rest of the grounds.
 The tests here were objective ones and if one of the several such tests failed. but the others were sufficient, the order would still have to be sustained. [801E]
