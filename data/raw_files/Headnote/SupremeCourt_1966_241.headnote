 By a deed executed in November 1946, the respondent and her husband created a trust in respect of their properties. In accordance with Clause 7 of the deed, the income of the trust properties was to be paid to the respondent during her lifetime and, by Clause 8 the trustees were directed to apply the income, from and after the death of the respondent, to certain charitable purposes enumerated in the deed. On July 21, 1955, the respondent executed a deed of surrender whereby she gave up her beneficial interest in the income of the trust so that it may immediately vest in the trustees and may be utilised for the charitable purposes mentioned in the trust deed.
 In the course of assessment to income tax in respect of the income from the trust properties for the assessment years 1956-57 to 1959-60, it was claimed on behalf of the trust that during the relevant previous years, the properties were held under a trust wholly for charitable purposes, and consequently, the income was exempt from income-tax under s.
 4(3)(i) of the Income Tax Act, 1922. The Income Tax Officer rejected this claim on the view that the deed of surrender executed by the respondent did not amount to renouncement of her rights under the trust deed and that it really amounted to a transfer of the income received by her for the use of the trust; and since the income was receivable by the respondent, the trust properties were not held wholly for charitable purposes. However,. the: Appellate Assistant Commissioner, on appeal held that the income from the trust properties was exempt under s. 4(3)(i) and this view was upheld by the Tribunal. The High Court, upon a reference, also held in favour of the trust.
 It was also contended on behalf of the department that as clause 8 of the trust deed executed in November 1946 provided that the income of the trust was to be applied for charitable purposes "from and after the death" of the respondent the trustees could not, during her life-time, apply the income for any charitable purposes and therefore no exemption could be claimed under s, 4(3) (i).
 
HELD:The income from the trust properties -after July 21, 1955 was exempt from tax under s. 4(3) (i). [ 1 3 B-C] Whenever a valid trust is executed, the property vests in the Trustees, and the income accruing from those properties is the income of the trust and not of the beneficiaries.
 For purposes of income-tax law, however, the income under s.
 41(1) of the Act is treated as received by the Trustees on behalf of the beneficiaries, but is to be taxed in the hands of the Trustees as it would be in the hands of the beneficary for whom it is 8 received. In the present case, therefore, it would be wrong to proceed on any assumption that the income of the trust properties was received by the respondent. Once the respondent renounced her interest by the deed of July 1955, which was clearly valid in view of s. 58 of the Indian Trusts Act, the entire properties were held by the Trustees for the charitable purpose mentioned in clause 8, because that was the only purpose of the trust which then remained.
 The income which accrued thereafter was come which could be applied or allowed to accumulate for application to the charitable purposes mentioned in clause 8 and for no other purpose. [10 E; 11 B-H] Even if it were to be held that by virtue of clause 8 the trustees could not apply the income for charitable purposes so long as the respondent was alive, the only effect would be that the income would accumulate. Such accumulations would also be exempt from the liability to income-tax under s. 4(3) (i) as soon as the rights of the respondent ceased on the execution by her of the deed of surrender in July 1955.
