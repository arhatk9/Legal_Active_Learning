 The Tamil Nadu Additional Sales-tax Act 1970 imposed additional sales-tax of 5% on a dealer whose annual total turnover exceeded Rs. ten lacs. Writ petitions questioning the constitutional validity of the Act were dismissed by the High Court. In appeal it was contended that (i) the State legislature had no power to enact the Act as the tax was outside the scope of entry 54 of List II; (ii) that the provisions of the Act violated the fundamental rights of the appellant under Art. 19(1)(f) and (g) of the Constitution and (iii) that the provisions of the Act imposed different rates of tax upon different dealers depending on their turnover and were, therefore. violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution.
 Dismissing the appeal.
 
HELD : (1) The contention of the appellants that the additional sales-tax is not a tax on sales but on the income of the dealers is without any basis. The additional tax is really a tax on the sale of goods. The object of the Act is to increase the tax on the sale or purchase of goods imposed by the Tamil Nadu General Sales-tax Act, 1959 and the fact that quantum of the additional tax is determined with reference to the sales-tax imposed would not alter its character. The additional sales-tax is to be imposed only if the turnover of a dealer exceeds Rs. 10 lacs. It is in reality a tax on the aggregate of sales effected by a dealer during a year. [123D-E] Kilikar v. Sales Tax Officer, 21 S.T.C. 253, and A. S.
 Ramachandra Rao V. State of Andhra Pradesh, 25 S.T.C. 133, approved.
 (2)(a) It cannot be said that the provisions of the Act imposed any unreasonable restrictions upon the appellants' right to carry on trade. It is no doubt true that every tax imposes some restrictions upon the right to carry on business but it would not follow that the imposition of tax in question was an unreasonable restriction upon the appellants' fundamental right to carry on trade. Generally speaking, the amount or rate of a tax is a matter exclusively within legislative judgment and as long as a tax retains its avowed character and does not confiscate the property to the State under the guise of a tax, its reasonableness is outside the judicial ken. [123F-124A] (b) It is not necessary that the dealer should be enabled to pass on the incidence of the tax on sale to the purchaser in order that it might be a tax on the sale of goods.
 Although the legal incidence of a tax on sale of goods under the Act falls squarely on the dealer, it may be that he can add the tax to the price of the goods sold and thus pass it on to the purchaser. It is not possible to say that because a dealer is disabled from passing on the incidence of tax to the purchaser to provisions of the Act impose unreasonable restriction upon the fundamental rights of the appellants under Art. 19(1) (f) or 19(1) (g). [124B-C, C] J. K. Jute Mills Co. v. State of U.P., [1961] INSC 162; [1962] 2 S.C.R. 1 at 13, and Konduri Buchirajaligam v. State of Hyderabad, [1958] 9 S.T.C. 397, referred to.
 (3) It can be said that a legislative classification making the burden of the tax heavier in proportion to the increase in turnover would be reasonable. A 122 flat rate is thought to be less efficient than the graded one as an instrument of social justice. The economic wisdom of a tax is within the exclusive province of legislature.
 The only question for the Court to consider it whether there is rationality in the belief of the legislature that capacity to pay the tax increases, by and large with an increase of receipts. An attempt to proportion the payment to capacity to pay and thus bring about a real and factual equality cannot be ruled out as irrelevant in levy of tax on the sale of purchase of goods. The object of a tax is not only to raise revenue but also to regulate the economic life of the society. [124H-125D; 126A-B]
