 With respect to the election to the State Legislative Assembly the last date for filing nominations was fixed on 11th February, 1972, and the last date for withdrawal of candidature was fixed on 14th February, 1972. The poll was held on 11th March, 1972 and the appellant, who polled the highest number of votes, was declared elected on 12th March.
 The respondent filed an election petition challenging the appellant's election alleging that he was guilty of several corrupt practices. The High Court found that, (1) the appellant committed a corrupt practice by hiring and procuring two jeeps and two trucks for the free conveyance of electors to and from the polling stations, and (2) that the appellant committed bribery within the meaning of s. 123 (1)(A)(a) in so far as he, on March, 10, 1972, made a payment of Rs. 1000/- to one of the contesting candidates, with the object of inducing him to continue to stand as a candidate at the election and not to withdraw from it, in order to wean away votes of Harijans and members of backward classes from the respondent; and set aside the appellant's election.
 in appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) On the evidence, there was proof of corrupt practice by the appellant only in relation to one truck.
 There was no acceptable evidence regarding the two jeeps, and, with respect to the other truck, though it was used for the purpose of conveying electors it could not be held, on the evidence that the appellant or his election agent had procured it for the conveyance of electors. But on that one single ground of corrupt practice found, the order of the High Court setting aside the election of the appellant must be confirmed. [933 E; 934D; 937 A-B; 939 G] (2) The High Court erred in holding that there was any bribery by the appellant within the meaning of s.
 123(1)(A)(a) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, with respect to one of the contesting candidates as alleged by the respondent. It must also be held on the evidence that even if any amount was paid to that contesting candidate it was not with the object of inducing him not to withdraw from the contest. [929 F] (3) Further, s. 123(1)(A)(a) is inapplicable to a situation where a candidates retires from the contest after the date fixed for the withdrawal of his candidature., The words "to withdraw or not to withdraw from being a candidate' in the clause refer to the stage of withdrawal of candidature under s. 37, and they do not apply to a situation where a contesting candidate announces that he does rot wish to contest the election or declares his intention to sit down after the last date for the withdrawal of candidature under s. 37 is past and a list of contesting candidates is published under s. 38. [940 H-941 C; 946 C-F] (a) The democratic form of Government requires that the election process must remain pure and unsullied. To secure this various provisions have been made in the Representation of the People Act, 1951, one of which is s. 123 (1)(A)(a).
 It must, therefore, be construed so as to suppress the mischief and advance the remedy. But that does not mean that a construction should be adopted which ignores the plain natural meaning of the words or disregards the context and the collocation in which they occur. The words used by the legislature must be construed according to their plain natural meaning, and, in order to ascertain that true intention of the legislature the court must not only look at the words used by the legislature but also have regard to the context and the setting in which they occur. The word "context" is used in a vide sense which 919 requires that all the provisions of the Act which bear upon the same subject matter must be read as a whole and in their entirety, each throwing light and illumining the meaning of the other. [943 F-944 C] (b) Section 55-A relating to retirement from contest, was introduced in the 1951-Act by the Amending Act 27 of 1956.
 The Amending Act amended s. 123(1)(a) also, by adding the words "or to retire from contest and the amended clause provided that, bribery with the object, directly or indirectly, of inducing a person to stand or not to stand as or to withdraw from being a candidate or to retire from contest at an election, shall be deemed to be a corrupt practice. Section 55A, however, was deleted by the Amendment Act, 58 of 1958. Since the provision for retirement from contest was thus deleted consequential changes were also made in, s. 123(1) (a) by deleting the words "or to retire from the contest," from it. 1946 F-G] (c) The addition of the words "to retire from the contest in s. 123(1)(a) after the introduction of s. 55A in the Act shows that the original words "to withdraw from being a candidate were not regarded as sufficiently comprehensive or wide enough to cover a situation where a contesting candidate retires from the contest. The court should, as far as possible, construe a statute so as to avoid tautology or superfluity. It would not, therefore, be right to place a meaning on the words "to withdraw from being a candidate" which would have effect of rendering the succeeding words "to retire from contest" superfluous and meaningless. The Court must proceed on the basis that the words "to retire from the contest" were deliberately and advisedly introduced by the legislature with the definite purpose of adding something which had not been said in the immediately preceding words and were not intended merely to repeat what was already enacted there. The words "to withdraw from being a candidate" could not therefore. at that stage, be read as applying to an event where a contesting candidate retires from the contest. And if that was the meaning of those words then, the subsequent deletion of the words "to retire from the contest" could not have the effect of adding to or expanding that meaning. [946 F-947 E] (d) The words "to withdraw from being a candidate" cannot be read in isolation. The concept of withdrawal of candidature is already dealt with in two earlier provisions, namely, ss. 30(c) and 37. Section 30(c) speaks of the last date for withdrawal of candidature, and how the candidature may be with,drawn on or before the last date, is provided for in s. 37. It is reasonable to presume, though the presumption is not of much weight and can be displaced by the context, that the expression "withdrawal of candidature" is used by the legislature in all these sections in the same sense. Therefore, in s. 123 also, the expression must mean withdrawal before the last date fixed for withdrawal of candidature as contemplated in s. 37. [946 A-F] Mills v. Mills (1963) p. 329 and I.R.C. v. Henry.
 Anisbacher &- Co., [1963] A.C. 191. referred to.
 (e) Further, the word "withdraw" in the clause does not stand alone. It is part of a composite expression, "to withdraw from being a candidate." When a person withdraws from, being a candidate, he ceases to be candidate, that is, he is no more a candidate. Clause (b) (i) uses the expression "having withdrawn his candidature" and Cl. (B) (b) uses the expression "to withdraw his candidature they denote the same idea. The only mode in which the candidate can withdraw his candidature and cease to be a candidate is that set out in s. 37. Until the last date for withdrawal of candidature he has a locus poenitentiae and be can withdraw from being a candidate by giving a notice in writing to that effect under s. 37; but once that date is past, he becomes a contesting candidate and he has no choice. No subsequent change of mind can help him to get out of the fight; and whether he likes it or not, whether he energizes himself or not, whether he actively campaigns or not, he remains a contesting candidate and the voters can cast their votes for him and even elect him, despite himself. He cannot, therefore, cease to be a contesting candidate, and if that be so, it must follow a fortiorari that he cannot withdraw his candidature or withdraw from being a candidate, once the last date for withdrawal of candidature under s. 37 is past [945 C-H] 920 (f) The different view taken in Mohd. Yunus Saleem's case [1974] INSC 70; (A.I.R. 1974] S.C. 1218) is erroneous and must be overruled.
 That case placed emphasis upon the etymological meaning of the word "withdraw" ignoring its contextual, setting and interrelation with the other provisions of the Act, and without considering the effect of the introduction and deletion of s. 55A. Even if "withdraw" were etymologically comprehensive enough to connote" retirement from contest, "retirement from contest" is impossible under the Act after the deletion of s. 55A. The Court was also impressed by the fact that if the words "to withdraw from being a candidate" were given a restricted meaning confined to the stage of withdrawal of candidature under s. 37, an absurd position would arise " where actual withdrawal after the time limit by taking bribe will be free from the vice of corrupt practice whereas that prior to it will not be so." But the function of the court is to gather the intention of the legislature from the words used by it and it would not be right for the court to attribute an intention to the legislature, which though not justified by the language used by it, accords with what the court conceives to be-reason and good sense and then bend the language of the enactment so as carry out such presumed intention of the legislature.
 For the Court to do so would be to overstep its limits.
 Factual withdrawal under the Act has no legal effect. It is no withdrawal at all, because, the candidate continues to be a contesting candidate and he is as much in the contest as he was before the announcement. The word "withdrawal", in the context in which it occurs cannot be read in a loose and in exact sense to mean something which it plainly does not.
