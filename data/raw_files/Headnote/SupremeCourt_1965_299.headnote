 After the respondent-company sold its assets, which included agricultural lands and buildings, it was resolved that it should be voluntarily wound up. On 30th March, the liquidator distributed Rs. 850,000 to share-holders. The appellant (Income-tax Officer) proposed to treat the amounts distributed as dividends and to call upon the liquidators to pay the tax under s. 18(3D) of the Income-tax Act, 1922.
 The liquidators contended that the amount was capital appreciation realised by the sale of agricultural lands and buildings and therefore not liable to tax; and that in any event the amounts represented "current profits" of the year in which it was resolved that the company be wound up and so were not dividends within the meaning of s. 2 (6-A) (c). As the appellant did not agree, the liquidators moved the High Court for a writ of prohibition to restrain him from taking further action. The High Court issued the writ holding that the demand by the appellant was not in conformity with law in that the amount of Rs. 850,000 could not be deemed to be distributed as dividend without determining whether any portion of it represented capital gains, which arose out of the sale of capital assets consisting of lands from which agricultural income was derived.
 In appeal to this Court.
 
HELD : (i) Normally the High Court should not entertain a petition under Art. 226, when the party claiming relief has an adequate alternative remedy, but as the matter is one of discretion and not jurisdiction of the High Court, if the High Court thought that the case was one in which its jurisdiction could be invoked, this Court would ordinarily not interfere with the exercise of the discretion. [86 F] (ii) The decision in Bacha Guzdur v. Commissioner of Income- tax, (27 I.T.R. 1), wherein it was held that dividend received by a share-holder out of profits tamed from agricultural income was not exempt from liability under 8.
 4(3)(viii), has no application to the present case because, the claim of the respondent to exemption from liability to tax was not under s. 4(3)(viii), but on the basis that the receipt by the shareholder was not income chargeable to tax under s. 12 as dividend. [92 B] (iii) By s. 12 tax is payable by an assessee under the head "income from other sources" which includes dividends.
 "Dividend" is defined in s. 2(6-A) and cl. (c) declares that accumulated profits immediately before the liquidation of the company are dividends. Since it does not say that only accumulated profits upto end of the previous year immediately proceeding the year in which liquidation of the of the company commences are dividend all profit earned till immediately before liquidation, if they are distributed will be brought to tax if they consist of accumulated profits or partly to the extent they are attributable to accumulated profits.in giving effect to the definition the taxing authority may have to com- 85 pute profits of the company for a part of the year but there is nothing in the Act which prohibits assessment of profits for a part only of the previous year in special circumstances. In fact, the legislative history of s. 2(6- A)(c) shows that "current profits", that is, profits of a company in liquidation arising after the end of the last previous year and before liquidation commenced are brought within the net of taxation as dividend. Further, the explanation to the section plainly implies that within the expression "accumulated profits"are included capital gains outside the excepted periods specified therein. But under s. 12-B while capital gains are chargeable in respect of any profits arising from transfer of "capital assets' "capital assets" do not include lands from which the income derived is agricultural income. Therefore, on a combined reading of s. 12-B and the definition, of capital asset in s. 2(4-A), profits derived by transfer of lands from which the income derived is agricultural income would not be chargeable to tax.
