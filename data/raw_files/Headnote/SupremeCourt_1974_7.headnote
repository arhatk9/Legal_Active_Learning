 The respondent came into Class I post. from October 27, 1946. From that day till July 23, 1954, he was Private Secretary to three ministers. Without giving credit for his service as Private Secretary his immediate junior was promoted as Deputy secretary. The respondent field a writ petition in the High Court praying that the order denying him credit for service as Private Secretary may be quashed and for a directions for payment of such amounts as he would have got had his due inter se seniorty and promotion been accorded to him. The High Court granted both the In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (i) The High Court was right in holding that the respondent was entitled to count his service from October 27, 1946, for fixation of his seniority in the gradation list.
 (2) The High Court, however, erred in directing the appellant to give the respondent notional promotion as Deputy Secretary with effect from the date on which his junior secured such Promotion and for payment of the excess salary accruing to him on that footing.
 The power to promote an officer belongs to the executive and the judicial power may control or review government action but cannot extend to acting as if it were the Executive.
 The Proper direction therefore, can only be that the government should reconsider the case of the respondent afresh for purposes of notional promotion. If the service rule entitles him to promotion on the ground of seniority alone, Government should, except for the strongest reason, grant the benefit of promotion with effect from the date when his junior became Deputy Secretary especially, because, nothing had been suggested against the respondent in his career to disentitle him to promotion. However, if the criterion for promotion is one of seniority-cum-merit comparative merit may have to be assessed if length of service is equal, or an outstanding junior is available for promotion. [88F] (3) The appellant State should apply to the respondent the same rule of promotion as was applied to his junior and not to act adversely without giving him an opportunity. Since the respondent had retired from service, the appellant should also consider promptly his claim and make payment to him of what is due to him without further delay. [91A] State of Mysore v. Syed Mahmood, [1968] INSC 58; [1968] 3 S. C. R. 363, 366 and State of Mysore v. P. N. Nanjundiah, [1969] 3 S. C. C.
 633,637 followed.
 (4) The appellant's inexplicable indifference is not placing before the Court the relevant rule regarding promotion to the post of Deputy Secretary merits the order that the appellant should pay the costs of the respondent even though the appeal is partly allowed.
