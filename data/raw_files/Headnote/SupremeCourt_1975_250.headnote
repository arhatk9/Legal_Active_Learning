 The plaintiff-respondent obtained a decree in an eviction suit filed u/s 20 of the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1956 on the original side of the Calcutta High Court on the grounds of "personal use and occupation", which was confirmed by a bench of the High Court. On an appeal by certificate of fitness, the defendant-appellant raised the following contentions:
 (i) That the Civil Court at Calcutta and not the High Court had jurisdiction to try the suit as per section 20 of the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act 1956.
 (ii) That there could be no reasonable requirement of the landlord of the suit premises for residential purposes, as they were being used by the tenant appellant for business purpose. The requirement of the landlord must exist for the same purpose to which the premises were being used by the tenants.
 (iii) That in any event the High Court ought to have decreed the suit for eviction from a part of the premises only under section 13(4) of the West Bengal Premises tenancy Act 1956.
 Dismissing the appeal, the Court ^ 
 HELD : (i) Section 20 is couched in a language which does not determine merely the place of suing but affects the jurisdiction of one court or the other. Triability of the suit by the High Court excludes the triability by the city civil court. [207-D] (ii) If a suit were to be instituted in a court to which both Section 8 of the Suit Valuation Act 1887 and section 7(xi)(cc) of the Court Fee Act 1870 would apply, the nature of the suit both for the purposes of jurisdiction and court fee will be the amount of rent payable during the preceding 12 months. But on the original civil side of the Calcutta High Court the procedure followed and the law applicable is different. Within the local limits of ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court the legislature thought to provide that, if the value of the suit exceeded Rs. 10,000/- it was only entertainable by the High Court at Calcutta. But apart from the value of the suit if the value of the suit premises of which the recovery of possession is claimed exceeds Rs. 10,000/- only the High Court can entertain such a suit. The intention of the legislature is that if the value of the premises exceeds Rs.
 10,000/- then irrespective of the value of the suit, the suit can be entertained only by the High Court and not by the City Civil Court. [207F, G-H, 208-A] (iii) There is no conflict between Section 5(2) of the city civil court and Section 20 of the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act of 1956 read with its Schedule. The High Court alone has the jurisdiction to try the suit and not the city civil court, in the view, either the value of the suits exceeds Rs. 10,000/-or because of the special provision in the Act when the market value of the premises (not the value of the lease held interest) exceeds Rs. 10,000/- [208 F-G] (iv) The law does not require the landlord must need the premises for his own occupation only for the purpose to which they were being put by the tenant. It may well be that a tenant cannot put the demised premises to any 206 other use. But there is no bar in law in the way of the landlord requiring the business premises for his residential occupation and vice versa provided the premises are capable of being put to different uses.
