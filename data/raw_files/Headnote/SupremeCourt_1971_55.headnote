 In the course of a domestic enquiry on a charge of pilferage against B a' part time clerk who was incharge of a godown of the appellant a chit was produced suggesting collusion with him of H another workman, The appellant instituted a domestic enquiry against the workman and he was dismissed.
 On a reference of the Industrial Dispute the Labour Court held that the contents of the chit were too vague and were procured only to harass the workman for no fault of his, that the domestic enquiry was violative of the principle of natural justice, and its findings perverse and without any evidence to support them. Consequently it ordered the re- instatement of the workman' The management appealed to his Court contending that instead of reinstatement the workman should be paid compensation. It also raised the plea that it had lost confidence in the workman.
 
HELD : The present case is not one in which this Court would be justified in interfering, on appeal under Art. 136 of the Constitution, with the order of the tribunal. The question whether on setting aside the wrongful dismissal of a workman he should be reinstated or directed to be paid compensation is a matter within the Judicial discretion of the Labour Court or the Tribunal, dealing with the industrial dispute, the general rule in the absence of any special circumstances being of reinstatement. In exercising this discretion, fair play towards the employee on the one hand and interest of the employer, including considerations of discipline in the establishment, on the other, require to be duly safeguarded.
 This is necessary in the interest both of security of tenure of the employee and of smooth and harmonious working ' of the establishment. Legitimate interests of both of them have to be kept in view if the order is expected to promote the desired objective of industrial peace and maximum possible production. The past record of the employee, the nature of the alleged conduction which the order of the employer is set aside, the nature of the duties performed by the employee concerned and the nature of the industrial establishment are some of the broad relevant factors which require to be taken into consideration. These factors are merely illustrative. Each case has to be decided on its own facts and no hard and fast rule can said down to cover generally all conceivable contingencies. Proper balance has to be maintained between the conflicting claims of the employer and the employee without jeopardising the larger interests of industrial peace and progress. [780 D] There was no evidence to conclude that the management lost confidence in the workman. If the workman is entitled as a general rule to be reinstated after his wrongful dismissal is set aside and on the facts it is not possible to find cogent material on which the establishment can genuinely be considered to have lost confidence in the integrity of the workman, he 775 is entitled to be reinstated. The suggestion that having regard to the nature of the proceedings against the workman the management has lost confidence was acceptable. [782 F] If' the workman's dismissal was wrongful then merely because proceedings for adjudication of the industrial dispute have taken a long time (10 years) was by itself no reason for not directing his reinstatement if it was otherwise justified being in accordance with the normal rule.
