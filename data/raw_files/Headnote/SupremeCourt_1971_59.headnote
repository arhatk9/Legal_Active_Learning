 On the question whether the West Bengal Land (Requisition and Acquisition) Act, 1948, was ultra vires the Constitution under Art. 19 (1) (f) read with 19(5).
 
HELD : The State of West Bengal was faced with many emergent problems created by the partition of India and the impugned Act was enacted in order 'to provide for requisitioning and speedy acquisition of land under s. 3 for a number of public purposes mentioned therein. The necessity for requisitioning must necessarily be left to the State Government. Though there is no express provision to make a representation against an order of requisition under s. 3(2) there is no bar to such a representation being made and to its being considered by the State Government or appropriate Governmental Authorities. If. however, any order is made for any collateral purpose, or has been made for purposes not mentioned in s. 3 of the Act, or is mala fide., it can always be challenged in a civil court. Under ss. 7(3) and (4), 8 and 8A of the Act, fair compensation has been pro- vided for requisitioning which is determinable by a civil court, if there is a dispute regarding the amount, and ultimately by the High Court and this Court. Therefore, the restrictions imposed by the impugned Act are not ,unreasonable. [792 C, D; 794 D-F]
