 The appellant is a registered dealer under the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act, 1959. The appellant manufactures and deals in chemical fertilizers. The appellant paid tax under the Act on certain chemical fertilizers which are shown as sub items 1 to 16 of Serial No. 21 of the First Schedule to the Act. The appellant prepared fertilizer mixtures by dry-mixing various chemical fertilizers which had already suffered tax. The appellants claimed exemption for the turnover in respect of fertilizers mixtures on the ground that it cannot be said to be a commodity different from the ingredients composing it which had been purchased within the State and had suffered tax under item No. 21 of the First Schedule. The Assessing Officer disallowed the exemption. On appeal the Appellate Assistant Commissioner allowed the exemption on the ground that no manufacturing process was involved at the time of preparing the fertilizer mixture and that the resultant product is not a product different from the ingredients constituting it which had already suffered tax.
 In an appeal, the Tribunal reversed the decision of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and refused to grant the exemption. The Revision Application filed by the appellants to the Tamil Nadu High Court was dismissed at the stage of admission on the ground that each of the competent article and the fertilizer mixture have different chemical properties of their own and their use also is different and that, therefore, it is not possible to treat the fertilizer mixture as the same article as the components themselves.
 The appellants contended in appeal by special leave (1) As s. 3(2) of the Act provides for levy of sales tax in respect of goods mentioned in the First Schedule at the rate and only at the point specified thereunder and as the fertilizer mixtures are prepared by mixing manually by means of shovels some of the chemical fertilizers mentioned in sub items 1 to 15 in Entry 21 in the Schedule without admixture of any organic manure, they are not liable to tax inside the State.
 (2) Even if such fertilizer bears a specific commercial name, for the purpose of the Act, it has no identity except as a chemical fertilizer and secondly the mixing of one or more chemical fertilizers cannot but be the same article entitled to application of single point scheme in respect of its ingredients. This is the natural implication of the expression 'chemical fertilizers' followed by the expression 'that is to say'.
 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD : (1) The principal question for determination in these appeals is whether the fertilizer mixtures in question can be treated as the same article as chemical fertilizers composing them. A plain reading of s. 3 read with item 21 of the First Schedule shows that it is only when a chemical fertilizer specified in sub items 1 to 15 of item No. 21 of the First Schedule is sold in the same condition in which it is purchased that it is not subject to a 796 fresh levy. Fertilizer mixture it would be noted is not the same article as the ingredients composing it. It is sold as a different commercial product. The question whether there is any manufacturing process involved in the preparation of any fertilizer mixture is wholly irrelevant for the present purpose. [798A G-H, 799A] (2) The fertilizer mixture is a marketable commodity different from its components, it is put to different use and has different properties. [800-G] State of Tamil Nadu v.
