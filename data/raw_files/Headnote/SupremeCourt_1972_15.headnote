 A private complaint in connection with the forgery of a zerpeshgi lease and its registration under the Indian Registration Act was filed against several persons including the appellant. The appellant was acquitted by the trial court. In an appeal filed by the complainant the High Court convicted the appellant under s. 82(d) of the Indian Registration Act for abetment of an offence under s. 82 after overriding his contention that the complaint was not maintainable without the permission as required by s. 83 of the Act. Under s. 83(1) a prosecution for any offence under the Act coming to the knowledge of a registering officer in his official capacity may be commenced by or with the permission of the Inspector-General, the Registrar or the Sub-Registrar in whose territories, district or subdistrict as the case may be, the offence has been committed. In appeal by special leave before this Court the only point argued on behalf of the appellant was that the complaint was incompetent as it was filed by a person without obtaining the necessary permission under s. 83 of the Act and therefore the conviction of the appellant was bad and must be set aside.
 
HELD : On a reading of the section it would be clear that it deals only with prosecution for an offence under the Act coming to the knowledge of the Registering Officer in his official capacity. It, in effect, provides that where an offence comes to the knowledge of the Registering Officer in his official capacity, a prosecution may be commenced by or with the permission of any of the officers mentioned in the section. The section can possibly have no application to cases in which the offences are committed under the Act, but the offences do not come to the knowledge of the Registering Officer in his official capacity. [113 H] The section is not prohibitory in that it does not preclude a private person from commencing a prosecution. Even in a case where the commission of offence comes to the knowledge of the Registering Officer in his official capacity, the section does not prohibit a private person from commencing a prosecution as the section is clearly permissive in language and intent. [114B] One would have expected a more apt phraseology if the purpose of the Legislature was to prohibit the prosecution of an offence under the Act by a private individual. Seeing that a private person will be more seriously injured by the action of an offender who not only forges a document but endeavours to give it a higher efficacy by registering it, there is no reason why the private person should be deprived of the liberty to prosecute the offender. There is also no reason why a registering officer guilty of an offence under s. 81 of the Act should get immunity from prosecution. by a private individual injured thereby. In s. 195(1) of the Criminal 112 Procedure Code, s. 70(1) of the Indian Stamp Act and s. 29 of the Indian Arms Act, 1878 the language employed is prohibitory in character. Section 83(1) of the Act is not prohibitory either in terms or in intention [116 A-G] The view taken by the Allahabad and Rangoon High Courts that the word 'may' in s. 83(1) should be read as 'must' was not correct.
