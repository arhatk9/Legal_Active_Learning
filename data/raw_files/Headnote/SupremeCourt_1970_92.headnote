 The respondent Company, which was itself primarily engaged in the manufacture of iron and steel products, owned a colliery. The coal raised from this colliery was mainly used in the respondent's iron and steel factories though some cog was also sold to outsiders. In the years 1946-47, 1947-48 and 1948-49, the respondent Company lodged returns with the Collector of Burdwan under s. 72 of the Bengal Cess Act, 1880 in which the Company valued the coal supplied by the colliery to its factories at a rate per ton less than the actual cost of raising the coal, and computed the profits of the colliery on that basis. The Cess Deputy Collector, who was the assessing authority, rejected the returns and computed the profits of the colliery for the purpose of assessment to, the cess by valuing the coal at the control rate in force at the time. The 'assessing authority under the Bengal Primary Education Act, 1930, the provisions of which were similar to the Bengal Cess Act, also computed the education cess payable by the Company for the years 1946-47 and 1947-48 on the same basis. The Respondent Company paid the amounts 'assessed as cess under each Act under protest and thereafter instituted a suit for refund of the amount which it contended was collected from it in excess. It also prayed for a declaration that it had earned no profits from the colliery during the three years from the coal consumed in its own steel factories and as such no cess could have been assessed and levied on it. The Trial Court decreed the suit and an appeal to the High Court was dismissed.
 In the appeal to this Court it was contended inter alia on behalf of the Respondent (i) that supply of coal made by the colliery to its factories could not be considered a sale and without a sale, there could be no profit; accordingly in computing the profits of the colliery the value of the coal supplied to its factories should not have been taken into consideration; and (ii) that in view of the decision of this Court in Tata Iron and Steel Company's case it was not open to the assessing authority to value the coal supplied to the factories at the controlled rate; he should have dis- integrated the ultimate Profits earned and found out the profit 'earned by the mine.
 
HELD : Allowing the Appeal (i) Indetermining the profits earned by the colliery, it was open to the assessing authority to take into consideration the value of the coal supplied-to the factories and workshops of the Respondent Company.

 (ii) The mode of computation is a matter for the assessing authorities except where the computation is done in violation of any provision of 276 law. If the respondent company was aggrieved by the mode of computation adopted by the assessing authority, it should have agitated that question firstly before that authority and thereafter before the appellate authority. Having not done so, the company cannot be permitted to raise that question in the, present suit; otherwise the finality contemplated by s . 102 of the Act would become illusory.
 The levy under the Act is imposed by a special lay which law also provides its own remedies for correcting the errors that, may be committed by the assessing authority. Where a liability not existing previously is created by a statute which statute at the same time provides a special or particular remedy for correcting any mistake that may occur in its enforcement the aggrieved party must adopt the form of remedy given by the statute and no other.
