 Section 4(1), Indian Electricty Act, 1910, as amended in 1958, provides that the State Government may, if in its opinion the public interest so requires, and after consulting the State Electricity Board, revoke a licence in certain cases. Sub-section (3) provides that no licence shall be revoked under sub-S. (i) unless the State Government has given to the licensee not less than three notice in writing stating the grounds on which it is proposed to revoke the licence, and, has considered the cause shown by the licensee.
 On June 21, 1962, the respondent-Government wrote to the State Electricity Board that the respondent considered that the licence of the appellant should be revoked under s.
 4(1)(a) and requested the Board to communicate its views.
 On July 26, the Board recommended the revocation. On August 17, the respondent issued a notice to the licensee, of which the appellant was proprietor under s. 4(3), to show cause why the licence should not be revoked. On November 5, 1962, within three months, the appellant sent his explanation. On April 6, 1963 the respondent wrote to the Board that they had considered the explanation of the licensee, that since the explanation was not satisfactory the respondent had decided to revoke the licence. and inquired if the Board was willing to purchase the undertaking. On 20th April, 1963, the Board expressed its willingness to purchase the undertaking with effect from August 1, 1963. On May 17. 1963.
 the respondent revoked the licence with effect from August 1, 1963, and directed the appellant to deliver the undertaking to the Board.
 The appellant's writ petition to the High Court challenging the orders was dismissed.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) Section 4 contemplates that the Board should make its recommendation only after considering the explanation of the licensee. When the government consults the Board on the question of revocation of a licensee the Board is to make up its mind as to whether it should recommend, (i) to revoke the licence, or (ii) not to revoke the licence, or (iii) to permit the licence to remain in force subject to such further terms and condition, as may be though proper. The Board would not be able to make a choice out of these three courses without considering the explanation of the licensee, because, the explanation may make out case for not revoking a licence. In the present case, the Board was consulted much before the receipt of the appellant's explanation. The entire chain of correspondence between the Government and the Board shows that there was no second consultation between the Government and the Board regarding the revocation of the licence after the Government had received the appellant's explanation to the show cause notice. Any telephonic consultation is out of question, because, such telephonic consultation could not be held with the three members of the Board at one and the same time, nor could the members bestow collective consideration on the matter before giving the Board's opinion thereon. [64D-E; 65F; 68F-H; 69A- C] (2) There is no force in the contention that the consultation with the Board is only as regards 'public interest. [69C] (3) The words "after consulting the Board" show that the construction suggested by the respondent that the Board was to be consulted only at the stage when the Government takes a provisional decision is not correct. [69D] (4)Having regard to the object and context the condition of consulting the Board after the licensee's explanation was received is mandatory and the breach of this condition will makes the order of revocation void, [70F] 61 (a) The power of revoking a licence is a drastic power as it results in the severe abridgment of the right to carry on a business. Having in mind the requirements of Art. 19(1)(g) of the Constitution, Parliament has prescribed conditions to prevent the abuse of power and to ensure just exercise of the power,. [69G] (b)When revoking a licence the State-Government acts in two stages. It forms a tentative opinion regarding revocation of a licence and calls for explanation from the licensee. When the explanation is received, Government considers it and thereafter, if not satisfied, passes the final order of revocation. But first impressions and provisional judgments have a tendency to become Ultimate ideas and final judgments. Therefore, Parliament interposed the condition of consultation with the Boar before government takes its final decision. The Board is an independent body consisting of three members one of whom is a technical expert, the other a financial expert and the third an administrative expert. While considering the facts presented to it by the Government and by the licensee in his explanation, the Board will act with an open mind and will offer unbiased counsel to the Government. [706-E] (c)The clause "if in its opinion the public interest so requires" and cls. (.a) to (d) of s. 4 prescribe some of the conditions precedent for the exercise of the power of revocation and an order of revocation in breach of any of these conditions will be void. The phrase "after consulting the State Electricity Board" occurs between the clause 'if in its opinion the public interest so requires' and cls. (a) to (d). The context shows that the consultation with the Board is also a condition precedent for making the order of revocation and breach of this condition precedent would entail the same consequences as the breach of other conditions, [69G-70B] (d)It is true that the opinion of the Board is not binding on the government, for, in spite of the Board advising against revocation, the government, if satisfied that it is necessary to revoke the licence, may revoke the.licence. But this should not be regarded as an overweighing consideration, because, it will normally be difficult for the government to ignore the Board's expert advice. [71D-E] State of U.P. v.

 (5)It is true that the appellant did not urge the point, regarding consultation with the Board, in the High Court.
 But no prejudice would be cause to the respondents if the point was.permitted to raised in this Court. [63A; 65G] (a)The counter affidavits of the Government and the Board show that the Government as well as the Board understood that petition as raising the challenge to the orders on the ground of want of due consultation with the Board before making the impugned orders and they have replied to the implicit challenge in the petition. [63F-G] (b)The facts requisite for deciding the issue are on record and the appellant had raised the point as a ground in the statement of the cm, and the respondents are not taken by surprise.
