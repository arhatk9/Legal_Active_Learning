 In Firm A.T.B. Mehtab Majid & Co. v. State of Madras, [1963] Supp. 2 S.C.R. 435, the Supreme Court struck down Rule 16 of the Madras General Sales Tax Rules made under Madras General Sales Tax Act, IX of 1939, on the ground that where a tanner buys raw hides and skins inside the State and sells them after tanning he pays the tax only on the purchase price of raw hides and skins whereas a dealer who purchases raw hides and skins from outside the State and sells the tanned hides and skins pays the tax on the price for which tanned hides and skins are sold and therefore pays more tax. In order to deal with this situation, the Madras Legislature passed Act 11 of1963. As section 2(1) of this Act provided a uniform rate of 2 per cent for sales during the whole of the period between 1st April 1955 and 31st March 1959, it was struck down by the Supreme Court in A. Hajee Abdul Shakoor & Co. v.
 State of Madras [1964] 8 S.C.P.. 217.
 In order to get over this objection section 2(1) had been enacted by Madras Act 37 of 1964. Under this section the tax is leviable on the first seller of dressed hides and skins at the rate of one and nine-sixteenth per cent for the period between 1st April 1955 and 31st March 1957. For the period between 1st April 1957 and 31st March 1959 it is to be at the rate of two per cent. The tax is on the amount for which such hides and skins were last purchased in the untanned condition.
 On the question whether section 2(1) of Madras Act 37 of 1964 contravenes Article 286 of the Constitution, 
HELD : What is taxed under the impugned statute is not the purchase of raw hides and skins whether inside or outside the State. In both the cases it is On the first sale of tanned hides and skins. Even if a person purchases raw hides and skins inside the State and sells it after tanning he pays the tax on the sale of the tanned hides and skins and not on the Purchase of raw hides and skins though the amount of tax payable is calculated on the amount for which such raw hides and skins were purchased. Similar is the position with regard to raw hides and skins purchased outside the State. Thus there is no discrimination between the sellers of tanned hides and skins whether the raw hides and skins out of which they were tanned were purchased inside the State or outside the State. The tax is not leviable even in the case of raw hides and skins imported from another State but on hides and skins tanned from those raw hides and skins. Only the tax is levied on the amount for which the raw skins and hides ware purchased. This amount is used only for the purpose of quantification of the tax. The impugned statute does not suffer from the vice of taxation of the imparted raw hides and skins. [430 C-F]
