 Under the E. P. Holdings Consolidation and Prevention of Fragmentation) Act, 1948, a scheme, for consolidation of holdings was framed for the petitioner's village and a repartition of the lands was proposed. The petitioner objected to the repartition and contended that under the scheme he was entitled to retain his plots Nos. 635 and 636 and to get some more land adjacent to them in exchange for other lands belonging to him. This contention was rejected by the Consolidation Officer The petitioner filed an appeal before the Settlement Officer 540 but the appeal also failed. Against this the petitioner filed an appeal before the State Government under s. 21 (4) of the Act, which was heard by Shri Brar, Assistant DIrector, Consolidation, to whom the power to hear such appeals had been delegated under s. 41 (1). Shri Brar allowed the appeal and the petitioner became entitled to retain plots Nos. 635 and 636. Respondent No. 2 to whom these plots had been given on repartition moved the State Government under s. 42 to revise the order made by Shri Brar, and the State Government set aside the order of Shri Brar and restored that of the Consolidation Officer. The petitioner filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court challenging the order of the State Government contending that under S. 42 it could not interfere with an order made by itself or by an officer exercising powers of the Government delegated to him under s. 41 (1).
 Held (per Das, Sarkar and Dayal, JJ.) that s. 42 did not empower the State Government to interfere with an order passed by an officer to whom the power to hear appeals filed under s. 21 (4) had been delegated by it under s. 41 (1).
 The words II any order passed .... by an officer under this Act, in s. 42 did not include an order passed by an officer in exercise of powers delegated to him by the Government under s. 41 (1). Section 21 (4) gives the power to the Government to hear appeals, and an order made in the exercise of that power, whether by the Government itself or by its delegate, would be an order of the Government.
 Section 42 was applicable to an order made by a subordinate officer exercising independent powers under the Act.
 Lakha Singh v. Director, Consolidation of Holdings, Punjab, A. 1. R. (1959) Punj. 157, disapproved.
 The. impugned order infringed the fundamental rights of the petitioner and he was entitled to a writ or direction from the Supreme Court. If the order was allowed to stand the petitioner would be deprived of plots Nos. 635 and 636 which were his property.
 Per Kapur and Hidayatullah, JJ.-The State Government had jurisdiction to revise the order made by Shri Brar. Under s. 42 the Government had over-all control at all stages of the Consolidation proceedings. An officer to whom powers were delegated under s. 41, though exercising the powers of the Government was still an officer of the State Government and his order was subject to the power of revision under s.
 
42. The order made by Shri Brar under s. 21 (4) was an order of repartition and was liable to be revised under s.
 42.
 541 Lakha Singh v. Director, Consolidation of Holdings, Punjab, A. I. R. (1959) Punj. 157, approved.
