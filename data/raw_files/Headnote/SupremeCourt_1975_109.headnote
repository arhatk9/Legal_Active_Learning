 The appellant is the decree-holder. He obtained a money decree against the respondent judgment-debtor and took a warrant of attachment of flat No. 9 of Paresh Cooperative Housing Society Limited at Santacruz, Bombay. This flat was attached on August 8, 1970 and a warrant of attachment was served on the judgment-debtor while he was in jail in Rajkot. In, due course a sale proclamation was also issued in respect of the flat while the judgment-debtor was yet in jail. At this stage of the proceedings, the judgment- debtor's brother, Hasmukh J. Joshi took out a chamber summons challenging the execution oil the ground that the flat did not belong to the judgment-debtor but belonged to him and to the judgment-debtor's wife and that the attachment should be raised. His chamber summons was made absolute but in appeal the order was set aside and the matter was remanded. The aforesaid chamber summons was, however, finally dismissed on September 30, 1971. Hasmukh did not take any further action against the rejection of his claim to the property. After coming out of the jail, the judgment-debtor filed a suit some time in 1972 to set aside the decree. He, however, could not secure an order for injunction to prevent the execution of the decree and the suit is pending. The flat was offered for sale and was purchased in auction by one Bhupendra N. Shah for a sum of Rs. 34,000/-. The sale, however, is not yet confirmed.
 Subsequently a new plea was taken by the judgment-debtor.
 This time he filed a chamber summons on March 28, 1972, praying for the dismissal of the execution petition filed by the decree-holder and for setting aside the warrant of attachment and proclamation of sale on the ground that the flat being a flat in a cooperative housing society was not liable to attachment and sale. It was also stated that he had not saleable interest in the said property under section 60, Civil Procedure Code, and therefore, it was not liable to attachment. The Judge, City Civil Court, Bombay, dismissed the chamber summons. The learned single Judge, Bombay High Court, however, in appeal allowed the claim and made the summons absolute by directing that the attachment and sale of the flat being illegal be set aside. The appellant preferred a Letters Patent Appeal before the Bombay High Court without success and the decision of the learned single Judge was affirmed. Hence this appeal by special leave.
 It was contended for the appellant that the right of the judgment-debtor, who claims the right to occupation of flat No. 9, is liable to attachment and sale in execution of a decree. The respondent contended that section 31 of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960, completely bars attachment and sale of the flat in question in execution of the decree. It was also contended for the respondent that section 60, Civil Procedure Code, does not specify that this species of property is liable to attachment.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) While section 29(2) refers to transfer of a member's share or his interest in the capital or property of any society, section 31 in contrast speaks of "the share or interest of a member in the capital of a society". The Act, therefore, makes a clear distinction between the share or interest in the capital and share or interest in property of the society. [278D-E] (ii) The right or interest to occupy is a species of property. There is 271 nothing in the language of section 31 to indicate that the right to occupation which :is the right to be sold in auction is not attachable in execution of the decree. There is nothing in section 31 to even remotely include a prohibition against attachment or sale of the aforesaid right to occupation of the flats. The only restrictions under section 29(2) are that the member may not transfer his interest in the property prior to one year and the transfer is made to an existing member of the society or to a person whose application for membership has been accepted by the Society. It is true that bye-law 71D says that a member to whom a tenement is allowed shall not assign or underlet, vacate or part with the possession of the tenement or any part thereof without the previous consent in writing of the Managing Committee, but there is nothing to show that contravention of this bye-law makes the assignment void under the Act unlike in the case of a transfer being void under section 47(3). Section 29 read with rule 24 shows that there is no prohibition as such against transfer of a share to a member or even to a non-member if he consent. to be a member and makes an application for membership by purchasing five shares as provided under bye-law 9. There is no reason to think that there is any question of refusal of membership of the Society to a non-member if he' is qualified otherwise and makes an appropriate application in which cast the transfer of shares will be operative and thus the assignment of the right to occupation will hold good.
 [278F-H, 279-B] (iii)Section 60 of the Civil Procedure Code is not exhaustive as such. It also refers to any other saleable property, movable or immovable, whether the same be held in the name of the judgment-debtor or by another person on his behalf. The right to occupation of a flat is property both attachable and saleable. Specific non-inclusion of a particular species of property under section 60, is therefore, not of any consequence if it is saleable otherwise. [280-F-G]
