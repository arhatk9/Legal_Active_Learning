 The assessee-respondent is the holder of an impartible estate. By an indenture dated 23rd November, 1963, he granted to his wife two premises for life by way of supplementary maintenance grant. It was a direct transfer which was admittedly not effected for any consideration or in connection with the agreement to live apart. During the assessment years 1957-58 to 1960-61, the income from these house properties was included in the total income of the assessee under section16(3) (a) (iii) of the Act At the instance of the assessee the matter was referred to the High Court. TWO questions fell for consideration before the High Court, namely, (i) whether the Tribunal was justified in holding that the provisions of s. 16(3)(1)(iii) applied to the income arising from the property; and (ii)whether the Tribunal was right in holding that the income under the said provisions was to be included in the total income for the purpose of computing the net annual value of the residential house, under the first proviso of s. 9(2). The High Court answered the first of the two questions in favour of the assessee and, therefore, did not think it necessary to go into the other question.. On appeal by certificate to this Court, the material question was whether the income from the house properties transferred by the assessee was liable to be included the income of the assessee.
 
HELD : (i) The incident of impartible estate have been well settled by the decisions of the Courts in this country as well as by the decisions of the judicial committee. The holder of an impartible estate has uncontrolled power of enjoyment and disposal of the impartible estate as well as the income arising therefrom; yet the estate belongs to the Hindu joint family of which the holder is a member. Subject to any custom to the contrary, on the death of the holder of an impartible estate, the estate devolves by survivorship.

 (ii)After s. 9 was amended by incorporating s.. 9(4), the income of house property owned by the holder of an impartible estate has to be considered as his individual income. From this it follows-that had the assessee not transferred the premises in question in favour of his wife, the income from those premises would have been considered as his individual income under section 9. The contention that s. 9(4) (a) raises a legal fiction which is limited for the purpose of s. 9 is fallacious. Section 9 deals with only one head of income. Section 9(4) (a) speaks for the purpose of this Section" which really means for the purpose of deter- 523 mining the taxable income of the assessee. An assessee is not separately taxed under each head of income., Hence when a source of income is transferred from assessee to his wife excepting for the two purposes mentioned in s. 16(3) (a) (ii), income from that purpose has to be considered as the income of the assessee because of asset of the assessee stands transferred to his wife. Such a conclusion does not amount to extending the fiction created under s. 9 beyond the purpose for which it is, created. It merely gives effect to that fiction. It is true that a legal fiction may not be extended beyond the purpose for which it is created but that does not mean that the Court should not give effect to that fiction. [526H to 527D] Section 27(ii) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 which has taken place of s. 9(4) of the Act makes explicit that was implicit in the provision, as it originally stood. [527D-E] (iii)It follows as necessary corollary that the annual value of the assessee's residential house has to be computed at 10% of the total income of the assessee which income includes the income from the house properthis transferred to his wife as required by the first proviso to s. 9(2).
