 Under the Bombay Agricultural Produce Markets Act, 1939 as amended in 1954, a Market area is first declared under s.
 4(1), after which, under s. 4A, a Principal Market Yard and one or more sub-,Market Yards may be constituted for the area. The effect of constituting the Market Area and Market Yard is that the purchase or sale of agricultural produce in any place in the area is prohibited except in the Principal and sub-Market Yards. Under s. 5 the State Government may establish a Market Committee for the market area.
 In 1951, the town in which the appellants were carrying on business in :agricultural produce was declared, along with surrounding villages, as the .Market Area. In 1954, after the Act was amended by the addition of s: 4A, the Government notified the area in which the appellants were carrying on business as the Principal Market Yard of the Market area.
 On 5th January 1965, the Government issued a Notification by which land granted to the Market Committee established under the Act for the Market Area, was declared to be the Principal Market Yard with effect from 15th January 1965.
 The appellants challenged the Notification, but the High Court dismissed their writ petition.
 In appeal to this Court :
 
HELD : (1) The Government has the power to issue the Notification in public interest, but the prohibition on the appellants, implicit in the Notification, was unreasonable and to that extent violated the fundamental rights of the appellants to carry on their business, because, it was impossible for them to shift their business to the new Principal Market Yard within ten days. [376 A-C, D-F] (2) The Government could have declared the area in which the appellants were carrying on the business as a Sub-Market Yard and rectified the Notification, but this Court cannot assume the functions of the Government and direct the Government to do so. [376 F-G] (3) Since the Market Committee bad however agreed to grant a reasonable period of one and a half years time to the appellants to enable them to shift to the Principal Market Yard and to permit them to continue their business in the old Market Yard during that period, the Notification need can be struck down.
