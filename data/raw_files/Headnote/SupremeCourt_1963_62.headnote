 The Vizianagram family was a joint Hindu family. It owned a very large estate which was impartible and devolved by primogeniture. At Various times the holder of the estate 404 acquired other properties, moveable as well as immovable, some of which were incorporated in the impartible estate.
 In 1948, the Madras Estates (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1948 was enacted and the Vizianagram estate was taken over by the State. The holder of the estate filed a suit for partition of the joint family properties, claiming as impartible the estate as originally granted to the ancestors of the party together with certain immovable properties subsequently acquired and incorporated in the original estate and certain jewels described as regalia.
 The suit was contested, inter alia, on the grounds that the subsequently acquired immovable properties were not impartible, that the theory of incorporation could not apply to movables and that even if the buildings had been incorporated in the estate by virtue of s. 18 (4) of the Act they became partible.
 Held that the immovable property subsequently acquired which had been incorporated in the estate originally granted was also impartible. An ancestral estate to which the holder has succeeded by the custom of primogeniture is part of the joint estate of the undivided Hindu family. Though the other rights enjoyed by member of a joint If Hindu family are inconsistant in the case of an impartiable estate the right of survivorship still exists. Unless the power is excluded by statute or custom,the holder of customary impartible estate, by a declaration of his intention, can incorporate with the estate his self-acquired immovable property and thereupon the said property accrues to the estate and is impressed with all its incidents including a custom of descent by primogeneture In all such cases the crucial test is one of intention. A holder of an impartible estate can alienate the estate by gift inter vivos, or even by a will, though the family is undivided; the only limitation on this power could be by a family custom to the contrary or the conditions of the tenure which have the same effect. The Madras Impartible Estates Acts, 1902-1901 have expressly made impartible estates inalienable; this inalienability attaches not only to the estate as originally granted but also to the properties incorporated in it.

 The theory of incorporation does not apply to movable property. But if a family custom is proved that a ceartain 405 Category of movable property is recognised by the family as impartible that custom would be recognised. A family custom, like any other special custom should be ancient and invariable and must be proved by clear and umambiguous evidence. In the case of a family custom, instances it support of the custom may not be as many or as frequent as in the case of customs pertaining to a territory or to a community. In dealing with family customs, the consensus of opinion amongst the members of the family, the traditional belief entertained by them and acted upon by them, their statements and their conduct would all be relevant. The evidence in the present case established that there was a family custom under which some of the ceremonial jewels were treated as forming part of the regalia which belonged to the holder of the estate.

 The buildings which had been incorporated in the impartible estate were not made partible by s. 18 (4) of the abolition Act. The buildings falling within s. 18 (4) were vested in "the person who owned them immediately before the vesting".
 The expression "the person who owned" refers only to the landholder and not to other persons. The fact that the word "landholder" was riot used in s. 18 (4) made no difference.
