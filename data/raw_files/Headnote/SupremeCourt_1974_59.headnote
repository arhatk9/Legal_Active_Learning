 By Section 8 of the Madhya Pradesh Madhyarrik Shiksha Adhiniyam, 1965 the Board of Secondary Education was empowered to prescribe courses of instruction in such branches of Secondary education as it may think fit. The Board claimed that the power to prescribe courses of instruction carried with it by necessary implication the power to prescribe text books, and did prescribe text books on languages. This Act was replaced by the Madhya Pradesh Prathmik Middle School Tatha Madhyamik Shiksha (Pathya Pustakon Sambandhi Vyavastha) Adhiniyam, 1973. Section 4(1) empowered the State Government to prescribe text books according to syllabi laid down under s. 3. The proviso to sub-section (1) enacted that the text books for secondary education shall not be prescribed without prior consultation with the Board. Sub-section (2) of this section stated that the text books prescribed by the State Government or the Board and 'in force' immediately before the appointed day shall, till they are changed in accordance with the provisions of this Act, be the text-books prescribed for the purpose of sub-section (1). Sub-section (3) prohibited the use of any books,other than the text books prescribed under subsection (1) or referred to in sub-section (2) in any approved school or recognised school from the appointed day, that is, 23rd March, 1973. In exercise of the powers conferred by section 4(1) the State Government issued a notification dated 24th May, 73 giving its approval to certain text-books for the Higher Secondary School Certificate Examination in which it was stated that the approval of these text books was given by the State Government in consultation with the Board of Secondary Education. A notification was issued by the Board on 28th March, 1973 giving directions that the scheme of examination for the higher secondary school certificate examination 1976 shall continue as per the same examination in 1975 and that except for the language subjects the text-books recommended or prescribed by the Board for higher secondary school certificate examination 1975 in respect of other subjects shall be the recommended or prescribed text-books for the same examination for the year 1976.
 The petitioner carried on business in printing, publishing and selling text-books for use in schools in the State. The petitioner was one of the publishers who registered himself with the Board and submitted text-books published by him for the approval of the Board. From among the books received for approval the Board recommended certain text-books but none of the text-books prescribed or recommended by the Board was text book printed and published by the petitioner.
 In a petition under article 32 of the Constitution it was contended (1) that before the 1973 Act the State Government had no statutory authority to prescribe any textbooks and, therefore, the text-books published by the Text Book Corporation and prescribed by the State Government could not be said to be validly prescribed and they could not be regarded as text-books 'in force' immediately before the appointed day under s. 4(2) of the Act, (2) that there was no statutory provision empowering the Board to Prescribe any text-books on languages and the notification prescribing the text-books was ineffective because it was issued 625 by the Board and not by the State Government which alone could prescribe the text-books under s. 4(1); (3) that the text-books recommended by the Board could not be regarded as text-books 'in force' immediately before the appointed day under s. 4(2) and the notification dated 28th March, 1973 issued by the Board did not have the effect of prescribing any of these text-books (4) that though the notification dated 24th May, 1973 stated that the approval to the text- books was accorded by the State Government in consultation with the Board, there was' in fact, no prior consultation as required by the proviso to sub-section (1) of section 4 and the notification was, therefore, void, and (5) that section 4 imposed unreasonable restrictions on the petitioner's right to carry on his business in as much as it did not provide adequate machinery for selection of text books and left it to the unfittered and unguided discretion of the State Government and so was violative of article 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.
 
HELD: The text-books printed and published by the Text-books Corporation were validly and lawfully prescribed by the State Government in exercise of its executive power and they were 'in force' immediately before the appointed day. These text-booksaccordingly fall within the category of prescribed text-books under s. 4(2)and s. 4(3) of the Act. The action of the State Government in prescribing the text-books, printed and published by the Text Book Corporation, to the exclusion of other text-books on the subjects did not infringe any right of the petitioner and other publishers and-it was within the executive power of the State. The State Government could act in exercise of executive power in relation to any matter with respect to which the State legislature had power to make laws even if there was no legislation to support executive action; but such executive action must not infringe rights of any person. The fact that prior to 1973 there was no statutory provision like s.4(1) of the 1973 Act which empowered the State Government to prescribe any text books did not-mean that the State Government was not entitled to prescribes these books in exercise of its executive power under article 162 of the Constitution.[638-D; B-C;

 (2) The Board has undoubtedly the power to prescribe courses of instruction in languages, but it does not include, as necessarily incidental to it, the power to prescribe text- books on languages. It is not correct to say that the course of instruction in language cannot be laid down except by reference to text books prescribed for the purpose. The prescription of text books on languages was outside the power of the Board and hence it was ultra vires and had no binding effect which would oblige the schools to use only those text books and no others. it is only the State Government and not the Board which is given power under s.
 4(1) to prescribe text books and therefore, the notification dated 28th March, 1973 which was issued by the Board and not by the State Government was futile and ineffectual and did not have the effect of prescribing these text books under s.
 4(1). The Board is a creature of the statute and unless the statute creating it invests it with power to prescribe text- books so as to make it obligatory on the schools to adopt such text books and no other for study and teaching, it can not claim to exercise such power. The Board also, cannot in the absence of power expressly or by necessary implication conferred on it by the statute. make it a condition of recognition of schools that they shall follow only the text books prescribed by it and no other text books shall be used by them for study and teaching. The Act of 1965 under which the Board was created did not in express terms give power to the Board to prescribe text books, nor did it provide anywhere that the Board shall be entitled to make it a condition of recognition that the schools shall use the text books prescribed by it and no others. [639 B; 640 B-D; 638 E-G] (3) The notification dated 28th March, 1973 cannot be read as representing exercise of power under s. 4(1) and the status of prescribed text books could not be accorded to the four text books on the strength of this notification. [641 B] There is a basic distinction between recommendation and prescription of tex books. Prescription of a text book carries with it a binding obligation to follow the text book. There is no such obligation when a book is merely recommended.
 626 No conferment of statutory power is needed to enable the Board to recommend text books and no question of ultra vires can arise in such a case. The text books were merely recommended and not prescribed by the Board and being only recommended text books, they obviously could not be said to be 'in force' immediately before the appointed day. Section 4(2) did not, therefore, apply in respect of these text books. [640 E-H] (4) The notification dated 24th May, 1973 must be held to be invalid as being in breach of the mandatory requirement of the proviso to section 4(1) of the Act. It is clear beyond doubt that there was no prior consultation with the Board before the State Government issued the notification. The proviso to section 4(1) clearly lays down a condition for the exercise of power and unless this condition is satisfied the power cannot be exercised by the State Government. It is settled law that where the validity of an order depends on the fulfilment of a condition precedent and there is a recital in the order that the condition precedent is satisfied, the presumption arises in favour of the satisfaction of the condition precedent and the burden is on the person challenging the satisfaction of the condition precedent to prove that in fact the condition precedent was not satisfied. In the instant case the question as to what text books should be recommended to the State Government for prescription was not placed before the general meeting of the Board, nor was any resolution passed by the general meeting of the Board recommending any text books. The recommendations in regard to the text books were made by the Chairman of the Board, which were not made as an emergency measure nor was any power of the Board vested in the Chairman by the regulations. There is nothing in the Act or the regulations which says that consultation with the Chairman would be tantamount to consultation with the Board.
 The consultation which Government had before issuing the notification dated 24th May, 1973 was consultation with the Chairman and not with the Board. [644 E; 641F] Swadeshi Cotton Mills v. The State of U. P. [1962] 1. S.C.R.
 422. referred to.
 (5) No fundamental right guaranteed to the petitioner under article 19(1)(g) was infringed, if the State Government, in exercise of the statutory power conferred under s. 4(1), did not prescribe text books printed and published by them. It is not possible to say that arbitrary and uncontrolled power has been veste in the State Government and on that account Section 4(1) is bad. The power to select and prescribe text books is not an unguided and unfettered power which leaves it free to the State Government to select and prescribe such text books as it may wantonly or capriciously please, but it is a power which is confined and embanked within limits by the object and purpose for which it is conferred. The State Government has to exercise this power in the light of the policy or principle that the best possible text books should be made available to the students. [648A; 649 D,B] It is true that the power conferred on the State Government is a large, discretionary power and no machinery is laid down by the legislature which would ensure just and proper execution of the power by the State Government, but on that account alone conferment of the power connot be held to be invalid. Whenever a discretionary power is conferred on any authority there is always a potential danger of its exercise or abuse, however much the legislature may try to hedge it with safeguards. But the mere possibility that the power may be misused or abused cannot per se induce the court to deny the existence of the power. The State legislature has confided this power not to any petty official but to the State Government and that itself is a guarantee that the power would be exercised in conformity with the policy or principle laid down in the statute.
