 D, a Divisional Engineer of Posts and Telegraphs was suspended from service for irregularities in the matter of allotment of telephones. The charges were firstly, that irregularities were committed by him with a view to secure illegal gratification for himself and others and secondly, that he was a party to the commission of irregularities having thereby facilitated acceptance of illegal gratification by his subordinates. The enquiry officer found him guilty of misdemeanour by disobeying orders expressly issued. The report of the Enquiry officer was sent by the President to the Union Public Service Commission for their recommendations. In the meantime was informed that the Government of India had decided to dismiss him subject to the advice of the Union 969 Public Service Commission, and that he should show cause why he should not be dismissed. The Public Service Commission agreed with the view of the Enquiry Officer that there was contravention of the specific orders issued by granting "casual connections" from time to time, but the Commission was of the opinion that this may amount to neglect to open defiance of the order of his superior and the be suspicion, there was nothing on the record to connect D with receiving illegal gratification, and advised that D `be retired compulsorily'. The appellant was informed that the President had come to the conclusion that he was guilty of gross negligence and disobedience of orders, and though the Union Public Service Commission had advised that he be retired compulsorily as it was not a permissible punishment under the rules, the President had decided that D should be removed from service with immediate effect. The appellants writ petition to the High Court of the Punjab for mandamus and certiorari was dismissed and thereafter he came up by special leave to this Court.
 ^ Held, that the Civil Service Rules merely prescribe diverse punishments which may be imposed upon a delinquent public servant; the rules do not provide for specific punishments for different misdemeanours. The Rules leave it to the discretion of the punishing authority to select the appropriate punishment having regard to the gravity of the misdemeanour. It is not for the enquiry authority to propose punishment.
 The power of the President to impose punishment for misdemeanour found proved against a delinquent public servant, is unrestricted and is not circumscribed by the proposal about punishment by the enquiry officer which the latter was incompetent to make. It was for the President to arrive at a tentative conclusion as to the guilt of the delinquent public servant and to propose the appropriate punishment. The Constitution merely guarantees the protection of a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed; it does not guarantee that the punishment shall not be more severe than a prescribed punishment.
 The President is by Art. 320 of the Constitution required to consult the Union Public Service Commission in disciplinary matters but the President is not bound by the advice of the Commission. The Union Public Service Commission is not an appellate authority over an Enquiry Officer.
 In the present case, in imposing punishment of removal from service the President did not violate the guarantee of reasonable opportunity to show cause against the action proposed to be taken against the appellant.
