 The Judicial Magistrate convicted the appellant under s. 9 of the Opium Act for being in possession of over 1 Kg. of opium without a licence and sentenced him for 8 months R.I.
 and to pay a fine of Rs. 500/-. The order of conviction and sentence was confirmed in appeal by the Sessions Judge and in revision by the High Court.
 According to the prosecution, the appellant was arrested under s. 54 Cr.P.C. and while he was in the police lock-up, he was alleged to have made a statement that he had kept a tin of opium in his house. Accordingly, he was taken to his house where the accused is alleged to have handed over a tin of opium to the police. Before they were arrested, the appellant and another made an application ,before the Sarpanch of the village Panchayat stating that they were apprehensive that they would be involved in some false charge or the other on account of their enmity with certain persons.
 Three courts had, however, held concurrently that the charge levelled against the accused stands clearly established.
 All the courts below had rejected the defence evidence summarily.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) It is common ground that on June 9, 1968, the appellant was in the lock-up. Suddenly, the appellant made a disclosure that he had concealed a large quantity of opium in his house. The appellant was not arrested on the charge or on suspicion that he was in possession of contraband opium. After the statement made by the appellant was recorded in police station, no case was registered against him before his house was searched. Secondly, without taking any help from any respectable person from the locality, the Constable, got hold of two persons, to accompany the police party who were involved in criminal charges earlier.
 Further an uncle of one of the witnesses was a, rival candi- date against the appellant in the Municipal elections.
 Their evidence also' was contradictory. The High Court however, unhesitatingly, believed their evidence. The High Court brushed aside the defence witness as a procured witnesses.There was no reference at all to the contradiction in the evidence of the two panchas in connection with the authenticity of the search. [395B-G] (ii) The respondent relied heavily on Ex. P.A., the statement alleged to have been made by the Appellant at the police station,which bore his signature. In view of the infirmities in the evidence of the prosecution, no reliance can be placed on other circumstances that the statement bears the Appellant's signature besides in his examination under s. 342, Cr.P.C., the appellant was not asked by the Magistrate to offer any explanation in regardto the statement. [396G-397A] In view of the exceptional circumstances of thecase, the appeal was allowed. 1397C]
