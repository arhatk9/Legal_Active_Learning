 The predecessor-in-interest of the respondents filed a suit for a declaration that the Hiba-bil-Ewaz executed by him was void and inoperative due to fraud and misrepresentation proceeding from the appellant (donee), the allegation being that the appellant represented it to be a deed of cancellation of a will.
 The trial court and the first appellate court dismissed the suit. In second appeal, the High Court remanded the case to the first appellate court holding that the finding given by the court below that the plaintiff had executed the document after knowing its contents was not sufficient in law to throw out the plaintiff's case, because, in view of the allegations in the plaint that the appellant was assisting him in the management of his property and that as a result thereof the plaintiff had developed confidence in the appellant which was abused by him by getting the document executed in his favour by the plaintiff, it was incumbent on the court to find out whether the done was in a position to dominate the will of the donor. After remand, the first appellate court again dismissed the suit. In a further second appeal, the High Court allowed the appeal on the ground that the written statement of the appellant contained a clear admission of intimate relationship between the parties indicative of the possibility of dominating the will of the plaintiff by the appellant, and consequently, the onus had shifted on the appellant to show that the plaintiff had access to independent advice, and since the appellant did not produce any such evidence, the plaintiff should have been taken to have proved that the document was vitiated by the undue influence of the appellant.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court.
 ^ 
 HELD : The finding of the first appellate court to the effect that the plaintiff had failed to prove that the appellant was in a position to dominate his will was not wrong or unreasonable. In any case, it did not suffer from any illegality, omission, error or defect such as is referred to in s.100(1) C.P.C. It is a finding of fact and the High Court in second appeal, had no jurisdiction to interfere with it even if it appeared to be erroneous to the High Court, the error not being of the kind indicated in the sub-section. [338 C-D] (1) The High Court in second appeal has tried to make out a new case for the plaintiff, of undue influence which was neither pleaded adequately in the plaint nor put in issue nor raised in the trial court or the first appellate court on the first occasion. [332 D-E] (a) The pleas of undue influence, fraud and misrepresentation are in law distinct categories and are somewhat inconsistent with one another. In view of 0 6, r.4 read with 0.6, r.2, C.P.C. they are required to be separately pleaded with specificity, particularity and precision. [332 H-333 A] 328 (b) The specific case set up in the plaint was that the document was vitiated by fraud and misrepresentation practised by the appellant. [332 E] (c) A general allegation in the plaint that the plaintiff was a simple old man of 90 years who had reposed great confidence in the appellant was totally insufficient to amount to an averment of undue influence of which the High Court could take notice. Apart from this general and nebulous allegation no particulars of undue influence were pleaded. Even the mere relationship between the plaintiff and the appellant (appellant was the grandson of the sister of the mother of the plaintiff) was not disclosed. It was not particularised how the appellant was in a position to dominate the will of the plaintiff, in what manner he exercised that influence, and how it was `undue' influence.
 [332 E-G; 333 A-C] (a) All that has been said in the written statement was that the relationship subsisting between the plaintiff and the appellant was marked by love and affection and was skin to that of father and son. This pleading could not be reasonably construed as an admission that he was in a position to dominate the will of the plaintiff. Normally, it would be the father and not the son who would be in a position of dominating influence. In spelling out a plea of undue influence for the plaintiff by an inverted construction of the appellant's written statement the High Court over-looked the principle of the maxim secundum allegataet probata that the plaintiff could succeed only by what he had alleged and proved. [333 D-G] (2)(a) The law relating to undue influence is the same as that embodied in s. 16, Indian Contract Act, 1872. Under s. 16(1) the Court must consider two things, namely, (i) are the relations between the donor and donee such that the donee is in a position to dominate the will of the donor ? and (ii) has the donee, in fact, used that position to obtain an unfair advantage over the donor ? Under s. 16(3), if the person seeking to avoid a transaction on the ground of undue influence, establishes that the person who had obtained the benefit was in a position to dominate his will, and that the transaction was unconscionable, the burden shifts on the party who had obtained the benefit to show that the transaction was not induced by undue influence.
 Therefore, there are three stages to be considered by the Court, in a case of undue influence in the order specified :
 (i) Whether the party seeking relief on the ground of undue influence has proved that the relations between the parties are such that one is in a position to dominate the will of the other; (ii) it is not sufficient for the person seeking relief to show merely that the relations of the parties have been such that one naturally relied upon the other for advice and that the other was in a position to dominate the will of the first in giving it. That is, making out mere influence is not sufficient and something more must be proved so as to render the influence `undue' in law; and (iii) if the transaction appears to be unconscionable, then the burden of proving that it was not induced by undue influence lies upon the person who was in a position to dominate the will of the other.

 (b) The High Court in the present case, did not consider the propositions in the order indicated and was thus led to a wrong decision. [336 B] (c) The first appellate court after a careful examination of the evidence found the first two stages against the plaintiff. It has held that although the relationship between the donor and the donee was intimate like that of father and son characterised by mutual cordiality and affection, the donee was not in a position to dominate the will of the donor, that the appellant did not exercise any undue influence on the plaintiff and that the Hiba-bil-Ewaz was voluntarily executed by the plaintiff after understanding its contents and effect. The evidence shows that (i) Though the plaintiff was an old man, he was quite fit to look after his own affairs and that he deliberately overstated his age in the plaint. (ii) There was nothing to show that his mental capacity was temporarily 329 or permanently affected or enfeebled by old age or other cause so that he could not understand the nature of the deed and the effect and consequences of its execution. [336 B-C, E-G] (iii) The scribe gave evidence that the document was prepared according to the instructions of the plaintiff in the presence of the attesting witnesses and that he read it out to the plaintiff who accepted it as correct and then affixed this thumb mark. [337 B-C] (iv) The attesting witness corroborated the scribe and the trial court and the first appellate court had concurrently found that these two witnesses were respectable, independent and disinterested persons, and that their evidence was credit-worthy. [337 D-E] (v) The scribe of the document which cancelled the registered will did not, in his evidence, state that the appellant was present when that deed was written and executed, and so, the appellant could not have come into possession of the cancellation deed to enable him to induce by misrepresentation or undue influence the execution of the Hiba-bil-Ewaz. [337 F-G] (vi) The plaintiff in his evidence refused to concede that he had brought up the appellant as a son from his very infancy and that the latter used to look after his lands, thus destroying the slender basis from which the High Court spelt out fiduciary relationship. But assuming that the Hiba-bil-Ewaz was induced by the influence of the appellant in whom the plaintiff reposed confidence such as a father does in his son, it had not been proved that the influence was undue. There is no presumption of undue influence in the case of a gift to a son even when made during the donor's illness and a few days before his death.

 674, referred to.
 (3) The first appellate court also held that the gift was acted upon by the parties, that the appellant entered into possession of the gifted land, and that it was the plaintiff's natural son who did not like the property being given to the appellant that was responsible for the filing of the suit. [337 G-338 B] (4)(a) The High Court was incompetent in second appeal to reverse the findings of fact recorded, after remand, by the first appellate court. The scope of the powers of the High Court to interfere in second appeal with the judgments and decrees of the courts below is indicated in ss. 100, 101 and 103, C.P.C. The effect of ss. 100 and 101 is that a second appeal is competent only on the ground of an error in law or prcedure and not merely on the ground of an error on a question of fact, however, gross or inexcusable the error may seem to be. Section 103 enables the High Court in second appeal where the evidence on record is sufficient to determine an issue of fact necessary for the disposal of the appeal, only; (a) if the lower appellate court has not determined that issue of fact, or (b) if it has determined that issue wrongly by reason of any illegality, omission error or defect such as is referred to in s. 101.

 (b) It is well settled that a question whether a person was in a position to dominate the will of another and procured a certain deed by undue influence is a question of fact and a finding thereon is a finding of fact, and if arrived at fairly in accordance with the procedure prescribed it is not liable to be reopened in second appeal.
