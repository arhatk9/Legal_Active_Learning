 The State Government of Uttar Pradesh after overruling objections approved a draft scheme and published it under sub-section (3) of section 68-D of the Motor Vehicles Act 1939 on 29th September, 1959 to authorise the State Transport Undertaking of Uttar Pradesh to operate state carriages on the inter-state route between Saharanpur and Delhi to the total exclusion of all other operators. The validity of the scheme was challenged before the High Court of Allahabad by 50 operators. The High Court by its judgment dated October 30, 1961 directed the State Government not to enforce the approved scheme against the said operators and also ordered that a fresh enquiry into the question whether the scheme should be approved or not, be held. The approved scheme became final as regards other operators. The result was that while the 50 operators who had filed Writ Petitions were able to operate their stage carriages on the route, those who had not filed the writ petitions could not operate The U.P. State Road Transport Corporation however commenced to operate its stage carriage too.
 The respondent State Government has not been able to hear the objections to the scheme as directed by the High Court in 1961 because of certain orders of injunction passed by the Civil Courts restraining the State Government from proceeding with the hearing in suits filed by or at the instance of one or the other of the 50 operators who have been running their services on the route all these 24 years.
 689 The petitioners in their petitions under Art. 32 questioned the validity of the proceedings pending before the State Government pursuant to the draft scheme published under Sec. 68-C of the Motor Vehicles Act 1939.
 Allowing the Writ Petitions, ^ 
 HELD: 1. It 18 very strange that Civil Courts have issued orders of injunction from time to time effectively preventing the State Government from disposing of the matter. This is a case in which the Civil Courts should not have issued orders of injunction st all since such suits are barred under sec. 9 of the Cote of Civil Procedure. [690 H] 
 2. Delay in performance of statutory duties amounts to an abuse of process of law and has to be remedied by the Court particularly when the public interest suffers thereby.
 1691 E-F] In the instant case, the delay is in the order of 26 years. The situation created by the unreasonable delay in the approval of the scheme has not merely resulted in the violation of Art 14 of the Constitution but also of the fundamental right of the other operators guaranteed under Art 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution. Therefore, the draft scheme published on February 26, 1959 ant the proceedings which have taken place pursuant thereto are quashed. The State Government is directed not to proceed with the bearing of the matter. It is open to the State Transport Undertaking to publish a fresh draft scheme under Section 68-C of the Act if it is necessary to do so. [692 C, 691 A-B] Yogeshwar Jaiswal etc. v.
