 The prosecution alleged that the appellant committed the murder of a young boy. Both the Sessions Court and the High Court imposed death sentence upon the appellant and gave "special reasons" for doing so.
 Dismissing the appeal, this Court on the question of sentence.
 ^ 
 HELD: 1. The death sentence imposed upon the appellant is set aside. The ends of justice will be met by sentencing the appellant to suffer imprisonment for life. [1270 D] In the instant case though the murder of the young boy by the appellant has to be deprecated strongly, the murder was the result of a land dispute between the deceased's father and certain other persons. The appellant is not a habitual criminal. The circumstances which led to the crime are not likely to recur. The crime had not been committed for any personal gain. This is therefore not a proper case for imposing the death sentence. [1270 C] 
 2. Since, the appellant had committed a very serious crime, the Government will not, save for weighty reasons, reduce or commute the sentence to less than fourteen years.
 [1270 E] 3 The rule that the normal sentence for the offence of murder is life imprisonment should be observed both in letter and spirit. The death sentence should be imposed in very extreme and rare cases [1270 B] Bachan Singh v State of Punjab, A.I.R. 1980 S.C. 898;
