 The second respondent (appellant in CA 2655/77) Shri Satish Chandra wrote to the President of India, on May 7, 1977, intimating his resignation from the office of Judge of the Allahabad High Court, with effect from August 1, 1977. On July 15,1977, he again wrote to the President, revoking his earlier communication,and commenced deciding matters in Court from July 16, 1977. On August 1,1977 the first respondent Shri Misra, an advocate of the High Court. filed a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution, contending that the resignation of Shri Satish Chandra, having been duly communicated to the President of India, in accordance with Article 217(1) Proviso (a) of the Constitution, was final and irrevocable, and that the continuance of res- pondent No. 2 as a High Court Judge thereafter, was an usurpation of public office. The High Court allowed the petition holding that Shri Satish Chandra was not competent to revoke his resignation letter.

1. Resigning office necessarily involves relinquashment of the office which implies cessation or termination of, or cutting asunder from the office. A complete and effective act of resigning office is one which severs the link of the resignor with his office and terminates its tenure. In the context of Art. 217(1) this assumes the character of a decisive test, because the expression "resign his office" occurs in a proviso which excepts or qualifies the substantive clause fixing the office tenure of a judge upto the age of 62 years. [21 E-F] 
2. In the absence of a legal, contractual or constitutional bar, an intimation in writing sent to the appropriate authority by an incumbent, of his intention or proposal to resign his office/post from a future specified date, can be withdrawn by him at any time before it becomes effective i.e., before it effects termination of the tenure of the office/post or employment. This is general rule equally applies to Government servants and constitutional functionaries. In the case of a Government servant, normally, the tender of resignation becomes effective and his service terminated, when it is accepted by the appropriate authority. In the case of a High Court Judge who is a constitutional functionary having under Art.
 217(1), Proviso (a), a Unilateral right or privilege to resign, his resignation becomes effective on the date from which he, of his own volition, chooses to quit office. [27 E_G] Jai Ram v. Union of India, A.I.R. 1954, SC 584 and Rai Kumar Y. Union of India, [1968] 3 S.C.R. 857 followed.

3. A High Court Judge's letter addressed to the President intimating or notifying the writer's intention to resign his office as Judge,' on a future date, does no', and cannot forthwith sever the writer from the office of the Judge, or terminate his tenure. Such a 'prospective' resignation does not, before the indicated future date is reached, become a complete and operative act of resigning his office by the Judge within the contemplation of Proviso (a) to Article 217(1).
 [22H, 23A] 
4. Public policy can be a very unsafe, questionable and unreliable ground for judicial decision. This doctrine can be applied only in a case where clear and undeniable harm to the public is made out. [24C-E] Gherulal v. Mahadeo Das [1959] Supp. 2 S.C.R., 406, applied.
 
5. In substance, the letter dated May 7, 1977, addressed by appellant 2 to the President, amounted to a proposal or notice of intention to resign at a future date and, before the arrival of that date (August 1, 1977). it did not constitute a complete act of resignation having the jural consequence of severing the link of the appellant with the office of the Judge, and hence it had been validly withdrawn by him as per his letter dated July 15, 1977 addressed to the President, there being no constitutional or legal bar to such withdrawal. [33D-E] Per S. Murtaza Fazal Ali, J. (Dissenting) 
1. Where the effectiveness of a resignation by a Judge does not depend upon the acceptance by the President, and the resignation acts ex-proprio vigore on the compliance of the conditions mentioned in Art. 217(1)(a), the resignor completely ceases to retain any control over it and becomes functus officio, though the resignation may take effect from the date mentioned in the letter, or "if no such date is mentioned, from the date of the letter itself". [54 EG] The Principles flowing as a logical corollary from the nature and character of the privileges right or power conferred by the Constitution on a Judge of a High Court or other constitutional functionaries are :- 
 1. The concept of the acceptance of resignation submitted by a High Court Judge is completely absent from Article 217(1)(a), and the effectiveness of the resignation does not depend upon the acceptance of the resignation by the President.
 If. In view of the provisions of Article 217(1)(a) and similar provision,-, in respect to high constitutional functionaries, the resignation once submitted and communicated to the appropriate authority, becomes complete and irrevocable and acts ex proprio vigore.
 III. The resignation may be effective from a particular date but the resignor completely ceases to retain any control over it and becomes functus officio once the resignation is submitted and communicated to the appropriate authority.
 IV. The resignation contemplated by Art.
 217(1) (a) is purely a unilateral act and takes effect ipso facto-once intention to resign is communicated to the President in writing and addressed to him.
 V. On a true interpretation of Article 217(1)(a), a resignation having been submitted and communicated to the President, cannot be recalled even though it may be prospective in nature so is to come into effect from a particular date.
 14 VI. The Constitution contains an express and clear Provision for the mode in which a resignation can be made. It has deliberately omitted to, Provide for revocation or withdrawal of a resignation once submitted and communicated to the President.
 In the absence of such a provision, the doctrine of implied powers cannot be invoked to supply the omission. [56 C-H, 57 A-B] Rev. Oswald Joseph Raichal v. The Right John Fielder, Lord Bishop of Oxford, 14 A.C. 259, Pinch v. Oake (1896) 1 Ch.D.

2. It is manifestly plain that there is no relationship of master and servant, employer and employee between the President and the Judge of the High Court, because a Judge is not a Government servant so as to be governed by Article 310 of the Constitution. A Judge of the High Court appointed under Art. 217 has a special status and is a constitutional functionary appointed under the provisions of the Constitution by the President. The mere fact that the President appoints him does not make him an employer of the Judge, in appointing a Judge, the President exercises certain constitutional functions as contained-in Article 217(1). It is, therefore, indisputable that a Judge of the High Court enjoys a special status under the Constitution, because of the very high position that he holds and the, dignity and decorum of the office that he has to maintain.
