 The Legislature of Bombay passed an Act entitled the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1952, which imposed (by s. 5) a general tax on every dealer whose turnover in respect of sales within the State of Bombay during the prescribed period exceeded Rs. 30,000 and (by s. 10) a special tax on every dealer whose turnover in respect of sales of special goods made within the State of Bombay exceeded Rs. 5,000 during the prescribed period. The term 'sale' was defined [in s. 2 (14)] as meaning any transfer of property in goods for cash or deferred payment or other valuable consideration, and an Explanation to this definition provided that the sale of any goods which have actually been delivered in the State of Bombay, as a direct result of such sale for the purpose of consumption in the said State shall be deemed, for the purposes of the Act to have taken place in the said State irrespective of the fact to at the property in the goods has, by reason of such sale, passed in 139 1070 another State. Rules 5 and 6 of the Bombay Sales Tax Rules, 1952, which were brought into force on the same day on which ss. 5 and 10 of the Bombay Sales Tax Act came into force provided for the deduction of the following sales in calculating the taxable turnover, viz., sales which take place (a) in the course of the import of the goods into, or the export of the goods out of, the territory of India, and (b) in the course of inter-State trade or commerce (being the two kinds of sales referred to cl. (1)(b) and cl. (2) respectively of art. 286 of the Constitution). Rule 5 (2) (1), however, required, as a condition of the aforesaid deductions, that the goods should be consigned by a railway, 'shipping or aircraft company or country boat registered for carrying cargo or public motor transport service or by registered post. In an application under art. 226 of the Constitution challenging the validity of the Act and praying inter alia for a writ against the State of Bombay and the Collector of Sales Tax, Bombay, restraining them from enforcing the provisions of the Act, the High Court of Bombay held that the definition of 'sale' in the Act was so wide as to include the three categories of sale exempted by art. 286 of the Constitution from the imposition of tax by the States, and as the Act imposed a tax on all such sales, it was wholly void. On appeal Held, per (Patanjali Sastri C. J., Mukherjea, Ghulam Hasan and Bhagwati JJ.-Bose T. dissenting)-that the Bombay Sales Tax Act (XXIV of 1952) was not ultra vires the State Legislature on the ground that it contravened art. 14 or art. 286 of the Constitution. But clause (1) of sub-rule (2) of Rule 5 of the Bombay Sales Tax Rules, 1952, was ultra vires in so far as it provided that in order that sales mentioned in clause (1) (b) and clause (2) of art. 286 of the Constitution may be exempt from tax, the goods shall be consigned only through a railway, shipping or aircraft company or country boat registered for carrying cargo or public motor transport service or by registered post. These provisions of Rule 5 (2) (1) were, however, severable from the other provisions of the Act and could be ignored.
 Per Bose T.-The Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1952, is wholly ultra vires.
 Per Patanjali Sastri C.J., Mukherjea and Ghulam Hasan JJ.
 -Article 286 (1) (a) of the Constitution read with the Explanation thereto and construed in the light of art, 301 and art. 304 prohibits the taxation of sales or purchases involving interState elements by all States except the State in which the goods are delivered for the purpose of consumption therein. The latter State is left free to tax such sales or purchases and it derives this power not by virtue of the Explanation to art. 286 (1) but under art. 246 (3) read with entry 54 of List II. The view that the Explanation does not deprive the State in which the property in the goods passed, of its taxing power and that consequently both the State in which the property in the goods passes and the State 1O71 in which the goods are delivered for consumption have the power to tax, is not correct.
 (ii)The expression "for the purpose of consumption in that State"in the Explanation to el. (1) of art. 286 must be understood as having reference not merely to the individual importer or purchaser but as contemplating distribution eventually to consumers in general within the State. and all buyers within the State of delivery from out-of -State sellers, except those buying for re-export out of the State, would be liable to be taxed. by the State.
 (iii) Clause (2) of art. 286 does not affect the power of the State in which delivery of goods is made to tax inter-State sales or purchases of the kind mentioned in the Explanation to el. (1). The effect of the Explanation is that such transactions are saved from the ban imposed by art. 286 (2).
 (iv) The fact that sales which take place (a) in the course of the import of the goods into, or export of the goods out of, the territory of India and (b) in the course of inter-State trade or commerce, are not expressly exempted by the Bombay Sales Tax Act could not render the Act ultra vires inasmuch as the Rules framed under the Act and brought into force simultaneously must be -read as a part of the Act and Rules 5 and 6 of these Rules exempt such sales. Delhi Laws Act, In re ([1951] S.C.R. 747) referred to.
 (v) The fact that the Bombay Sales Tax Act does not expressly exclude from its operation the transactions mentioned in art. 286 (1) (a) of the Constitution, viz., sales and purchases outside the State, does not render the Act ultra vires inasmuch as, on a true construction of the Explanation to art. 286 (1) (a) sales or purchases in respect of goods delivered for consumption outside Bombay are not taxable under the Act, even if the goods are in Bombay and the sale is effected there.
 (vi) The provisions of the charging sections 5 and 10 of the Act fixing Rs. 30,000 and Rs. 5,000 as the minimum taxable turnover for general tax and special tax respectively are not discriminatory and void under art. 14 read with art. 13 of the Constitution as such classfication is perfectly reasonable and no discrimination is involved in it.
 (vii) Taxing statutes imposing tax on subjects divisible in their nature which do not exclude in express terms subjects exempted by the Constitution, should not for that reason be declared wholly ultra vires and void, for, in such case it is always feasible to separate taxes levied on authorised subjects from those levied on exempted subjects and to exclude the latter - in the assessment to tax. In such cases the statute itself should be allowed to stand, the taxing authority being prevented by injunction from imposing the tax on subjects exempted by the Constitution.
 1072 Bowman v. Continental Co. [1921] USSC 153; (256 U. S. 642; 65 L. Ed.
 1130) relied on, Punjab Province v. Daulat Singh and Another ([1942] F.C.R. 67) distinguished.
 (viii)A sale "in the course of inter-State trade" in art. 286 (2) of the Constitution includes a sale by a trader in one State to a consumer in another State. The expression is not confined to sales between two traders only.
 (ix)The expression "for such State or any part thereof" in art. 246(3) of the Constitution cannot be taken to import into entry 54 of List II the restriction that the sale or purchase referred to must take place within the territory of that State. All that it means is that the laws which a State is empowered to make must be for the purposes of that State.
 (x)It is always desirable when relief under art. 226 is sought on allegations of infringement of fundamental rights, that the Court should satisfy itself that such allegations are well founded before proceeding further with the matter.
 Bose J.-(1) Article 286 (2) cannot be construed in the light of art. 304 (1) as the two articles deal with different matters.
 (ii)The basic idea underlying art. 286 is to prohibit taxation in the case of inter-State trade and commerce until the ban under el. (2) of the said article is lifted by Parliament, and always in the case of imports and exports.
 When the' ban is lifted, the Explanation to cl. (1) of 286 comes into play to determine the situs of the sale. This Explanation does not govern el. (2) of art. 286 and, as it can only apply to transactions which in truth and in fact take place in the course of inter-State trade and commerce, there is no need to call it in aid until the ban is removed.
 (iii)Explanation (2) to the definition of sale in s. 2 (14) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1952, which embodies word for word the provisions of the Explanation to art. 286 (1) directly offends cl. (2) of the said article as the ban under el. (2) has not been lifted by the Parliament.
 (iv)Assuming that the Bombay Sales Tax Rules exclude all sales which are exempt from taxation under the Constitution, they cannot save the Act, for the Rules are made by a subordinate authority which is not the legislature and the validity of an Act of the legislature cannot be made to depend on what a subordinate authority choses to do or not to do.
 (v)The good portion of the Act cannot be separated from the bad in this case, even if the Explanation to s. 2 (14) is expunged and the whole Act is therefore ultra vires.
 Bhagwati J.-(1) Under the general law relating to sale of goods, a sale must be regarded as having "taken place"in the State in which the property in the goods sold has passed to the 1073 purchaser and that State is entitled to tax the sale or purchase as having taken place inside the State. The Explanation to art. 286 (1) does not take away the right which the State in which the property in the goods passed has to tax the sale or purchase but only deems such purchase or sale, by a legal fiction, to have taken place in the State in which the delivery of the goods has been made for consumption therein so as to enable the latter State also, to tax the sale or purchase in question. The Explanation only lifts the ban imposed by cl. (1) (a) on taxation of sales or purchases which take place outside the State, to the extent of the transactions mentioned in the Explanation to enable the delivery State also to tax them.
 (ii) Delivery of the goods for the purpose of consumption in the delivery State means delivery for the purpose of use by the-consumers, and does not include delivery to a dealer purchasing the goods across the border for dealing with or disposing of the same in the ordinary course of trade, and the Explanation to art. 286 (1) therefore only covers those cases where, as a direct result of the sale or purchase, goods are delivered for consumption in the delivery State by the consumer and the delivery State can tax only this limited class of transactions under the Explanation.
 (iii) The general provision enacted in art. 286 (2) against the imposition -of tax on the sale or purchase of goods in the course of inter-State trade or commerce should give way to the special provision which is enacted in the Explanation to art. 286 (1) (a) enabling the delivery State to tax such sale or purchase in the limited class of cases covered by the Explanation, the transactions covered by the Explanation being thus lifted out of the category of transactions in the course of inter-State trade or commerce and assimilated to transactions of sale or purchase which take place inside the State and thus invested with the character of an intra-state sale or purchase so far as the delivery State is concerned.
