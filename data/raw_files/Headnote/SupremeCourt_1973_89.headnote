 The plaintiffs (respondents herein) instituted a suit for the recovery of damages for breach of contract impleading the State of U.P. (through the Collector of Bijnor) as the first defendant, and the Divisional Forest Officer, Bijnor as the second defendant. The summons in the. suit issued to the State of U.P. were served on the District Government Counsel. On September 2. 1966 the said counsel filed an appearance slip in the court and also put in a formal appli- cation praying for one month's time for the purpose of filing written statement. This prayer was granted. On October 1, 1966 the District Government counsel filed an application under s. 34 of the Arbitration Act pleading that there was an arbitration--clause in the agreement between the parties to the suit and the State of U.P. being willing to refer the matter to arbitration the suit should be stayed. The trial court held that the dispute was subject to arbitration clause and since the State of U.P. had not taken any steps in the suit proceedings and had also not filed the written statement the suit was liable to be stayed. On appeal the High Court held that the action of the District Government Counsel in applying for time to file the written statement amounted to taking a step in the proceedings within the meaning of s. 34 of the Arbitration Act. On this view the defendant was held disentitled to claim that the suit should be stayed. By special leave the defendants appealed to this Court.
 Dismissing,the appeal, 
HELD : (i) Taking other steps in the suit proceedings within the meaning of s. 34 connotes the idea of doing something in aid of the progress of the suit or submitting to the jurisdiction of the court for the purpose of adjudication of The merits of the controversy in the suit. [37E-F] A recognised agent like the District Government Counsel can scarcely be considered to appear voluntarily in a case on behalf of the Government in the sense of being unauthorised by his client for the simple reason that he is authorised by virtue of statute to appeal, act and make applications on behalf of the Government. Indeed in the present case the District Government Counsel also filed in the Court the usual appearance slip. If he wanted time for further consultations, he could and should have specifically made a prayer to that effect.
 [38C] The State took the benefit of the adjournment. It would be somewhat irrational and perhaps incongruous to permit the State, after having taken the benefit of the adjournment, to plead that the application for adjournment was not made on instructions and was unauthorised. [38E] (ii) The argument that the trial court's discretion had been erroneously reversed by the High Court was equally devoid of merit. If the appellants application was for adjournment for the purpose of filing the written statement, then there was no question of any case of discretion by the trial court. Discretion with regard to stay under s. 34 of the arbitration Act is to be exercised only when an application under that section is competent.[38G] (iii) Keeping in view the long delay after the commencement of the suit and the fact that the suit was for a very heavy amount by way of damages for breach of contract. it would be more satisfactory on the whole to have the suit tried in a competent court of law in the normal course rather than by a lay 32 arbitrator who was not bound either by the law of evidence or by the law of procedure.
