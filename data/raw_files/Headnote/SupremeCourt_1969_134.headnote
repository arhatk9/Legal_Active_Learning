 A preliminary decree was obtained by the mortgagee-firm for recovery of the principal, interest at 3% and costs by gale of the mortgaged property. The High Court in affirming the decree, directed payment of the decretal amount by November 10, 1946, and awarded interest at 3 % from the date of suit to August 11, 1941 and thereafter at 4% till the date of satisfaction. In an application for clarification of the order the High Court directed that interest be paid at 3% from October 5, 1936 till August 11, 1941 on the amount decreed by the trial court and at 4 % thereafter till November 10, 1946. During the pendency of an appeal by the mortgagor against the preliminary decree some of the partners of the mortgagee-firm migrated to Pakistan, and were declared evacuees. The court ordered that the Custodian of Evacuee Property be impleaded as a party respondent in the appeal. The appeal filed in this Court was dismissed.
 Thereafter the only partner of the mortgagee-firm who had not migrated, for himself and as agent of the evacuees applied for a decree absolute for sale. The Custodian of Evacuee Property resisted the application. Ultimately the High Court ordered that the Custodian of Evacuee Property be joined as a party to the application for decree absolute for sale, observing that the respective rights of the Custodian of Evacuee Property and the partners of the mortgagee firm were not decided in that proceeding. The, mortgagors contested the application, contending that (i) on, proper accounting nothing was due against them since they had made deposits towards the principal in the Court 0. 21 r. 1 C.P.C. as and in making some deposits they had informed the court that the payments were made, towards the principal due; (ii) the High Court by its order clarifying the decree restored the rate of interest awarded by the trial court after November 10, 1946; (iii) the mortgagee could not be awarded as interest an amount exceeding the principal, because of s. 9 of the Madhya Pradesh Money Lenders Act, 1934; and (iv) the Custodian of the Evacuee Property was not entitled to the decree absolute for sale, and that the only partner, who had not migrated, could get a decree absolute in respect only of his share. Rejecting these contentions, this Court :- 
HELD : (i) Unless the mortgagees were informed that the mortgagors had deposited the amount only towards the principal -and not towards interest, and the mortgagees agreed to withdraw the money from the court accepting the conditional deposit, the normal rule that the amounts de- posited in court should first be applied towards satisfaction of the interest and costs and thereafter towards the principal applied. There was no 524 evidence in this case, that the mortgagees were informed that the money was deposited towards principal or that the mortgagees accepted the pay.meat made towards the principal.

 47 I.A. 150, referred to.
 (ii) By directing that interest at 4% from August 12, 1941 to November 10, 1946, it was not, and could not be, intended by the High Court that interest after November 10, 1946 was to be awarded only at the rate of 3%. No such application was made by the debtors. The High Court did riot reduce the rate of interest after November 10, 1946.
 (iii) Section 9 of the Madhya Pradesh Money Lenders Act prohibited the courts from awarding interest exceeding the principal of the' loan. But the prohibition of the statute was against the making of a decree for arrears of interest exceeding the amount of loan. In the present case the decree awarded interest much less than the principal. [529 B] (iv) The court was concerned in the present proceeding to pass a decree absolute for sale in a mortgage suit. It was not concerned to determine the respective rights of the mortgagees inter se. The mortgagees' interest was fully represented before the Court. Whether or not the Custodian of Evacuee Property was entitled to the money or that the evacuees had a subsisting interest was a matter which could not be decided in this appeal. That was made clear by the judgment of the High Court in the application filed by the Custodian of Evacuee Property. [529 D]
