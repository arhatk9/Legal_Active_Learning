 The condition of eligibility laid down by the Karnataka University for admission to the first year of the Engineering Degree Course in the affiliated private colleges provides :
 "Candidates shall have passed the two year pre- university examination of the pre-university education board, Bangalore or an examination held by any other Board or University recognised as equivalent to it with English as one of the languages and Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics as optional subjects with the necessary percentage of marks laid down by the University at the time of admission.
 A student who has passed B.Sc. Examination with Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics and secured not less than 50% of the aggregate of Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics, is also eligible for admission. However, he cannot claim exemption of any sort." The Higher Secondary Examination in the State of Rajasthan required only eleven years schooling. The State of Rajasthan did not follow the pattern of 10+2 where SSLC Examination is held after 10 years schooling followed by study for a period of two years, whether in school or in college, which is termed as intermediate course at some places and Pre-University Course at others. However, so far as the State of Karnataka is concerned, it followed the pattern of 10+2 and after 10 years schooling followed by SSLC Examination, it provided for a two year Pre-University Course culminating in an examination held by the Pre- University Education Board.
 913 The appellant in Civil Appeal No. 10610 of 1983 had passed the Higher Secondary Examination conducted by the Board of Secondary Education, Rajasthan. The appellants in the other appeals had also, after the Higher Secondary Examination, passed the first year examination of the three year B.Sc. Degree Course of the University of Rajasthan / Udaipur. All these appellants were granted admission to the first year of the Engineering Degree course in different colleges/institutions affiliated to the Karnataka University. While they were studying, the Karnataka University took the view that since they had not passed the two year Pre-University Examination of the Pre-University Education Board, Bangalore and neither the Higher Secondary Examination of the Board of C Secondary Education, Rajasthan, nor the first year B.Sc. Examination of the Rajasthan and Udaipur Universities passed by them was equivalent to the Pre-University Examination of the Pre- University Education Board, Bangalore, they were not eligible for admission and accordingly the Karnataka University disapproved of their admissions and cancelled the same.
 Aggrieved by the cancellation of their admission, the appellants filed writ petitions in the High Court. A Single Judge of the High Court dismissed all the writ petitions holding (a) that the Vice-Chancellor had laid down the condition of eligibility in exercise of his emergency powers under s.12(5) of the Karnataka Universities Act and his action was approved and affirmed by the Academic Council and the Syndicate of the University; (b) that the B.Sc. Part Examination of the Universities of Rajasthan and Udaipur could not be regarded as equivalent to the B.Sc. first year Examination of the Karnataka University and a fortiori it could not be considered as equivalent to the Pre-University Examination of the Pre-University Education Board, Bangalore and in any event it was not recognised as such by the Karnataka University; (c) that each University got the power to prescribe the condition of eligibility for various courses in the colleges within its jurisdiction and the condition of eligibility prescribed by the Karnataka University was perfectly valid and since the Karnataka University had not recognised the first year B.Sc.
 Examination of any other university outside the State of Karanataka as equivalent to the Pre-University Examination held by the Pre-University 914 Education Board, Bangalore, the appellants did not satisfy the condition of eligibility and were accordingly not eligible for admission; and (d) that since the appellants were ineligible for admission to the Engineering Degree Course of the Karnataka University, any delay in the cancellation of their admission could not convert ineligibility into eligibility and this was not a case of irregular admission where less meritorious candidates were selected in preference to more meritorious candidates but it was a case where the candidates who were not eligible at 811 for admission were admitted. The Division Bench of the High Court also dismissed the appeals of the appellants in limine.
 Dismissing the appeals, ^ 
 HELD: 1. The appellants were not eligible for admission to the Engineering Degree Course of the Karnataka University and their admission was contrary to the Ordinance prescribing the condition of eligibility. However, the fault lies with the Engineering Colleges which admitted the appellants because the Principals of these Engineering Colleges must have known that the appellants were not eligible for admission and yet for the sake of capitation fee, in some of the cases, they granted admission to the appellants. Therefore, in the facts and circumstances of the case, there is no reason why the appellants should suffer for the sins of the managements of these Engineering Colleges. The appellants are, therefore allowed to continue their studies in the respective Engineering Colleges in which they were granted admission notwithstanding the view taken by the Court in this judgment. [926 B; F] 2.(i) The condition of eligibility laid down by the Karnataka University requires that the students seeking admission should have passed the two year Pre-University Examination of the Pre-University Education Board, Bangalore or an examination held by any other Board of University recognised as equivalent to it. The examination held by any other Board or University which has been passed by the candidate must be recognised by the Karnataka University as equivalent to the two year Pre-University Examination of the Pre-University Education Board, Bangalore. [923 G-H; 924 Al 915 2.(ii) It is for each University to decide the question of equivalence and it would not be right for the Court to sit in judgment over the decision of the University because it is not a matter on which the Court possesses any expertise. The University is best fitted to decide whether any examination held by a University outside the State is equivalent to an examination held within the State having regard to the courses, the syllabus, the quality of teaching or instruction and the standard of examination. It is an academic question in which the court should not disturb the decision taken by the University. [925 C-E] 2.(iii) The Higher Secondary Examination held by the Secondary Education Board, Rajasthan after only 11 years schooling could not be regarded as equivalent to the Pre- University Examination of the Pre-University Education Board, Bangalore which came as the culmination of a full 12 years course of study. It is also difficult to understand how the decision of the Karnataka University not to recognise the n first year B.Sc. examination of the Rajasthan and Udaipur Universities as equivalent to the Pre- University Examination of the Pre-University Education Board, Bangalore could be regarded as arbitrary or fanciful.
 [925 B-D] In the present case, the Karnataka University did not recognise the Higher Secondary Examination held by the Secondary Education Board, Rajasthan as equivalent to the Pre-University Examination of the Pre-University Education Board, Bangalore. And rightly so because the Higher Secondary Examination of the Secondary Education Board, Rajasthan followed only 11 years schooling while the Pre- University Examination of the Pre-University Education Board, Bangalore came at the end of 10+2 Course, that is, 12 years study. The Karnataka University also did not recognise the first year B.Sc. Examination of the Universities of Rajasthan and Udaipur as equivalent to the Pre-University Examination of the Pre-Education Board Bangalore. In fact the Academic Council took the view that first year B.Sc.
 Examination of any University outside the State of Karnataka could not be recognised at equivalent to the first year B.Sc. examination of the Karnataka University and it would therefore seem to follow a fortiori that the first year B.Sc. examination of the Rajasthan or Udaipur University was not regarded by the 916 Karnataka University as equivalent to the Pre-University Examination of the Pre-University Education Board, Bangalore. [924 B-F] The Court observed that the University of Karnataka should take appropriate action against the erring Engineering Colleges because the managements of these Engineering colleges have not only admitted students ineligible for admission but thereby deprived an equal number of eligible students from getting admission to the Engineering Degree Course.
