 Rule 2 of the All India Services (Conditions of Service-Residuary Matters) Rules, 1960 empowers the Central Government to make regulations to regulate any matters relating to conditions of service of persons appointed in an All India Service for which no provision is made in the rules under the All India Services Act, 1951; and until such regulations are made, such matters shall be regulated, in the case of persons serving in connection with the affairs of a State, by the rules applicable to officers of the State Civil Service, Class I. By an order issued in 1963 the then Punjab Government ordered that officers of the State holding Class I posts would be entitled to deputation allowance at the rates mentioned in para (i) (c) (ii) of the Order. By the application of the Punjab Reorganisation Act this order became applicable to officers serving in the State of Haryana.
 The appellant was an officer belonging to the Indian Police Service. His services were placed at the disposal of the State Electricity Board to work as a Vigilance Officer, a post which was declared equivalent in status and responsibilities to the post of Deputy Inspector General of Police, held by him under the State Government. The order of deputation passed by the Governor, while protecting the pay and other allowances received by him in the cadre post, did not however mention anything about the payment of deputation allowance to him.
 The appellant claimed deputation allowance under Rule 2(b) of the Residuary Rules. But his representation had been rejected by the State Government. He then moved the High Court for the issue of a writ; but that petition was dismissed in limine.
 Before this Court the appellant contended that he had a statutory right to get deputation allowance as provided in Rule 2(b) of the Residuary Rules.
 Allowing the appeal ^ 
 HELD: Rule 2(b) of the Residuary Rules expressly applies to officers of All India Services on deputation. [87 G] 85 
 1. The substratum of Rule 2(b) is that an officer of the All India Services on deputation would be entitled to deputation allowance equivalent to that given to Officers of the State Civil Service Class I. This Rule, read in conjunction with para (i) (c) (ii) of the Order issued by the erstwhile Punjab Government, manifestly entitles the appellant to draw deputation allowance at the rates mentioned in the Order. [87 H] 
 2. There is nothing in either Rule 6 of the IPS (Cadre) Rules, 1954 or in Rule 9 of the IPS (Pay) Rules, 1954 which debars an I.P.S. Officer from getting any deputation allowance when he was on deputation to any of the authorities mentioned in Rule 2(i) of the Cadre Rules. The mere absence of a provision for payment of deputation allowance in the Cadre Rules or Pay Rules cannot be interpreted to mean an absolute bar to the receipt of such deputation allowance if other rules permit such a course of action. Rule 9 of the Pay Rules only protects the salary admissible to I.P.S. Officers on deputation. Sub-rules 1 to 6 of Rule 9 of the Pay Rules do not prohibit payment of deputation allowance to officers. What the proviso to sub- rule 6 does is that it protects the pay and allowances of an officer on deputation so that he is not adversely affected in his emoluments while on deputation. In the absence of any express rules made by the Central Government on the subject the Residuary Rules would apply. [89D-G] 
 3. There is no substance in the argument of the Board that since the terms of deputation sanctioned by the Governor did not speak of payment of deputation allowance to the appellant, the order of deputation should be read as a modification made by the Central Government to Rule 2(b) of the Residuary Rules. Rule 2(b) makes an exception only if the Central Government makes an order in consultation with the State Government modifying the rules. There is no evidence to show that the Central Government consulted the State Government to take away the effect of Rule 2(b) of the Residuary Rules. Moreover the order of the Governor cannot be construed as an order passed by the Central Government.
