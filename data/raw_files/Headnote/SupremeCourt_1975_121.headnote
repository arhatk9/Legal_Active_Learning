 The appellant-company wanted to introduce the following scheme of D.A for its clerical staff and drivers.
 ----------------------------------------------------------- Basic Pay slabs. Percentage of Variation for basic salary every 10 points (C.P.I. 441-450) of C.P.I.
 ------------------------------------------------------------ 1st Rs. 100 120 5% 2nd Rs. 100 40 2% Rs. 201 to Rs. 500 30 1% Over Rs. 500 25 -------------------------------------------------------------- Maximum D.A. Rs. 325 ============================================================== Placing the ceiling of Rs. 325 on the D.A. was not acceptable to the employees and a reference was made to the Industrial Tribunal and the Tribunal removed the ceiling.
 In appeal to this Court, HELD:
 While the question of the desirability of ceiling on D.A.
 was not in issue in any references to Tribunals of appeals therefrom, referred to by the parties, the question of imposing a ceiling on D. A. is not an absolutely alien phenomenon. Although it might not have been the general practice, ceiling was not rejected out of hand as irrational or unjust by unions in the course .of collective bargaining in the Bombay region, in which the head-office of the appellant is situated. In the case of the employees under the Central Government also a kind of ceiling has been in vogue. [461F.G., 462A] (1) The problem of imposing or removing a ceiling on D. A.
 has to be viewed from the following among other important aspects :
 (1) Condition of the wage scale prevalent in the company.
 (2) Condition of the wage level prevalent in the industry and the region.
 (3) The wage packet as a whole of each earner in the company with all ameni ties and benefits and his ability and potency to cope with the economic requirements of daily existence consistent with his status in society, responsibilities, efficiency at work and industrial peace.
 (4) The position of the company viewed in relation to other comparable concerns in the industry and the region.
 (5) Peremptive necessity for full neutralisation of the cost of living at the rock-bottom of wages scale if at, or just above, the subsistence level.
 454 (6) The rate of neutralisation which is being given to the employees in each salary slab.
 (7) Avoidance of huge distortion of wage differentials taking into reckoning all persons employed in the concern.
 (8) Degree of sacrifice necessary even on the part of workers in general interest.
 (9) The compulsive necessity of securing social and distributive justice to the workmen.
 (10) Capacity of the company to bear the additional burden.
 (11) Interest of national economy.
 (12) Repercussions on other industries and society as a whole.
 (13) The state of the consumer price Index at the time of the decision.
 (14) Forebodings and possibilities in the foreseeable future as far as can be envisaged.
 (15) Price indices have now assumed menacing figures.Any problem regarding wage or D.A. has to be considered in that background and at the same time not losing sight of the national economy. [466E-H, 467A-C] II. The removal of ceiling in the instant case is not justified even though, on the. appellant company is a prosperous company with capacity to bear the additional financial burden if the ceiling is removed, and (ii) the consumer ,rice index has been soaring higher and higher;
 because : [465A-B, 467D] (a) The unprecedented rise in the consumer price index produces steep rise in D.A.[458H] (b) The absence of ceiling on D.A. can thus result in curious anomalous situations wherein the pay packet of the clerical staff would exceed the pay packet of junior executives which would hardly be conducive to discipline, efficiency and effective exercise of control.
 [463-GA] (c) Although the appellant employs a total of 1142 workmen in its various factories and branches, the dispute relates to only 265 workers in the head-office. A general problem like imposition of ceiling on D.A. in a company cannot be treated on the statistical burden relevant only to a section of the employees. [463C-E] 111. D.A. being intimately connected with the cost of living, the matter cannot be judged by the test submitted by the workmen, namely, that there cannot be a ceiling on D.A.
 unless there is a ceiling on profits. [467-F] IV. Also, in dealing ',with the problem of ceiling on D.A., the Tribunal's view that there should not be a ceiling on D.A. unless the company would be required to close down if the ceiling is removed, is not correct. [465-H] V. At what particular amount there should be a ceiling on D.A. is a matter which will have to be gone into by the Tribunal. But so far as the lowest paid employees at or just above subsistence level are concerned, they are entitled to 100 per cent or at any rate 95 per cent neutralisation of the rise in cost of living, and hence, there should be no ceiling on D.A. payable to employees within the slab of first Rs. 100/- unless it can be shown by the management that the rate of neutrailsation in their case is more than 100per cent. The manner in which the ceiling may be imposed, that is, at a certain amount as the outside limit of the D.A. or by reference to the quantum of D.A.
 payable at a certain wage level, or in any other manner, would also 455 have to be decided by the Tribunal in the exercise of its judicial discretion The Tribunal will have to perform this delicate task by striking a balance the weightage to be given to any principle being variable according to the conditions-and keeping in view the dominant principle of doing social justice.
