 The respondent who was charged of offences under sections 420, 471 read with section 466 Indian Penal Code and Section 132 of Customs Act was committed to the Court of Sessions.
 The offence related to alleged tampering with seals affixed by the Textile Inspector on the bales containing handloom fabric known as "Bleeding Madras". The Court split the case into two so that Sessions Case No. 34/68 was registered for the trial of the offence relating to 93 bales which were covered by a particular invoice and Sessions Case No. 2/ 1970 was registered for the goods relating to 19 bales which were covered by a different invoice. Sessions Case 34 of 1968 ended in conviction of the respondent, but, on an appeal the High Court acquitted him giving him the benefit of doubt. When the second care was taken up for trial, the respondent moved the High Court under section 215 of Criminal Procedure Code, 1898, for quashing the "proceedings". The High Court allowed the application holding (1) that the evidence in both the cases being similar and one case having ended in acquittal, further prosecution in the present case would amount to abuse of the process of the Court; (ii) even otherwise the alleged offences were committed somewhere in 1965 and it would be unfair, if not unjust, to put the petitioner on trial after about ten years and (iii) the charges were "not likely to stand".
 Allowing the appeal by special leave, the Court 
HELD : The trial of the case had not started and there was no justification for taking the view that evidence in both the cases was similar. Moreover it is not the requirement of law that if one case has ended in acquittal prosecution in another case would be illegal. So also it could not be said that the High Court's opinion that the charge was not likely to stand the trial was on a point of law within the meaning of section 215. The High Court therefore lost sight of its limitation under section 215 and quashed the "Proceedings" for reasons which were extraneous to that section. [463 A-B] The High Court took its earlier judgment in Sessions Case No. 34 of 1968 into consideration in reaching its conclusion. Here again it lost sight of the provisions of sections 40 to 44 of the Evidence Act which state the circumstances of which previous judgments are relevant in civil and criminal cases.- The judgment in S.C. No. 34 of 1968 was clearly "irrelevant" under those provisions. 463 C, D. F] In fact it was not in controversy that Sessions Case No. 2 of 1970 concerned the trial of the respondent in respect of 19 bales which formed the subject matter of separate invoices and of which the goods were inspected on different lates. It was also not controverted that a different officer inspected three of those bales and found them to be substandard goods and they were not the subject matter of the trial in case No. 34 of 1968.
