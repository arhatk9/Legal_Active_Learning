 The respondent filed a suit alleging that he was the owner of a house let out to the appellant as a tenant and claimed a decree for the appellant's ejectment, arrears of rent and future mesne profits. The appellant admitted that the land over which the house had been constructed belonged to the respondent but pleaded that the house had been constructed by the appellant at his own cost on the condition that he would continue to occupy it until the amount spent by him on the construction was. repaid to him by the respondent. The trial court disbelieved the appellant's version and also disbelieved the agreement as to the rent on which the respondent relied and held that the relationship of landlord and tenant had been proved and that the respondent was entitled to a decree for ejectment as well as to a reduced -amount by way of rent and directed the appellant to pay damages by way of use and occupation till the date of ejectment. On appeal the High Court held that the appellant must be deemed to have been in possession of the house as a licensee and treating the respondent's claim for ejectment on the basis that the appellant was proved to be a licensee of the premises, the High Court confirmed the decree for ejectment; but it set aside the decree to pay past rent and mesne profits being of the view that even if the res- pondent's case about the tenancy had been proved, such a tenancy would have been invalid because of the relevant statutory provisions then prevailing in the area. Both the appellant and respondent appealed to this Court :
 
HELD : If a party asked for a relief on a clear and specific ground, and in the issues or at the trial, no other ground was covered either directly or by necessary implication, it would not be open to the said party to attempt to sustain the same claim on a ground which is entirely new. But where the substantial matters relating to the title of both the parties to the suit are touched, though indirectly, in the issues, and evidence has been led about them, then the argument that a particular matter was not expressly taken in the pleadings would be purely fornication and technical and cannot succeed in every case. What the court has to consider in dealing with such an objection is : did the parties know that the matter in question was involved in the trial, and did they lead evidence about it ? If it appears that the parties did not know that the matter was in issueat the trial and one of them has had no opportunity to lead evidence in respect of it, that undoubtedly would be a different matter [290 F; 291 D-F] In the present case, having regard to all the facts, the High Court did not err in confirming the decree for ejectment on the ground that the appellant was in possession of the suit premises as a licensee. On the pleas taken by the appellant in his written statement in clear and unambi- guous language, only two issues could arise between the parties : is the 287 appellant the tenant of the respondent or is he holding the property as the licensee subject to the terms specified in the written statement? In effect, the written statement pleaded licence, subject to the condition that the licensee was to remain in possession until the amount spent by him was returned by the respondent. [292 G-H] Trojan & Co. Ltd. v. Rm. N. N. Nagappa Chettiar, [1953] INSC 22; [1953] S.C.R. 789 and Sheodhar Rai & Ors. v. Suraj Prasad Singh & Ors., A.I.R. 1954 S.C. 758, referred to.
 In regard to the respondent's claim for past 'rent, no interference was called for with the decree passed by the High Court, but its decree in relation to future mesne profits could not be sustained. Once it was held that the respondent was entitled to eject the appellant it followed that from the date of the decree granting the relief ejectment to the respondent the appellant who remained in possession of the property despite the decree, must pay mesne profits or damages for use and occupation of the said property until it was delivered to the respondent. A decree for ejectment in such a case must be accompanied by a direction for payment of the future mesne profits or damages. [294F-H]
