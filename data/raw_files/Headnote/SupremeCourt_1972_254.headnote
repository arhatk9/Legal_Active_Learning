 The assessee was carrying on business in Malaya and was owning rubber plantations. He was also carrying on business in 'India. In respect of the assessment year 1953-54 he declared his foreign income from Malaya at Rs. 2,22,532, income in India at Rs. 39,142 from sources other than business and a loss on business in India at Rs. 68,658. The Income-tax Officer allowed double taxation relief on a sum of Rs. 1,92,816/- by adding the income in India to the foreign income and deducting therefrom the loss in India.
 The Commissioner, in exercise.. of his powers under s.48 read with s.49-D of the Income-tax Act, 1922, however, set off the business loss in India against the business profits in Malaya and held that only the resulting income of Rs.
 1,53,674 from Malaya could be considered to have suffered double taxation and hence granted double taxation relief in respect only of that amount. The Tribunal followed the decision of the Madras High Court in C.I.T. Madras v.
 Arunachalam Chettiar, 49 I.T.R. 574, and confirmed the order of the Commissioner. The High Court also on reference, was of the view that the relief granted by s.49-D 'on such doubly taxed income' has reference to the factual double incidence under two different jurisdictions of tax on identical amounts of income, and decided against the assessee.
 In appeal to this Court, on the scope of the expression 'such doubly taxed income' in s.49-D of the Act, with respect to which double taxation relief is given, HELD: (Per P. Jaganmohan Reddy, H. R. Khanna and I. D.
 Dua, JJ.) The High Court was in error.
 By the year 1950, the Government of India was encouraging More and more Indian citizens to establish branches in countries with which there was no special agreement for the avoidance of double taxation, and s.49-D was substituted in place of the old one, in 1953, for the purpose of giving double taxation relief in respect of taxes on income charged in any country, by deduction or otherwise, under the law in force in that country. The object of the section is that the amount of Indian income tax paid or the amount of tax in the foreign country, whichever is lower, is allowed as a deduction from the tax payable under the Act on such doubly taxed income. Prior to 1953, the section afforded relief at half the Indian income tax or half the tax paid in the other country, in respect of the same income whichever is less. if the concession that was being given by the new section for encouraging Indian citizens to start business in foreign countries was only to give relief at the full rate of Indian income-tax instead of half such tax, all that was necessary by the amendment was to delete the words "one half" occurring in the section prior to its amendment. But the Legislature bad redrafted the entire section with the result that the phrase such doubtly taxed income' in the new section and the phrase 'same income' in the repealed section do not have the same import. The words 'same income' in the context would mean the same kind or species or identical income earned in a foreign country 651 on which tax has been paid in that country, in respect of which relief is being claimed from being again subjected to tax under the Act. But the words 'such doubly taxed income' have reference to the foreign income which bears once again the burden of Indian income-tax by its being included the total income chargeable under s.3 read with s.2(15) of the Act. Under s.4(1)(b)(ii) the income which accrues to an assessee outside the taxable territories is to be included in the total income so that the income under any of the heads enumerated in s.6 which has accrued or arisen to the assessee outside the taxable territory and is subject to the tax under the law in force in that country, is included in his total income attracting the levy of charge under the Indian Income Tax Act, and is therefore doubly taxed. [667C- D; 672G-H; 673C-E 674B-F, G-H; 675A-B] Once it is recognized that s.49-D does not make the basis of relief the tax paid on the income from the same head or source, then the relief to which ,in assessee would be entitled would be the amount of tax on the foreign income which by its inclusion in the total income once again bears under the Act. The word 'such' in the phrase 'such doubly taxed income' has reference to the foreign income which is being subjected to tax by its inclusion in the computation of income under the Act and not the same income' under an identical head of income under the Act. The income from each head under s. 6 is not, under the Act, subjected to tax separately; but it is the total income which is computed and assessed as such in respect of which relief is given for the inclusion of the foreign income, on which tax has been paid according to law in force in that country. The scheme of the Act is that although income is classified under different heads and the income under each head is separately computed in accordance with the provisions dealing with that particular bead of income, the income which is the subject matter of tax under the Act is one income which is the total income. Income-tax is only one tax levied on the aggregate of the income classified and chargeable under the different heads and not a collection of distinct taxes levied separately on each head of income. There is nothing 'in the language of s.49-D which, either expressly or by necessary implication, restricts the grant of double taxation relief to incomes under the same head.

 (Per Hegde J. dissenting) : The construction of the section given by the Commissioner, Tribunal and the High Court is the proper construction. [653G] Under our income-tax law in every assessment year, the total income of an assessee during the previous year is brought to tax. It is made up of income from various sources set out in s.4. The section attracts into the pool income, profits and gains from whatever sources derived, which are received or deemed to be received in the taxable territory in the previous year by the assessee; and one of the components is the income that has accrued or arisen to him in the previous year, outside the taxable territory. In computing the total income of the assessee the procedure adopted is that income under each head is first determined after giving deductions to which the argessee is entitled under that head, and thereafter, the total income is arrived at for the purpose of detecting the 652 rate of tax as well as for the quantification of tax due.
 Section 4 requires that there should be a recalculation of the incomewhich has be doubly taxed. in making that calculation, the authority computing tax will have to leave those portions of the income which have not be doubly taxed.
 [654D F; 656A C] The ingredients of s.49-D, which gives double taxation relief, are:
 (i)the assessee must have been resident in the taxable territory the year;
 (ii)that some income must have accrued or arisen to him outside the taxable territory during that year;
 (iii)in respect of that income he must have paid, by deduction or otherwise, tax under the law 'in force in the country in question; and (iv)if he fulfills all the above Conditions he will be entitled to deduction from the Indian income-tax payable by him of a sum calculated of such doubly taxed income at the Indian rate of tax or the rate of tax of the said country, whichever is lower. [655C-F] The expression "such doubly taxed income" involves two aspects: (a) it exclusively relates to the income earned outside India, and (b)it relates only to that part of the income earned outside India which is doubly taxed; that is, the same income must have been doubly taxed. The income that gets relief under s.49-D, is only that inclom- identified income-which has been 'subjected to tax not only in the country in which it was earned, but also in this country. The section does not concern itself with the totality of the income or even with the source of income, but, concerns itself with that part of the income which has been subjected to double taxation. [655F-H] If the entire tax paid by the assessee in a country outside India is to be deducted while computing his tax liability in this country, then there is no necessity 'for the Legislature to enact s. 49-A. It is not reasonable to think that s.49-D gives more relief than that is likely to be given under an agreement under s.49-A. Anything more than that, cannot be considered as relief from double taxation, but would amount to tax concession. If the relief given under an agreement under s.49-A and the relief given under s.49-D mean the same thing, tin Legislature must be held to have indulged in an exercise of futility. Section 49-D, being a residuary provision, must be understood to cover a field other than that covered by s.49-A. Under the section, as it stood before the amendment in 1953, relief was given in respect of the same income which was taxed twice over.
 After amendment, relief is given on such doubly taxed income The two expressions 'the same income' and 'such doubly taxed income' mean the same thing. [656 G-H; 657 A.0. E.G.] Despite the difference in language the section is similar in scope to s.27 of the United Kingdom Finance Act, 1920, and the decisions rendered under the U.K. Act have a bearing on the point in controversy. [657G; 658C-D] In the present case, the assessee's income from property and other sources amounting to a sum of Rs. 39,142 has not been doubly taxed. Hence that income cannot enter into the calculation of the doubly taxed income of the assessee and that income could not have been included in the return made by the assessee in Malaya. That being in calculating the doubly taxed income, that component of the total income has to be 653 kept apart. Further, the entire business income earned in Malaya though taxed in Malaya has not been taxed in this country. Out of that sum only a sum of Rs. 1,53,674 has been taxed in this country. The business loss in this country cannot be said to have been taxed in this country.
 A relief does not amount to a taxation. Double taxation relief should not be mixed up with tax concessions. It is only that income which can be said to have been doubly taxed, that is entitled to-relief under the section. [656 S- G] Rolls Royce Ltd. v.
