 The enhancement of motor vehicles tax on omnibuses imposed by the State Government, by notification dated September 20, 1971, from Rs. 30/per seat per quarter to Rs. 100 per seat per quarter was challenged on the following grounds :- (1) The notification was not a measure of taxation but a device to eliminate the competition of omnibus" with stage carriages run by the Government;
 (21 Since the tax operates as a restriction on the freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse within the State, it could be imposed only by a law which had obtained the previous sanction of the President under Art. 304. and as the notification was issued by the government in the exer- cise of its delegate power, it was not a law made by the legislature, nor could the previous sanction of the President be obtained for it; and (3)The distinction made between contract carriages and stage carriages. in the matter of levy of vehicle tax offends Art.

 Rejecting the contentions.
 
HELD : 1. The tax was imposed by the Government in the exercise of its power under S. 4 of the Madras Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1931. As the State Legislature was competent to pass the Act and as the Government is authorised under s. 4 to levy the tax, the question of the motive with which the tax was imposed is immaterial. There can be no plea of a colourable exercise of power to tax if the Government had power to impose the tax and the fact that the imposition of the tax was for the purpose of eliminating competition would not detract from its validity. [720A-B] 
2. (a) Article 301 imposes a general limitation on all legislative power in order to secure that trade, commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of India shall be free. The word 'free' does not mean freedom from regula- tion. There is a distinction between laws interfering with freedom to carry out the activities constituting trade and law imposing on those engaged therein rules of proper conduct or other restraints directed to the due and orderly manner of carrying out the activities. This distinction is described as regulation. The true solution in any given case could be found by distinguishing between features of the transaction or activity in virtue of which it fell within the category of trade, commerce and intercourse and those features which, though invariably found to occur in some form or another in the transaction or action are not essential to the conception. what is relevant is the contrast between the essential attributes of trade and commerce and the incidents of the transaction which do not give it necessarily the character of trade and commerce.
 Laws for government of such incidents, ,regulate'. If a tax is compensatory or regulatory, it cannot operate as a restriction on the freedom of trade or commerce. A compensatory tax is based on the nature and the extent of the use made of the roads. if the proceeds are devoted to the repair, upkeep, maintenance of relevant roads and the collection of the exaction involves no substantial interference with the movement. What is essential for the purpose of securing freedom of movement by road is that no pecuniary burden should be placed upon. it 716 which goes beyond a proper recompense to the state for the actual use made of the physical facilities provided in the shape of a road. Motor vehicles require, for their safe, efficient and economical use, roads of considerable width, hardness and durability. and the maintenance of such roads will cost the government money. But, because the users of vehicles generally and of public motor vehicles in particular, stand in a special and direct relation to such roads, and may be said to derive a special and direct benefit from them. it is not unreasonable that they should be called upon to make a special contribution to their maintenance over and above their general contribution as tax payers of the State. [721C-H; 722B-F] (b) In the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the State, the averment in that Government has incurred an expenditure of Rs. 19.51 crores in the year 1970-71 on the maintenance and construction of roads while the receipts from out of the vehicle tax was only Rs. 16.38 crores. It would not be right to say that a tax is not compensatory because the precise or specific amount collected is not actually used for providing any facilities, and a working test for deciding whether a tax is compensatory or not is to enquire whether the trades people are having the use of certain facilities for the better conduct of their business and not paying patently much more than what is required for providing the facilities. It would be impossible to judge the compensatory nature of a tax by a meticulous test and, in the nature of things, it could not be done. It is always difficult to evolve a formula which will in all cases ensure exact compensation for the use of the road by vehicles having regard to their type, weight and mileage. Rough approximation, rather than mathematical accuracy is all that is required. [722G; 723A-D] Automobile Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd. v. State of Rajasthan [1963] 1 S.C.R. 491 followed.
 (c) If the tax is attacked on the ground that it is excessive, the burden ,of proof is upon the one attacking its validity. The amount of the charges and the method of collection are primarily for determination by the State itself, although they must be reasonable and fixed according to some uniform, fair and practical standard. Although any method of taxation which has a direct bearing upon or connection with the use of the highways is apparently valid, a tax which has no such apparent bearing and is not shown to be compensatory, but is rather a tax on the privilege of engaging in trade and commerce, is beyond the power of the State. It is also not necessary that there should be a separate fund or expenses allocation of money for the maintenance of roads to prove the compensatory purpose when such purpose is proved by alternative evidence. [723G-724B] (d) It could not be said that vehicle tax can be levied only for the the of the road in existence and that the levy is not compensatory because government, has included the cost of the construction of new roads also in their 'road costs' because. [724B-C] (i) Even if the cost of construction of new roads is excluded, the receipts would not be sufficient to meet the expenses incurred for maintenance of old roads and therefore. it is difficult to say that in actual fact, capital expenditure for construction of new roads was taken into account in the levy of vehicle tax. [724E-F] (ii) This court approved in the Automobile case the reason given by the High Court that the State was charging far the cost incurred in maintaining and making roads. [724G-725A] (iii) The State may impose even upon motor vehicles as compensation 'for the use of the public highways a charge) which is a fair contribution to the cost of (constructing and maintaining roads and "for regulating traffic thereon.

 717 Therefore, the tax imposed by the notification is compensatory in character and could not therefore restrict the freedom of trade and commerce. [726C-D] (e) There is no material to show that the tax is cofiscatory or excessive and operates as an unreasonable restriction upon the appellants right to carry on the trade. A tax which is compensatory cannot operate as an unreasonable restriction upon the fundamental right of the appellants to carry on the business, for, the very idea of a compensatory tax is service more or less commensurate with the tax levied. No citizen has a right to engage in trade or business without paying for the special services he receives from the State. because, that is part of the cost of carrying on the business. [726E-F] 
3. (a) The reasons for enhancing the vehicle tax on contract carriages are, (a) that contract carriages run more miles, (b) carry more load, and (c) stage carriages pay surcharge on the fare collected; while owners of contract carriage are not liable to pay the surcharge. It cannot be said that a classification made on the basis of the capacity of the contract carriage to run more miles is unreasonable, because, these carriages will be using the road more than the stage carriages which have got time schedules. specified routes and maximum and minimum number of trips. [727D-728C] (b) There is always a presumption that a classification is valid, especially in a taxing statute and a person who challenges a classification as unreasonable has the burden of proving it. Classification depends to a great extent upon an assessment of the local conditions under which these carriages are being run which the legislature or the administrative body alone is competent to make. The Act in its II Schedule classifies contract carriages and stage carriages separately for tax purposes. Therefore, when the Government, in the exercise of its power to tax, made a classification between stage carriages on the one hand and contract carriage on the other hand and fixed a higher rate of tax on the latter, the presumption is that Government made that classification on the basis of its information that contract carriages are using the roads more than the stage carriages because they are running more miles; and this Court has to assume, in the absence of any materials placed by the owners of contract carriages, that the classification is reasonable. Hence, the levy of an enhanced rate of vehicle tax on contract carriages is not hit by Art. 14. [730G-731E] State of Gujarat v. Ambica Mills Ltd. [1974] 11 S.C.J. 211, at 231.
