 A milk vendor was prosecuted for alleged adulteration, on the ground that there was a minimal shortfall in the percentage of "milk solids not fat" prescribed by the Prevention of Food Adulteration Rules. The trial court convicted but on appeal, the Sessions Judge made a passing reference to an obiter observation of this Court in the Malwa Cooperative-Milk Union Ltd., lndore v. Biharlial, (Criminal Appeal No. 235 dated 14-8-1967) ignored the minor deficiency observing that it was in the nature of permissible error and acquitted the accused. An appeal against acquittal was dismissed by the High Court.
 Dismissing the appeal to, this Court, 
HELD : In the Malwa Cooperative Milk Union Ltd. v. Biharilal this Court while holding that the revisional power of the High Court is reserved for setting right miscarriage of justice and not for being invoked by private prosecutors, made an obiter observation, to drive home the point, that the case itself was so marginal that the difference from the set standard was microscopic. The Sessions Judge was perhaps wrong in tearing that passage out of context and devising a new defence out of it in respect of food adulteration cases. But an appeal with special leave under Art. 136 should not have been filed merely to get a declaration that a casual statement in a judgment of the Court is not its ratio. [915 E-G, 916 E]
