 The respondent firm, which had its headquarters in Madhya Pradesh and was, during the years 1948 to 1951, engaged in collecting bidi leaves from certain forest areas in Orissa and dispatching them to various destinations outside the State of Orissa, did not get itself registered as a dealer under the Orissa Sales Tax Act, 1947, and did not submit a return in spite of the notice issued to it, It was asked to show cause why a penalty should not be imposed under s.
 12(5) of the Act. The assessing authority then proceeded to assess the tax to the best of its judgment and determined the taxable turnover for each of the twelve quarters, the first quarter ending on June 30, 1948, and the last quarter ending on March 31, 1951. A penalty of Rs. 500 for each quarter was also imposed. The respondent's appeal to the Assistant Collector of Sales Tax against the orders of assessment and penalty was dismissed, and the revision petition was rejected by the Collector of Commercial Taxes as having been filed out of time. One of the pleas taken before the appellate authority was that the respondent was not a dealer in Orissa inasmuch as the sales of bidi leaves were not effected in Orissa, but at the hearing of the appeal it was admitted by the respondent's pleader that the sales were completed in Orissa. The High Court, on a writ petition filed by the respondent, set aside the orders of assessment and penalty on the grounds, inter alia, (i) that the assessment orders were bad because of the repeal of the second proviso to S. 2(g) of the Act defining " sale ", by the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1950, (2) that the levy of fees on the memorandum of appeal and the application in revision on a graded scale under r. 59 read with s. 29(2)(s) of the Act amounted to the imposition of a tax which was beyond the competence of the State, and (3) that the notice issued under s. 12(5) of the Act was not in accordance with law, inasmuch as separate notices were not issued for each quarter.
 92 720 Held, (i) that the question as to where a sale was completed depended on facts and was not a pure question of law and, therefore, the admission made by the respondent's pleader was binding on the respondent; and that as the admission brought the sales within s. 2(g) of the Act, it was unnecessary to consider the second proviso to s. 2(g) and the sales,were liable to tax ;
 (2) that the sales-tax authorities including the Assistant Collector of Sales Tax and the Collector of Commercial Taxes, though they exercised quasi-judicial functions under the Act, were not courts in the strict sense of the term " Court " ;
 (3) that fees levied under r. 59 read with s. 29(2)(s) of the Act were not taxes but were imposed for services rendered by a governmental agency. Section 29(2)(s) was, not invalid on the ground of legislative incompetence and r.
 59 did not go beyond what was permitted under that section;
 The Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt, [1954] INSC 46; [1954] S.C.R. 1005, relied on.
 (4) that the issue of one notice under s. 12(5) of the Act for several quarters was not contrary to law as the section makes reference to a period which might consist of more than one quarter.
