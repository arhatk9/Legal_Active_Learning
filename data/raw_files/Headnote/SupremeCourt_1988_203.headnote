 In June, 1984 the Indian Army mounted an operation known as `Operation Blue Star' by which Armed Force personnel entered the Golden Temple Complex at Amritsar to flush out the armed terrorists. That operation resulted in loss of life and property as well as damage to the Akal Takht in the Golden Temple Complex, which greatly offended the religious feelings of some members of the Sikh community. Beant Singh (deceased) and Balbir Singh, Sub- Inspectors and Satwant Singh, a constable of Delhi Police posted for security duty in the office of the deceased Prime Minister Smt. Indira Gandhi and Kehar Singh, an Assistant in the Directorate General of Supply and Disposal, New Delhi, who were sikhs by faith, had been expressing their resentment openly, holding Smt. Indira Gandhi responsible for the action taken at Amritsar. They met at various places and at various times to discuss and to listen to inflammatory speeches and recordings calculated to excite listeners and provoke them to retaliatary action against the decision of the Government to take army action in Golden Temple Complex. They thus became parties to a criminal conspiracy to commit the murder of Smt. Indira Gandhi.
 On October 31, 1984 Smt. Indira Gandhi had an engagement with well-known actor and writer Peter Ustinov.
 His crew was to record her interview for Irish Television.
 They were waiting at Bungalow No.1, Akbar Road, the home office of the Prime Minister. Bungalow No.1, Safdarjung Road was the official residence of the Prime Minister. The two buildings are connected by a narrow cemented pathway. They are located practically in one campus, but seperated by a sentry gate which is known as the "TMC Gate." Smt. Indira Gandhi at about 9.10 a.m. emerged from her house.
 Immediately behind her was Head Constable Narayan Singh (PW 9) holding an umbrella to protect her against the sun.
 Rameshwar Dayal (PW 10) an Assistant Sub-Inspector, Nathu Ram (PW 64), her personal attendant and R.K. Dhawan,Special Assistant, were closely following Smt. Gandhi.
 In pursuance of the aforesaid conspiracy Beant Singh and Satwant Singh, who had prior knowledge that Smt. Gandhi was scheduled to pass through the TMC Gate on the date and at the time afore-mentioned, manipulated their duties in such a manner that the former would be present at the TMC Gate and the latter at the TMC sentry booth on October 31.
 1984 between 7.00 and 10.00 A.M. Beant Singh got exchanged PG NO 26 his duty with S.I. Jai Narain (PW7). Satwant Singh, who ought to be at Beat No. 4, managed to get TMC sentry booth by misrepresenting that he was suffering from dysentry. He was given that place since it was near the latrine. Thus they had managed to station themselves together near the TMC gate.
 Smt. Indira Gandhi was at the head of the entourage on the cemented pathway followed by the afore-mentioned persons approaching the TMC Gate where Beant Singh, S.I. was on the left side while Satwant Singh, Constable was on the right side. At that time Beant Singh was armed with his service revolver while Satwant . Singh had SAF carbine. When Smt.
 Gandhi reached near the TMC Gate, Beant Singh fired five rounds and Satwant Singh 25 shots at her from their respective weapons, as a result of which Smt. Indira Gandhi sustained injuries and fell down. She was immediately removed to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) where she succumbed to her injuries the same day.
 The cause of death was certified upon a post-mortem which took place on October 31, 1984 as haemorrhage and shock due to multiple fire arm bullet injuries which were sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. The post- mortem report also opined that injuries Nos. 1 and 2 specified in the report were sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature, as well.
 At the spot of the incident both Beant Singh and Satwant Singh are alleged to have thrown their arms which had been recovered. Five empties of Beant Singh's revolver and 25 empties of SAF Carbine of Satwant Singh and 6 lead pieces were recovered from the spot. 13 live cartridges. 38 bore from the person of Beant Singh and 75 live cartridges of .99 SAF carbine from the person of Satwant Singh were also recovered. Two lead pieces were recovered from the body of Smt. Indira Gandhi during the post-mortem and two from her clothes and that the experts opined that the bullets recovered from the body and found from the spot were fired through the weapons possessed by these two accused persons.
 Rameshwar Dayal ASI (PW 10), who was following Smt.
 indira Gandhi, also received injuries on his left thigh as a result of shots fired by the accused which were grieveous and dangerous to life.
 Both the assassins were secured by the Indo Tibetan Border Police Personnel, and taken to the guard room. where they sustained gun shot injuries as a result of which Beant Singh died and Satwant Singh suffered grievous injuries but recovered later on.
 PG NO 27 The prosecution case against Kehar Singh was that he was a religious fanatic. He had intense hate against Smt.
 Indira Gandhi for causing damage to the Akal Takhat in Golden Temple, Amritsar by "Operation Blue Star." He was in a position to influence Beant Singh, being the uncle of Beant Singh's wife called as `Poopha'. He converted Beant Singh and through him Satwant Singh to religious bigotry. He made them to undergo "Amrit Chakhan Ceremony" on October 14 and 24, 1984 respectively at Gurdwara, R.K. Puram, New Delhi. He also took Beant Singh to Golden Temple. Amritsar on October 20.1984. Gold `Kara' and `ring' of Beant Singh were later recovered from him.
 It is alleged that Balbir Singh, like other accused had expressed his resentment openly, holding Smt. Indira Gandhi responsible for the "Operation Blue Star". He was planning to commit her murder and had discussed his plans with Beant Singh (deceased). who had similar plans to commit the murder. He also shared his intention and prompted accused Satwant Singh to commit the murder of Smt. Indira Gandhi and finally discussed the matter with him on October 30.
 1984. In the first week of September 1984, when a falcon (Bazz) happen to sit on a tree near the main Reception of the Prime Minister's House st about 1.30 P.M. Balbir Singh spoted the falcon. called Beant Singh there and pointed out the falcon. Both of them agreed that it had brought a message of the Tenth Guru of the Sikhs and that they should do something by way of revenge of the "Operation Blue Star".
 Therefore both of them performed `Ardas' then and there.
 Balbir Singh was posted on duty at the Prime Minister's residence. On October 31. 1984 his duty was to commmence in the evening. When reported for duty, in the usual course. he was asked to go to security lines. At about 3.00 a.m. on November 1. 1984 his house was searched and a book on Sant Bindrawala was recovered. At about 4.00 a.m. he was taken to Yamuna Velodrome and kept there till late in the evening when he was reported to have been released. This custody in Yamuna Velodrome was described as `de facto custody'.
 Thereafter on December, 1984 he was said to have been arrested at Najafgarh Bus Stand when his personal search was taken and certain articles were recovered from his possession including a piece of paper containing certain entries described as "Memorandum events" allegedly written by him.
 After the investigation the charge-sheet was filed against appellants Satwant Singh, Balbir Singh and Kehar Singh. They were accused of offences under ss. 120-B, 109 PG NO 28 and 34 read with s. 302 of the IPC and also of substantive offences under ss. 302 and 307 of the IPC and ss. 27, 54 and 59 of the Arms Act.
 The accused were committed to take their trial in the Court of Session. In the meanwhile the High Court of Delhi issued two notifications. By one notification, the High Court directed that the trial of the case shall be held in the Central Jail, Tihar according to law. By another notification the High Court directed that "the case be tried by Shri Mahesh Chandra, Additional Sessions Judge, New Delhi." In pursuance of the said notifications, the accused were tried in Central Jail, Tihar. The trial Judge found the accused guilty of all the charges framed against them and convicted Satwant Singh, Beant Singh and Kehar Singh of murder under s. 302 read with s. 120-B and 34 IPC as well as under s. 307 IPC and s. 27 of the Arms Act. The trial Judge awarded the sentence of death on all the three accused. The trial Judge also awarded other terms of imprisonment on Satwant Singh.
 Two appeals were filed in the High Court--One by Satwant Singh and the other by Balbir Singh and Kehar Singh jointly, challenging their conviction and sentence. These appeals were heard alone with the Murder Reference No. 2 of 1986. The High Court accepted the Murder Reference and dismissed the appeals preferred by the accused and confirmed firmed the conviction and the sentence of death on all the accused. The High Court also confirmed the other sentence on Satwant Singh.
 In the appeal to this Court, on behalf of the appellants it was contended; (1) that under Art. 2.1 of the Constitution speedy, open and public trial is one of the constitutional guarantees of a fair and just trial and by holding the trial in Tihar Jail in the instant case this gurantee has been affected and the accused have been deprived of fair and open trial as contemplated under s.
 327 of the Code of Criminal Procedure; (2) that in cases where the ends of justice would be defected it the case is not heard in camera. only the trial Court. for special reasons to be recorded, could hold the trial or a part of the trial in cameral. Section 327 of the Code does not confer any such authority or jurisdiction on the High Court;
 (3) that the High Court has no power to direct that trial of a criminal case at a place other than the normal seat of the Court of Sessions. Section 9(6) of the Code empowers the High Court only to specify the place or places at which all or any class of the cases pertaining to a division can be heard and does not empower the High Court to specify the place or places of hearing for individual cases; (4) that in the instant case, the High Court while exercising jurisdiction under s. 9(6) of the Code notified the place of PG NO 29 trial as Tihar Jail. It indirectly did what the trial Court could have done in respect of particular part of the proceedings. By shifting the trial to Tihar Jail it could not be said to be open and public trial as the trial inside the Jail premises is the very antithesis of an open trial;
 (5) that the orders passed by the trial Court providing that representatives of the Press may be permitted to attent and for security, etc. the Jail authorities will regulate entry to the Court indicate that the trial was not public and open and therefoe on this ground alone the trial vitiates; (6) that the fundamental right guaranteed under Art. 19(1)(a) of the Constitution need not be under the mercy of the Court and that there should not be any discrimination in the matter of public access to judicial proceedings and first come first serve should be the principle no matter whether one is a press person or an ordinary. citizen; (7) that under s. 194 of the Code it was not necessary for the High Court to have allotted the instant case to a particular Judge; (8) that inspite of the prayer made by the accused during the trial and also in the High Court about the copies of the statements of the witnesses who have been examined by the prosecution and were also examined before the Thakkar Commission the same were not supplied. Even the copy of the Thakkar Commission Report was not made available. Not only were the accused entitled to the previous statements of witnesses who were examined by the prosecution, but they were also entitled to relevant material on the basis of which they could build their defence and raise appropriate issues at the trial; (9) that the High Court has misconstrued the scope of s. 6 of the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952 and misunderstood the observations in Dalmia's case [1958] INSC 30; [1959] SCR 279; (10) that even if the words "used against" in s. 6 of the said Act mean preventing the use of statement for the purposes of contradictions as required under s. 145 of the Evidence Act, there are other provisions by which the previous statement could be looked into for productive uses without confronting the witnesses such as first part of 145, sub-s. (1) & (2) of s. 146, s. 157 and s. 159 of the Evidence Act. The term "used against" in s. 6 was not intended to be an absolute bar for making use of such statements in subsequent proceedings; (11) that the confession of Satwant Singh being not recorded in the manner prescribed in s. 164 of the Code is inadmissible in evidence and cannot be used for convicting the accused; (12) that there is no evidence that Beant Singh and his wife were deliberately taken by Kehar Singh to expose them to provocative Bhajans in the house of Ujagar Sandhu at the time of celeberation of the birthday of a child; (13) that Kehar Singh being an elderly person and a devout religious Sikh was keeping company with Beant Singh to dissuade the latter from taking any drastic action against Smt. Gandhi;
 (14) that there is no substantive evidence from the PG NO 30 testimony of Bimla Khalsa that Beant Singh took Amrit on October 14, I9S4 at the instance of Kehar Singh; (15) that the finger prints found on the sten-gun of accused Satwant Singh were not tested for comparison and the two bullets recovered from the body of Smt. Gandhi were not examined for traces of blood or tissues; (16) that the post-mortem examination ought to have been full and complete.
 It was further contended on behalf of Balbir Singh: (i) that the document Ex. PW 26/B was not recovered from his possession; (ii) that his arrest at Najafgarh bus-stand was a make believe arrangment. He was not arrested there and indeed he could not have been arrested, since he was all along under police custody right from the day when he was taken to Yamuna Velodrome on November 1, 1984. He was not absconding and the question of absconding did not arise when he was not released at all. No question was put to him under Section 313 examination that he had absconded; (iii) that the conclusions of the High Court on all these matters were apparently unsustainable; and (iv) that there being no charge against the accused under s. 109 IPC they are liable to be sentenced only for the offence of abetment and not for murder.
 On behalf of the Respondent-State it was contended; (i) that this Court in an appeal under: Art. 136 of the Constitution of India is not expected to interfere with the concurrent findings of facts arrived at by the two Courts below; (2) that there is no question-of any constitutional right under Art. 21. Article 21 only talks of procedure established by law and if today on the statute book there is s. 327 Cr. P.C. tomorrow s. 327, may be so amended that it may not be necessary for a criminal trial to be open and it does not becomes a consitutional right at all;(3) that the premises where the trial was held was not that part of the Jail where the prisoners are kept but was the office block where there was an approach, people were permitted to reach. and the trail was held as if it was held in an Ordinary place; (4) that there is nothing to show that the friends and relations of the accused or any other member of the public was prevented from having access to the place where the trial was held. On the other hand, permission was granted to the friends and relations of the accused as well as to outsiders who wanted to have access to the Court or to see the proceedings subject, of course, to Jail Regulations. Section 2 (p) Criminal Procedure Code defines `place' as including a house, building, tent, vehicle and vessel. So Court can be held in a tent, vehicle, a vessel that than in Court. Furthermore, the provision to s.327, Cr.P.C. provides that the presiding Judge or Magistrate may also at any stage of trial by Order restrict access of the PG NO 31 public in general, or any particular person in particular in the Court room or building where the trial is held; (5) that if the confession is not recorded in proper form as prescribed by s. 164 read with s. 281 which corresponds to earlier s. 364, it is a mere irregularity, and it can be cured by s. 463 on taking evidence that the statement was recorded duly and that it has not injured the accused in his defence on merits; (6) that if the High Court had the authority to issue notification under s. 9(6) Cr. P.C.
 fixing the place of sitting it was open to the High court also to fix the place of sitting for a particular case; (7) that the language of s. 6 of the Commission of Inquiry Act is clear that a witness who is examined before a Commission, is protected and that protection is that the statement made before the Commission could not be used against him for any other purpose in any other proceedings either Civil or Criminal. The only exception carved out in s. 6 pertains to his prosecution for perjury. The Commission by its regulation and notification clearly made the enquiry a confidential affair and in addition to that there was an amendment of the Act which even provided that if Government by notification decided not to place the Report of the Commission before the House of Parliament or Legislature then it was not necessary that it should be so placed before the House and thus the report not only wast confidential but even the Parliament had no right to see the report and.
 therefore, neither the report nor the statements made before the Commission could be asked for by the accused for the purposes of trial; (8) that in the remand application dated December 4, 1984, it was stated that Balbir Singh had absconded and was not available for interrogation and that he was arrested at Najafgarh Bus stand on December 3, 1984. The Magistrate therefore, remanded the accused to policc custody till December h and the order of remand was signed I,S' the accused. The accused being a police officer did not object to the allegations made against him in the remand application; and (9) that as regards recovery of documents Ex. PW 26/B from the accused Balbir Singh, entry No. 986 in the Malkana Register of Police Station,Tughlak Road, which contains verbatim copy of the seizure memo (Ex.
 PW 26/A), is indicative of the fact that Ex. PW 26/B was recovered from the accused upon his arrest and search.
 The Court unanimously dismissing the Appeals of Kehar Singh, and Satwant Singh and allowing the Appeal of Balbir Singh, 
 HELD: Per Oza, J.) 
 1. The act of the accused not only took away the life of a popular leader of the country but also undermines the democratic system which has been working in the country PG NO 32 so well for the last forty years. There is yet another serious consideration. Beant Singh (deceased) and accused Satwant Singh were posted on the security duty of the Prime Minister to protect her from any intruder or from any attack from outside and, therefore, if they themselves resort to this kind of offence, there appears to be no reason or no mitigating circumstance for consideration on the question of sentence. Additionally, an unarmed lady was attacked by these two persons with a series of bullets and it has been found that a number of bullets entered her body.
 The manner in which mercilessly she was attacked by these two persons on whom confidence was reposed to give her protection repels any consideration of reduction of sentence. In this view of the matter, even the conspirator who inspired the persons who actually acted does not deserve any leniency in the matter of sentence. The death sentence awarded by the trial Court and maintained by the High Court appears to be just and proper. [115F-ll6B] 
 2. The first part of s. 194 Cr. P.C. clearly provides that the Sessions Judge of the Division by general or special order is supposed to allot cases arising in a particular area or jurisdiction to be tried by Additional or Assistant Sessions Judges appointed in the Division, but the last part of this section also authorises the High Court to allot the case to a particular Judge keeping in view the fact that in certain cases the Sessions Judge may not like to allot and may report to the High court or either of the parties may move an application for transfer and under these circumstances it may become necessary for the High Court to allot a particular care to a particular Judge. [78G-H] 
 3. From the language of s. 9(6) Cr.P.C. one thing is clear that so far as the High Court is concerned it has the jurisdiction to specify the place or places where ordinarily a Court of Sessions may sit within the division. So far as any particular case is concerned trial at a place other than the normal place of sitting is only permissible under the second part of the sub-clause with the consent of parties and that decision has to be taken by the trial Court itself.
 Whatever be the terms of the notification, it is a notification issued by the Delhi High Court under s. sub- clause (6) of Cr.P.C. and thereunder the High Court could do nothing more or less than what it has the authority to do.
 Therefore, the High Court could be taken to have notified that Tihar Jail is also one of the places of sitting of the Sessions Court in the Sessions division ordi- narily. That means apart from the two places Tis Hazari and New Delhi, the High Court by notification also notified Tihar Jail as one of the places where ordinarily a Sessions Court could hold its sittings.
 PG NO 33 There is, therefore, no error if the Sessions trial is held in Tihar Jail after such a notification has been issued by the High Court. [79G-80E] 
 4. In fact, the High Court was right when it referred to the concept of administration of justice under the old Hindu Law. But apart from it even the Criminal Procedure Code as it stood before the amendment had a provision similar to s.
 327 which was s. 352 of the Old Code and in fact it is because of this that the criminal trial is expected to he open and public. In our Constitution phraseology difference from the United States Constitution has been there. Art. 21 provide? that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law. So far as this aspect of open trial is concerned the procedure established by law even before our Constitution was enacted was as is provided in s. 327 Cr.P.C. The language of s. 327 shows that any place where a criminal Court holds its sitting for enquiry or trial shall be deemed to be an open Court to which the pablic generally may have access provided the same can conveniently contain them. The language itself' indicates that even if a trial is held in an private house or is held inside.jail or anywhere no sooner it becomes venue of trial of a criminal case it is demed to be in law an open place and everyone who wants to go and attend the trial has a right to go and attend the trial except the only restriction contermplated is number of persons which could be contained in the premises where the Court sits. [18C-E,82D-E] 
 5. The only thing that is necessary for the appellant is to point out that, in fact, it was not an open tiral. There is no material at all to suggest that any one who wanted to attend the trail was prevented from so doing or one who wanted to go into the Court room was not allowed to do so.[82G] 
 6. it is very clear that Art. 21 contemplates procedure established by law and the procedure established by law was as on the day on which the Constitution was adopted and, therefore, it is not so easy to contend that by amending the Criminal Procedure Code the effect of the procedure established by law indicated in Art. 21 could be taken away.
 The trend of decisions of this Court has clearly indicated that the procedure must be fair and just. Even expeditious trial has been considered to be a part of the guarantee under Art. 21. Undisputedly the procedure established by law as indicated in Art. 21 is as provided in s. 327 and unless on facts it is established that what is provided in s.327 was prevented or was not permitted,it could not be said that merely because trial was held at a particular place it could be said to be a trial which was not open to public. Merely suggesting the difficulties in reaching the Jail will not he enough, to say that it ceased to be a public trial. It was not that part of the Jail where the prisoners are kept but was the Office block where there was an approach, people were permitted to reach and the trial was held as if it was held in an ordinary place and in fact what the High Court did by issuing a notification under s. Y(6) was not to fix place of trial of this Particular case in Tihar Jail, but the High Court by the said notification made Tihar Jail also as one of the places where a Sessions Court could ordinarily sit and in this case, therefore, the trial was held at this place. As soon as a trial is held whatever the place may be the provisions of s. 327 are attracted and it will be an open Court and every citizen has a right to go and unless there is evidence or material on record to suggest that on the facts in this particular public at large was not permitted to go or some one was prevented from on the facts in this Particular case attending the trial or that the trial was in camera. In fact, without an appropriate order it could not be said that what is contemplated under s. 327 or under Art. 21 was not made available to the accused in this case and, therefore, it could not be contended that there is any prejudice at the trial.[83B-84C] PG NO 34 
 7. On analysis of the provision of s. 6 of the Commission of Inquiry Act, I952, it will be found that there are two restrictions on the use of a statement made by a witness before the Commission. A statement given in a Commission cannot be used to subject the witness to any civil or criminal proceedings nor it can be used against him in any civil or criminal proceedings and it is in the context of these restrictions the Provisions of s.145 read with s. 155(3) and s. 157 of the Evidence Act which permit the use of a previous statement of a witness and for what PurPose will have to be examined. These sections clearly indicate that there are two purposes for which a previous statement can be used. One is for cross-examination and contradiction and the other is for corroboration. The first PurPose is to discredit the witness by putting him the earlier statement and contradicting him on that basis. So far as corroboration is concerned, it could not be disputed that it is none of the PurPoses of the defence to corroborate the evidence on the basis of the previous statement. section 145, therefore, is the main section under which relief was sought by the accused. The use for which the previous statement was asked for was to contradict him if necessary and if it was a contradiction then the earlier statement was necessary so that contradiction be put to the witness and that part of the statement can be proved.[89E-G; 91D-E]] 8.Contradiction could be used either to impeach the credit of a witness or discredit him or to pull down or bring down the reliability of the witness. These purposes for which the previous statements are required could not be said to be purposes which were not against the witness. The two aspects of the restrictions which s. 6 contemplates are the only two aspects which could be the result of the use of these state- . There is no other use of such previous statements in criminal proceedings. It is, therefore, clear that s. 6 prohibits the use of the previous statements at the trial either for the purpose of cross- examination to contradict the witness or to impeach his credit. Therefore, the Courts below were right in not granting the relief to the accused. [9lF-92A] 
 9. The report of a Commission is a recommendation of the Commission for the consideration of the Government. It is the opinion of the Commission based on the statements of witnesses and other material. It has no evidentiary value in the trial of a criminal case. In the instant case, the Courts below were also justified in not summoning the reports of the Thakkar Commission. Moreover, the Commission framed regulations under s. X of the Act in regard to the procedure for enquiry and Regulation 8 provided that in view of the sensitive nature of enquiry the proceedings will be in camera unless the Commission directs otherwise. So far as recording of evidence and the proceedings of the Commission are concerned they were held in camera throughout and even the reports, interim and final were stated by the Commission itself to be confidential. Normally, the Government was supposed to place the report of the Commission before the House of the People, but the Government did not do that, amended the Commisson of Inquiry Act, 1952 and notified that the reports of the Thakkar Commission shall not be laid before the House of the People in the interest of the security of the State and in public interest and the said notification was also got approved by the House of people.

 10. Undisputedly Smt. Indira Gandhi died as a result of the gun shot injuries inflicted by Beant Singh and Satwant Singh with their service revolver and carbine respectively.
 In view of such clear evidence about the cause of the death, the post-mortem or a fuller postmortem examination loses all its significance. It becomes important only in cases where the cause of death is to be established and is a matter of controversy. [92D-F] 
 11. Where the High Court has reached cunclusions based on partly inadmissible evidence and partly on circumstances which are not justified on the basis of evidence, or partly on facts which are not borne out from the evidence on record it cannot be contended that in an appeal under Art.
 136 of the Constitution the Supreme Court will not to into the facts of the case and come to its own conclusions. The case in hand is one of such cases and some of the findings of fact reached by the High Court could not be said to be such which are concurrent or conclusive. This Court was, therefore, put to the necessity of examining the evidence wherever it was necessary. Moreover, it was a case where the very popular elected leader of the people, Prime Minister Of India, was assassinated, but still this Court has all through maintained the cardinal principle of the Constitution-Equality before law and the concept of rule of law in the system of administration of Justice. [93G,77H- 78A] PG NO 36 Pritam Singh v. The State,[1950]AIR SC 169; Ram Raj v.
 State of Ajmer,[1954]SCR 1133 and [1983] INSC 72; AIR 1983 SC 753, referred to.
 
 12. Section 12O-A I.P.C. provides that when two or more persons agree to do or cause to be done an act which is an illegal act it is criminal conspiracy. Section 12-B provides for the Punishment for a criminal conspiracy. To prove a conspiracy it was not easy to get direct evidence.
 Therefore, s. 10 of The Indian Evidence Act was enacted.
 first part of s- 10 talks of where there is reasonable ground to believe that two or more persons have conspired to commit an offence or an actionable wrong, and it is only when this condition Precedent is satisfied that subsequent part of the Section comee into operation and it talks of reasonable grounds to believe that two or more persons have conspired together and this evidently has reference to s.
 120-A of the I.P.C. where it is provided "when two or more persons agree to do, or cause to be done." This further has been safeguarded by providing a proviso that no agreement except an agreement to commit an offence shall amount to criminal conspiracy. Therefore, a prima facie case of conspiracy has necessarily to be established for application of s. 10. The second part of s.10 talks of anything said, done or written by any one of such persons in reference to the common intention after the time when such intention was first entertained by any one of them is relevant fact against each of the persons believed to be so conspiring as well for the PurPose for proving the existence of the conspiracy as for the purpose of showing that any such person was a party to it. The second port of s. 10 permits the use of evidence which otherwise could not be used against the accused person. Act or action of one of the accused cannot be used as evidence against the other. But an exception has been carved out in s. 10 in case of conspiracy. The second part of s. 10 operates only when the first Part of the section is clearly established i.e. there must be reasonable ground to believe that two or more persons have conspired together in the light of the language of s. 120-A. It is only then the evidence of action or statements made by one of the accused could be used as evidence against the other.[94E-95E] PG NO 37 Sardul Singh Caveeshar v. State of Maharashtra, [1964]2 SCR 378 relied on.
 13.At about 3 A.M. on November 1,1994 Balbir Singh, appelant was awakened from his sleep and his house was searched, but nothing except a printed book on Sant Bhindrawala was recovered. At about j P.M. allegedly he was taken to Yamuna Velodrome, a place where police has reserved a portion of this building to be used for interrogation and investigation. He was kept there till late in the evening when he is reported to had been released. The custody in Yamuna Velodrome is described as 'de facto custody'. But there is no evidence or no police officer examined to say that he allowed this appellant to go in the evening on November 1, 1984. The appellant is said to have been absconding since then and thereafter he is alleged to have been arrested on December 3. I984 at Najafgarh Bus stand.
 When his personal search was taken certain articles including a piece of paper Ex. PW 26/H were recovered from his possession. "he appellant denied his release from Yamuna Velodrome and challenged his arrest at Najafgarh Bus-stand and recovery of any document from his possession as alleged by the prosecution. [97B-D]

The prosecution evidence itself indicates that on Novembr 1,1984 late at night Balbir Singh's house was searched and a printed Book-Sant Bindrawala was seized from his house, he was brought to Yamuna Velodrome and upto the evening of the next day he was seen there. normally when a person or a witness is brought for interrogation or investigation at a Police station, some record has to be made as there is a general diary, although diaries may or may not be filled in, but a duty is cast on the Station House Officer of a Police Station to maintain the movements of the Police Officers and also to note down the activities, especially when it is connected with the investigation of an important case. But it appears that all about the preliminary investigation of this case was going on at Yamuna Vlodrom, witnesses and persons were brought here, detained or kept, and interrogated but there is no further evidence in regard to this place.[98D-G] 
 15. This part of the prosecution story that this accused was at Yamuna Velodrome upto the evening of that day and thereafter he was allowed to go and then he absconded becomes very important in view of the further facts alleged by the prosecution that the investigating officer got some information through some one that this accused who was wanted would appear at the time and place But there is no evidence as to who asked this accused to go. He was a suspect in the criminal conspiracy. He could not have gone away of his own accord. Some responsible officer must have taken the decision but it is unfortunate that no office has been examined to state that "I thought that his presence was not necessary and therefore I allowed him to go." There is no evidence on this aspect of the matter at all and the only evidence is that this person was arrested at midnight in the late hours on November 1, 1984, carried to Yamuna Velodrome and was seen there by some prosecution witnesses till the evening of the next day. [98H-99C] PG NO 38 
 16. As regards the prosecution allegation that this appellant was absconding from Ist or 2nd November till 3rd Dec. 1984, it is significant that no witness has been examined to indicate that he went to find him out either at his residence or at any other place in search of him and that he was not available. There is also no evidence produced to indicate that inspite of the fact that during investigation police wanted to arrest him again but he was not available at his known address. It is perhaps of absence of evidence as to absconding the trial Court when examined this accused under s. 313 Cr.P.C. did not put him any question about his abscondence. It is, therefore, clear that the abscondence as a circumstance could not be used against him. [99D-E] 
 17. As regards the arrest of this appellant at Najafgarh Bus stand, it was alleged that the Investigating Officer got some information that this accused was expected to appear at that place on December 3,1984. It was not immediately after the assassination. It was after a month. The people could come forward to become witness. But no independent witness has been examined in support of the arrest or seizure from the accused. In all matters where the police wants that the story should be believed they always get an independent witness of the locality so that that evidence may lend support to what is alleged by the police officers.
 Admittedly for this arrest Najafgarh and for the seizure of the articles from the person of this accused there is no other evidence except the evidence of police officers.
 Independent witness in this case would be all the more necessary, especially when his release after the earlier arrest is not established and his abscondence is not proved. In such a controversial situation the presence of an independent witness from the public, if not of the locality, would have lent some support to the case of the prosecution. The accused is said to haveappeared at th Bus- stand but it has been shown where he appeared. Whether he get down from a bus, if so from which bus-city or outstation bus?How he appeared there is all mystery. Nobody bothered to notice of his coming. It is said that he had a DTC bus ticket. NobodY examined it. Perhaps there was nothing to examine. If the Police Officer had gone with prior information to arrest the absconding accused who was involved in such an important crime, they could have taken an independent witness with them. It is again interesting to note instead of searching him and Performing the formalities of arrest at the place where the accused appeared, he was taken to a place said to be the office of the Electricity Board. The search and seizure took place there. Some articles were recovered from his possession. Most of the articles recovered are mere personal belongings. There was also a piece of paper since marked as Ex. PW 26/B. The Police did not think it necessary to have an independent witness even for the seizure memo, when particularly some important piece of evidence was recovered from his possession The plea of the prosecution was that noboy was available or none was prepared to be a witness in this matter. It is unthinkable at a public place and that too at the Bus-stand. The further plea of the prosecution was that the circumstances After the assassination of the Prime Minister were such that no witness was prepared to come forward. It appears that for every problem this situation is brought as a defence by th prosecution but this would not help them go them so far as this matter is concerned. It is very difficult to believe that more than one month after the unrest in Delhi a citizen in this capital did not come forward to be a witness for seizure memo. The arrest of the accused Balbir Singh in the circumstances stances appears to be only a show and not an arrest in actuality. If the release of this accused after his arrest on Ist November is not established and his abscondence is not proved, then the story of his arrest on 3rd December with the recovery of the articles loses all its significance. The arrest of the accused on 3rd December and the recovery of the alleged articles from his person have not been proved satisfactorily and therefore could not be of any consequence against this accused. The attempt of the prosecution lo prove the recovery of Ex. PW 26/B on the basis of an entry in the Mslkhana Register of Tughlak Road Police Station is an interesting situation. There is an endorsement in the Malkhana Register stating that the DTC ticket which the accused carried and the paper containing the dates in English Ex. PW.26/B were not deposited. The Malkhana Register, therefore, is of no help to the prosecution. In view of' these infirmities it cannot be accepted that the accused was arrested on 3rd December as alleged by the prosecution So the recovery of Ex. PW 26/B is doubtful.[99G- 101G] PG NO 40 
 18. The document Ex. PW 26/B is a sheet of paper containig certain entries, and if it is considered to be a "memorandum of events~ prepared by this accused relating to his conspiracy, why should he carry it in an atmosphere surcharged with emotion against the Sikhs. Not only that, this person knew that he was an accused in such an important case, absconding and carrying in his pocket such an important piece of evidence. Was it his intention that he should keep it readily available so that he could oblige the prosecution whenever they needed? There is no other possible reason why this person should keep this document with him all the time. The prosecution could not explain this strange behaviour of the accused as to why he could have thought of carrying such a piece of paper in his pocket. [1O1H-102C] Except a mention of few dates and few events there is nothing in document Ex.PW.26/B.It even does not indicate that with those events whether this accused was connected in any manner. It is significant that this document was not with him when his house was searched and he was arrested on the night of November 1, 1984. If after that arrest he was not released at all and there was no occasion for him to go away then, one fails to understand as to how this document came in his possession. The evidence indicates that this accused was preparing to give a statement or a confession and, therefore, he was given the notes and he must have recorded those dates to facilitate the statement that he was planning or he was made to give which ultimately he choose not to give at all. [102D-F] There is no reference after the words 'felt like killing' as to who was intended ln be killed, and as to whose feelings were noted in this piece of paper. There are entries in this document which refer to meetings, visits.
 persons, visiting somebody's house but it is not clear as to whom they refer and what is intended when reference is made.
 Beant Singh has been referred to in this document more than in one place. At one place, there is a reference to Beant Singh with eagle. But there is no reference to a joint brought a message or they should take revenge. The entry dose not suggest that the accused Balbir Singh had anything to do with the eagle. If there is anything it is against Beant Singh. [102G-103A] A perusal of this whole document also shows that there is no reference at all to Beant singh and his plan to kill the Prime Minister Nor there is any mention about the bomb or granade with which he was planning to eliminate the Prime Minister before 15th August 1984. There is also no reference about Beant Singh conspiring with this Accused or PG NO 41 vice-versa. Kehar Singh is not at all in the document.
 Satwant Singh, however, is mentioned against 30th October, but without any indication where? [103B] 
 22. Under these circumstances it is very clear that except the mention of 'Operation Blue Star' and 'felt like killing' there is nothing in this document which is of any significance. If the document is read as it is, there is nothing incriminating against accused Balbir Singh.
 Unfortunately it appears that the High Court read in this document what was suggested by the posecution without considering whether it could be accepted or not in the absence of evidence on record. Admittedly, there is no such evidence at all in this case. [103D] 
 23. Even if the document is accepted to have been written by accused Balbir Singh, still there is nothing in it on the basis of which an inference of conspiracy could be drawn. There must be evidence to indicate that the accused was in agreement with the other accused persons to do the act which was the ultimate object which was achieved on October 31, 1984. This document, therefore, although described by the High Court as very important piece of evidence, is nothing but a 'scrap of paper'. [103G] 
 24. Unfortunately, the High Court while coming to the conclusion that Balbir Singh knew Beant Singh and Satwant Singh well, has not referred to any piece of evidence which establishes that they knew each other well. The prosecution has also not been able to point out any piece of evidence on the basis of which this could be inferred. This accused being a Sikh also is referred to, but there were number of Sikh Officers posted at the house of the Prime Minister and merely because he was a Sikh it could not be said that he became a party to the conspiracy or he was in conspiracy or he knew Beant Singh and Satwant Singh well. Similarly as regards the observations made by the High Court that Balbir Singh shared indignation of Beant Singh against Smt. Gandhi was in a mood to avenge for the 'Operation Blue Star' there is no evidence to support it. From the evidence of SI Madan Lal Sharma, PW 30 all that could be gathered is that after the 'Operation Blue Star' Balbir Singh was in an agitated mood and he used to say that the responsibility of damaging the Akal Takht lies with Smt. Gandhi and it would be avenged by them. From this it cannot be inferred that Balbir Singh wanted to take revenge against the Prime Minister alongwith Beant Singh. If expression of anger or protest on the 'Operation Blue Star' could be used as a piece of evidence or a circumstance against accused then all those members of the Sikh Community who felt agitated over the 'Operation Blue Star' must be held as members of the Conspiracy.
 [104E-105A] PG NO 42 
 25. There is no material to indicate that during the leave taken by Balbir Singh, he met Beant Singh or anyone else or was in any manner connected with the conspiracy or was doing something in pursuance of the agreement of conspiracy between them. Merely because on certain dates he was on leave no inference could be drawn. [105B] 
 26. So far as appearance of falcon and offering of Ardas is concerned, admittedly appearance of a falcon is considered, by the Sikh Community, as a sacred thing as falcon is supposed to be a representative of the Guru and if, therefore, this accused and Beant Singh offered Ardas nothing could be inferred from this alone. [105C] 
 27. The statement of Amarjit Singh PW 44 was recorded thrice during the investigation. In the first statement there is no involvement of Balbir Singh and had alleged against Beant Singh. According to him, he recalled bit by bit and that was the reason, he gave the subsequent two statements. If these statements are carefully perused it is clear that the entire approach of the High Court appears to be erroneous. What he did later was to improve upon his statement and indroduce Balbir Singh also or substitute Balbir Singh in place of Beant Singh. The only other inference is that he was himself a party to that conspiracy.
 Otherwise there is no explanation why he should keep on giving statement after statement, that too after 25 days of the incident. It clearly shows that he was a convenient witness available to State whatever was desired from him. He appears to have become wiser day by day and remembered bit by bit, is certainly interesting to remember. In his first version there is nothing against Balbir Singh. In his second statement he has tried to introduce things against him. This apparently is a clear improvement. [105F-107C] 
 28. Even delay is said to be dangerous and if a person who is an important witness does not open his mouth for a long time his evidence is always looked with suspicion but here is a witness who even after 15 days gave his first statement and said nothing against accused Balbir Singh and then even waited for one more month and then he suddenly chose to come out with the allegations against this accused.
 Such a witness could not be relied upon and even the High Court felt that it would not be safe to rely on the testimony of such a witness alone. His claim that he had so much of close association with Beant Singh and Balbir Singh that he used to be taken in confidence by these two persons means that he is one of the conspirators or otherwise he would not have kept quiet without informing his superiors as it was his duty to do when the Prime Minister was in danger.
 [107D-G] PG NO 43 
 29. In the instant case, there is no evidence at all to establish prima facie participation of accused Balbir Singh in conspiracy or any evidence to indicate that he had entered into any agreement to do an unlawful act or to commit an offence alongwith the other accused persons.
 Therefore, in absence of any evidence in respect of the first part of s. 10 of the Evidence Act which is necessary it could not be contended that the confession of Satwant Singh could be of any avail or could be used against this appellant. [107H-108A] 
 30. It is clear that where PW 44 says 'agreed' and 'he' in his statement on November 24, 1984 he had not named Balbir Singh at all. It is only now in his statement at trial that he grew wiser and made an attempt by way of this explanation. It is rather unfortunate that the High Court felt that this explanation should be accepted. [108D] 
 31. The Statement against Balbir Singh coming for the first time on December, 21, 1984 itself in the light of the settled criminal jurisprudence of this country ought to have been rejected outright. Even Bimla Khalsa, the wife of Beant Singh does not mentioned anything against Balbir Singh.
 [108E] 
 32. So far as accused Balbir Singh is concerned there is no evidence at all on the basis of which his conviction could be justified. He is, therefore, entitled to be acquitted. [108H] 
 33. The material evidence against accused Kehar singh is the evidence of PW 65, Bimla Khalsa wife of Beant Singh.
 Although she has been declared hostile, but her statement could not be discarded in toto merely because on certain questions she has chosen not to support prosecution. It is true that her statement for the first time during investigation was recorded on January 16, 1985. She lost her husband Beant Singh on October 31, 1985. She was placed in a situation where it would have been very difficult for her to compose herself in a manner in which she could give her statement immediately. It is nobody's case that she has any grudge against anybody. Bimla Khalsa in clear terms stated that Kehar Singh and Beant Singh had secret talks on October 17, 1984. She wanted to know it, but she was not given to understand. This kind of secret talk with Beant Singh which Kehar Singh had, is a very significant circumstance.
 Apparently Kehar Singh being an elderly person did not indicate her about their plan. If the attempt of Kehar Singh was to dissuade Beant Singh then there was no occasion for him to keep the matter secret from his wife. On the contrary he should have indicated to his wife also what Beant Singh was planning. These talks, therefore, as proved by Bimla Khalsa go a long way in establishing Kehar Singh being a party to the conspiracy. [109-C, 111G-112A] PG NO 44 
 34. Her evidence also indicates that Beant Singh took Amrit on 14th and Beant Singh kept his golden 'kara' and 'ring' in the house of Kehar Singh which have been recovered from the latter. It clearly goes to show that Kehar Singh knew why Beant Singh took Amrit and why he handed over the golden 'kara' and 'ring' to him. It is also clear from the evidence of Bimla Khalsa that what transpired between Beant Singh and Kehar Singh on 14th was not conveyed to her and she was kept in dark. [112B] 
 35. In this background the trip to Amritsar of Beant Singh, Kehar Singh and their families is of some significance. The attempt of these two persons to keep themselves away from the company of their wives and children speaks volume about their sinister designs. The way in which these two avoided the company of the members of the family and PW 53 at whose residence they were staying and the manner in which they remained mysterious if looked at with the secret talks which they had in the house of Bimla Khalsa earlier goes to establish that the two were doing something or discussing something or planning something which they wanted to keep it as a secret even from Bimla Khalsa. [112C- G] 
 36. The manner in which Amrit has been taken by Beant Singh and even Satwant Singh and Bimla Khalsa have been made to take it makes it significant that in all these three of Amrit taking Kehar Singh was always with them or at least it could be said, was inspiring them to have it. It also indicates that there was something in the mind of Beant Singh which was known to Kehar Singh and which he even tried to keep a secret from his wife Bimla Khalsa and wanted Beant Singh to have a full religious purification and confidence.
 [113 A-B] 
 37. The post-crime conduct of Kehar Singh immediately after the news of assassination spread when he mentioned to his office colleague that ""whosoever would take confrontation with the Panth, he would meet the same fate" shows his guilty mind with that of Beant Singh. These circumstances by themselves indicate that Kehar Singh was a co-conspirator to assassinate Mrs. Gandhi. [113C-E] PG NO 45 
 38. The main evidence against accused Satwant Singh is evidence of eye witnesses. The testimony of Narain Singh PW 9-an eye witness, is corroborated by the first information report and also by the two other eye witnesses Rameshwar Dayal PW 10 and Nathu Ram PW 64, whose presence on the spot could not be doubted. Nathu Ram was in the personal staff of the Prime Minister and Rameshwar Dayal himself had received injuries. Apart from it, this evidence of direct witnesses also finds corroboration from the post-mortem report, recovery of cartridges and arms on the spot and the evidence of the Doctor and the expert who tallied the bullets. Under these circumstances, even if the confession of this appellant Satwant Singh is not taken into consideration, still there is enough evidence which conclusively establish his part in the offence and in this view of the matter there appears to be no reason to interfere with the conclusions arrived at by the two Courts below. Therefore, the appeal of Satwant Singh deserves to be dismissed. [114D,115C-D] (Per Ray, J.) 
 1. The concurrent findings of the Trial Court as well as of the High Court that offences under s. 302 I.P.C. read with s. 120-B, I.P.C. and s. 34 I.P.C. were proved aginst Satwant Singh, must be upheld. It is a gruesome murder committed by the accused who was employed as a security guard to protect the Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. It is one of the rarest of rare cases in which extreme penalty of death is called for. [136C] 
 2. The charge of conspiracy against Kehar Singh with the accused Satwant Singh and Beant Singh since deceased has been proved without any reasonable doubt. [136D] 
 3. The fixing of the place of sitting of Court of Sessions was made prior to the enforcement of the Code of Criminal procedure Amendment 1973 by the Executive. Under the amended Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, s. 9(6) has conferred power on the High Court to notify the place where the Court of Sessions will ordinarily hold its sittings within the Sessions Division in conformity with the policy of separation of Judiciary from the executive. The High Court may notify the place or places for the sitting of the Court where the sittings are ordinarily held if the High Court can fix a place other than the Court where the sittings are ordinarily held if the High Court so notifies under s. 9(6) Cr. P.C. by itself signifies that the High Court in exercise of its powers under s. 9(6) of the Code may order the holding of Court in a place other than the Court where sittings are ordinarily held if the High Court thinks it expedient to do so and for other valid reasons such as security of the accused as well as of the witnesses and also of the Court. [117C-F] PG NO 46 
 4. The Order of the High Court notifying the trial of a particular case in a place other than the Court is not a prejudicial order but an administrative Order. In this case because of the surcharged atmosphere and for reasons of security, the High Court ordered that the trial be held in Tihar Jail. Therefore, it cannot be said that the trial is not an open trial because of its having been held in Tihar Jail as there is noting to show that the public or the friends and relations of the accused were prevented from having access to the place of trial provided the space of the Court could accommodate them. Various representatives of the press including representatives of international news agency like BBC, etc. were allowed to attend the proceedings in Court subject to the usual regulations of the jail.
 [117F-G] 
 5. Section 327 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that any place in which any criminal Court is held for the purpose of inquiring into or trying any offence shall be deemed to be an open Court, to which the public generally may have access. so far as the same can conveniently contain them. The place of trial in Tihar Jail according to this provision is to be deemed to be an open Court as the access of the public to it was not prohibited.
 [117H-118A] 
 6. In Some cases, trial of a criminal case is held in Court and some restrictions are imposed for security reason regarding entry into the Court. Such restrictions do not detract from trial in open Court. Section 327 proviso empowers the Presiding Judge or Magistrate to make order denying entry of public in Court. No such order had been made in this case denying access of members of public to Court. [118D-E) 
 7. Trial in jail does not by itself create any prejudice to the accused and it will not be illegal. [118F] 
 8. In the instant case, though the trial was held in Tihar Jail for reasons of security of the accused as well as of the witnesses and of the Court and also because of the surcharged atmosphere, there was no restriction on the public to attend the Court, if they so minded. Therefore, the trial, in the instant case, in Tihar Jail is an open trial and it does not prejudice in any manner whatsoever the accused. [120H-121A] PG NO 47 
 9. Though public trial or trial in open Court is the rule yet in cases where the ends of justice would be defeated if the trial is held in public, it is in that case the Court has got inherent jurisdiction to hold trial in camera. Therefore, the holding of trial in jail cannot be said to be illegal and bad and entire trial cannot be questioned as vitiated if the High Court thinks it expedient to hold the trial in jail.

 10. Section 164(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure requires that the Magistrate before recording confession shall explain to the person making confession that he is not bound to make a confession and if does so it may be used as evidence against him and upon questioning the person if the Magistrate has reasons to believe that it is being made voluntarily, then the confession will be recorded by the Magistrate. The compliance of sub-s. (2) of s. 164 is therefore,mandatory and imperative and non-compliance of it renders the confession inadmissible in evidence. Section 463 (old s. 533) of the Code provides that where the questions and answers regarding the confession have not been recorded evidence can be adduced to prove that in fact the requirements of sub-s. (2) of s. 164 read with s. 281 have, in fact, been complied with. If the Court comes to a finding that such a compliance had, in fact, been made the mere omission to record the same in the proper form will not render it inadmissible in evidence and the defect is cured under s. 463 (s. 533 of the old Code) but when there is non- compliance of the mandatory requirement of s. 164(2) of the Code and it comes out in evidence that no such explanation as envisaged in the aforesaid sub-section has been given to the accused by the Magistrate, this substantial defect cannot be cured under s. 463 of the Code. [126E- 127A] PG NO 48 
 11. In the instant case, accused Satwant Singh who was in police custody was produced before the Magistrate on 29.11.1984. On that day the accused made an application stating that he wanted to make a statement about the facts concerning assassination of Mrs. Indira Gandhi, the Magistrate directed the remand of the accused in judicial custody till 1.12.1984 giving the accused time to reconsider and reflect. The Magistrate also told him that he was not bound to make any statement and if any statement is made the same might be used against him. The Magistrate also directed the sending of a letter to the Secretary, Legal Aid Committee to provide legal assistance to the accused at the expenses of the State. On 1.12.1984, the Magistrate enquired of the accused whether he wanted to make a statement whereon the accused stated that he wanted to make a statement. He was allowed to consult his counsel who conferred with him for about 15 minutes privately. As the accused insisted that his statement be recorded, the application was sent by the magistrate to the Link Magistrate for recording his statement. Before recording his statement a doctor was called to examine the accused, who in his report (Ext. PW 11/B) stated that in his opinion the accused is fit to make his statement. It appears from Ext. PW 11/B-2 as well as from the questions and answeres which were put to the accused (Ext. PW 11/B-3) that the Link Magistrate warned the accused that he was not bound to make any confessional statement and in case he does so it may be used against him during trial. The accused in spite of this warning wanted to make a statement and thereafter the confessional statement Ext. PW 11/C Was recorded by the Link Magistrate. In the certificate appended to the said confessional statement it has been stated that there was no pressure upon the accused and there was neither any police officer nor anybody else within the hearing or sight when the statement was recorded. Therefore, it appears that the accused was put the necessary questions and was given the warning that he was not bound to make any statement and in case any statement is made, the same might be used against him by the prosecution for his conviction. Of course, no question was put by the Magistrate to the accused as to why he wanted to make a confessional statement. It also appears from the evidence of the Magistrate that the confessional statement was made voluntarily by the accused. So the defect in regarding the statement in the form prescribed is cured by s. 463 of the Code. The defect in recording the statement in appropriate form prescribed can be cured under section 463 of the code provided the mandatory provisions of s. 164[2] namely explaining to the accused that he was not bound to make a statement and if a statement is made the same might be used against him, have been complied with and the same is established on an examination of the Magistrate that the mandatory provisions have been complied with.

 On a consideration and appraisement of the evidence of the eye-witnesses, it is clear and apparent that the accused Satwant Singh and Beant Singh fired at Smt. Indira Gandhi while she was approaching the TMC gate accompanied by her Private Secretary Shri R.K. Dhawan, Narain Singh, H.C., PW- 9 holding an umbrella on her head to protect her from sun accompanying her on the right side and Nathu Ram following behind Shri R.K. Dhawan. It also appears that Beant Singh first started firing from his service revolver and simultaneously the accused Satwant Singh also cocked his SAF Carbine towards the Prime Minister whereon the Prime Minister fell on the ground on her right side. The eye- witnesses have specifically stated that the accused Satwant Singh and Beant Singh shot on the Prime Minister while she was approaching the TMC gate and she was about 8-10 steps away from the TMC gate. The eye-witnesses have denied that there was any firing from all the sides and it has been specifically stated in cross-examination that the firing was caused by Beant Singh and Satwant Singh from their respective service revolver and SAF carbine. It also appears that Beant Singh and accused Satwant Singh were apprehended by PW-9 Narain Singh, HC and by the ITBP people. PW-9 in his cross-examination specifically stated that Satwant Singh did not sustain bullet injuries before Smt. Indira Gandhi had been fired at. The suggestion on behalf of the defence that there was firing from all the sides and accused Satwant Singh was injured seriously and Beant Singh died by this firing has got no basis and it is unsustainable. It is obvious from the deposition of PW-49 that when he and other ITBP took Beant Singh and Satwant Singh to the guard room they were not at all in injured condition. [132F-133C] 
 13. The evidence clearly show that Satwant Singh accused No. 1 manipulated his duty from beat No. 4 to TMC gate in P.M. House and so there is no-doubt about his presence at the TMC gate on 31.10.1984 from 7.30 A.M. [135C] PG NO 50 
 14. A confession made by an accused cannot be used to convict his co-accused unless there is corroborative evidence against the co-accused but a person can be convicted solely upon his own confession even if retracted if the Court believed it to be true. The deposition of the independent witnesses is corroborated by the confessional statement PW 11/C made by the accused Satwant Singh. Though the said confession was retracted subsequently by the accused, the same can be used by the Court against the accused in convicting him. In the instant case the confessional statements were corroborated by independent evidences which clearly prove the guilt of the accused.

 1. Section 354(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 marks a significant shift in the legislative policy of awarding death sentence. Now the normal sentence for murder is imprisonment for life and not sentence of death. The Court is required to give special reasons for awarding death sentence. Special reasons mean specific facts and circumstances obtained in the case justifying the extreme penalty. [202D] Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab, [1980] 2 S.C.C. 684 and Machhi Singh v. State of Punjab, [1983] INSC 80; [1983] 3 S.C.R. 413, referred to.
 
 2. In the instant case, the crime charged was not simply the murdering of the human being, but it was the crime of assassination of the duly elected Prime Minister of the country. The motive for the crime was not personal, but the consequences of the action taken by the Government in the exercise of constitutional powers and duties. In our democratic republic, no person who is duly constituted shall be eliminated by privy conspiracies. The 'Operation Blue Star' was not directed to cause damage to Akal Takht. Nor it was intended to hurt the religious feelings of Sikhs. The decision was taken by the responsible and responsive Government in the national interest. The late Prime Minister Smt. Indira Gandhi was, however, made the target for the consequences of the decision. The security guards who were duty-bound to protect the Prime Minister at the cost of their lives, themselves became the assassins. All values and all ideals in life; all norms and obligations were thrown to the winds. It was a betrayal of the worst order. It was the most foul and senseless assassination. The preparations for and the execution of this egregious crime do deserve the dread sentence of the law.
 PG NO 51 
 3. Sub-s. (6) of s. 9 of the Code of Criminal Procedure can be divided into two parts. The first part provides power to the High Court to notify the place or places for the Court of Session to hold its sittings for disposal of cases.
 The second part deals with the power of the Court of Sessions in any particular case to hold its sittings at a place not notified by the High Court. [142D-E] 
 4. The words "place or places" used in S. 9(6) indicate that there could be more than one place for the sitting of the Court of session. The different places may be notified by different notifications. There may be a general notification as well as a special notification. The general notification may specify the place for the class of cases where Court of Session shall sit for disposal. The special notification may specify the same place or a different place in respect of a particular case. [143C] 
 5. The words and sections like men do not have their full significance when standing alone. Like man, they are better understood by the company they keep. [143D] 
 6. Section 9(4) and s. 194 of the Code are the closely related sections and they may also be examined to understand the true meaning of the words "place or places" in the first part of s. 9(4). Section 9(4) empowers the High Court to appoint a Sessions Judge of one division to sit at such place or places in another division for disposal of cases.
 The High Court while so appointing need not direct him to sit only at the ordinary place of sittings of the Court of Sessions. There is no such constraint in s. 9(4). The High Court may also issue a separate notification under s. 9(6) specifying the place or places where that Sessions Judge should sit for disposal of cases. Section 194 provides power to the High Court to make a special order directing an Additional or Assistant Session Judge of the same division to try certain specified cases or a particular case. If the High Court thinks that the Additional or Assistant Sessions Judge should hold the Court at a specified place, a separate notification could be issued under s. 9(6). [143E-144C] 
 7. The power provided by the first part of the High Court is an administrative power, intended to further the administration of justice. The power provided by the second part is a judicial power of the Court of Session intended to avoid hardship to the parties and witnesses in a particular case. One is independent of and unconnected with the other.
 So, the first part of s. 9(6) cannot be read with second part thereof. The Judicial power of the Court of Session is of limited operation, the exercise of which is conditioned by mutual consent of the parties in the first place.
 Secondly, the exercise of that power has to be narrowly tailored to the convenience of all concerned. It cannot be made use of for any other purpose. This limited judicial power of the Court of Session cannot be put across to curtial the vast administrative power of the High Court.
 [144D-E] PG NO 52 
 8. Section 9(6) is similar to s. 9(2) of the Old Code (Act 5 of 1898). The only difference being that s. 9(2) conferred power on the State Government to specify the "place or places'' where the Court of Session should sit for the purpose of disposal of cases. That power is now vested in the High Court. The change of authorities was made to keep in tune with the separation of judiciary from the executive. The scope of the sections, however, remains the same. [144G] 
 9. It is unnecessary for the High Court to hear the accused or anybody else before exercising the Power under s.
 9(6). Such a hearing, however, is required to be given by the Court of Session, if it wants to change the normal place of sitting,in any particular case, for the general convenience of parties and witnesses. Therefore, the impugned notification of the High Court, in the instant case, directing that the trial of the case shall be held at Tihar is not ultra vires of s. 9(6) of the code. [146G-H] Lakshman v. Emperor, A.I.R. 1931 Bom. 313 and Ranjit Singh v. Chief Justice & Ors., [1985] Vol. 28 DLT 153, affirmed.
 
 10. The Sixth Amendment to the United states Constitution provides "In all criminal prosecution, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury.....". No such right has been guaranteed to the accused under the Indian Constitution. The right of an accused to have a public trial in India has been expressly, provided in the Code. [147F] 
 11. The jail trial is not an innovation. It has been there since long back. The practice of having trials inside jails, Seems to have persisted even after the coming into force of the Indian Constitution. [147G] 
 12. Jail is not a Prohibited place for trial of criminal cases. Nor the jail trial can be regarded as an illegitimate trial. There can be trial in jail premises for reasons of security to the parties, witnesses and for other valid reasons. The enquiry or trial, however, must be conducted in open Court. There should not be any veil of secrecy in the proceedings. There should not even be an impression that it is a secret trial. The dynamics of judicial process should be thrown open to the public at every stage. The public must have reasonable access to the place of trial. The Presiding Judge must have full control of the Court house. The accused must have all facilities to have a fair trial and all safeguards to avoid prejudice. [149F] PG NO 53 
 13. In the instant case, there is no decision of the High Court to have the trial in Tihar Jail. The records show that the situation then was imperative. It is said that the assessination of Smt. Indira Gandhi had provoked widespread violence threatening the security of the State and the maintenance of law and order. The remand and the committal proceedings had to be taken in Tihar Jail since the Magistrate and Prosecutor were threatend with dire consequence. Such circumstances continued to exist when the case came up for trial. The Government requested the High Court to have the trial of the case in Tihar Jail for the security of the Judge, witnesses, Police Officers and also for the safety of the accused themselves. The High Court also had taken note of the events that immediately followed the assassination of Smt. Indira Gandhi, Beant Singh one of the assassins was shot dead and Satwant Singh accused received near fatal gun shot injury. There was unprecedented violence aftermath in the national capital and other places.
 Frenzied mobs armed with whatever they could lay their hands were seen besieging passing Sikhs and Burning their vehicles, as doctors in the hospital fought their vain battle to save the life of Smt. Indira Gandhi. Even President Zail Singh's cavalcade, making its way from the Airport to the hospital was not spared. The reaction of outrage went on unabated followed by reprisal killings and destruction of properties. The local police force was Badly shaken. They could do little even to contain the violence.
 The Army had to be deployed to stem the tide of deluge. The new Prime minister, made an unscheduled broadcast to the Nation pleading for sanity and protection to the Sikhs.
 Nevertheless three days passed on with murder and loot leaving behind a horrendous toll of more than two thousand dead and countless property destroyed. It is a tragedy frightening even to think of. These unprecedented events and circumstances would amply justify the decision of the High Court to direct that the trial of the case should take place in Tihar Jail. [149G-151C] Sahai Singh v.

 14. The main part of sub-s. (1) of s. 3Z7 embodies the principle of public trial. It declares that the place of enquiry and trial of any offence shall be deemed to be an open Court. It significantly use the words "open Court". It means that all justice shall be done openly and the Courts shall be open to public. It means that the accused is entitled to a public trial and the public may claim access to the trial. The sub- section, however, goes on to state that "the public generally may have access so far as the place can conveniently contain them". It is implicit in the concept of a public trial. The public trial does not mean that every person shall be allowed to attend the Court. Nor the Court room shall be large enough to accommodate all persons. The Court may restrict the public access for valid reasons depending upon the particular case and situation.
 [151G-152B] 
 15. The proviso to sub-s. (1) of s. 327 specifically provides power to the Presiding Judge to impose necessary constraint on the public access depending upon the nature of the case. It also confers power on the Presiding Judge to remove any person from the Court house. The public trial is not disorderly trial. It is an orderly trial. The presiding Officer may, therefore, remove any person from the Court premises if his conduct is undesirable. If exigencies of a situation require, the person desiring to attend the trial may be asked to obtain a pass from the authorised person.
 Such visitors may be also security checks. These and other like restrictions will not impair the right of the accused or that of the public. They are essential to ensure fairness of the proceedings and safety to all concerned. [152F-153A] 
 16. "There are yet other fundamental principles justifying the public access to criminal trials. The crime is a wrong done more to the society than to the individual.
 It involves a serious invasion of rights and liberties of some other person or persons. The people are, therefore, entitled to know whether the justice delivery system is adequate or inadequate. Whether it responds appropriately to the situation or it presents a pathetic picture. This is one aspect. The other aspect is still more fundamental. When the State representing the society seeks to prosecute a person, the State must do it openly. [153B] Cooley's Constitutional Law, Vol. I. 8th Ed. at 647 and Scott v. Scott, 1913, A.C. 417 at 477, referred to.
 PG NO 55 
 17. In open dispensation of justice, the people may see that the State is not misusing the State machinery like the Police, the Prosecutors and other public servants. The people may see that the accused is fairly dealt with and not unjustly condemned. There is yet another aspect. The Courts like other institutions also Belong to people. They are as much human institutions as any other. The other instruments and institutions of the State may survive by the power of the purse or might of the sword. But not the Courts. The Courts have no such means or power. The Courts could survive only by the strength of public confidence. The public confidence can be fostered by exposing Courts more and more to public gaze. [153H-154B] "First Amendment Right of Access to Pretrial Proceedings in Criminal Cases" By Beth Hornbuckle Fleming (Emory Law Journal, V. 32 (1983) p. 618 to 688, referred to.
 
 18. In the instant case, the Office Block of the Jail Staff was used as the Court House. It is an independent building located at some distance from the main jail complex. In between there is a court-yard. This court-yard has direct access from outside. A visitor after entering the court-yard can straight go to the Court House. He need not get into the Jail Complex. This is evident from the sketch of the premises produced before this Court. It appears the person who visits the Court House does not get any idea of the Jail Complex in which there are Jail Wards and Cells.
 From the sketch, it will be also seen that the building comprises of a Court-hall, bar room and Chamber for the Judge. The Court hall can be said to be of ordinary size. It has seating capacity for about fifty with some space for those who could afford to stand. The accused as undertrial prisoners were lodged at Jail No. 1 inside the Jail Complex.
 It was at a distance of about 1 Km. from the Court House.
 For trial purposes, the accused were transported by van. In the Court hall, they were provided with bullet proof enclosure. [155D-G] 
 19. For security reasons, the public access to trial was regulated. Those who desired to witness the trial were required to intimate the Court in advance. The trial Judge used to accord permission to such persons subject to usual security checks. Before commencement of the trial of the case, the representatives of the Press and News Agencies, national or international, approached the trial Judge for permission to cover the Court proceedings. The trial Judge allowed their request. The trial Judge did permit access to the members of the public also. He permitted even the Law Students in batches to witness the trial. There is hardly any instance brought to the attention of this Court where a person who sought permissions was denied access to the Court. The observations of the High Court that the "trial Judge has given access to the place of trial for all members of the public who may be minded to attend the same save for certain reasonable restriction imposed in public interest" have not been shown to be incorrect. The accused were represented by leading members of the Bar. Some of the close relatives of the accused were allowed to be present at the trial. All press representatives and news agencies whoever sought permission have been allowed to cover the day to day Court proceedings. There can, therefore, be no doubt or dispute as to the adequacy of safeguards provided to constitute an open trial. Indeed, the steps taken by learned trial Judge were more than adequate to ensure fair trial as well as public trial. There is no member of the public or press before this Court making grievance that his constitutional right of access to the trial has been denied in this case. [155H, 158C-F,H] PG NO 56 
 20. What the Judicial decision purports to do is to decide the controversy between the parties brought the Court and nothing more. The Judicial verdict pronounced by Court in or in relation to a matter brought before it for its decision cannot be said to affect the fundamental rights of citizens under Art. 19(1) of the Constitution of India.

 21. Under the American Constitution the mandatory exclusion of the press and public to criminal trials in all cases violates the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. But if such exclusion is made by the trial Judge in the best interest of fairness to make that exclusion, it would not violate that constitutional right.

 22. Soon after the assassination of Smt. Indira Gandhi the Government of India by notification dated November 20, 1984, constituted a Commission under the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952 presided over by Mr. Justice M.P. Thakkar the sitting Judge of the Supreme Court. The Commission inter-alia was asked to make recommendations as to the corrective remedies and measures that need to be taken for the future with respect to the matters specified in clause (d) of the terms of reference. The Commission framed regulations under s. 8 of the Act in regard to the procedure for enquiry. Regulation 8 framed thereon provided that "in view of the sensitive nature of the enquiry, the proceedings will be in camera unless the Commission directs otherwise".
 Accordingly, the Commission had its sittings in camera, and the Commission submitted an interim report, followed by the final report. [161G, 162E-F] PG NO 57 
 23. The Government of India did not lay the said reports before the House of People on the ground of expediency in the interest of the security of the State and in the public interest and for that purpose amended the Commissions of Inquiry Act. [162G,163G] 
 24. The trial Court while rejecting the application of the accused held that the statements recorded by the Commission are inadmissible in evidence in any subsequent proceedings and cannot, therefore, be used for the purpose of contradicting the same witnesses under s. 145 of the Evidence Act. The High Court also rejected such applications and held that it was not proper to compel production of the proceedings or the report of the Commission in view of the privilege of non-disclosure provided by the Act of Parliament and that the evidence before the Commission is wholly inadmissible in any other Civil or Criminal proceedings except for prosecuting the person for prejury.

 25. The accused in criminal trials should be given equal opportunity to lay evidence fully, freely and fairly before the Court. The Government which prosecutes an accused will lay bare the evidence in its possession. If the accused asks for summoning any specific document or thing for preparing his case, it should normally be allowed by the Court if there is no legal bar. But "the demand must be for production of ..... specific documents and should not purpose any broad or blind fishing expedition." These principles are broadly incorporated for the guidance of Courts under s. 91 and s. 233 of the Code of Criminal procedure. [165G-166C] Clinton E. Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657-1 L.Ed.

 26. Dissecting s. 6 of the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952 it will be clear that the statement made by a person before the Commission, in the first place shall not be the basis to proceed against him. Secondly, it shall not be used against him in any subsequent civil or criminal proceedings except for the purpose set out in the section itself. The single exception provided thereunder is a prosecution for giving false evidence by such statement. [l66Fl PG NO 58 
 27. From the provisions of ss. 3, 4, 5, 5(a), G and 8 of the Commission of the Inquiry Act, it will be clear that the Act was intended to cover matters of public important. In matters of public importance it may be necessary for the Government to fix the responsibility on individuals or to kill harmful rumours. The ordinary law of the land may not fit in such cases apart from it is time consuming. The Commission under the Act is given the power to regulate its own procedure and also to decide whether to sit in camera or in public. A Commission appointed under the Act does not decide any dispute. There are no parties before the Commission. There is no lis. The Commission is not a Court except for a limited purpose. The procedure of the Commission is inquisitorial rather than accusatorial. The Commission more of ten may have to give assurance to persons giving evidence before it that their statements will not he used in any subsequent proceedings except for perjury.
 Without such an assurance, the persons may not come forward to give statements. If persons have got lurking fear that their statements given before the Commission are likely to be used against them or utilised for productive use on them in any other proceeding, they may be reluctant to expose themselves before the Commission. Then the Commission would not be able perform its task. The Commission would not be able to reach the nuggets of truth from the obscure horizon.
 The purpose for which the Commission is constituted may be defeated. [169-170B] 
 28. The Court should avoid such construction to s. 6 of the said Act which may stultify the purpose of the Act.
 Section 6 must receive liberal construction so that person deposing before the Commission may get complete immunity except in a case of prosecution for perjury. That is possible if the word "against" used in s. 6 is properly understood. [170C] 
 29. Section 6 contains only one exception. That is a prosecution for giving false evidence by such statement.
 When the Legislature has expressly provided a singular exception to the provisions, it has to be normally understood that other exceptions are ruled out. Therefore, the statement given before a Commission shall not be admissible against the person in any subsequent civil or criminal proceedings save for perjury. [170E] PG NO 59 Sohan Lal v.

 30. There is vital difference between the two crimes;
 (i) abetment in any conspiracy, and (ii) criminal conspiracy. The former is defined under the second clause of s. 107 and the latter is under s. 120-A of the Indian Penal Code. The gist of the offence of criminal conspiracy created under s. 120-A is a bare agreement to commit an offence. It has been made punishable under s. 120-B. The offence of abetment created under the second clause of s.
 107 requires that there must be something more than a mere conspiracy.. There must be some act or illegal omission in pursuance of that conspiracy. That would be evident by the wordings of s. 107 (Secondly): "engages in any conspiracy omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy ....." The punishments for these two categories of crimes are also quite different. Section 109 IPC is concerned only with the punishment of abetments for which no express provision is made under the Indian Penal Code; A charge under s. 109 should, therefore, be along with some other substantive offence committed in consequence of abetment. The offence of criminal conspiracy is, on the other hand, an independent offence. It is made punishable under s. 120-B for which a Charge under s. 109 IPC is unnecessary and indeed inappropriate. [l75G_l77C] 
 31. The genuineness of the document Ex. PW 26/B is inextricably connected with the arrest and search of the accused Balbir Singh at Najafgarh Bus Stand. The document was recovered from the accused upon arrest and search made under s. 51 of the Code. If the arrest cannot carry conviction then the recovery automatically falls to the ground. Not merely that, even the allegation that the accused had absconded vanishes to thin air. The case of the prosecution is that Balbir Singh was released from his 'de facto custody ' at Yamuna Velodrome in the evening of November 1, 1984 and thereafter he was absconding till he was arrested on December 3, 1984 at Najafgarh Bus Station.
 The accused has challenged this version. [177H- I78C] PG NO 60 
 32. The Courts do not interfere in the discretion of the police in matters of arrest, search and release of persons suspected in criminal cases. But the Courts do insist that it should be done according to law. If the prosecution say that the accused was released from custody and the accused denies it, it will be for the prosecution to place material on record in support of the version. In the instant case, there is no record indicating the release op Balbir Singh from Yamuna Velodrome. The explanaTion gIven is that Yamuna Velodrome being not a Police Station, registers were not maintained to account for the incoming and outgoing suspects. It is hardly an explanation where life and death questions are involved. [178D-E] 
 33. The question of absconding by the accused Balbir Singh remains unanswered. First, there is no material to lend credence to this serious allegation. Nobody has been asked to search him. No police party has been sent to track him. No procedure contemplated under law has been taken.
 Second. there is no evidence from which place the accused came and landed at Najafgarh Bus stand. There is no independent witness for the seizure memo (PW. 35/a) vide which the police is said to have recovered certain articles including Ex. PW 26/B described as "memorandum of events." Third, no question as to absconding was put to the accused in the examination under s. 313 of the Code. So far as the reliance placed by the prosecution upon the averments in the remand application is concerned, the averments in the remand application are only self-serving. The silence of the accused cannot be construed as his admission of those allegations. Further, the reliance placed by the prosecution on the Malkana Register is of little assistance to the prosecution as there is an endorsement in the Malkana Register stating that the D.T.C. ticket which the accused carried and the paper containing the dates in English (Ex.
 PW. 26/B) were not deposited. In view of these infirmities, the arrest of the accused at Najafgarh Bus Stand does not inspire confidence. This by itself is sufficient to discard the document Ex. PW. 26/B. [178F-180A] 
 34. The document Ex. Pw. 26/B is a sheet of paper which contains certain entries. If this document is an incriminating piece of evidence, it is rather baffling why the accused, who was suspected to be a conspirator to murder the Prime Minister of the country, should carry the document wherever he goes that too at a place where there were reprisal killings. The accused is not a rustic person. He is a Sub-Inspector of Police with several years of service to his credit. He must have investigated so many crimes. He must have anticipated the danger of carrying incriminating document when he was already suspected to be a party to the deadly conspiracy. Indeed, nobody could offer even a plausible explanation for this unusual conduct attributed to the accused. To say that the absconding accused-Sub- Inspector was found at a public place in the national capital with an incriminating document which may take him to gallows is to insult the understanding, if not the intelligence of police force of this country. [180-181G] PG NO 61 
 35. A bare reading of the document Ex. PW. 26/B shows that this is a document composed at one time with the same ink and same writing instrument. The corrections. the fixing of months and dates with the nature of entries therein apparently indicate that the document was not kept as a contemporaneous record of events relating to Balbir Singh.
 The fact that it was not in the possession of the accused when his house was searched in the early hours of November 
1. 1984 also confirms this conclusion. [181-182A] 
 36. In the document, there is no reference to killing of the Prime Minister. In fact, except for a "felt like killing" in early June as an immediate reaction the "Operation Blue Star" even the manifestation of this feeling does not exist anywhere in subsequent part of the document.
 The document refers to bare meetings, visits of persons, or visiting somebody's house. It is, however, nor possible to find out to whom the document was intended to be used.
 There is no reference to a joint 'Ardas' or a message for revenge associated with the appearance of the eagle. The entry does not suggest that the author had anything to do with the eagle. It is something between Beant Singh alone and the eagle. It is significant that there is no reference to Beant Singh and his plans to murder the Prime Minister.
 There is no reference to bombs or grenades associated with the plan to eliminate the Prime Minister before the 15th August, 1984. There is no reference to any commission of any offence. There is no reference about Beant Singh conspiring with Balbir Singh. There is no reference to Kehar Singh at all. If Balbir Singh was a party to the conspiracy with Beant Singh, the date on which Beant Singh has planned the murder of Smt. Indira Gandhi, that is, October 25, 1984 as written in Ex. P. 39 ought to have been noted in Ex. PW. 26/B, but there is no reference to that.
 There is a cryptic reference to Satwant Singh against 30th October. The only one entry which makes a reference to killing is the second entry. It refers to "felt like killing". But one does not know who "felt like killing" and killing whom? It may be somebody's reaction to the "Operation Blue Star". If the document is read as a whole, it does not reveal anything incriminating against Balbir Singh, [182B-183A] PG NO 62 
 37. Entering into an agreement by two or more persons to do an illegal act or legal act by illegal means is the very quintessence of the offence of conspiracy. The illegal act may or may not be done in pursuance of agreement, but the very agreement is an offence and is punishable. Reference to ss. l20A and l20R I.P.C. would make these aspects clear beyond doubt. These provisions have brought the law of conspiracy in India in line with the English Law by making the overt act unessential when the conspiracy is to commit any punishable offence. [l84C] 
 38. Generally, a conspiracy is hatched in secrecy and it may be difficult to adduce direct evidence of the same. The prosecution will often rely on evidence of acts of various parties to infer that they were done in reference to their common intention. The prosecution will also more often rely upon circumstantial evidence. The conspiracy can be undoubtedly proved by such evidence direct or circumstantial. But the Court must enquiry whether the two persons are independently pursuing the same end or they.
 have come together to the pursuit of the unlawful object.
 The former does not render them conspirators, but the latter does. It is, however, essential that the offence of conspiracy requires some kind of physical manifestation of agreement. The express agreement, however, need not be proved. Nor actual meeting of two persons is necessary. Not it is necessary to prove the actual words of communication.
 The evidence as to transmission of thoughts sharing the unlawful design may be sufficient. [184D-E] 
 39. The relative acts or conduct of the parties must be conscientious and clear to mark their concurrence as to what should be done. The concurrence cannot be inferred by a group of irrelevant facts artfully arranged so as to give an appearance of coherence. The innocuous. innocent or inadvertent events and incidents should not enter the judicial verdict.
 
 40. Section 10 of the Evidence Act introduced the doctrine of agency and if the conditions laid down therein are satisfied, the acts done by one are admissible against the co-conspirators. [l85D] PG NO 63 
 41. Section 10 will come into play only when the Court is satisfied that there is reasonable ground to believe that two or more persons have conspired together to commit an offence. There should be a prima facie that the person was a party to the conspiracy before his acts prima facie against his co-conspirator. Once such prime facie evidence exists, anything said, done or written by one of the conspirators in reference to the common intention, after the said intention was first entertained is relevant against the others. It is relevant not only for the purpose of proving the existence of conspiracy, but also for proving that the other person was a party to it. [185G-H] Russell on Crime, 12 Ed.

 42. The HIgh Court was unjustified in attaching importance to any one of the aforesaid circumstances in proof of the conspiracy. Like Balbir Singh there were several Sikh officers on security duty at the PM's house.
 There is no evidence to show intimacy between Balbir Singh and Beant Singh or between Balbir Singh and Satwant Singh.
 There is no acceptable evidence that Balbir Singh shared the indignation of Beant Singh against Smt. Gandhi and was in a mood to avenge for the "Operation Blue Star." From the evidence of P.W. 13 all that could be gathered is that after the "Operation Blue Star", Balbir Singh was in agitated mood and he used to say that the responsibility of damaging 'Akal Takhat' lies with Smt. Gandhi and it would be avenged by them. This is not to say that Balbir Singh wanted to take revenge against the Prime Minister along with Beant Singh.
 It would not be proper to take notice of such general dissatisfaction. It is not an offence to form one's own opinion on governmental action. It is on record that some members of the Sikh community felt agitated over the "Operation Blue Star." The resentment was also expressed by some of the sikh employees of the Delhi police posted for PM's security. In fact, the chargesheet against all the accused is founded on those averments. Resentment of the accused on "Operation Blue Star" should, therefore, be excluded from consideration. There is no material that Balbir Singh took earned leave for any sinister purpose or design. There is no evidence that during the said period, he met Beant Singh or anybody else connected with the conspiracy. It is, therefore, totally an innocuous circumstance. Assuming that falcon did appear and sat on a tree in the PM's house and that Beant Singh and Balbir Singh did offer 'Ardas' on the occasion, there is "nothing unusual or abnormal about the incident." The sanctity of the falcon as associated with the Tenth Guru is not denied. The evidence of Satish Chander Singh (PW Sl) about the meeting of Balbir Singh with Satwant Singh on October 30, 1984 has got only to be referred to be rejected. To place reliance on the testimony of Amarjit Singh (PW 44) would be to put a premium on his irresponsibility. The discrepancies between the first version and his evidence in the Court are not immaterial. They are substantial and on material points. The witness is putting the words of Beant Singh into the mouth of Balbir Singh and thereby creating circumstances against the latter. All the facts and circumstances above recited are either irrelevant or explainable. No guilty knowledge of the contemplated assassination of the Prime Minister could be attributed to Balbir Singh on those facts and circumstances. [187-188] PG NO 64 
 41. The confession of a co-accused could be used only to lend assurance to the conclusion on the acceptable evidence against the accused. When by all the testimony in the case, Balbir Singh's involvement in the conspiracy is not established, the confession of Satwant Singh cannot advance the prosecution case. Even otherwise, the reference in the confession as to the conspiracy between Balbir Singh and Beant Singh was not within the personal knowledge of Satwant Singh. He refers to Beant Singh consulting Balbir Singh and "advising" to kill P.M. It is not clear who told him and when? such a vague statement is of little use even to lend assurance to any acceptable case against Balbir Singh.
 [191B] 
 42. The evidence produced by the prosecution against Balbir Singh is defective as well as deficient. It is safer, to err in acquitting than in convicting him. [191C] 
 43. The evidence of Bimla Khalsa wife of Beant Singh indicates that on October 17, 1984 Beant Singh and Kehar Singh were combined and conspiring together. Kehar Singh was closeted with Beant Singh on the roof of her house for about 15/18 minutes. There was hush hush talk between them which could not be over-heard by her as she was in the kitchen. That evoked suspicion in her mind. She did consider "their talk as something secret". She enquired from Kehar Singh "as to what they were talking thereupon?" Kehar Singh replied that the talks were "with regard to making somebody to take Amrit". Dimla Khalsa remarked: "that taking Amrit was not such a thing as to talk secretly". She was perfectly right in her remark. There cannot be a secret talk about Amrit taking ceremony. It is a religious function. Kehar Singh might have realised that it would be difficult to explain his conduct without exposing himself.
 He came with cryptic reply: "There was nothing particular".
 The said conversation, as the High Court has observed, could be only to further the prosecution of the conspiracy.
 Satwant Singh later joining them for meals lends credence to this conclusion. [193-l94C, F] PG NO 65 
 44. Merely because Bimla Khalsa turned hostile, her evidence cannot be discarded. That is a well accepted proposition. She had no axe to grind against any person. She gains nothing by telling falsehood or incorrect things against Kehar Singh. She has revealed what she was told and what she had witnessed on October 17, 1984 in her own house.
 There is, therefore. no reason to discard that part of her testimony. It is true that the police did not record her statement after the incident. That is understandable. she had lost her husband. She was in immeasurable grief. She ought to be allowed time to compose herself. Both the objections raised against her testimony are, therefore. not sound. [l94G-l95AI 
 45. The visit of Kehar Singh and Beant Singh along with their family members to Amritsar on October 20. 1984 assumes importance and it is significant to note about The relative character of Kehar Singh and Beant Singh. Even at the most sacred place they remained isolated from their wives and children. [195 E-196A] 
 46. Kehar Singh had the opportunity to bring Beant Singh back to the royal path, by dissuading him from taking any drastic action against Smt Gandhi, but unfortunately, he did nothing of that kind. If he had not approved the assassination of the Prime Minister. Beant Singh would not have grafted Satwant Singh to the conspiracy. Secondly, if Kehar Singh was really interested in reading Beant Singh, he would have taken the assistance of Bimla Khalsa. He did not do that even. She was deliberately not taken into confidence. She was in fact kept in darkness even though she was inquisitive to know their secret talk. [196B-C] 
 47. It is true that there is no substantive evidence from the testimony of Bimla Khalsa that Beant Singh took Amrit on October 14, 1984 at the instance of Kehar Singh.
 Undisputedly he was present at the ceremony in which Bimla Khalsa took Amrit. It may not be, therefore, unreasonable to state that he must have been present when Beant Singh also took Amrit. The recovery made from his house supports this inference. It is said that while taking Amrit or thereafter, the person is not expected to wear gold ornaments. Beant Singh had gold 'kara'(Ex. p. 27) and ring (Ex. p. 28). These two articles were recovered by the investigating agency from the house of Kehar Singh. That is not disputed before this Court. Beant Sign must have entrusted the articles to Kehar Singh at the time of his taking Amrit. It also shows the significant part played by Kehar Singh in taking. Amrit by Beant Singh. [196D-F] PG NO 66 
 48. It is true that taking Amrit by itself may not have any sinister significance. It is a religious ceremony and 'Amrit' is taken only to 'lead a life of spartan purity giving up all worldly pleasures and evil habits.' But, unfortunately, the assassins have misused that sacred religious ceremony for ulterior purpose. [196G] 
 49. The post crime conduct of Kehar Singh is conclusive of his guilt. He was cognizant of all the details of the coming tragedy and waiting to receive the news on that fateful day. That would be clear from the testimony of Nand Lal Mehta (PW 59) who was an office colleague of Kehar Singh. He has deposed that Kehar Singh had met him in the third floor corridor of the office at about 10-45 A.M. on October 31, 1984. By that time the news of the murderous attack on the Nation's Prime Minister came like a thunder- blot from a clear sky. The messenger had told that 'some- body' had shot at Smt. Gandhi. PW 59 then enquired from Kehar Singh as to what had happened. Kehar Singh replied that "whosoever would take confrontation with the Panth, he would meet the same fate." So stating, he went away. It may be noted that at that time, there was no specific information to the outside world whether any Sikh had shot the Prime Minister or anybody else. Unless Kehar Singh had prior knowledge, he could not have reacted with those words.
 [196H-197C] 
 50. To sum up: Kehar Singh's close and continued association with Beant Singh; his deliberate attempt to exclude Mrs. Bimla Khalsa from their company and conversation; his secret talk with Beant Singh followed by taking meals together with Satwant Singh; his keeping the gold 'kara' and 'ring' of Beant Singh; and his post crime conduct taken together along with other material on record are stronger as evidence of guilt than even direct testimony. Kehar Singh was one of the conspirators to murder Smt. Gandhi, though not for all the reasons stated. [197D] PG NO 67 
 51. Satwant Singh, a constable in the Delhi Police was on security duty at the Prime Minister's house since July 2, 1983. On October 31, 1984, in the usual course, he was put on security at Heat No. 4 in the Akbar Road House (not at the TMC Gate). This has been confirmed by R the daily diary maintained at Teen Murti (Ex. PW I4/C)-Entry No. 85). He was issued SAF Carbine (Sten-gun) having Butt No. 8() along with 5 magazines and 100 live rounds of 9 mm ammunition. In acknowledgement thereof, he had signed the register (Ex. PW 3/A). He got exchanged his place of duty to carry out the conspiracy he had with Beant Singh to murder Smt. Gandhi on the pretext that he was suffering from loose motions and got himself posted as TMC Gate being C nearer to a latrine.
 [197F-l98E] 
 52. Three eye witnesses to the occurrence, namely, Narain singh. Rameshwar Dayal and Nethu Ram corroborate with each other on all material particulars. They had accompanied the Prime Minister on the fateful day. They were able to see vividly, describe correctly and indentify properly the persons who gunned down Smt. Gandhi. Both the Courts below have accepted them as natural and trustworthy witnesses.
 Such a conclusion based on appreciation of evidence is binding on this Court in the appeals under Article 136 of the Constitution of India. [198F-G] Pritam Singh v. The State, A.l.R. 1950 SC 169; Hem Raj v. State of Ajmer, [l954] S.C.R. 1133 and Bhoqinbhai Hirjibhai v. State of Gujarat, A.l.R. 1983 SC 753; relied upon.
 
 53. There can be little doubt as to the presence of Narain singh at the spot. His evidence receives full corroboration from the other two eye witnesses. The umbrella (Ex. p. 19) which he was holding has been recovered from the place under the seizure memo (Ex. PW 5/H). Rameshwar Dayal (PW 10) is an A.S.I. of Police. He was on security duty at the PM's residence. He was also the water attendant in the pilot car of the Prime Minister. On material particulars his evidence is identical in terms with that of Narain Singh (PW 9). Undisputedly, he had suffered bullet injuries. He was admitted to the AIIMS for treatment. The Medico-legal Certificate issued by the AIIMS (Ex. 10/DA) supports his version. No further corroboration is necessary to accept his evidence. [l99E-200A] PG NO 68 
 54. Nathu Ram (PW 64) is also an eye witness. He was a dedicated servant of Smt. (Gandhi. His evidence as to the relative acts of the two assassins is consistent with the version of PW 9 of PW 10. His presence at the spot was most natural. His evidence is simple and straight-forward.
 [200B-D] 
 55. The presence of Satwant Singh at TMC Gate is also not in dispute and indeed it was admitted by his while answering question No. 51(A) in the examination under s.
 313 of the (code. What is important to notice from the testimony of Ganga Singh (PW 49) is that Satwant Singh when apprehended by him was not injured. He was taken safely to the guard room. He did not receive any bullet injury in the incident with which this Court is concerned. He must have been shot evidently inside the guard room where he was taken for safe custody by the ITBP personnel. The defence put forward by Satwant Singh that he was decoyed to the TMC gate where he received bullet injury is. therefore. patently false. 200G-H] 
 56. The eye witnesses are not strangers to the assassins. They were familiar faces in the security ring of the Prime Minister. Their presence with Smt. Gandhi at the spot was not accidental, but consistent with their duties.
 There was no scope for mistaken identity since everything happened in the broad day light. Therefore, the evidence thus far discussed itself is sufficient to bring, home the guilt to Satwant Singh on all the charges levelled against him. [201A-B] The records contain evidence as to the identification of arms and ammunition entrusted to the assassins. The stengun issued to Satwant Singh along with 25 empties of the sten- gun were recovered from the place of incident under the seizure memo (Ex. PW 5/H). The revolver (Ex. P.1) delivered to Beant Singh and 5 empties of the revolver were also collected at the spot. Dr. T.D. Dogra (PW 5) while conducting limited post-mortem examination had taken two bullets from the body of Smt. (Gandhi; one from injury No. 1 and the other from injury No 2. These bullets along with the arms recovered from the spot were sent for the opinion of the Principle Scientific Officer, Ballistic Division, GFSL, New Delhi. P.W. 12 has testified that the bullets recovered from the body of Smt. Gandhi are traceable to the sten-gun and the revolver.Similar is the evidence with regard to the other bullets recovered from the place of incident. The record also contains evidence about the total tally of the bullets fired and empties collected. It is not necessary to confirm the finger prints on the sten-gun, as that of the accused when it is proved that sten-gun was delivered to him. The examination of the bullets recovered from the body of Smt. Gandhi for the traces of blood or tissues is also unnecessary, since one of the bullets taken by the Doctor tallied with the sten-gun (Ex. P. 4). Equally, limited post- mortem examination would not affect the merits of the case.
 It is not always necessary to have a complete post-mortem in every case. Section 174 of the Code confers discretion to the Police Officer not to send the body for post-mortem examination if there is no doubt as to the cause of death.
 If the cause of death is absolutely certain and beyond the pale of doubt or controversy, it is unnecessary to have the post-mortem done by Medical Officer.
 In the instant case, there was no controversy about the cause of death of Smt. Gandhi. A complete post-mortem of the body was therefore uncalled for. [201F-202A] PG NO 69 
 57. From the aforesaid direct testimony coupled with the other clinching circumstances available on record, there is not even an iota of doubt about the crime committed by Satwant Singh. He is guilty of all the charges. I202B] 
 58. In the past, the Judges and lawyers spoke of a 'golden rule' by which statutes were to he interpreted according to grammatical and ordinary sense of the word.
 During the last several years, the 'golden rule' has been given a go bye. [167H] 
 59. The Courts now look for the 'intention' of the legislature or the 'purpose' of the statute. First, it examines the words, oF the statute. If the words are precise and cover the situation in hand it does not go further. It expounds those words in the natural and ordinary sense of the words. But if the words are ambiguous, uncertain or any doubt arises at to the terms employed, the Court deems it as its paramount duty to put upon the language of the legislature rational meaning. It then examines every word, every section and every provision. It examines the Act. It looks at the mischiefs which the legislature intended to redress. It looks at the whole situation and not just one relation. It will not consider any provisions out of the frame work of the statute. It will not view the provisions as abstract principles separated from the motive force behind. It will consider the provisions in the circumstances to which they owe their origin. It will consider the provisions to ensure coherence and consistency within the law as a whole and to avoid undesirable consequences.
