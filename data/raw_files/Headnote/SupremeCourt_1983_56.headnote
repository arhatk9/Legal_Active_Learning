 The petitioners, filed two petitions for special leave to appeal and also obtained interim orders of status quo ante as on 1.10.82 averring that they were continuing their studies as post-graduate students of Medical College, Rohtak. Since a dispute was raised whether the provisional admissions granted to them had continued till October 1, 1982 or were cancelled long prior to that date, an issue was sent to the District Judge, Rohtak for inquiry and a finding thereon. The said report contained not only a finding against the petitioners, but also revealed how the two petitioners and their counsel have indulged in telling lies and making reckless allegation of fabrication and manipulation of records against the college authorities and how in fact the boot was on their leg.
 Dismissing the petitions, the Court ^ 
 HELD: (1) It is clear from the report that on 1.10.1982, the petitioners made a false representation to the Supreme Court that they were continuing their studies as post graduate students of Medical College, Rohtak on 1.10.1982 and obtained an order of status quo ante as of that date to be maintained from this Court. But for the misrepresentation this Court would never have passed the said order. By reason of such conduct, they have disentitled themselves from getting any relief or assistance from this Court and the special leave petitions are liable to be dismissed. [1038 F-H] (2) In view of their conduct, the petitioners will pay a sum of Rs. 2,500.00 each by way of costs to the respondents. [1039 E] [The Court took a lenient view, on the tender of apology by the counsel on his own behalf and on behalf of the petitioners and awarded only costs under order XLI Rule 2, instead of drastic action by the respective professional bodies to which they belonged.] 1038
