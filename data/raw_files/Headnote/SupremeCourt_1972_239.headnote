 Under S. 27 of the Orissa Hindu Religious Endowments Act, the Additional Assistant Commissioner of Hindu Religious Endowments, appointed an interim trustee of two deities in a village in Orissa. The person in charge of the deities made an objection under S. 41 of the said Act, that since the deities were consecrated under a private endowment, the Act did not apply to the facts of the case. The Additional Assistant Commissioner rejected the objection without making any inquiry under S.41. The objector filed a revision under s. 9 of the said Act, before the appellant.
 During the period between the rejection of the objection and the filing of the revision, the Orissa High Court in Bhramarbar Santra & Ors. V. State of Orissa and Others, I.L.R. 1970 Cuttack 54 decided the identical question and (the High- Court) held that the Assistant Commissioner cannot appoint an interim trustee under s. 27 until he has held an inquiry under s. 41 and has found that there was no hereditary trustee of the religious institution.
 At the hearing of the revision, the said decision of the High Court was cited before the appellant, but the appellant did not follow it and dismissed the revision.
 The applicant filed a writ petition, in the High Court against this order. The Division Bench on hearing the applicant issued notice to contempt of the High Court to the applicant. The High Court took exception to the following sentence occurring at the end of paragraph 2 in his order "Further, against the order we have moved the Supreme Court, and as such, the matter can be safely deemed to be sub- judice." and held that the appellant was guilty of contempt of Court.
 On appeal before this Court, it was contended that the appellant was not guilty of contempt of court, for, the sentence in the appellant's order, neither interfered with the administration of justice, nor scandalised the High Court.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) Contempt of court is disobedience to the court by acting in opposition to the authority, justice and dignity thereof, it signifies the willful disregard or disobedience of the court's order. It also signified such conduct as tends to bring the authority of the court and the adminis- tration of law into disrepute, Oswald's Contempt of Court, 1910 Edn. pp. 5-6 referred to. [496D] (ii) It is a common-place that where the superior court's order staying proceedings is disobeyed by the inferior court to whom it is addressed, the latter court commits contempt of court for it acts in disobedience 496 the authority of the former court. The act of disobedience is calculated to undermine public respect for the superior court and to jeopardise the preservation of law and order.
 [496E] (iii) The appellant is guilty of contempt. Firstly, on the date of the order, nothing was pending in the Supreme Court; only a petition was pending in the High Court form a certificate to appeal to the Supreme Court from the decision in Bhramarbar Santras Case' The appellant has thus made a wrong statement of fact. Secondly, the use of the word "we" is also significant. it indicates that the appellant identified himself as a litigant in the case and did not observe due detachment and decorum as a quasi-.judicial authority. Lastly, it is not possible to believe that the appellant, who had 23 years of judicial experience, could have entertained the view that as soon as a petition for certificate to appeal to the Supreme Court was filed in the High Court against the decision, the binding character of the decision disappeared. it is, therefore, clear that the appellant deliberately avoided to follow the High Court's decision by giving wrong and illegitimate reasons and that his conduct is 'clearly mala-fide, [496 G] Under Art. 227 of the Constitution, the High Court is vested with the power of superintendence over the Courts and tribunals in the State. Acting as a quasi-judicial authority, the appellant was also subject to the super- intendence of the High Court. Accordingly, the decisions of the High Court were binding on him. He could not get away from them by adducing factually wrong and illegitimate reasons. The conduct of the appellant in not following the previous decision of the High Court is calculated to create confusion in the administration of law, which will undermine respect for law laid on by the High Court and impair the constitutional authority of the High Court. Therefore, the High Court has rightly found the appellant guilty of contempt. A bonafide but mistaken act of distinguishing a binding precedent does not amount to contempt.
