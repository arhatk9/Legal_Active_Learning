 The respondent was the owner of a building whose tenant was paying a certain amount as rent. No standard rent under s.
 9 of the West Bengal Rent Control (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1950 was fixed but the amount of rent was such that it would have been fixed as standard rent if application for such fixation was made under that Act. The tenant had sub- let the promises and was receiving a much larger sum from the sub-tenants. For the purpose of assessment to the consolidated rate under s. 168(1) of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation Act, 1951, the annual rent at which the building might be reasonably expected to be let from year to year should be taken into consideration. The appellant determined the annual value of the building on the basis of the rental received by the tenant from its sub-tenants. In appeal by the respondent the Court of Small Causes held that only the rent paid by the tenant to the respondent should be taken as the basis; and the High Court confirmed the order.
 In appeal to this Court it was contended that under the proviso to s. 168(i), if standard rent had been fixed under the West Bengal Rent Control (Temporary Provisions) Act, it would form the, basis of annual rent, but, if there was no such fixation, the appellant was competent to take into account all relevant circumstances including the rent at which the building- was sub-let.
 
HELD : (1) The corresponding section, s. 127(a) of the Calcutta Municipal Act, 1923 did not contain a proviso similar to the one in s. 168(1) of the 1951-Act. But the decision in Corporation of Calcutta v. Smt. Padma Debi, [1961] INSC 239; [1962] 3 S.C.R. 49, interpreting s. 127(a) of the 1923Act and holding that the annual value should be determined only on the footing of the standard rent applies. In determining the annual rent statutory limitation of rent circumscribes the scope of the bargain in the market and the rent at which the premises could be let out from year to year can never exceed the standard rent. Under s. 2(10) of the West Bengal Premises Rent Control (Temporary Provisions) Act, when there is no order of the Controller fixing the standard rent under s. 9 of that Act, the standard, rent would be the amount at which it would have been fixed if application were made for such fixation. Therefore, in the present case the annual rent at which the building, might reasonably be expected to be let from year to year, would be rent which the tenant was paying to the respondent and not the rent which the tenant was receiving from the sub-tenants. [251 D-H] (2) Section 193 of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation Act, which only provides for apportionment of consolidated rates, is irrelevant in determining the annual value. [252 G] 249
