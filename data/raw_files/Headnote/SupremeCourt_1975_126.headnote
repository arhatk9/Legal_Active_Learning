 On 14th August, 1972 the Government of Maharashtra made a reference to the Labour Court under s. 10(1)(c) of the Industrial Disputes Act of an industrial dispute in respect of the dismissal by the appellant of one of its employees N.
 S. Bobhate. On 25th August 1972 the appellant dismissed three other workers, Dastoor, Shome and Soman after an enquiry and this led to a strike in the appellant's factory.
 Towards the end of October 1972 the Company discharged about 312 of its employees and filed 12 applications before the industrial Tribunal for approval of such discharge as a reference was pending before it. The appellant pleaded before the Tribunal that the strike was illegal as a reference was pending in respect of Bobhate and therefore the discharge of its workers by the appellant was in order and approval should be granted. On August 30, 1973 the Tribunal rejected all the applications for approval and these appeals have been filed in pursuance of a Special Leave granted by this Court It was contended on behalf of the appellants that the whole of the machinery under the Act is available in the case of a -reference relating to an individual workman and once something which is not an industrial dispute is deemed to be an industrial dispute all the necessary implications of such a deeming provision should be given effect to. On the other hand, contention on behalf of the workmen was that, if the intention was to make the whole of the machinery of the Act available even in the case of pendency of the case of an individual workman before a Labour Court or Tribunal what would have been done is to add the words "and includes any dispute or difference between a workman and his employer connected with or arising out of the discharge, dismissal, retrenchment or termination of the services of that workman notwithstanding that no other workman nor any union of workmen is a party to the dispute" to clause (k) of sec. 2.
 IL was further contended that the dispute Or difference between the individual workman and hi% employer is only deemed to be an industrial dispute and that it is not in fact an industrial dispute. In the case of a deeming provision no greater effect should be given to it than is necessary for the purpose for which it is enacted.
 Dismissing the appeals, 
HELD : (i) The important words in S. 23(b) of the Act are "during the pendency of proceedings." Even though the dispute between the employer and the employees might relate to a case of a single workman the provisions of s. 23(b) would apply if the single workman's cause has been espoused by a labour union which need not necessarily comprise of all the employees of the concerned employer. [418 A-B] (ii) Even though the proceedings pending before the Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal might relate to certain matters only, there cannot be a strike or lock-out even in relation to matters other than those which are pending before the Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal. [418 B-C] 416 Provat kumar v. W. T. C. Parker, AIR 1950 Cal. 116 and State of Bihar v. Deodar Jha, AIR 1958 Patna 51, approved.
 (iii) In enacting S. 2A the intention of the legislature was that an individual workman who was discharged, dismissed or retrenched or whose service,,, were otherwise terminated should be given relief without it being necessary for the relationship between the employer and the whole body of employees being attracted to that dispute and the dispute becoming a generalised one between labour on the one hand and the employer on the other. [418H, 419A] (iv) The provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act clearly bring out the elaborate nature of the proceedings relating to conciliation, arbitration, settlement, inquiry and ward.
 The intention behind all these provisions is to avoid strikes and lock-outs as far as possible not only by bringing the parties together but also by referring points of dispute between them, either voluntarily or otherwise for decision by Labour Courts, Tribunals and National Tribunals.
 Strikes are not banned even in the case of public utility services. The ban on strikes is subject to certain limitations. There is no doubt that the Act recognises strikes as a legitimate weapon in the matter of industrial relations. The prohibition of strikes during the pendency of proceedings before a Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal under sec. 23 was, in the Act as originally enacted, confined only to disputes between the employer and the general body of employees and not to individual workmen.
 It is in that context that section 23 should be interpreted.
 ID the case of an industrial dispute between in individual workman and the employer the whole elaborate machinery of the Industrial Disputes Act may not be necessary lest it Would be like using sledge hammer to kill a flea'. While there is justification for preventing a strike when a dispute between the employer and the general body of workmen is pending adjudication or resolution, it would be too Much to hold that the legislature intended that it lid should be put on all Strikes just because the case of a single workman was pending. That the general body of labour should be prevented from resorting to strike where they had chosen to espouse the cause of a single workman understandable and reasonable. Even if the employer and workmen are parties to a reference the decision therein binds them even though they may have said they were not interested in it. But if strikes are to be prohibited merely because the case of an individual workman was pending, whose case had not been espoused by the general body of the workmen, there can never be any even for justiciable grounds [421 E-422A] Bellapur Collieries v.

 (v) It is not correct to say that clause (b) of S. 23 provides a blanket can on strikes if proceedings are pending. Even in respect of clause (b) come limitation should be, read confining it to the parties to the proceedings either actually or constructively as in the case of a Union espousing the cause of an individual workman.
