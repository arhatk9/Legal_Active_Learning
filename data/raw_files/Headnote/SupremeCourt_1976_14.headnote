 The appellants in Criminal Appeals 195 and 196 are the owner and Manager of a timber depot respectively (hereinafter referred to as appellants). Appellants complained to the Police that Respondent No. 1 had collected a large number of persons with deadly weapons and that the sheds constructed by the appellants were attacked and that there was apprehension that the shed would be demolished.
 The Police seized the disputed timber. The appellants made an application praying that the seized logs may be handed over to them. Respondent No. 1 also made an application claiming the timber to be his property. After perusing the Police Report and hearing the counsel for the claimants, the Magistrate directed the Forest' Range officer to keep the timber in his custody pending the further investigation by the Police. Respondent; No. 1 filed a Revision in the High Court against the said order of the Magistrate. The High Court did not grant stay of the order of the Magistrate. The High Court, however, observed that as the rainy season was approaching it was necessary that the timber should be removed from the place as early as possible. Thereafter, the Police officer submitted the final report stating that the earlier Police report was biased and that the appellants were the owners of the disputed timber arid that the timber might be released to them. On that the Magistrate passed an order directing that the timber should be returned to the appellants. The Magistrate also issued. a letter to the Forest Range officer directing him to hand over the seized timber to the appellants, urgently.
 Respondent No. 1 filed a contempt petition in the High Court against the appellants, as well as against the appellant in Appeal No. 118 of 1971, the Magistrate. The charge against the Magistrate was that he passed the second order without giving notice to respondent No. I and directed the Forest Range officer to release the timber urgently and thereby defeated whatever order the High Court might have finally passed in revision and that he permitted process of the court to be abused and that he impeded the course of justice. The Magistrate filed his affidavit and stated that the High Court had not stayed his order and that he ordered the delivery of the disputed timber in the bona fide discharge of his official duty after accepting in good faith the final report made by the Police in which it was indicated that its notice had been given to the complainant and a copy of such notice was also enclosed.
 The High Court did not find the appellants guilty of contempt. The High Court, however, found the Magistrate guilty of 'Criminal contempt' on the following grounds:
 
 1. The case between the parties had gained notoriety in the State and attracted a good deal of public attention.
 
 2. The certified copy of the order was taken only by appellant No. I, and since the case was not posted in the open court, appellant No. I must have shown the order to the Magistrate at a place other than the open court.
 
 3. The Magistrate passed the order in spite of the fact that he was aware that the revision application was pending in the High Court which was seized of the matter of determining the question of the custody of the timber.
 277 
 4. The Magistrate did not give notice to the other side before passing the A order. The procedure adopted by the Magistrate in writing the letter to the Forest Range officer asking him to release the timber urgently is very strange and reveals an anxiety on the part of the Magistrate to help the appellants. The urgency can only be to circumvent any possible orders of stay that might be passed by the High Court.
 In appeal filed by the Magistrate.

 HELD: (1) Section 2(c) of the Contempt of Courts Act 1971 codifies the definition of criminal contempt which had previously been crystallized by judicial decisions. The broad test to be applied in such cases is whether the act complained of was calculated to obstruct or had an intrinsic tendency to interfere with the course of justice and the due administration of law. The standard of proof required to establish a charge of criminal contempt is the same as in any other criminal proceeding. It is all the more necessary to insist on strict proof of such charge when the act or omission complained of is committed by the respondent under colour of his office as a Judicial officer. Wrong order or usurpation of jurisdiction by a Judicial officer owing to an error of judgment or to a misapprehension of the legal position, does not fall within the mischief of 'criminal contempt'. Human judgment is fallible and a judicial officer is no exception. Consequently, so long as a Judicial officer in the discharge of his official duties acts in good faith and without any motive to defeat, obstruct or interfere with the due course of justice, the court will not, as a rule, punish him for a criminal contempt. Even if it could be urged that mens rea as such is not an indispensable ingredient of the offense of contempt, the courts are loath to punish a condemner if the act or omission complained of was not willful.

 cited with approval.) (2) The main ground which influenced the High Court was that the case '` had gained certain amount of notoriety.
 This was a very vague, indefinite and nebulous circumstance.
 In the instant case, the prejudice generated by this creeping circumstance has unmistakably vitiated the approach of the High Court. 1284 C-D] (3) The explanation given by the Magistrate was at least sufficient to dispel the suspicion that the Magistrate while passing the order was actuated by a motive to impede or obstruct or defeat the course of justice. It was immaterial as to who showed the certified copy of the order of the High Court to the Magistrate. On reading the final report of the Police and the order of the High Court the Magistrate mist have honestly formed the opinion that there was no need to give the notice to the other party and that it was necessary to direct the Poorest officer to deliver the timber urgently to the appellants. It is true that under the circumstances, the prudent course for the Magistrate would have been to postpone the making of any final order in regard to the delivery of the timber till the final disposal of the revision petition by the High Court. It would have been also proper for him to have given opportunity of being heard to the other side before making any order.
 Nevertheless it was evident from the stark circumstances of the case, that in failing to do so, the Magistrate was not actuated by any improper motive or deliberate design to impede, obstruct or interfere with the course of justice or to circumvent or defeat the proceedings in the Revision pending before the High Court. Consequently the penal action taken by the High Court was not justified. [284 H, 285A, B, F, 286A-D]
