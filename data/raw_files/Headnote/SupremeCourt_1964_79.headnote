 The system prevailing in the State of Rajasthan for the purpose of promotion of head-constable to the post of Sub- Inspectors of Police was challenged as violative of Arts. 14 and 16(1) of the Constitution. The petitioner, who was promoted to the rank of Sub-Inspector of Police from the rank of head constable, was reverted when a permanent ;Sub- Inspector returned to the range as he was the junior most approved headconstable in that range, though in other ranges of the State there were many approved head-constables who were junior to him but they continued to officiate as Sub- Inspectors. The petitioners grievance was that if the whole State had been treated as one unit for purpose of promotion to and reversion from the rank of Sub-Inspectors, the petitioner would not have been reverted. He contended, inter alia, that the whole police force being one, the practice of promotion of head-constables to officiate as Sub-Inspectors rangewise amounted to denial of equal opportunity before the law and was hit by Arts. 14 and 16 of the Constitution; and that the practice of confining pro- motions and reversions to officers serving at a particular point of time in one particular range and at the same time making inter-range transfers freely and frequently and as a matter of official routine was bound to produce serious in- equalities in promotions and reversions and also very hapha- zard changes in seniority amongst the officers inter se.
 Held:.....(i) The system of giving promotions as evolved in the State cannot be struck down as denying equality before the law or denying equality in the matter of employment in public service, on the ground that the police force being deemed one for the whole State, promotion throughout from constable upwards should be on the basis of the whole State or simply on the ground of possible cases of hardship. The system has been evolved for the efficiency of the police in the State as well as for administrative convenience.
 (ii).If there is wholesale abuse of the power of transfer by the Inspector-General of Police, (for he alone can transfer Sub-Inspectors from one range to another), a case of glaring denial of equality before the law or glaring denial of equal opportunity for employment in the service of the State may arise. But a system like this cannot be struck down on the.
 ground that it may be abused. In case of abuse in this wholesale manner a case may arise for striking down the abuse and not the system.
 (iii).....In the face of Government Order of March 1955, directing not to ordinarily transfer officers drawing less than 229 Rs. 250/- p.m. outside their home district, it cannot be accepted that free and frequent transfers are made as a matter of routine by the Inspector-General of Police in violation thereof. Further the material that has been placed on the record by the petitioner is insufficient to come to the conclusion that along with this system of promotion, there is also a pracice of free and frequent transfers in Rajasthan as a matter of routine of Sub- Inspectors from one range to another.
