 The petitioner, who was an unsuccessful applicant for a seat in one of the medical colleges in the respondent-State challenged the selections made by a writ petition in this Court. This Court came to the conclusion that the selections made were invalid, but did not strike them down, and instead, directed the State to constitute a separate expert Committee for making selections to the unfilled seats. The Court further directed that the Committee should interview only the candidates shown in the waiting list and those who moved unsuccessfully the High Court and this Court. This Court observed that the 75 marks allocated for interview should be divided equally among the five different beads with respect to which the marks should be given at the interview.
 In pursuance of the direction the State constituted a Selection Committee. The Committee called for interview several other candidates besides those asked to be interviewed by this Court, though the Committee refrained from interviewing such additional candidates. The Selection Committee also distributed the 75 interview marks, among the five heads not equally but according to its own discretion.
 Candidates were selected for all the unfilled seats but the petitioner was not selected. He challenged the selection on the grounds that : (1) the Selection Committee showed open hostility to him at the interview, (2) the violation of the directions of this Court showed malafides, and (3) those illegalities vitiated the selection made.
 
 HELD : (1) The Selection Committee denied that they had exhibited any hostility towards the petitioner. The charge of malafides has to be established by the petitioner by satisfactory evidence, and the fact that the petitioner could not get any outside evidence to establish what happened at the interview cannot shift the burden that is on him. [451 F-H] (2) The Selection Committee explained that they called additional candidates for interview because they did not understand the scope of the judgment of this Court, and that they distributed the 75 marks in their dicretion because there was no specific direction in the operative portion of the judgment of this Court to distribute them equally.
 Though the explanation was not satisfactory, it could not be said that the Committee had acted mala fide. [452 B-C; 453 E-F] (3) The interview rules were made by Government and Government alone could have distributed the marks amongst the various heads. In the absence of such a distribution' it should be deemed that each one of the heads carried equal marks. Therefore, the procedure adopted by the Committee was illegal and contrary to the directions of this Court and was likely to have affected the result of the interview.
 [453 F-G] 450 Moreover, the Moreover the Committee even on the basis adopted by it, had proceeded on wholly wrong premises while granting marks to the petitioner under the head 'National Cadet Corps activities'. [455 F-G] Therefore, the selections made could not be sustained.
