 Certain workmen of the appellant resorted to "go slow". The appellant held, a domestic enquiry and as a result thereof decided to dismiss 21 workmen. After considerable delay it made an application under s. 33 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, for permission to dismiss these workmen.
 Evidence was led before the Tribunal to prove the charge against the workmen. The Tribunal held that the domestic enquiry was not proper, that the appellant was guilty of mala fide conduct and victimisation, that, except in the case of one workmen, the others were not guilty of any deliberate go slow and accordingly granted permission in respect of the one workman alone. The appellant contended that the finding that the remaining 20 workmen were not guilty of deliberate go slow was perverse and that the finding in respect of mala fides and victimisation was arbitrary and erroneous. The workmen contended that once the domestic enquiry was found to be improper the Tribunal had to dismiss the application and it could not take independent evidence and arrive at a finding of its own as to the guilt of the workmen.
 Held, that in an application under s. 33 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, when there has been no domestic enquiry or when the domestic enquiry has not been properly conducted it is the duty of the Tribunal to take evidence of both sides and to decide whether the alleged misconduct has been made out. The evidence produced before the Tribunal clearly established that 13 out of the 20 workmen were guilty of deliberate go slow. Go slow was a pernicious and dishonest practice which was a misconduct punishable with dismissal under the standing orders. Actual participation in go slow was serious misconduct and the management could not reasonably be accused of mala fides or revengefulness if it proposed punishment of dismissal for such conduct. There was delay in holding the domestic enquiry and the management showed lamentable callousness in this matter. In cases of this nature the enquiry should be held as early as possible, specially when the workmen arc put under suspension. Again, there was delay in making the application for permission to 685 dismiss. But these delays did not show that the management was guilty of mala fides or of an intention to victimise.
 The order of the Tribunal refusing permission to dismiss 13 of the workmen was entirely wrong and unjust and could not be allowed to stand.
