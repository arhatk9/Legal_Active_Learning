 Under s. 6 of Ordinance 12 of 1949, the Deputy Custodian of Evacuee notified certain property to be evacuee property in October 1949. No claim was preferred by any one in pursuance of the notification and the Central Government acquired the property under the Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act, 1954 and put it up for sale by Public auction in 1957. The predecessor in title of the appellants purchased the property. In 1961, the State of Uttar Pradesh applied under s. 27 of the-Administration of Evacuee Property Act, 1950, invoking the revisional jurisdiction of the Custodian-General, claiming that the property belonged to the State and not to the evacuee and that therefore, the Deputy Custodian had no power to declare it as evacuee property. The Custodian General upheld the plea of the State.
 In appeal to this Court, the jurisdiction of the Custodian- General to entertan the petition was questioned.
 
HELD : (1) The Custodian-General had the power to entertain the revision application filed. by the State.
 By Ordinance 27 of 1949, which repealed Ordinance 12 of 1949, a Proceeding commenced or anything done or action taken under the earlier Ordinance was to be deemed a proceeding commenced, thing done and action taken under the later Ordinance, as if it were in force on the date on which the proceeding was commenced, thing was done or action was taken. Sec. 58(3) of the Administration of Evacuee Property Act, which repealed Ordinance 27 of 1949, contained a similar deeming provision that anything done or action taken in exercise of the power conferred under Ordinance 27 of 1949 is to be deemed to have been done or taken in exercise of the power conferred by or under the Act, as if the Act were in force on the day on which such thing was done or action was taken. By this chain of fictions, things done and actions taken under Ordinance 12 of 1949 are to be deemed to have been done or taken in exercise of the powers conferred under the Act, as if the Act were in force on the day on which such thing was done or action was taken. [164 B-E] By the first part of s. 58(3) of the Act, the previous operation of repealed status services the repeal. Thereby matters and transactions past and closed remain operative.
 But the saving of the previous operation of the repealed law is not be read, as saving the future operation of the previous law. The previous law stands repealed and it has not for the future the practical operation as is prescribed by s. 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897. The rule contained in s. of the General Clauses Act applies only if a different intention does not appear and by enacting 159 s. 58(3) of the Administration of Evacuee Property Act Parliament has expressed a different intention. Under s.
 58(3), all things done and actions taken under the repealed statute are deemed to be done or taken in exercise of the powers conferred by or under the repealing Act, as if that Act were in force on the day on which the thing was done or action was taken. [168 C; 167 H; 168 B] The order made by the Deputy Custodian was declared final by s. 30(6) of Ordinance 12 of 1949. If fictionally the order is deemed to have been passed under the Administration of Evacuee Property Act, as if the Act were in operation in October, 1949, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the order would be subject to the appellate and revisional jurisdiction of the authorities who have the appellate or revisional power by virtue of the provisions conferring those powers and which must also be deemed to have been in force on the date when the impugned order was passed. The use of the expression "subject thereto" in s. 58(3) cannot attribute to the previous operation of the repealed statute an overriding effect so as to deprive the authorities constituted under the repealing Act of their power to entertain appeals or revision applications, which they possess by the express enactment. [169 A-C; 168 F] Indira Sohanlal v. Custodian of Evacuee Property, [1955] INSC 57; [1955] 2 S.C.R. 1117 and Dafidar Niranjan Singh v. Custodian Evacuee Property, [1961] INSC 83; [1962] 1 S.C.R. 214, explained.
 (ii) The procedure followed by the Custodian-General was however open to grave objection, because, he relied upon copies of documents on which the title of the State was founded without giving an opportunity to the appellants to lead evidence in rejoinder, and therefore the order of the Custodian-General should be set aside and the matter remanded to him for fresh disposal according to law.
