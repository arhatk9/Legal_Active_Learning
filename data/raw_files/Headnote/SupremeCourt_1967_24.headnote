 Respondent No. 1, a Society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, took to lease a piece of land part of which was already leased to Respondents 2 and 3. Under the lease Respondent No.1 was entitled to receive rent from Respondents 2 and 3. The latter transferred the land held by them to the appellant. Respondent No.1 thereupon filed an application claiming the right of transfer under s. 24 of the West Bengal Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1949. The trial Court and the appellate court dismissed the application but the High Court, in revision, allowed it. By special leave, the appellant came to this Court. It was urged on behalf of the appellant : (i) that the terms of s.
 24 of the aforesaid Tenancy Act were not satisfied in the case, (ii) that s. 24 was ultra vires as the right of transfer therein was based solely on the ground of vicinage and created an unreasonable restriction on the guaranteed right of the appellant and respondents Nos. 2 and 3 under s.
 19(1) (f) of the Constitution and (iii) that Respondent No.
 1 being only entitled to receive rent from respondents 2 and 3 was an "intermediary" within the meaning of the West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act and therefore all its rights vested under the Act in the State of West Bengal.
 
HELD: (i) The Society was the immediate landlord of the land in dispute. The said land was contiguous to the other land in its actual possession, and was bona fide required by it for the expansion of its educational institution. The purpose for which it was required was covered by cls. (b) and (c) of s. 4 of the Tenancy Act. The terms of s. 24 of the Act were therefore fully satisfied in the case. [562 B- E] (ii) The. object of s. 24 is to have an adjustment of the rights of landlords and tenants. The consideration of the land being contiguous is not the sole consideration. The principle of Bhau Ram v. B. Raijnath Singh's ease is not therefore attracted. The restriction contained in s. 24 cannot by any means be treated as an unreasonable restriction,, [565 D] Bhau Ram v. Baijnath Singh, [1962] Supp. 3 S.C.R. 724, distinguished.
 Ram Sarup v. Munshi, [1963] a S.C.R. 858, relied on.
 (iii) Being itself a non-agricultural tenant the 1st respondent was excluded from the definition of "intermediary" by the terms of S. 2(1)(i) of the Estates Acquisition Act. [563 D-E]
