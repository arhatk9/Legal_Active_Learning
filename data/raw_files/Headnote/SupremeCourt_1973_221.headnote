 Upon the death of an applicant for a stage carriage permit under Chap. IV of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, before his application bad been considered by Regional Transport Authority, the heirs or legal representatives of the applicant do not have the right to step into the shoes of the deceased applicant and prosecute the application filed by him.
 Section 61 of the Act, deals with cases in which a transfer of the permit held can be applied for. If it was the intention of the legislature to provide for succession to whatever claims an applicant for a permit has even before a permit is granted to him, it would have similarly provided for such a situation. But neither the Motor Vehicles Act nor the Rules made thereunder provide for the substitution of heirs to prosecute the application of a deceased applicant for a permit. An application for a permit, gives only the right that the merits of the applicant should be considered vis-a-vis other applicants. These merits depend on the peculiar position, capabilities and qualifications of the applicant which may be either personal or peculiarly or particularly those of a concern or organisation. It is not necessary that an heir or successor of an applicant will also have the applicant's qualifications or capabilities with regard to a transport service for the benefit of the public.
