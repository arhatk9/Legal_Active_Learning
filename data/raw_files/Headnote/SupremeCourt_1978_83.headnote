 The assessee company carries on the business of generation and distribution of electricity at Cambay and as such is covered by the provisions of Section 80E(1) and is entitled to claim the deduction contemplated by the said provision.
 During the accounting period which ended on March. 31, 1967 i.e. assessment year 1967-68, the assessee Company earned an income of Rs. 46,319/- from its business. The assessee company had sold some of its old machinery and buildings resulting in balancing charges contemplated by section 41(2) which worked out to Rs. 7,55,807/-. There were unabsorbed depreciation of Rs. 1,42,955/- and unabsorbed development rebate of Rs. 1,11,658/aggregating to Rs. 2,54,613/- of the earlier years which were required to be set off against the profits of that period. The Income Tax Officer, while com- pleting the assessment treated the item of Rs. 7,55,807/- as profits attributable to the business of generation and distribution of electricity and allowed deduction at 8% thereon under Section 80E(1). The Income Tax Officer, thus computed the relief/deduction admissible to the assessee under section 80E(1) at 8% on the amount of Rs. 8,02,126/- (46,319+7,55,807), that is to say, on the income without adjusting or setting off the unabsorbed depreciation and development rebate carried forward from the earlier year.
 In exercise of his revisional powers under section 263 of the Act, the Additional Commissioner of Income Tax called for examined the records and took the view that the manner of computing the deduction admissible to the assessee under Section 80E(1) was erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue, in that the deduction of 8% on the item of profit of Rs. 7,55,807 arising under Section 41(2) had been wrongly allowed and that for the purpose of calculating the deduction of 8%, the items in respect of the unabsorbed depreciation and development rebate should not have been excluded and that, if proper calculations as suggested by him were made, the assessee was not entitled to any deduction. In the appeal, the Tribunal took the view that the item of Rs. 7,55,807 being profits arising from the sale of old machinery and buildings under S. 41(2) of the Act, could not be treated in isolation or divorced from the profits and gains of the business of generation and distribution of electricity done by the assessee-company and that the said item will have to be regarded as profits ,.attributable to", though not "derived from" the business of generation and distribution of electricity and, as such, the said item was exigible to the deduction of 8% under Section 80E(1) of the Act. On the question whether the unabsorbed depreciation and development rebate would be deductible in computing the profits under Section 80E of the Act, following 93 ITR, 115, the Tribunal held that these items could not be deducted in computing the deduction admissible under Section 80E. The Tribunal allowed the appeal and set aside the orders of the Additional Commissioner.
 By its judgment, dated 11th and 24th of December 1975 disposing of the Reference, the Gujarat High Court upheld the view of the Tribunal regarding the item of Rs.
 7,55,807/- and answered in favour of the assessee. As to the items of unabsorbed depreciation and development rebate, the High Court held that they were deductible before arriving at the figure that would be exigible to the deduction of 8% under Section 80E(1) and, therefore, after deducting the aggregate amount of Rs. 2,54,613 from Rs.
 8,02.126, the balance of Rs. 547,513 was exigible to the deduction of 8% under the said provision.
 661 Both the assessee and the Revenue preferred separate appeals against the said judgment.
 Dismissing both the appeals, the Court 
HELD : 1. (a) On true construction of the provision itself, both the Tribunal and the High Court were right in taking the view that the item of Rs. 7,55,807 was required to be taken into account while computing the deduction of 8% contemplated by S. 80E(1) of the Act. [668 A] (b) Three important steps are required to be taken before the special deduction permissible under section 80E(1) of Income Tax Act, is allowed and the net total income exigible to tax is determined. First, compute the total income of the concerned assessee in accordance with the other provisions of the Act i.e., in accordance with all the provisions except Sec. 80E; secondly, ascertain what part of the total income so computed represents the profits and gains attributable to the business of the specified industry (here generation and distribution of electricity); and thirdly, if there be profits and gains so attributable, deduct 8% thereof from such profits and gains and then arrive at the net total income exigible to tax. As regards the first step mentioned above, the important words in sub- s. 1 are those that appear in parenthesis, namely, "as computed in accordance with the other provisions of this Act", and these words clearly contain a mandate that the total income of the concerned assessee must be computed in accordance with the other provisions of the Act without reference to S. 80E and since in the instant case it is income from business the same as per s. 29 will have to be computed in accordance with Ss. 30 to 43A which would include s. 41 (2). It is also clear that under the second step the profits and gains attributable to the business of the specified industry (here generation and distribution of electricity) forms a component of the total income spoken of in the first step. Reading these two steps together, therefore, it is obvious that in computing the total income of the concerned assessee the balancing charge arising as a result of the sale of old machinery and buildings and worked out as per s. 41(2), irrespective of its real character, will have to be taken into account and included as income of the business. In other words, the balancing charge as worked out under s. 41(2) will have to be taken into account before computing the deduction of 8% under the third step.
 On proper construction of sub-s. (1) and having regard to the legislative mandate contained in the three steps that are required to be taken in the manner indicated above, it is clear that the item of Rs. 7,55,807/- will have to be taken into account before computing the 8% deduction contemplated by the said provision.

Express Newspaper Ltd., (1964) 53 I.T.R. 250; discussed.
 (c) It is true that by legal fiction created under S. 41(2) a balancing charge arising from sale of old machinery or building is treated as deemed income and the same is brought to tax; in other words the legal fiction enables the Revenue to take back what it had given by way of depreciation allowance in the preceding years since what was given in the preceding years was in excess of that which ought to have been given. This shows that the fiction has been created for the purpose of computation of the assessable income of the assessee under the head 'business Income'. [669A-B] (d) Legal fictions are created only for a definite purpose and they should be limited to the purpose for which they are created and should not be extended beyond their legitimate field. The fiction under s. 41(2) is created' for the purpose of computation of assessable income of the assessee under the head "business income" and under s. 80E(1), in order to compute and allow the permissible special deduction, computation of total income in accordance with the other provisions of the Act is required to be done and after allowing such deduction the net assessable income chargeable to tax is to be determined, in other words, the legal fiction under S. 41(2) and the grant of special deduction in case of specified industries are so closely connected with each other that 662 taking into account the balancing charge (i.e. deemed profits) before computing 8% deduction under S. 80E(1) would amount to extending the legal fiction within the limits of the purpose for which the said fiction had been created.
 [669 B-E] (e) Whenever the Legislature wanted to give a restricted meaning it has used the expression "derived from", as for instance in S. 80J. Since the expression of wider import, namely, "attributable to" has been used, the legislature intended to cover receipts from sources other than the actual conduct of the business of generation and distribution of electricity. [669 G-H] 
2. (a) The High Court was right in deducting unabsorbed depreciation and development rebate aggregating to Rs.
 2,54,613 from Rs. 8,02,126 and holding the balance of Rs.
 5,47,513/- being exigible to the 8% deduction. [670 E] (b) Having regard to the construction placed on sub-s. (1) of Section 80E as above it is obvious that, in computing the total income of the concerned assessee items of unabsorbed depreciation and unabsorbed development rebate will have to be deducted before arriving at the figure that will become exigible to the deduction of 8% contemplated by s. 80E(1) [670D-E] (c) In sub-s. (1) of S. 80E the expression "total income" is followed by the words "as computed in accordance with the other provisions of this Act" in parenthesis and the mandate of these words clearly negatives the argument that the expression "total income" has been used in the sense of commercial profits. The expression "total income" has been defined in s. 2(45) of the Act as meaning "the total amount of income referred to in Section 5, computed in the manner laid down in this Act" and when this definition has been furnished by the Act itself the expression as appearing in S. 80E(1) must be in the absence of anything in the context suggesting to the contrary be construed in accordance with such definition. Since the words in the parenthesis occurring in sub-s. (1) lay down the manner in which the total income of the concerned assessee is to be computed there would be no scope for excluding items like unabsorbed depreciation and unabsorbed development rebate while computing the total income on the basis that the total income spoken of by sub-s. (1) means commercial profits.
 [670 G-H, 671 A-B] 
3. S. 72(1) has a direct impact upon the computation under the head 'profits and gains' of business or profession. In other words, the correct figure of total income, which is otherwise as taxable under other provisions of the Act, cannot be arrived at without working out the net result of computation under the head 'profits and gains' of business or profession. The question whether special benefit under s. 80E as well as the normal or usual benefit of carry forward of losses of previous years should both be available to an assessee without one impinging on the other must depend upon the intention of the Legislature and such intention has to be gathered from the language employed. In this view of the matter it is extremely doubtful, whether in spite of the legislative mandate contained in the three steps provided by sub-s. (1) of s. 80E, carried forward losses would not be deductible before working out the 8% deduction contemplated by s. 80E and, therefore, the contention that by parity of reasoning or on a priori reasoning unabsorbed development rebate and unabsorbed depreciation should be held to be lion-deductible before working out the 8% deduction under s. 80E(1) cannot be accepted. On proper construction of the provisions contained in sub-s. (1) of a. 80E item like unabsorbed depreciation and absorbed development rebate will have to be deducted in arriving at the figure which would be exigible to deduction of 8% under 80E(1).
