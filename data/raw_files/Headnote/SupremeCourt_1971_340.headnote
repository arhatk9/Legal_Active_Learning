 In a Taluka Panchayat election in 1968, Respt. No. 1 was elected as a member and he was elected president of the Taluka Panchayat. Thereupon, he became ex-officio member of the Surat district Panchayat under S. 15(i)(A)(i) of the Gujarat Panchayats Act 1961. He was ultimately elected President of the Surat District Panchayat. He ceased to hold his office of President of the Taluka Panchayat. The district in question consists of several Talukas; one of such Talukas was called 'C' Taluka for which a Taluka Panchayat was constituted under the provisions of the Panchayat Act. Two areas known as 'R' & 'A' were subject to the authority of the District Panchayat and the 'C' Taluka Panchayat 'R' had a Nagar Panchayat and 'A' bad a Gram Panchayat. In 1970, the State Govt. by a notification under S. 3(3),of the Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporations Act, 1949, included the local areas of 'R' & 'A' within the limits of the Surat Municipal Corporation and by this notification, it was declared that the local area of 'R' shall cease to be a Nagar and that of 'A' shall cease to be a Gram. The result was that 'R' & 'A' stood excluded from the limits of 'C' Taluka Panchayat & the Surat District Pan- chayat from January 1971 with a direction that the members of the dissolved Panchayat shall vacate offices and that the Taluka & the District Panchayat shall be reconstituted with members specified in clause 3 of the order read with Schedule 1 and 2. Respondent No. 1 having ceased to hold office as President of the Taluka Panchayat when he was elected Is President of the District Panchayat, could not act as an ex-officio member of reconstituted Surat District Panchayat because he had ceased to be an ex-officio member as such. He was not an elected member of the Surat District Panchayat and was rot appointed a member under S.
 310A (2) (b) of the Panchayat Act. He, therefore, ceased to be a member of the Surat District Panchayat as reconstituted. This led to the cessation of his holding the 'office of the President of that Panchayat. He filed a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution challenging the validity of the order of dissolution and reconstitution made by the Development Commissioner. The High Court allowed the petition on the ground that by reason of' the exception contained in S, 310A(10) of the Panchayats Act. Commissioner had no power to dissolve the panchayat Sub-s. (i) of that section. On appeal the question arose provisions of S.
 310A(10) would apply to the Municipal which had been converted into a city with effect from 
HELD : (i) The Appellant had no right to dissolve the 'C' Taluka Panchayat under sub-S. (1) because S. 310A(10) of the Panchayat Act provides that nothing in the foregoing provisions of the section shall apply or shall be deemed ever to have applied to the alteration of the limits of a district or a taluka by reason of the inclusion in or exclusion from the district taluka of any area as a result of the alteration of the 687 limits of a municipal borough or conversion of a municipal borough into a Gram or Nagar or the establishment of or the alteration of the limits of a contonement. [693 F] (ii) The Municipal borough under Sec. 310(10) of the panchayat Act, would have the meaning of the word 'City' within the meaning of para 1 of Appendix IV of the Corporation Act. Therefore when the 'C' Taluka Panchayat was included into the Municipal borough of Surat which was declared as a city, Sub section (1) of Section 310(A) will have no application. [692 H] (iii) In the matter of interpretation of enactment which are in force in a particular state, this Court generally attaches a good deal of value to the views of the High Court of that State, particularly, when they have been fully considered by it, because that Court is expected to be sufficiently conversant with the provisions of the various local enactment.
