 Eight accused including the five appellants in this appeal were charged and tried for various offences punishable under the Penal Code, for rioting being armed with deadly weapons and for causing the death of one Pakhar Singh by inflicting grievous hurt and simple hurt to Pritam Kaur (PW-3), his wife. The case of the prosecution as to the motive was that Pakhar Singh, the deceased file(l on 28-10- 69 a declaratory suit claiming certain lands as his, while his sister also claimed the said lands as hers and; that on the date of the incident the suit was pending and an interim order was passed to the effect that the parties had agreed in respect of the question of possession that status quo will be maintained; and that an exparte injunction was issued in favour of the deceased; that the accused by the strength of numbers wanted to conclude the litigation by taking forcible possession and therefore with weapons hidden in the field caused grievous injuries to Pakhar Singh out of which injury No. I was opined by the doctor as sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. The Additional Sessions Judge, Patiala found the accused not guilty of the various offences and acquitted them all. But the High Court in appeal by the State against the acquittal maintained the acquittal in respect of three accused but reversed the order of acquittal of the appellants and convicted them under s.
 302/149, 325/149, 323/149 and IPC and sentenced them to imprisonment for life and a fine of Rs. 1,000/- each for an offence under s. 302/149. They were also sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 2 years, 1 year and six months for the offences under s. 325/149, 148 and 323/149 respectively.
 Hence the statutory appeal under s. 2(a) of the Supreme Court (Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction), Act 1970.
 Allowing the appeal partly the Court ^ 
 HELD: (1) By s. 2(a) of the Supreme Court (Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction) Act, 1970 any accused who has been acquitted by the trial court, but, on appeal by the State convicted and sentenced by the High Court, as specified in the section is entitled, as of right, to appeal to the Supreme Court. As a Court of appeal, the Supreme Court has got to go into all the questions of fact and law and decide the case on its merits. The question, therefore, whether the High Court rightly interfered on sufficient grounds or 528 not in a State appeal against acquittal will not be material. A right of appeal has been provided under s. 2(a) of the Act and this Court has to decide the case on its merits. The decisions regarding the scope of appeal against an acquittal the powers of the High Court to interfere in an appeal against acquittal by the State, which may be relevant when the Supreme Court is acting under Art. 136 are not material in deciding an appeal by person whose acquittal has been set aside by the High Court and who is entitled to prefer an appeal to the Supreme Court. [537 B-E] (2) Though the Court would be entitled, on the material on record to decide whether the question of right of private defence has been established or not it is the duty of the defence to make the necessary material available. [535 B-CI In the instant case, the plea of right of private defence of property has to be negatived since the accused failed to produce any order vacating the stay (as claimed by them) or any record to show that they had raised the wheat crop. This circumstance and Ex..PE & PF extracts of Khasra Girdwari also probabilise the prosecution case. Three were 8 persons on the field harvesting the crop and having the necessary weapons to repel any protest by the deceased. If the accused were in possession, it is most unlikely that the deceased and his wife alone would go into the field to disturb the possession. [534 F, 535 C-D] (a) In determining what offences any accused is guilty of it is necessary to consider the injuries that were inflicted on the deceased. The doctor who con ducted the autopsy found that the deceased had 8 injuries. According to the doctor injury no. I was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death and injuries 2 to 8 could not collectively normally cause the death of Pakhar Singh.
 Whoever caused injury No. 1 would be guilty of an offence punishable under s. 302. [535 G, H, 536 A, B, C] (b) In the background of the incident and all other circumstances it is clear that the common object of the unlawful assembly was to cause grievous hurt with dangerous weapons, an offence punishable under s. 326 IPC only. [536 D,F] (c) None of the appellants have been specifically charged for an offence punishable under s. 302 and it cannot be held that they are guilty of causing the injury which is "sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death". The injury was not caused in prosecution of the common object of the assembly or that the members of the assembly knew it likely to be caused in prosecution of the common object. [536 E-F] (d) The prosecution has proved the case beyond all reasonable doubt and the eye witnesses were natural witnesses and their testimony is acceptable. [534 B] OBSERVATlONS:
 The Court set aside the conviction and sentences under s. 323/149 and in lieu of the conviction and sentence under s. 302/149 convicted them under Section 326 r/w S. 149 and sentenced the appellants to 7 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1,000/- each. The conviction and sentence under the counts under Section 325 r/w S. 149 and under S.
 148 were, however, main tained.l 529
