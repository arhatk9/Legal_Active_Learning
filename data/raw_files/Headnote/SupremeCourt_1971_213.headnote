 Section 10A of the Excess Profits Act, 1940, deals with transactions designed to avoid or reduce liability to excess profits tax and empowers the Excess Profits Tax Officer to make appropriate adjustments as respects liability to excess profits tax. But before any action can be taken under the section, there should be pending a proceeding for assessment or reassessment of excess profits tax. Under s. 15, if in consequence of definite information which has come into his possession, the Excess Profits Tax Officer discovers that the profits of any chargeable accounting period have escaped assessment, he may serve a notice on the assessee and proceed to assess the profits liable to excess profits tax.
 In the present case, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, in appeal from the Income-tax officer order, stated that there was a partial partition in the family of one of the partners of the assessee. On the basis of that order, the Excess Profits Tax Officer started proceedings under s. 1OA.
 He issued notices to the assessee under both ss. 15 and 10A on the same-day, but the notice under s. 15 was ordered to be issued first. After considering the reply of the assessee the Excess Profits Tax Officer passed an order under s. 15 modifying the original assessment.
 On the questions : (1) whether the Excess Profits Tax Officer was competent to apply the provisions of s. 10A and make the revised assessment under s. 15, and (2) whether there was any definite information by virtue of which the Excess Profits Tax Officer was competent to reopen the original assessment..
 
HELD : (1) Though the notices under ss. 15 and 10A were issued on the same date, the requirements of law were satisfied, because, the Excess Profits Tax Officer had initiated proceedings under s. 15, before issuing notice under s. 10A by ordering the notice under s. 15 to be issued first. The assessee also did not take any objection in his reply to the notice under s. 10A that the notice under s. 15 had not been issued before the notice under s. 10A was issued. [365 F; 366 B-C] (2)The information which came into the possession of the Excess ProfitsTax Officer of partial partition having been effected was relevant for thepurpose of s. 15 and once he had initiated proceedings under that section, he was competent and had jurisdiction to examine for the purpose of s. 10A whether partial partition had been effected for avoidance or reduction of liability to excess profits. [367 B-C] (a)The Appellate Assistant Commissioner in the proceedings relating to the assessment of income tax of the assessee had stated the fact of partial partition which was certainly information which came into the possession of the Excess Profits Tax Officer. It was information received from the decision of superior authorities and not a mere change of opinion by himself. [366 F-G] 358 (b)The proceedings before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner related only to assessment of income tax.
 Therefore, it could not be said, that because he did not consider whether the object of the partition was to reduce liability to excess profits, there was no escapement for purposes of excess profits tax. [367 A] Bansilal v. C.I.T., M.P., 70 I.T.R. 74 (S.C.) and Asstt.
