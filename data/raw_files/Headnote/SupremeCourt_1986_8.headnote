 The Haryana Rural Development Fund Act, 1983 by section 3 provides that there shall be levied on the dealer for the purposes of the Act, a cess, on ad valorem basis, at the rate of one per centum of the sale proceeds of agricultural produce bought or sold or brought for processing in the notified market area. The dealer is, in his turn, entitled to pass on the burden of the cess paid by him to the next purchaser of the agricultural produce from him. Section 4(1) of the Act provides for the creation of a fund called the Haryana Rural Development Fund (hereinafter referred to as 'the fund') which is vested in the State Government. Sub- section (3) of section 4 of the Act provides that the amount of cess shall be credited to the Fund within such period as may be prescribed. Sub-section (5) of section 4 of the Act states that the Fund shall be applied by the State Government to meet the expenditure incurred in the rural areas, in connection with the development of roads, hospitals, means of communication, water-supply, sanitation facilities and for the welfare of agricultural labour or for any other scheme approved by the State Government for the development of the rural areas. The expression 'rural areas' has been defined in section 2(h) of the Act as an area the population of which does not exceed 20,000 persons.
 The appellants, who are dealers in agricultural produce carrying on business in certain notified market areas, questioned the validity of the Act before the High Court of 150 Punjab & Haryana. The learned single judge found that the Act was unconstitutional and struck it down. Aggrieved by the decision of the learned single judge, the State of Haryana filed a Letters Patent Appeal before the Division Bench of the High Court. The Division Bench allowed the appeal, set aside the judgment of the learned single judge and upheld the constitutional validity of the Act, on the ground that it was in the nature of a fee and, therefore, it could be levied as a fee imposed on dealers carrying on business within market area for services rendered to them by the State Government. Hence these appeals by Special Leave.
 It was contended on behalf of the appellants that the cess levied under the Act was in the nature of a tax and it did not fall under any of the Entries in List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution under which the State Legislature could levy a tax. On the other hand, counsel for the respondent-State argued (i) that it was in the nature of a fee and it was not necessary that there should be a direct correlation between the levy and the services to be rendered and that such correlation could be of "general character and not of mathematical exactitude"; (ii) that there was a reciprocal relationship between the levy of the fee and the services that were being rendered and (iii) that the impugned legislation had been enacted to fulfill the objectives contained in Articles 46,47,48 and 48A of the Constitution and the majority of dealers were directly benefited by the objects on which the amount collected as cess was spent.
 Allowing the appeals, ^ 
 HELD: l.(i) The Haryana Rural Development Fund Act, 1983 is unconstitutional, since the State Legislature was not competent to enact it. The judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court is set aside and the Act is declared void. [163 D-E] 1(ii) It is constitutionally impermissible for any State Government to collect any amount which is not strictly of the nature of a fee in the guise of a fee. If in the guise of a fee the legislation imposes a tax it is for the court on a scrutiny of the scheme of the levy to determine its real character. If on a true analysis of the provisions levying the amount, the court comes to the conclusion that it is, in fact, in the nature of a tax and not a fee, its validity can be justified only by bringing it under any one of the Entries 151 in List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution under which the State can levy a tax. [163 B-C] In the instant case, the State Government has failed to do so. The levy is not a fee as claimed by the State but it is a tax not leviable by it. The levy of the cess under section 3 is, therefore, liable to be quashed. Section 3 being the charging section and the rest of the sections of the Act being just machinery or incidental provisions, the whole Act is liable to be quashed. [163 C-D] l(iii) The fact that the Act is claimed to have been enacted pursuant to the Directive Principles of State Policy contained in Articles 46,47,48 and 48A of the Constitution and that the dealers are permitted by the Act to pass on the cess to the purchasers of the Agricultural produce from them have no bearing on the question involved here. [158 A-B] 
 2. The distinction between a tax and a fee is recognised by the constitution. In determining a levy as a fee the true test must be whether its primary and essential purpose is to render specific services to a specified area or class, it being of no consequence that the State may ultimately and indirectly be benefited by it Entry 66 empowers the State to levy fees in respect of any of the matters in List II. It is no doubt true that under Entry 66 of the List II it is permissible for the State to levy any amount by way of fees in respect of any of the matters in that List. The relevant Entry in the present case is entry 28 dealing with Markets and Fairs' but the amount so levied should be truly a fee and not a tax with the mask of a fee.
 The primary meaning of taxation is raising money for purposes of Government by means of contributions from individual persons, a compulsory exaction of money by a public authority for public purposes enforceable at law and not a payment for services rendered.

 In the instant case, the Fund, vests in the State Government and not in the municipality or a marketing committee or any other local authority having limited function specified in the enactment under which it is constituted. The definition of the expression 'rural areas' in section 2(h) of the Act is as vague as it can be. It means an area the population of which does not exceed 20,000 persons. It need not necessarily be a local area as it is ordinary understood. Ordinarily a local area means a Municipal Corporation, a Town Municipality, a Panchayat, a Notified Area, a Sanitary Board etc.... Any geographical area the population of which does not exceed 20,000 persons can be conveniently brought within the scope of section 2(h) of the Act. If it is understood that way even urban areas can be divided into areas with population not exceeding 20,000 and labelled as rural areas. Even if a town or a city having a population exceeding 20,000 persons, is excluded from the scope of the expression 'rural areas', the area in which the amount credited to the Fund can be spent is almost 90 per cent of the total area of the State of Haryana. There is no specification in the Act that the amount or a substantial part of the amount collected by way of cess under section 3 of the Act will be spent on any public purpose with in the market area where the dealer is carrying on his business. The purposes over which the Fund can be spent are the same purposes on which any amount collected by way of tax is spent by any State and there is nothing which is done specially to benefit the dealer. When any amount is spent from the fund the interest of the dealers is not at all kept in view even generally. There is no other restriction imposed on the manner in which the Fund can be spent. The cess, therefore, partakes of the character of a part of the common burden which has to be levied and collected only as a tax. A dealer who pays the cess under the Act may as one of the members of the general public derive some benefit from the expenditure of the fund incurred by the State Government. The benefit so derived by him is merely incidental to the fact that he happens to be a person residing in the State of Haryana. It is not the same as the benefit which a dealer in a market area would derive by the expenditure of its funds by a marketing committee or as the benefit which a person living in a town or a city would derive by the expenditure incurred by the municipality concerned. [161 A; 162 A-B] 153 
 3. There is practically no difference between the Consolidated Fund which vests in the State and the Fund which also vests in the State. Amounts credited to the Consolidated Fund and the amounts credited to the Fund can both be spent practically on any public purpose almost throughout the State. In such a situation it is difficult to hold that there exists any correlation between the amount paid by way of cess under the Act and the services rendered to the person from whom it is collected. The impost in these cases lacks the essential qualification of a fee namely 'that it is absolutely necessary that the levy of fees should on the face of the legislative provision, be correlated to the expenses incurred by Government in rendering services'. In fact, there is no correlation at all. [162 C-E]
