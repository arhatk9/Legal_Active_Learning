 The respondent's petition under Art. 226 challenging an order of the appellants (customs authorities) was ordered by the High Court. The appellants immediately applied for certified copies of the judgment and order. They filed an application for leave, to appeal to this Court against the order of the High Court, along with a certified copy of the judgment which alone was furnished to them by then; but the application was beyond the period of limitation even after excluding the time taken for obtaining the certified copy of the judgment. The certified copy of the order was furnished to the appellants thereafter, but it was not annexed to the application for leave to appeal. The High Court dismissed the application on the ground that it was barred by time.
 In appeal to this Court, the appellants contended that they were entitled under s. 12(2) of the Limitation Act to exclude the time taken in obtaining the certified copy of the order, while the respondent sought to support the dismissal on the grounds that: (1) the application for leave to appeal was competent without annexing either the certified copy of the judgment or order under the Rules of the High Court, and therefore, it cannot be said that the time taken for obtaining the copy of the judgment or order was requisite, and hence, could not be excluded under s.
 12(2) or (3), and (ii) the prescribed Form for an application for leave prohibited the annexing of a copy of the judgment or order.
 
HELD:(i) Under s, 12(2) and (3) of the Limitation Act, the time for obtaining the certified copies of the judgment and the decree or the order must be excluded while computing the period of limitation. The Legislature allowed the exclusion to enable a party who intends to file an appeal to examine the decree or the judgment before he launches a further proceeding. The provision does not depend upon whether the Civil Procedure Code or Rules of a Court permit a petitioner to file an application for leave to appeal with or without a copy of the judgment or order or decree, and where the Rules so permit, whether he has annexed such a copy to his application or not.

 Beharilal A.I.R. 1952 Bhopal 39 and Abdul Aziz v. Jai Ram, A.I.R. 1951 H.P. 67, overruled.
 (ii)The rule and the Form prescribed do not lay down any mandatory direction that a copy either of the order or of the judgment shall not be annexed. [51 B-C] 47
