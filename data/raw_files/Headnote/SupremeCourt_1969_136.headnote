 Even though import of gold into India had been banned, considerable quantities of contraband gold were finding their way into the country through illegal channels, affecting the national economy and hampering the country's economic stability and progress. The Customs Department was not in a position to effectively combat the smuggling over the long borders and coast lines. Therefore, anti-smuggling measures had to be supplemented by a detailed system of control over internal transactions and the Gold (Control) Act, 1968, was passed for this purpose. The petitioners, who were goldsmiths, contended that; (1) the Act was Dot within the legislative competence of Parliament, because, (a) Manufacture of -old ornaments by goldsmiths is not 'industry' within the meaning of Entry 52, List I or Entry 33, List III of the VII Schedule to the Constitution; (b) Even if it was an 'industry' within the meaning of the Legislative Entries, the Control of the industry was not declared by Parliament to be expedient in the public interest as required by the Entries; (c) The provisions of the industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951, indicate that what Parliament intended to control under Entry 52 was not the manufacture of gold ornaments by individual goldsmiths but 'industrial undertakings' as contemplated by s. 2(d) of that Act, because, the ex.
 pression 'scheduled industry' in s. 2(a) and 'industrial undertaking' in s. 2(d) of that Act are synonymous; and (2) that the restrictions imposed by ss. 4(4), 4(5), 5(1), 5(2), 27(2)(d), 27(6), 32, 46, 88 and 100 of the Gold (Control) Act were unreasonable and not in public interest and so are violative of Art. 19(1)(f) and (g) of the Constitution, and that s. 27 and s. 39 are discriminatory and violative of Art. 14.
 
HELD : (1) (a) The manufacture of gold ornaments by goldsmiths in India is a process of systematic production for trade or manufacture and so falls within the connotation of the word 'industry' in the appropriate legislative Entries. Therefore, in enacting the impugned Act, Parliament was validly exercising its legislative power in respect of matters covered by Entry 52 of List I and Entry 33 of List III. Entry 27 of List 11 dealing with 'Production, supply and distribution of goods, subject to the provisions 480 of Entry 33 of List III', is a general Entry and the general power should not be interpreted so as to nullify the particular power conferred by Entry 52 of List 1 and Entry 33 of List 111. There is no reason for imposing on the word 'industry' a restriction that to constitute industry, a process of machinery or mechanical contrivance is essential.
 The mere use of skill or art by the goldsmith is not a decisive factor and will not take the manufacture or gold ornaments out of the ambit of the relevent legislative Entries. The decisions in Banerji v. Mukherjee, [1952] INSC 67; [1953] S.C.R. 302 and National Union of Commercial Employees v. M.
 R. Meher, [1962] Supp. 3 S.C. R. 157 that the word industry in s. 2(j) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 involved cooperation of employer and employees, did not mean that the activity carried on by self-employed goldsmiths individually without any participation by labour and capital in the activity would not fall within the word 'industry' in the Lists of the Constitution. The interpretation of the word in the Industrial Disputes Act was adopted by this Court with reference to the subject-matter of that Act as that Act was passed to ameliorate the service conditions of workers.
 [491 B-C, E-F, H; 492 A, F-H] ? (b) There is no scientific or logical scheme in the classification under the headings of the first schedule to the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act as shown by the fact that many items were included under headings which are inappropriate and others are excluded which should have been included. Therefore, the first Schedule to that Act is -a mere enumeration and grouping of various items and the headings do not control the scope and meaning of the entries under them. Hence, the heading 'Metallurgical Industries' does not control the entry B(2) under it, dealing with semi- manufactures and manufactures'. The expression semi- manufactures' could not mean gold in the form of ingots, wire, strips and sheets, nor would the expression 'manufactures' mean gold bricks or standard gold bars and gold castings, because, then items 1-B(1) and (2) would convey the same meaning, and 1-B(2) would be superfluous.
 The two expressions should be construed in the light of the Brussels Tariff Nomenclature, and so construed, the manufacture of gold ornaments falls within the expression 'semi-manufactures or manufactures'. Since under s. 2 of that Act it is declared that it is expedient in the public interest that the Union should take under its control the industries specified in the first schedule. Parliament is competent to legislate in regard to the subject matter of the impugned Act. [494 F-G; 495 B-C ,D-F; 496 B-C] (c) There is a distinction made between 'scheduled industries' and 'industrial undertakings', because, separate provisions are made throughout the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, for their regulation. Therefore, the two expressions are not synonymous. [496 F-H] (2)(a) Sections 5(2)(b), 27(2)(d) 27(6), 32, 46, 88 and 100 are invalid.
 (a) Sections 4(4) and 4(5) contemplate that the Administrator appointed under the Act may authorise such person as he thinks fit, to also exercise all or any of the powers exercisable by him under the Act, except certain specified powers, and such person may exercise the powers as if they were conferred by the Act. Such delegation by the Administrator is necessary, because, the volume of work entrusted to him is great and it must be' assumed that be would delegate his authority only to competent and responsible persons. Therefore, the delegation does not go beyond permissible constitutional limits. [A-D] (b) Section 5(1) requires that in making orders for carrying out the provisions of the Act, the Administrator should have regard to the policy 481 of the Act. The orders should be made within the frame-work of the Act and should not be inconsistent with its provisions. As regards s. 5(2)(a), the section provided the safeguard that regulation -of the price at which any gold may be bought or sold should be made after consultation with the Reserve Bank of India. The phrase 'so far as it appears to him to be necessary or expedient for carrying out the provisions of the Act,' in the sub-Section, is not subjective and does not constitute the Administrator the sole judge as to what is in fact necessary or expedient for the purposes of the Act. In the context of the scheme and object of the legislation the opinion of the Administrator as to the necessity or expediency of making the order must be reached objectively after having regard to the relevant consideration and must be reasonably tenable in a court of law. It Must he assumed that the Administrator will not try to promote purposes to the object of the Act. [499 D-H-] (c) As regards s. 5(2)(b), on a review of ss. 8(6),II( 1) 3 4(2) and (3 the power conferred up-on the Administration under s. 5(2) (b) is legislative in character and extremely wide. But whereas the parallel power of subordinate legislation of rule-making conferred on the Central Government under s. 114(1) and (2) is subject to parliamentary scrutiny, the power of regulation granted to the Administrator under s. 5(2)(b) suffers from excessive delegation of legislative power and must be held to he constitutionally invalid. [501 A-D] (d) Section 27(2) (d) states that the licence issued by the Administrator may contain such conditions, limitations as the administrator may think fit to impose and different condition limitations and restrictions may be imposed for different classes of dealers. On the face of it. the sub- section confers such wide and vague power upon the Administrator that it is difficult to limit its scope and therefore, the section must be struck down as all unreasonable restriction on the fundamental right of the petitioners to carry on business.
 Section 27 (6) (a) states that in the matter of issue or renewal of licences ,he Administrator shall have regard to the number of dealers existing in the region in which the applicant intends to carry on business as a dealer. But the word 'region' is nowhere defined in the Act. Similarly s.
 27(6)(b) requires the Administrator to have due regard to the anticipated demand as estimated by him for ornaments in that region but the expression anticipated demand' is vague and incapable of objective assessment. and is bound to lead to a reat deal of uncertainty. In the same way the expression 'suitability of the applicant' in s. 27(6)(e) and 'public interest' in s. 27(6)(g) do not provide any objective standard or norm. Further. the requirement in the section imposing the same coiiditio.,is for the renewal of the licence as for the initial grant is unreasonable, as it renders the entire future of the business of the dealer uncertain and subject to the caprice and arbitrary will of the administrative authorities. Therefore. clauses (:t).
 (h). (e) and (g) of s. 27(6) arc constitutionally invalid.
 Since these clauses are inextricably woven up with other clauses of s. '7(6) the entire s. 17(6) must be held to be invalid. f501 D-H; 502 A-B] If s. 27(6) (d) and s. 27(6) of the Act arc invalid the licensing scheme contemplated by the Act becomes unworkable and it is therefore necessary for Parliament to enact fresh legislation imposing appropriate conditional restrictions for the, grant and renewal of licences to dealers or in the alternative, the Central Government may make appropriate rules for the same purpose under s. 114. [502 B-E] (e) Sections 32 and 46 of the Act authorise a licensed dealer to keep any quantity of standard gold bars and provides a limit Upon the holding of 482 primary gold depending on the number of artisans he employs.
 But a -standard gold bar cannot, in many cases be handed over to a certified goldsmith without cutting it. If a dealer gives a cut piece of standard gold bar to a goldsmith, the remaining portion is treated as primary gold in his hands. Therefore, the limits prescribed under the sections 'are rendered meaningless and constitute an unreasonable restriction on the right of the petitioners to carry on trade or business and are invalid. [503 C-E] (f) Section 88 extends the scope of the vicarious liability of the dealer .and makes him responsible for the contravention of any provision of the Act or rule by any person employed by him in the course of such employment.
 The section makes the dealer liable even for any past contravention perpetrated by an employee and extends vicarious liability beyond reasonable limits. it therefore imposes an unreasonable restriction and is unconstitutional.
 [503 H; 504 A-D] Section 100 imposes a statutory obligation upon dealer to take all reasonable steps to satisfy himself about the identity of persons from whom gold is bought. It does not specify the nature of steps which a dealer should take forsuch satisfaction and the obligation is uncertain and incapable of proper compliance. Hence it must also be held to be unconstitutional on the ground that it imposes an impossible and unreasonable burden. [504 D-F] (h) Licensed dealers and certified goldsmiths form separate classes and the classification is a reasonable classification, because, a licencd dealer is essentially a trader who does the business of buying and selling ornaments while a certified goldsmith is a craftsman who does the actual manufacture of ornaments and does not trade in ornaments. Considering the policy underlying the statute and the object intended to be achieved, the classification is reasonable and has a rational nexus with the avowed policy and object of the Act, and hence does not violate Art. 14. [504 G-H: 505 C-E] (3) The provisions which are declared invalid do not affect the validity of the Act as a whole. The test is whether what remains of the statute is so inextricably bound up with the invalid part that what remains cannot independently survive, or whether on a fair review of the whole maker it can be assumed that the legislature would have enacted at all that which survives without enacting the ultra vires part. In the present case. Act still remains substantialy the Act as it was passed, that is, an Act for the control of the production. manufacture, supply, distribution, use and possession of gold and gold ornaments and articles of gold even without including the sections which are found to be ultra vires. The provisions held to be invalid are not inextricably bound up with the remaining portions and it is difficult to hold that Parliament would not have enacted the Act excluding the part found to be ultra vires [506 C-E]
