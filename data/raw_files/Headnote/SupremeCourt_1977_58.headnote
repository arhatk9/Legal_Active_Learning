 Respondent No. 1 landlord after his father's death and during his minority let out the agricultural land in dispute to the appellant tenant through his mother for one year.
 After the expiry of the lease period the tenant refused to deliver possession of the field. The mother filed a suit for possession which was dismissed. Section 9A of the Berar Regulation of Agricultural Leases Act 1951 (Madhya Pradesh Act No. XXIV of 1951) enables a minor lessor to get posses- sion within 3 years of his attaining majority. The landlord, therefore, after attaining majority filed a peti- tion for possession: By order dated 8-8-1955, the authori- ties terminated the tenancy under s. 9A(2) of the Berar Act.
 It was directed that the landlord shall apply for possession of the suit land after 31-3-1956. Pending the proceedings under s. 9A the landlord applied for recovery of mesne profits or, in the alternative, the lease amount. Subse- quentlY, the landlord filed a suit in the year 1960 against the tenant for recovery of mesne profits or for rent since the tenant continued to be on the land. When the suit was pending the landlord filed another application under s.
 100(2) and s. 36 read with section 38 of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands (Vidarbha Region & Kutch Area) Act 1958 (Bombay Act No. XLIX of 1958). The relief prayed was for a declaration that Kesheorao was not a tenant. In the alternative, the landlord claimed for relief of resumption of the suit filed under section 36(2) and 38(1) of the Tenaney Act. The Tenancy Court took the view that the tenancy was terminated by the order dated 8-8-1955 under section 9A of the Berar Act and that the possession of Kesheorao thereafter was not in the capacity of a tenant and allowed the landlord's claim for possession under s. 132(3) of the Tenancy Act. The Tribunal reversed the judgment of the Appellate Authority ,red held that the tenant was a protected lessee and entitled to enjoy that status under s.
 6 of the Tenancy Act. The Tribunal held that the landlord in his application under section 36(2) will have to satisfy the conditions contained in s. 38(3) and (4) of the Tenancy Act. The Tribunal, therefore, dismissed the application of the landlord for possession. The High Court in exercise of its powers under Article 227 of the Constitution quashed the order of the Revenue Tribunal and restored the order passed by the Deputy Collector. The High Court held that the landlord was entitled to get possession under s. 36 read with s. 38 and section 100(2) of the Tenancy Act and direct- ed the handing over of the possession to the landlord.
 In an appeal by Special Leave the tenant contended that (1) The landlord took various proceedings on the basis that the appellant was a tenant and, therefore the landlord recognised or at any rate acquiesced in the tenancy of the appellant.
 (2) The order passed under s. 9A of the Berar Act cannot be given effect to under s. 36 of the Tenancy Act.
 (3) In any event, the application for possession was not filed within two years from the dale of the order for pos- session.
 Dismissing the appeal by special leave.
 
 HELD: (1) After the order dated 7-8-1955 was passed under section 9A of the Berar Act the lease was terminated and the appellant ceased to be a 15 tenant. The status of the appellant as a tenant was also lost on the expiry of the 7 years period on 31-3-1956 conferred on him under the Berar Act. It is clear from various proceedings that the landlord never recognised or acquiesced in the tenancy of the appellant. The claim was for mesne profits or in the alternative for lease and cannot amount to acquiescing in the tenancy. Under the Tenancy Act no right has been conferred on the appellant after his status as protected tenant came to an end. The landlord in fact made an application for possession within the period of two years from the date the 'Tenancy Act came into force and the application was, therefore, not barred by limitation.
 [16H, 17A-C, E-F] (2) The Revenue Tribunal was in error in upsetting the order of the Appellate Authority to the effect that after the order under s. 9A of the Berar Act was passed the pos- session of the appellant was not in the capacity of a tenant. The High Court was justified in interfering with the order of the Revenue Tribunal. [17G-H]
