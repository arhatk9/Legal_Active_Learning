 The term "accommodation" is defined by s. 2(a)- Scope of the U.P. (Temporary) Control of Rent and Eviction Act, 1947 to mean residential and non-residential accommodation in any building or part of a building and includes among others any furniture supplied by the landlord for use in such building or part of a building and any fittings affixed to such building or part of a building for the more beneficial enjoyment thereof. A proviso was added to clause (a) by the Amending Act XVII of 1954 which says "but does not include any accommodation used as a factory or for an industrial purpose where the business carried on in or upon a building is also leased out to the lessee by the same transaction." The respondent took on lease the cinema theatre of which the appellant was the owner. The lease deed provided a rent of Rs. 400 p.m. for the building simpliciter and Rs.
 1000 for the projector fittings, fans and other fixtures.
 The suit for eviction filed by the appellant was dismissed by the trial court holding that the suit properly was not accommodation within the meaning of the Act. The High Court upheld the view of the trial court.
 On appeal to this Court it was contended that the dominant purpose or real subject of the lease was the cinema apparatus and fittings, including subsidiarily and incidentally the building.

 HELD: The lease sued on does not fall within the scope of accommodation The appellant is entitled to a decree of eviction. [290B] (1) (a) The lease of an accommodation must essentially be of a building- not a business or industry together with the building in which it is situated.[82B-C] (b) Where the lease is composite and has a plurality of purposes, the decisive test is the dominant purpose of the demise. The additions such as gardens grounds and out- houses, if any, appurtenant to such building, any furniture supplied by the by the landlord for the use in such building, electrical fittings, sanitary fittings, and so on are subservient and beneficial to the building itself. They make occupation of the building more convenient and pleasant `when the principal thing demised is the building and the additions are auxiliary. The furniture and fittings visualised in the concept of building are calculated to improve the beneficial enjoyment of the premises leased.
 [282D-E] (c) The legislative policy is to control rents and evictions of buildings, rack-renting and profiteering by indiscriminate eviction from buildings, residential and non- residential. The law sought to rescue exploited tenants of building. It is, therefore, fair to hold that the protected category of accommodation was residential and non- residential buildings and not business houses. [283A-B] (d) It would be a travesty of language to speak of a lease of a building when what is substantially made over is a business or industrial plant. If a business were the subject matter of the lease, the prominent thing win be not what houses the business but the business itself. The building becomes secondary since clearly 278 business or industry has to be accommodated in some enclosure or building. In all such cases the lessor makes over possession of the building as part and parcel of the transfer of possession of the business. [283E-F] In the instant case a conspectus of factors settles the issue in favour of the landlord that the real intention of the parties to the lease was to demise primarily the cinema equipment and secondarily the building, the lease itself being a composite one. [284B-C] (2) If on a fair construction, the principal provision is clear, a proviso cannot expand or limit it. Sometimes a proviso is engrafted by an apprehensive draftsman to remove possible doubts, to make matters plain, to light up ambiguous edges. A proviso ordinarily is but a proviso although the golden rule is to read the whole sections inclusive of the proviso, in such manner that they mutually throw light on each other and result in a harmonious construction. The Amending Act in this case clarified what was implicit earlier and expressly carved out what otherwise month be mistakenly covered by the main definition. The proviso does not expand by implication, the protected area of building tenancies to embrace business leases.[284F-G]
