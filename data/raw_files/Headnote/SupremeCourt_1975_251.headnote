 The appellant contended before the Industrial Tribunal that the apprentices to which the Employees State Insurance Act, 1948 applies. The factory employs besides regular employees, two sets of apprentices. Graduate apprentices for a period of two years and Trade apprentices for the duration of 3 years. The graduate apprentices receive stipend of Rs.
 250/- per month for the first year and Rs. 300/- per month during the second year. The trade apprentices receive stipend of Rs. 2/- Rs. 2.50 and Rs. 3.00 per diem during the first, second and third years of the apprenticeship respectively. No further emolument is paid to the apprentices. A deed of apprenticeship is signed by the company, the apprentice and the surety by which the company agrees to provide to the apprentice necessary training in its factory and that after the apprentices successfully pass the examination after the training is completed they would be considered for absorption as skilled worker although the Company is not under a legal obligation to offer them employment. Another term provides that the apprentices would during the period of apprenticeship diligently and faithfully serve the Company and to the utmost power and skill attend to the Company's business. The apprentices give a bond for serving the Company for 5 years after their training is successfully completed.
 The appellant contended before the Industrial Tribunal that the apprentices are employees within the meaning of the Act. The Tribunal did not accept the appellant's contention.
 The High Court rejected the writ petition filed by the appellant. On an appeal by certificate under Art. 133(1) (a) and (b) of the Constitution it was contended by the appellant that the words "serve the Company" appearing in the apprenticeship agreement introduce a relation of master and servant.
 ^ 
 HELD : (1) The word "apprentice" is not defined in the Act. In ordinary acceptation of the term apprentice a relationship of master and servant is not established in law. The dictionary meaning does not accept such a relationship. The heart of the matter or the dominant object in apprenticeship is the intent to impart on the part of the employer and to accept on the part of the other person learning under certain agreed terms. Such a person remains a learner and not an employee. The fact that certain payment is made does not convert the apprentice into a regular employee. An examination of the provisions of the entire agreement leads us to the conclusion that the principal object with which the parties enter into the agreement of apprenticeship was offering by me employer an opportunity to learn the trade or craft and the other person to acquire such knowledge. [201F, 202D-F] (2) The Apprentices Act, 1850, defines an apprentice as a person who is undergoing apprenticeship training in a designated trade in pursuance of a contract of apprenticeship. Whenever the legislature intends to include an apprentice in the definition of a worker it has expressly done so, for instance, while defining a worker under s. 2 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The very next year while passing the Employees State Insurance Act, 1948, the Legislature did not choose to include apprentice while defining the word employee. Such a deliberate omission on the part of the Legislature can be only 200 attributed to the well known concept of apprenticeship which the Legislature assumed and took note of for the purpose of the Act. The apprentices are not given the wages as defined by s. 2(22) of the Act. The apprentices are not covered within the definition of the employees under s. 2(9) of the Act. They are not entitled to the daily allowances and other allowances to which the regular employees are entitled. The apprentice is, therefore, not an employee within the meaning of s. 2(9) of the Act.
