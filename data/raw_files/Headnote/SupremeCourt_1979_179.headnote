 Respondent, Carew and Co. Ltd., was resident in India having its Registered office in Calcutta. During the assessment year 1956-57, for which the corresponding previous year ended on June 30,1955, the sources of the income of the Company were from (a) business in India and interest earned in India on securities; (b) manufacturing business in Pakistan and (c) agricultural properties in Pakistan. For the relevant year the assessee's Indian income as computed by the Income Tax Officer was Rs. 2,01,329 from business and Rs. 373 from interest on securities. The total of the two items was Rs. 2,01,702. The profit from assessee's manufacturing business in Pakistan was computed at Rs. 3,26,368. In respect of the agricultural property, however, there was loss and it was determined at Rs.
 3,20,839. The Income Tax Officer deducted by way of set off the agricultural loss of Rs. 3,20,839 against the profit of the manufacturing business amounting to Rs. 3,26,368. The net profit of the assessee thus determined in respect of the two sources in Pakistan was Rs. 5,529. Deducting the statutory figure of Rs. 4,500 from the above net profit of Rs. 5,529 he gave the company relief against double taxation on the figure of Rs. 1,029 only. The assessee by filing a revised return claimed abatement on the entire profit from its manufacturing business in Pakistan i.e. Rs. 3,26,368 and also set off of the whole amount of Rs. 3,20,839 from the total income determined in India. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner affirmed the decision of the Income Tax Officer. But in second appeal to the Appellate Tribunal, it was held by the Tribunal that the assessee was entitled to abatement of tax under the Agreement on the entire profit from manufacturing business earned in Pakistan during the relevant year. Since the agricultural income of the assessee in respect of its agricultural properties in Pakistan was to be treated as taxable income in India, the loss was allowable under the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922. The High Court on a reference agreed with the Tribunal's view. Hence the appeal.
 Dismissing the appeal, the Court ^ HELD:
 Per Untwalia J.
 
 1. The assessee was entitled to the relief against double taxation in accordance with the Agreement leaving out of consideration the figure of loss of Rs. 3,20,839/- incurred in its agricultural activities in Pakistan, albeit the said loss had to be taken into account and adjusted against the assessee's profit in India. [642 F-G] 634 
 2. While computing the total income of the assessee, the income or the loss, as the case may be, from agricultural property in a foreign country had to be added to or adjusted in the assessee's total income. Obviously it will be an income "from other sources" within the meaning of clause (iv) of Section 6 of the Income Tax Act, 1922. So also the assessee's income from business in Pakistan had to be added to the figure of his profits and gains of business in India. The statutory deduction of Rs. 4,500 had to be granted under the third proviso to section 4(1) of the Act.
 The exclusion of the agricultural income as mentioned in clause (viii) of sub section (3) was to be granted only if it was an agricultural income as defined in Section 2(1).
 Otherwise not. Income from agricultural lands situated in Pakistan was not agricultural income within the meaning of the Indian Income Tax Act. Income Tax was, therefore, chargeable on the said income. Similarly if there is a figure of loss from agricultural lands situated in Pakistan, it has got to be deducted, while computing the total income of the resident assessee in India. [637 G-H, 638 A-C] Kumar Jagdish Chandra Sinha v. Commissioner of Income Tax, West Bengal, 28 I.T.R. 732 (Calcutta) approved.
 If the assessee's agricultural income in Pakistan was chargeable to tax there, then relief in respect of such income could be granted to the resident assessee only in accordance with sub clause (3) of Section 49-D of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922. Such a case would not be covered by any of the Articles of the Agreement for Avoidance of Double Taxation in India and Pakistan which was entered into and was followed by notification No. 28 dated 10th December 1947 published in the official gazette. [638 G-H, 639 D] In the instant case, since in the relevant year no amount of tax was charged or paid in Pakistan by the assessee, either because such income was not chargeable there or because the net figure was a figure of loss, in the matter of calculation of relief against Double Taxation sub- section (3) of section 49D was not attracted at all. The loss had simply to be allowed in India, while computing the assessee's total income because, if there were any figure of profit from agricultural lands in Pakistan the same could have been added in the total income of the assessee. [639 D- E] Section 49 D(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1922 is attracted for giving relief against double taxation only if the income derived by the assessee is from a foreign country with which there is no reciprocal arrangement between that country and India for relief for avoidance of double taxation. In case of Pakistan, there being a reciprocal agreement, the relief has to be granted only under it. [639 F-G] The scheme of the Agreement is (the phraseology of Article IV) quite different and distinct from what is provided in sub-section (1) of Section 49(D) of the Income Tax Act 1922. Therefore the view of the High Court on interpretation of Articles IV and VI of the Agreement is quite correct. It is significant to note that in Article IV, the wordings are "where either Dominion under the operation of its laws, charges any income from the sources or categories of transactions specified in column 1 of the Schedule to this Agreement". The various items in the Schedule clearly indicate that 635 if the sources or categories of transactions are to be clubbed together and not treated separately then it will be difficult, almost impossible, to give effect to the Agreement with reference to the Schedule. [640 C, 642 B-D] K. V. Al. M. Ramanathan Chettiar v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Madras, 88 I.T.R. 169 (S.C.); explained.
 Per Pathak J. (Concurring) (1) Since agricultural income does not fall within the scope of the Agreement for the Avoidance of Double Taxation the loss suffered by the respondent company in agricultural operations in Pakistan cannot be set off against the business income arising or accruing in that country for the purpose of determining the abatement due to the respondent under the Agreement. In the absence of such a set off the respondent is entitled to a rebate in respect of the entire business income from Pakistan. [644 A-C] (2) Article IV of the Agreement in view of Article I must be construed as relating to assessments made in the two countries under the Indian Income Tax Act, the Excess Profits Tax Act and the Business Profits Tax Act only. For the purpose of abatement under Article IV of the Agreement, the primary condition is that tax under these enactments should be leviable in both countries on income from the sources or categories or transaction specified in the Schedule to the Agreement. In the present case, which relates to an assessment in India under the Indian Income Tax Act for the assessment year 1956-57, in respect of that assessment year agricultural income arising in Pakistan was not liable to tax in Pakistan under the Indian Income Tax Act as applied in that country. Consequently, any agricultural income arising or accruing in Pakistan cannot be considered for the purpose of abatement under the Agreement for the Avoidance of Double Taxation. [643 D-F] (3) When statutory provisions are referred and cases are cited before the Court on a point involving double taxation, the distinction between the two concepts of "avoidance of double taxation" and the "relief against double taxation" evidenced by the two clauses of Section 49 A of the Indian Income Tax Act, and the difference in same degree from each other of these two concepts as embodied in the respective schemes must be borne in mind. One important feature distinguishing the two concepts lies in this, that in the case of avoidance of double taxation the assessee does not have to pay the tax first and then apply for relief in the form of refund, as he would be obliged to do under a provision for relief against double taxation.
