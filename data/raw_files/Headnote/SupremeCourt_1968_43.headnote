 Before the coming into force on April 1, 1951 of the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Rights (Estates, Mahals, Alienated Lands) Act, 1950 (Act 1 of 1951), the appellant had purchased from certain proprietors of land the right to collect forest produce from the said land during the years 1951, 1952 and 1953. The right was to be enjoyed after April 1, 1951 on which date under the aforesaid Act, the proprietary rights came to vest in the State of Madhya Pradesh. The Deputy Commissioner acting under s. 7 of the Act prevented the appellant from enjoying the rights he had acquired from the proprietors, and in April 1951 auctioned the right to collect forest produce from the land. The appellant deposited Rs. 10,000 to acquire the right of collecting lac from the said land during 1951, 1952 and 1953. He collected some lac but thereafter filed a suit claiming refund of the deposit of Rs. 10,000 on the basis that there was no. valid ,contract between him and the State of Madhya Pradesh as the provisions of Art. 299 of the Constitution were not complied with and the contract was void. The trial court granted him a decree but the High Court decreded against him. With certificate the appellant came to this Court.
 
HELD : (i) The right to collect forest produce was a proprietary right and vested in the State Government by the operation of s. 4(1) (a) of the Abolition Act. The contrary view taken in Chhotabhdi Jethabhai Patel & Co.'s case, was expressly overruled by this Court in State of Madhya Pradesh v. Yakinuddin. The present case was directly covered by the latter case. [219 G-220 C] State of Madhya Pradesh v. Yakinuddin [1962] INSC 209; [1963] 3 S.C.R. 13, relied on.
 Chhotabhai Jethabhai Patel & Co. v. State of Madhya Pradesh, [1952] INSC 80; [1953] S.C.R. 476 and Mahadeo v. State of Bombay, [1959] 2 Supp. S.C.R. 339, referred to.
 (ii) The provisions of Art. 299(1) of the Constitution like the provisions of s. 175(3) of the Government of India Act, 1935 have not been enacted for the sake of mete form but they have been enacted for safeguarding the Government against unauthorised contracts. The formalities which are embodied therein on grounds of public policy cannot be waved or dispensed with. The appellant was right in his contention that the Contract entered into by him was void because Art. 299 had not been complied with. [221 E-F] 215 Seth Bikhraj Jaipuria v. Union of India, [1961] INSC 228; [1962] 2 S.C.R. 880 and State of West Bengal v. Mls. B. K. Mondal & Sons, [1962] 1 Supp. S.C.R. 876, relied on.
 (iii) However the refund of Rs. 10,000 claimed by the appellant could not be allowed as he did not satisfy the conditions of s. 70 of the Indian Contract Act. The person who seeks restitution has a duty to account to the defendant for what he has received in the transaction from which his right to restitution arises. The appellant had not produced sufficient evidence to show to what extent he worked the contract and what was the profit made, by him in the year 1951 and the succeed in years. In the absence of reliable evidence on this point the appellant was not entitled to restitution or refund of the deposit he had mad,-. 1 [223 A-C] Fibrosa v.
