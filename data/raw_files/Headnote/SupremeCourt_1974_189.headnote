 Dr. Chandan Singh had two sons Tegh Singh and Shamsher Singh and two daughters Deva Devi and Lakshmi Devi Dayali Devi was the wife of Shamsher Singh. Dr. Chandan Singh executed a will in 1897. Chandan Singh and Tegh Singh died.
 Thereafter Shamsher Singh executed a will in 1944 in favour of Rama Krishna Mission and making provision for the residence and maintenance of his wife and sister. Mr. Mitra the executor obtained a probate of the will in spite of the opposition of Dayali Devi. The Division Bench of the High Court confirmed the grant of probate by the Single Judge.
 Therefore, Dayali Devi filed a suit for a declaration that she was the owner of the Properties left by her husband.
 The said suit was dismissed. The High Court dismissed the appeal. In the meanwhile, a suit for possession of the property bequeathed to Rama Krishna Mission was filed where Deva Devi was impleaded as a defendant on her application.
 The Trial Court awarded the decree for possession in favour of Rama Krishna Mission. Dayali Devi filed an appeal against that judgment in the High Court. During the pendency of the appeal in the High Court Deva Devi and Dayali Devi died. Four persons including the appellants applied to the High Court to be substituted as legal representatives of Dayali Devi on the ground that Dayali- Devi had executed a will in their favour 2 days before her death. The High Court dismissed the appeal. The High Court judgment mentioned that it was not challenged by the appellants that a part of the bequeathed property was self- acquired property of Shamsher Singh and that Shamsher Singh had become full owner of the share of Tegh Singh. It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the observations in the High Court judgment about the concession are erroneous.
 
HELD : The observation of the High Court that certain findings were not challenged is unequivocal and it is difficult to believe that the Learned Judges of the High Court would erroneously say so. The same counsel who argued the appeal also filed the Application for Leave which is silent on the point. Even in the Special Leave Petition filed in this Court no ground was taken that the observation of the High Court was incorrect. [193 E-H] The contention that Shamsher Singh was owner of only I share of the estate of Chandan Singh after the death of Tegh Singh was not allowed to be raised for the first time in this Court. While disallowing the appellant to raise the contention this Court took into account various facts including the fact that the plea is being set up by persons who admittedly had no relationship with Chandan Singh, Shamsher Singh or Dayali Devi. Another fact which weighed with this Court is that the suit giving rise to this appeal was instituted more than 16 years ago. The suit instituted in 1958 was the off-shoot of the litigation which started in 1946 and it is time that a final curtain is drawn on the long litigation. The Court in this context observed :
 "Deva Devi and Dayali Devi, who claimed rights and interest in the property is dispute, are now no more. So is Capt.
 Mitra who was the party arrayed against the two ladies in the litigation. It is time in our opinion, that we draw the final curtain on this long drawn litigation and not allow its embers to shoulder for a further length of time, more so when the principal contestants have all departed bowing as it were to the inexorable law of nature."
