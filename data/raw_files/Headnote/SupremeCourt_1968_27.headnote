 The respondents, who were teachers in District Board Schools were taken over by the State of Punjab with effect from 1st October 1957 when the Local Bodies Schools in the State were provincialised. The Punjab Educational Service (Provincialised Cadre) Class III Rules were framed in 1961 but were deemed to have come into force on 1st October 1957.
 Under r. 6(1) of the Rules the respondents, who were officiating in permanent posts against permanent vacancies were deemed to have held their posts on probation, in the first instance, for one year from 1st October 1957. On the completion of this initial period of probation on 1st October 1958. four courses of action were open to the 'appointing authority under r. 6(3), namely, (a) to extend the period of probation, provided the total period of probation, including extensions, would not exceed three years, or (b) to revert the employee to his former post if he was promoted from some lower post, or (c) to dispense with his services if his work or conduct during the period of probation was unsatisfactory, or (d) to confirm him in his appointment. As, the respondents were not promoted from lower posts there was no question of their reversion. No other order was however passed. but the authority continued them in their posts for three years, that is, upto 1st October 1960 and even thereafter; allowed them to draw annual increments of salary including the increment which fell due on 1st October 1962; and some time in 1963, terminated their services. The orders of termination were passed without holding any departmental enquiry and without giving the respondents any opportunity to make any representation.
 The writ petitions filed by the respondets challenging the orders were allowed by the High Court. The High Court held that the respondents were not temporary employees that on the expiry of three years' period of probation they must be deemed to have been confirmed in their posts, that the impugned orders having deprived them of their right to those posts amounted to removal from service by way of punishment and were passed in violation of Art. 311 and the Punjab Civil Services (Punishment and Appeal) Rules, 1952.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The impugned orders were rightly set aside by the High Court. [7 E] Where on the completion of the specified period of probation an employee is allowed to continue in the post without an order of confirmation, in the absence of anything to the contrary in the original order of appointment or promotion or the Service Rules,- the initial period of Probation is deemed to be extended by necessary implication. But, where, as in the present case, the Service Rules fix a certain period of time beyond which the 2 probationary period cannot be extend-ad, and an employee appointed or promoted to a post on probation is allowed to continue in that post after the completion of the maximum period of probation without an express order of confirmation, he cannot be deemed to continue in that post as a probationer. The reason is that such an implication is negatived by the service rule forbidding extension of the probationary period beyond the maximum period fixed by it.
 In such a case, it is permissible to draw the inference that the employee' allowed to continue in the post on completion of the maximum period of probation has been confirmed in the post by implication. [5 C, G; 6 A-B] Case law refereed to.
