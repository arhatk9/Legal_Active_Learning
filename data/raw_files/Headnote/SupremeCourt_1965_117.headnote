 The appellant,% were charged alternatively under s. 302 read with s. 149 and s. 302 read with s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. They were convicted under s. 302 read with s.
 149. On the question whether the conviction was legal, when they were not charged and convicted under s. 147 or s. 148, HELD : It was not obligatory to charged the accused under s.
 147 or S. 148 before S. 149 could be utilized against them.
 [22D; 23] For the application of s. 149 there must be an unlawful assembly. If an offence is committed in prosecution of the common object of that assembly or is such as the members of the unlawful assembly know to be likely to be committed then whoever is a member of that assembly at the time the offence is committed, is guilty. A charge under sections 143 or 147 is not a condition precedent before section. 149 is utilized, because. these are implied in circumstances in which s. 1,49 is used, and must always be present when the charge is laid for an offence like murder with the aid of s.
 149. There can be proof under s. 149, of the existence of an unlawful assembly of the common object and of the part played by that unlawful assembly or any of its members, same as under s. 143 or s. 147 or s. 148. There may be additional charges under these sections to guard against failure of the charge for an offence read, with s. 149, but the other charges cannot be regarded as condition precedent.
