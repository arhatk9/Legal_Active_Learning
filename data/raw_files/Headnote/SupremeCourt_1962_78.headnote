 Under s. 4 of the Northern India Ferries Act, 1878, the ferry at N was declared to be a public ferry. Rule 19 framed under s. 12 of the Act provided that a sale of ferry was generally to be auctioned to the highest bidder, and the acceptance of a bid by the officer conducting the sale was subject to the approval of the Chief Engineer who had to see whether that officer had taken into consideration all the factors mentioned in r. 19. Ferry at N was put up to auction and sold to the second respondent whose bid was the lowest, Though the first respondent's bid was the highest, the officer conducting the sale, without forming an opinion about the suitability of the first respondent on his own appreciation of materials as required under r. 19, rejected first respondent's bid straight away as his name appeared in the "Special List". This "Special List" was prepared and maintained by the Government of Assam of persons suspected or confirmed to be connected with 'smuggling activities so that no permit or license may be granted to such person is.
 This was in pursuance of the prohibition policy of the Government. The first respondent applied to the Chief Engineer for accepting his bid and settling the ferry on him which was rejected, whereupon he moved the High Court of Assam under Art. 226. The High Court set aside the settlement of the ferry in favour of the second respondent as being violative of s. 8 of the Act and r. 19 and further declared that the first respondent was entitled to the settlement as the highest bidder. And Government came up in appeal by special leave to the Supreme Court, 509 'The question is whether a bid of a person at the auction of ferry can straightaway be rejected by the officer conducting the sale merely for the reason that his name appears in the special list and whether the High Court could decide a question was entrusted to the executive authorities under the Act and make settlement of the ferry.
 Held, that the discretion conferred on the officer conduct- ing the sale under s. 8 of the Northern Ferries Act read with r. 19 framed under the Act is wide but not unrestricted. The discretion must be based on the material before him and relevant for his consideration and if, on a consideration thereof, he declines to exercise his discretion to accept the bid, his decision is not liable to be reversed by the courts. But where there is no material before him on basis of which he rejects a bid his action amounts to non-compliance with the provisions of r. 19 and cannot be upheld.
 Held, further, that the "Special List" maintained by the Government of Assam of persons suspected or confirmed to be connected with smuggling activities is not a document falling within s. 35 of the Indian Evidence Act and while such list might serve a purpose in guiding Criminal Intelligence Department, it will be unsafe to rely on it for deciding civil rights of a person.
 Held, also, that even though the order of authorities is not in accordance with law, it was for the appropriate authori- ties to deal with the matter and the High Court could not' itself decide what is entrusted to the executive authorities.
