 HELD: (1) The evidence of some of the witnesses unmistakably points in the conclusion that the occurrence really took place at 8 P.M. when it was dark, and if that is so, then there is no evidence on the record to show how the appellant could have been identified by the witnesses. [35D] (2) A combined reading of the report of the medical expert and the ballistic expert in the present case, clearly established that the deceased died of two gun shot injuries and the prosecution has not been able to explain this important circumstance. the evidence of the two eye witnesses is wholly in consistent with the medical evidence as also the evidence of the ballistic expert and must be rejected on that ground alone, apart from other inherent improbabilities which appear in the evidence. Where the evidence of the prosecution witnesses is totally inconsistent with the medical evidence or the evidence of the ballistic expert, thus Is a most fundamental defect in the prosecution case and unless reasonably explained it is sufficient to discredit the entire case. Where tax direct evidence is not supported by expert evidence then the evidence is wanting in the most material part of the prosecution case and it would be difficult to convict the accused on the basis of such evidence [33C: 36H: 37C] Mohinder Singh V.
