 The appellant and the respondent were rival candidates for election to the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly in, the 1967 general election. Besides them two other candidates had filed nomination papers but these were rejected on the ground that they had both been proposed, by the same elector. The appellant won the election. The respondent in his election petition before the High Court urged that the election had to be set aside because the nomination papers of the aforesaid two candidates had been wrongly rejected.
 The High Court held the election to be void. Under s. 116-A of the Representation of People Act, 1951 the appellant came to this Court, HELD : The appeal must be dismissed.
 (i) After the amendment made by Act 27 of 1956, there is no longer any express ban or prohibition under ss. 33 and 36 of the Representation of the People Act against an elector proposing more than one candidate in a single seat constituency, nor is there such a necessary implication in any other provision of the Act. On the other hand the said amendment indicates that it was the intention of Parliament that there should be no ban on the number of candidates to be proposed by an elector for a single seat constituency.
 [248 D-249 B] (ii) The two candidates whose nomination papers were rejected, unnecessarily filled the column indicating their caste. Such a requirement is there only for reserved seats.
 But there is nothing in s. 33(2) or in the rules forbidding the candidate from mentioning his caste, and the mention of caste therefore did not invalidate the nomination papers.
