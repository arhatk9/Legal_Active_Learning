 In an application under O.XXI, r. 90, Civil Procedure Code, the appellants (judgment-debtors) alleged that the sale of their property pursuant to an order of attachment was illegal for material irregularities. The trial Court held that where there was an irregularity in the procedure for sale, the remedy would be to apply to set aside the sale on proof of substantial injury and that there was no fraud in the sale, as alleged by the appellants. On appeal, the first appellate Court held that the auction-purchaser was the husband of the decree-holder and that there was gross under-valuation of the property and so set aside the sale.
 On further appeal, the High Court held that the application of the appellants was defective and not maintainable and the Court had no power to set aside the sale unless facts were alleged and proved by the applicant to the satisfaction of the Court that he had sustained substantial injury by reason of such irregularity.
 Dismissing the appeal, ^ 
 HELD: (1) The judgment of the trial Court should be restored. The trial Court was correct in its conclusion and reasons that the property sold was subject to mortgages and charges and was sold at the correct price, taking into consideration the price of the properties in the neighbourhood and other evidence on record. [1000 E, 1001 G] (2) The judgment of the trial Court was wrongly reversed by the first appellate court. Substantial justice had been done to the parties. [1001-C] (3) The High Court was not unjustified in holding that the application for setting aside the sale was bald and that there was no proper allegation of substantial injury to the appellants. Sometimes, however, there may not be express allegations of substantial injury and the same may appear to be implicit from all facts and circumstances alleged. In the present case, the allegations in the petition could be read to imply substantial injury to the appellants. The trial Court as well as the first appellate court heard the parties and decided the case on the footing that there were allegations of substantial injury to the appellants. [1001 E-F] Luxmidevi v.
