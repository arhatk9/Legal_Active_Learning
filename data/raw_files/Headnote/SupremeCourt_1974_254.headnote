 The respondent is engaged in transport business and owns a fleet of lorries and buses. The respondent purchased new diesel engines and fitted them in the vehicles. He claimed development rebate on the price of the diesel engines purchased in respect of the assessment years 1961-62 and 1962-63. For the accounting year relevant to assessment year 1961-62 the Income Tax Act, 1922 was applicable and for the accounting year relevant to 1962-63 the Income Tax Act, 1961 was applicable. The Income Tax Officer rejected the claim for development rebate in respect of both the years.
 The Appellate Asstt. Commissioner confirmed the decision of the Income Tax Officer. In respect of the assessment year 1961-62. the Tribunal allowed the claim of the assessee for development rebate. The Tribunal, however, rejected the claim made by the asses-see in respect of the assessment year 1962-63. The High Court decided both the references in favour of the assessee, on the ground that the case was covered by the judgment of this Court in the case of Mir Mohammad.
 
HELD : Section 10(2) as in force in the year 1950 when the case of Mir Mohammad was decided has undergone change and at the relevant time the section clearly provided that no allowance will be made in respect of any machinery or plant which consists of office appliances or road transport vehicles. [883D-E; 884C-D] 
FURTHER HELD: The contention of the assessee that the diesel engines retained their character as machinery though they were fitted to the transport vehicles was negatived on the ground that development rebate is allowed on machinery used for the purpose of business carried on by the assessee and in he present case the diesel engines were not used by the assessee for his business. It is the vehicles which were used for the purposes of the business. In section 33 of the 1961 Act, road transport vehicles are expressly taken away from the operation of the section. The High Court was therefore, in error in answering the question in favour of the assessee. [884D-F]
