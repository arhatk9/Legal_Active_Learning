 The assessee was a limited company. it owned extensive lands in which sugar cane was grown and the cane was used by the assessee for the manufacture of sugar in its factory. The cultivation of sugar cane and the manufacture of sugar by the assessee constituted one single and indivisible business. In the assessment year 1957:58, the assessee claimed deduction of remuneration paid to its managing agents under s.10(2)(xv) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, as an item of expenditure laid out or expended wholly or exclusively for the purpose of its business. The Income-tax Officer and the Appellate Assistant Commissioner disallowed a part of the remuneration on the grounds that part of the assessee's business namely cultivation of sugar cane, being an agricultural operation, the income therefrom was not exigible to tax, and therefore, any expenditure incurred in respect of that activity was not deductible. The Tribunal and the High Court on reference, however, upheld the plea of the assessee that the entire sum was deductible.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD: (1) The mandate of s. 10(2)(xv) is plain and unambiguous. To find out whether a deduction claimed is permissible under the Act or not, all that the Court has to do is to examine the relevant provisions of the Act.
 Equitable considerations are wholly out of the place in con- struing the provisions of the taxing statute. If the allowance claimed is permissible under the Act then it has to be deducted from the grow profits, and if it is not so permissible it has to be rejected. [232 H; 233 A-D] In the. present case, the allowance claimed was undoubtedly laid out or expended for the purpose of the business carried on by assessee. The fact that income arising from a part of that business was not exigible to tax under the Act was not a relevant circumstance. [233 D-E] C.I.T., Bombay v. Parakh and (India) Ltd., 29 I.T.R., 661, and C.L T. Madras v. Indian Bank Ltd., 56 I.T.R. 79, followed.
 S.A.S.S. Chellappa Chettiar v. C.I.T, Madras, 5 I.T.R., 97 and Salt & Industries Agencies Ltd. Bombay v. C.LT., Bombay City, 18 I.T.R. 58, referred to.
 (2) Rule 23 of the rules framed under the Income-tax Act says that in computing the taxable income of a business the agricultural income as defined in s. 2 of the Act should be deducted from the tota 231 income for arriving at the taxable income. The rule further says that No further deduction shall be made of any expenditure incurred by the assessee as cultivator or receiver of rent in kind'. If the rule is read with s. 2(1) it is clear that reference to the expenditure incurred by the assessee as a cultivator only applies to the process ordinarily employed by a cultivator in raising the crops and all other incidental and supple mentary activities up to the stage of sale of the produce, and has nothing to do with disbursements such as payment of managing agency commission.
