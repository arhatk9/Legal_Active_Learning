 The High Court passed a peremptory order that " the appeal will stand dismissed " if a certain amount of court fee was not paid within the time granted by the court. The appellant being unable to find money made an application for extension of time before the expiry of the time granted, and offering to make a partial payment asked for further time, The application was (1) [1960] A.C. 336.
 98 764 heard after the expiry of the time and was dismissed on the ground that the appeal had already " stood dismissed " owing to non-payment within the time allowed. The appellant's applications under s. 151 and 0. 47, r. 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure were also dismissed on the same ground although the court expressed sympathy for the appellant. On appeal with a certificate of High Court:
 Held, that such procedural orders though peremptory (condi- tional decrees apart) are, in essence, in terrorem, so that dilatory litigants might put themselves in order and avoid delay but they do not completely estop a court from taking note of events and circumstances which happen within the time fixed and time should have been extended in the circumstances of the case and the court was not powerless to deal with events happening after the peremptory order.
 Lachmi Narain Marwari v. Balmakund Marwari (1925) I.L.R. 4 Pat. 61 (P.C.), referred to.
 Section 148 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in terms, allows extension of time, even if the original period fixed expired and S. 149 is equally liberal; the High Court had ample power to apply those sections and to exercise its inherent powers under S. 151 in order to do justice to a litigant for whom it had expressed considerable sympathy.
