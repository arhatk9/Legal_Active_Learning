 There are about 1,50,000 hawkers in the city of Bombay, one sixth of them being women. Broadly, there are three types of hawkers-those who have four-wheeled carts, those squat on the streets numbering about 1,20,000 and the rest who have stalls to enable them to stand and sell their wares. They sell almost everything under the sun, from hairpins to hot food and vegetables to vides cassettes. They hawk their wares standing or squatting on public streets, which constitutes a serious impediment to the free movement of pedestrian and vehicle a traffic. Some of the streets in Bombay are so incredibly flooded with merchandise sold by hawkers that it is impossible for the pedestrians to walk on those streets The Bombay Municipal Corporation has been making Herculean efforts to clear the streets of these and other obstructions but, those efforts have met with intense opposition from several quarters.
 The Bombay Hawker's Union, a trade which has a large number of hawkers on its membership roll and which has been unsuccessfully negotiating with the Municipal authorities for the creation of a hawker's zone and for granting adequate number of licences to hawkers to enable them to carry on their trade and business, along with petitioner No 2 the President of the Bombay Hawker's Union and incidentally a corporator has challenged the Constitutional validity of the provisions of sections 313, 313-A, 314(3) and 497 of the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, 1888 on the ground that they confer upon the respondents unguided power to refuse to grant or renew licences for hawking and to remove the goods without affording to the hawkers an opportunity to be heard. There writ petitions were filed by those who carry on the business of hawking contending that they have a fundamental right to carry on their trade business or calling. with which the respondents are unlawfully interfering by arbitrarily refusing to grant or renew licences for hawking, which renders them liable to be removed along with their goods, from places where they to their business.
 850 During the pendency of the writ petition, on the intervention of the Court, the Municipal Corporation formulated a scheme for the licensing of hawkers in Greater Bombay by creating hawking zones. Preferring to adopt "non liquet" as to the validity of the challenge by the petitioners to certain provisions of the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, the Court considered the merits and feasibility of the scheme and suggested modalities to be adopted by the Corporation in so far as hawking and non- hawking zones are concerned.
 Disposing off the writ petitions, the Court, ^ 
 HELD: 1.1 The right conferred by Article 19(1) (g) of the Constitution to carry on any trade or business is subject to the provisions of clause (b) of that Article, which provides that nothing in sub-clause (g) of Article 19(1) shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes, or prevents the State from making any law imposing. in the interests of the general public, reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said subclause. Here, the affidavits filed on behalf of the respondent in unmistakable terms show that the impugned provisions of the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act are in the nature of reasonable restrictions, in the interests of the general public, on the exercise of the right of hawkers to carry on their trade or business [855 C-D] 
 1.2 No one has any right to do his or her trade or business so as to cause nuisance, annoyance or inconvenience to the other members of the public. Public streets, by their very nomenclature and definition, are meant for the use of the general public. They are not laid to facilitate the carrying on of private trade or business. If hawkers were to be conceded the right claimed by them, they could hold the society to ransom by squatting on the centre of busy thoroughfares, thereby paralysing all civic life. Indeed, that is what some of them have done in some parts of the city. They have made it impossible for the pedestrians to walk on footpaths or even on the streets properly so called.
 [855 E-G] 
 2.1 As to the merits and feasibility of the scheme formulated for the licensing of hawkers in Greater Bombay by creating hawking zones formulated by the Municipal Commissioner in letter No. MDG/2418 dated 30th September, 1983, and in particular the eight conditions subject to which the Commissioner proposes to grant licences to the hawkers, no exception can be taken to conditions (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) (vii) and (viii) except that conditions (ii) and (viii) require a little modification. The first part of condition (ii) beginning with the words "they should not put up any stall" and ending with the words "nor should they hawk on handcarts" may stand. But, the second part of that condition should not be construed to mean that the hawkers will not be entitled even to protect their wares against the sun, rain, wind and so on, by spreading a cloth, plastic sheet, chaddar, tarpaulin etc. The object of that condition is to ensure that no construction is put up and no handcarts are used. In so far as condition No. (viii) is concerned, all that it should be understood to mean is that the fact that a daily fee is charged will not confer upon the hawker the right to do his business at any particular place That is because, the daily fee is a kind of licence fee to do businees it is not a fee charged for doing business 851 at any particular place. The Commissioner will, therefore, be free to impose conditions (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (vii) and (viii) while granting licences to the hawkers in the Hawking Zones, after making the necessary clarifications in conditions (ii) and (viii). [859 GH-H 860 A-C] 
 2.2 Condition (v) is an unreasonable restriction on the hawkers' right to carry on their trade or business. There are several working families in Bombay, belonging to different strata of society, which depend upon the food supplied by hawkers. The hawkers cannot be denied the right to sell cooked food, cut fruits and the like. That will, of course, not confer upon them the licence to sell adulterated or unhygienic food. They shall have to comply, like any other vendor of food, with the Municipal licensing regulations and the provisions of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954. [860 C-D] 
 2.3 The hours of business mentioned in condition (vi) should be from 7 A.M. to P.M. instead of 7 A.M. to 9 P.M. In cities like Bombay, nights are quite young at 10 P.M.[860 D- E] 
 3. In so far as Hawking and non-hawking Zones are concerned, the Commissioner should adopt the following modalities:- (a) As far as possible, there should be one Hawking Zone for every two contiguous municipal wards in Greater Bombay.
 (b) The Non-Hawking Zones may be fixed by the Municipal Commissioner in his discretion, in consultation with the Bombay Municipal Corporation.
 (c) In areas other than the Non-Hawking Zones, licences should be granted to the hawkers to do their business on payment of the prescribed fee. That will be without prejudice to the right of the Commissioner to extend the limits of the non-Hawking Zones in the interests of public health, sanitation, safety, public convenience and the like.
 (d) Hawking licences should not be refused in the Hawking Zones except for good reasons. The discretion not to grant a hawking licence in the Hawking Zones should be exercised by the Commissioner reasonably and in public interest.
 (e) In future, before making any alteration in the scheme the Commissioner should take into confidence all public interests, including the hawkers, the Commissioner of Police and representative associations of the public such as the one which appeared before us. Hawkers have the right to do their business, subject to reasonable restrictions in the interests of the general public The Police Commissioner is in the best position to speak about the law and order problem as well as the traffic hazards created by street trading. The general public has a stake in showing how and why the hawking trade should 852 be regulated. The power conferred upon the Commissioner by section 313-A of the Act to grant licences to hawkers is in the nature of a discretion coupled with a duty. It is, therefore, essential that the said power should be exercised by consulting all concerned interests and guided by considerations of what is in the interests of the general public. The scheme framed by the Commissioner will have a binding effect on all concerned. [860 E-H,861A-D]
