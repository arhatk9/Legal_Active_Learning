 There was a dispute regarding the ownership of certain land between a Jenmi family and the State Government, and the Jenmi family filed a suit for declaration of its title.
 While the dispute was pending, the appellant applied to the Conservator of Forests for registration of the lands in his name under the Travancore Land Conservancy Act, 1916, but the application was rejected. After the suit filed by the Jenmi family was dismissed, the appellant who was in possession of the land, was dispossessed. The appellant, thereafter. filed a suit for the value of improvements affected by him on the land by planting trees and constructing a building.
 The trial Court decreed the suit for the value of the building but rejected the rest of claim. The High Court dismissed his appeal.
 In appeal to this Court, it was contended that : (1) there was no order of forfeiture of improvements as required under s. 9 of the Act; (2) the appellant was entitled to compensation under general, law; and (3) the appellant was not served with a notice to quit as required by s. 9 of the Act to enable him to cut and remove the trees.
 Dismissing the appeal, HELD: (1) Section 9 provides for two notices to be given :
 (a) one notice to be given to the person in unauthorised occupation of government land to vacate within a reasonable time, and (b) another for forfeiture of any crop or other product raised on the land or to remove any building or other structure within a reasonable time. The words 'raised on the land' qualify both the 'crop' and 'other product', and so, the words 'other product' have to be read in the context of the word 'crop'. So read, trees would not be in- cluded within the meaning of 'other product raised on the land in s. 9 of the Act, and therefore. there is no obligation on the respondent to give notice of forfeiture.
 [405D-H; 406E] Clark and Another v. Gaskarth, [1818] EngR 490; 8 Taunt 431, applied.
 (2) (a) The trial court and High-Court found on the evidence that the appellant's possession commenced only after his application for registration was rejected, and that. the improvements, if any, were effected by him only thereafter, with full knowledge that the title to the lands was in dispute. Therefore, he could not be said to be a bona fide trespasser. It could not also be contended that nevertheless he was a bona fide trespasser entitled to com- pensation on the basis that he entered upon the land with a bona fide intention of improving the land. Such a contention would give validity to a dangerous principle which will condone all acts of deliberate and wrongful trespass, be-cause, any person desperate enough to trespass on other man's land without any claim of title can always plead that he had a bona fide intention of improving the land whether or not the owner of the land wanted the improvement. The maxim of English law quicquid plantatur solo, solo cedit (whatever is affixed to the soil belongs to the soil) is not applicable to India. but that is not to say that wrongful trespasser can plant trees on someone else's land and claim a right to those trees after he is evicted.
 [406E-H; 407A] Vallabdas Narainji v. Development Officer, Bandra, A.I.R.
 1929 P.C. 163, applied.
 400 (b) in any case, the position of a trespasser cannot be better than that of a lawful tenant, who, having lost his possession cannot claim compensation or damages for anything erected on the land or any improvements made therein. [407H] (3) There are no clear allegations in the plaint that the appellant was evicted without notice. No issue had been framed regarding the notice of eviction not being given and no application for framing such an issue was filed in the trial court, or the High Court or this Court. Therefore, the appellant, who was not a mere trespasser but one who had deliberately entered upon the land knowing fully well that he had no right, claim or title to the land, or any manner of right to enter the land, and who had been rightly evicted as a trespasser, should not be permitted to raise such a contention in this Court.
