 The-petitioner was detained by an order made under s. 3 of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971, to prevent him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order, on two grounds. The activity which consti- tuted the substratum of the first ground of detention was a case of inter-state smuggling of essential commodities. The other facts mentioned, in addition to smuggling in the ground, are (a) that the detenu and his associates had threatened the Home Guards who arrested them, and snatched away the seized commodities from the custody of the Home Guards. and, (b) that his activity came within the purview of ss. 143/185/332/506, I.P.C. and s. 7(i) (a) (ii) of Act X of 1955.
 Allowing the petition under Art. 32 challenging the order of detention, 
HELD: (1) Section 3(1)(a) of the Act confers power on the authority for detain a person if it is satisfied that such detention is necessary to prevent him from acting in a manner prejudicial to, (i) the defence of India, the relation of India with foreign powers, or the security of India, or (ii) the security of the State or the maintenance of Public Order. or (iii) the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community. The power can be exercised only on, one or more of the grounds enumerated, and if the exercise of the power is not, on the face of the order, correlated to any of these grounds or concerns activities which are not germane to any of those grounds, such exercise would be vitiated for lack of jurisdiction.
 Further the satisfaction spoken of in s. 3(i) which is the sine qua non for the exercise of power, is the subjective satisfaction of the authority which cannot be tested in court by objective standards. Ordinarily, therefore, the court cannot go behind the satisfaction expressed on the face of the order. Thus, where the order ex facie is made with a view to prevent an act prejudicial to the maintenance of public order, the detaining authority cannot be permitted 'to show that in fact the order was made to prevent an act prejudiced to the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community. [534B-G] (2) Ordinarily, smuggling is a calendestine activity and its concept is repugnant to what is public. But cases are conceivable where the act of smuggling may be accompanied by such violence or disorder that it throws out of gear the even tempo of the life of the community in the locality or disturbs public tranquility. [535F-H] In the present case, there is no mention that the detenu or his associates were armed with any deadly weapons, or that their acts had caused panic and terror among the people of the locality. The incident was confined to the detenu and his associates on one hand and the home guards who checked them on the other. it was not an activity which was prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. The first ground of detention had, therefore, no real nexus with the maintenance of public order. [536B-C] (3) The activity could at the most be said to be an activity affecting law and order. The order cannot be justified on the ground that the activity was prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community, because, the Court cannot go behind the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority as expressed in the detention order and permit it to justify its order on a ground different from the one mentioned on the face of the order. The fact that the activities of the detenu constituted the various offences mentioned in the order was only a conclusion drawn by the authority. [536A-B, C-E] 532 (4) It could not be said that whenever any act is accompanied by show of force or threat to any public servant entrusted with the maintenance of law and order, it must necessarily fall within the category of art act prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. In every case the broad test to be applied is whether the act was of such a magnitude and gravity that it had disturbed the even tempo of the life of the community in the area and that, essentially, is a question of fact depending on the circumstances of each case.

 Writ Petition No. 476/74 decided on 22-1-75 referred to.
 (5) If one of the several grounds of detention is found to be irrelevant, the order of detention shall stand vitiated, because, it cannot reasonably by predicated to what extent the irrelevant ground had influenced the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority. [536E-F]
