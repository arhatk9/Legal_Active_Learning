 R filed his income-tax and excess profits tax returns before the Income Officer/Excess Profits Tax Officer for the assessment years 1942-43 and 1943-44 and the corresponding chargeable accounting periods. He complied with the statutory notices issued to him by the said Revenue Officer but died before the assessments could be made. He was survived by A, his second wife, his children by her, and by S, his son by a predeceased wife. In his will A and another person B were named'-as executors and S was disinherited. S performed the observation at the funeral of R and on this information the Revenue Officer gave notice to S asking him to show cause why assessment should not be made on him as the legal representative of R. It was objected by S that he was not legal representative, but he failed to produce a copy of the will. The Revenue Officer thereupon completed the assessments on the estate of R by his legal heirs and representatives among whom he included S, A and her.
 children. On appeal by S the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, before whom a copy of the will was produced, set aside the assessments and directed the Revenue Officer to make fresh assessment on the executors in accordance with s. 24B of the Income-tax Act, 1922. Pursuant to the direction the Revenue Officer issued notice to the executors. R's widow A accepted the notice and requested the Revenue Officer to issue the copies of the record to enable her to make representation. The Revenue Officer held that it was not necessary to go through the formalities again. He completed the assessments on 29th October 1952 more than four years after the end of the assessments, years 1942-43 & 1943-44 respectively. In appeal by A the Appellate Assistant Commissioner held that the assessments were validly made on a valid direction by the previous Appellate Assistant Commissioner. He however set aside the assessments and directed the Revenue Officer to complete them after giving the executrix a fresh opportunity to object to the assessment. The Tribunal upheld the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. In reference the High Court held that the first assessment having been made on S who was not a legal representative, the direction given by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner was outside the scope of s. 34(3) of the Act. The High Court also gave a finding that s. 24B was applicable to the proceedings but that in the present case the section had not been complied with inasmuch as the procedure for making assessment had not been followed de novo In appeals before this Court filed by the Revenue as well as by A the questions that fell for consideration were : (i) whether s. 34(3) 2nd proviso saved the assessments in the 808 present case from the bar of limitation and (ii) whether s.
 24B applied to the case.
 
HELD,: (i) The second proviso to s. 34(3) of the Act applied to the present appeals because, first the proceedings against R commenced on filing of returns before the Income tax authorities. Secondly, the assessment proceedings continued after the death of R against the legal representatives S and A; thirdly, the assessment proceedings on being set aside and not cancelled pursuant to the appeal filed by S on the ground that notice was not given to A were continued and fourthly, the setting aside of the assessment was only on the ground that notice was not given to and therefore the finding and direction was vital to the assessment proceedings. The High Court was in error in holding that the assessments were barred by limitation. [815 C-D] Income-tax Officer, Sitapur v. Murlidhar Bhagwandas, 52 I.T.R. 335 and S. C. Prashad & Anr. v.Vasantsen Dwarkadas & Ors. 49 I.T.R. 1, distinguished.
 (ii) The High Court correctly held that s. 24B of the, Act applied to present case. The third sub-section of s. 24B deals with !a case of a person dying after having furnished a return. Further in the present case the Income-tax Officer had reason to believe the return to be incorrect, and he called upon R to furnish evidence. The Act further confers power on the Revenue Officer to make the assessment and determine the tax payable by the deceased on the basis of the assessment and for that purpose to issue appropriate notice which would have had to be served upon the' deceased had he survived and in that behalf to require from the executor, administrator or other legal representatives of the deceased person any accounts or documents or further evidence which he might under the provisions of ss. 22 and 23 require from the demand person. [815 G-H] [Counsel for the Revenue did not impeach the conclusion of the High Court that in relation to A the provisions of s.
 24B of the Act were to be followed de novo.]
