 The petitioner was arrested on December 6, 1964 for an offence under 3 of the Official Secrets Act. On March 11 the investigating officer made a report to the Magistrate that there was insufficient evidence to charge the accused, and thereupon the Magistrate discharged the petitioner.
 Immediately after the petitioner came out of the jail he was served with An order under r. 30(1) (b) of the Defence of India Rules under which he was to be detained in order to prevent him from acting in a manner Prejudicial to the defence of India, public safety, and India's relations with foreign powers. He was then arrested and sent to jail in accordance with the further orders of the Government of India under r. 30(4) of the Rules. In a petition under Art.
 32 it was contended on behalf of the petitioner that in view of this Court's decision in Rameshwar Shaw's case the detention order was illegal; it was also illegal for the that in the circumstances of the case it was mala fide.
 
HELD:(i) What was decided in Rameshwar Shaw's case was that when a person was already in jail and would continue in jail custody for an indefinite length of time it could not be postulated about him that if he was not detained he would act in a prejudicial manner. In the present case the petitioner was not to continue in jail indefinitely but on the other and stood discharged in the criminal case. [316 G] It was further held in Rameshwar Shaw's case that the past activities in the basis of which detention order is passed against a person should Ordinarily be proximate in time. In the present case the petitioner had been in jail only for three months and it could be said that the conduct of the petitioner before this period of three months was not proximate enough to justify an order of detention based on that conduct. [317 D] Rameshwar Shaw v. District Magistrate, Burdwan [1963] INSC 190; [1964] 4 S.C.R. 921 distinguished.
 Smt. Godavari Shamrao v. State of Maharashtra, A.I.R. 1964 S.C. 129, referred to.
 (ii)It may very well be that the executive authorities felt that it was not possible to obtain a conviction for a particular offence under the Official Secrets Act; at the same time they might reasonably have come on the conclusion that the activities of the petitioner which had been watched for over two years before the order of detention was passed were of such a nature as to justify the order of detention.
 From the mere fact that the authorities decided to drop the case under the Official Secrets Act and thereafter to order the detention of the petitioner, it cannot be inferred that the order of detention was mala fide. [317 G-H] 314
