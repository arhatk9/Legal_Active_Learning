 The petitioners were members of Parliament. They were detained by orders passed by the State Government under r.
 30(1) (b) of the Defence of India Rules, 1962. They challenged the validity of the orders of detention on the grounds that : (i) rule 30(1) (b) was invalid because, a legislator cannot be detained so as to prevent him from exercising his constitutional rights as such legislator while the legislative chamber to which he belongs is in session; and- (ii) the impugned orders were passed mala fide as they were passed for the purpose of stifling the;
 petitioners' political activities which were inconvenient to the State Government. It was also urged that the orders were passed by the Chief Minister of the State without satisfying himself of the necessity of detaining the petitioners merely because the Union Home Minister thought that the petitioners should be detained. The respondent raised a preliminary objection that the petitions were incompetent in view of the Order issued by the President of India under Art. 359(1), suspending the rights of any person to move any court for the enforcement of the rights conferred by Arts. 14, 21 and 22 for the period during which the Proclamation of Emergency issued under Art. 352 was in force, if such person had been deprived of any such rights under the Defence of India Act, 1962, for any rule or order made thereunder.
 
HELD : (i) The last clause of the Presidential Order postulates that the Defence of India Act or any rule or order made thereunder is valid. During the pendency of the Presidential Order, the validity of Act, rule or order made thereunder cannot be questioned on the ground that they contravene Arts. 14, 21, (and 22; but this limitation will not preclude a citizen from challenging the validity of the Act, rule or order made thereunder, on any other ground.
 [410 F-G] The petitioners contended that r. 30(1)(b) under which the impugned orders of detention had been passed was invalid on grounds other than those based on Arts. 14, 19, 21 and 22.
 If that plea was well-founded, the last clause of the Presidential Order was not satisfied and therefore the bar created by it suspending the citizens' fundamental rights under Arts. 14, 21, and 22 could not be pressed into service by the respondent. The petitions, therefore, were not incompetent. [412 B] Makhan Singh v. The State of Punjab, [1964] 4 S.C.R. 797, followed.
 (ii) Rule 30(1)(b) is not invalid. [421 A] Articles 79, 85, 86 and 100(1), relied upon by the petitioners cannot be said to deal with any rights which can be, described as 'constitutional 407 rights of the members of Parliament. The totality of rights cannot claim the status of fundamental rights and the freedom of speech on which reliance was placed is a part of the privileges failing under Art. 105. A plea that a breach has been committed of any of these privileges could not be raised in view of the decision of the Committee of Privileges of the House of Commons in the case of Captain Ramay, because the privileges, powers and immunities of the members of the Indian Legislature are the same as those of the members of the House of Commons as they existed at the commencement of the Indian Constitution. Besides, freedom of speech would only be available to a member of Parliament when he attends the session of Parliament. If an order of detention validly prevents him from attending a session of Parliament, no occasion arises for the exercise of the right of freedom of speech and no complaint can be made that the said right has been invalidly invaded. [415 G-H; 419 B-D] If a person who is convicted and sentenced for a period less than two year such a conviction would not entail disqualification for being a member of Parliament-has necessarily to forego his right of participating in the business of the legislature to which he belongs, because he is convicted and sentenced it would follow that a person who is detained must likewise forego his right to participate in the business of the Legislature. Therefore, it could not be contended that so long as the member of Parliament had not incurred any disqualification, he was entitled to. exercise his rights as such member. [419 H; 420 A-B] The true constitutional position, therefore, is that so far as a valid order of detention is concerned, a member of Parliament can claim no special status higher than that an ordinary citizen and is as much liable to be arrested and detained under it as any other citizen. [420 E-F] (iii) In view of the facts that the detention of the petitioners formed" part of a larger question about the attitude which the Government of India and the State Governments should adopt in respect of the activities of the party to which the petitioners be-longed, namely, the pro- Peking faction of the Communist party, and that the issue was examined by the, Union Home Minister along with the Chief Ministers of States and only general decisions in relation thereto were, arrived at, and that the Chief Minister of the State had made a clear and unambiguous statement in his affidavit that he had examined the materials in relation to the activities of the petitioners and was satisfied that it was necessary to detain them, there was no substance in the grievance of the petitioners that the impugned orders of detention were made either mala fide or without the. proper satisfaction of the detaining authority.
