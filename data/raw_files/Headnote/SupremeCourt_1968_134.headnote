 The appellant filed his nomination paper for a seat to the Vidhan Sabha of a constituency different from the one in which his name was included as a voter. With his nomination paper, the appellant had produced an application for a certified extract on the reverse of which was recorded a certificate, containing relevant entries from the Voters' list. The entries in certificate did not tally in all respects with the entries in the voters' list, in that it failed to set out the age of he appellant and his house number. No objection to the nomination paper was raised before the returning officer. The returning officer accepted the nomination and held that the particulars were correct, and that the appellant was over 25 years of age.
 The appellant was declared elected. The first respondent, an unsuccessful candidate, challenged the validity of the election of the appellant on the ground that the appellant had failed to produce before the scrutiny of nomination paper, the electoral roll or a certified copy of the relevant entries in the roll in which his name was included as voter as required by s. 33(5) of the Representation of the People Act. The High Court set aside the election. In appeal, this Court :
 HELD:The appeal must be allowed.
 The copy of the relevant entries from the electoral roll relating to the appellant was defective. But under s. 36(4) the returning officer is entitled to accept the nomination paper even if it be defective, if the defect is not of a substantial character : indeed he is enjoined not to reject the nomination paper unless the' defect is of a substantial character. The details for identifying the appellant as an elector were duly furnished. His age was mentioned in the nomination paper, though it was not to be found in the certified copy produced by the appellant. No objection was raised to the acceptance of the nomination paper on behalf of the contesting candidate and his agents present at the scrutiny. The returning officer satisfied himself by personal inquiry that the appellant was above the age of twenty-five and competent to stand for election. it was true that he did not come to the conclusion that the defect in the copy of the electoral roll was of a substantial character. [204 G-H; 205 A-B] The decision of the returning officer in the matter is not final and in appropriate cases it is open to the Court to reach a different conclusion in an election petition. In this case, the appellant was not negligent nor was the purity of election process likely to be affected on account of the defects in the COPY produced by the appellant. The defects in the certificate were not of a substantial character. Therefore the returning officer did not err in not rejecting the nomination paper.
