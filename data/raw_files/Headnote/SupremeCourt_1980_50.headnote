 The appellant plaintiff filed a suit for eviction of the respondent tenant and for arrears of rent and mesne profits. Though no specific plea of relief against forfeiture for non-payment of rent under section 114 of the Transfer of Property Act was taken in the pleadings, during the course of the arguments, the tenant claimed the benefit under section 114 of the Transfer of Property Act. The Trial Judge found that the respondent was a defaulter and held that the notice to quit was a valid one but found that as section 114 of the Transfer of Property Act was applicable to the facts of the case and the balance of convenience being with the respondent tenant, dismissed the suit for possession, but gave a decree for arrears of rent. In appeal the first appellate court held that the trial Court was in error in granting relief against forfeiture under Section 114 of the Transfer of Property Act and decreed the suit as prayed for.
 On second appeal, the High Court after making a fresh appraisal of the evidence came to the conclusion that as per the terms of the lease deed of 1955 six months' notice was necessary even if the premises were not taken for manufacturing purposes and as required notice of six months was not given the suit was not maintainable and as such liable to be dismissed.
 Allowing the plaintiff's appeal by special leave, the Court, ^ 
 HELD : 1. Once the requirements of Rent Act are satisfied, the tenant cannot claim the double protection of invoking the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act or the terms of the contract. The provision of section 114 of the Transfer of Property Act cannot therefore be read into the U.P. (Temporary) Control of Rent and Eviction Act. [99 B 
 In the instant case (a) The question of termination of the lease by forfeiture does not arise on the facts of the case; [100 B] (b) after the Rent Act came into force, the landlord cannot avail himself of clause 12 which provides for forfeiture, even if the tenant neglected to pay the rent for over two months; [100 B] (c) the landlord cannot enter into possession forthwith without notice. The only remedy for him is to seek eviction under the provisions of the Rent Act; and [100 B C] 94 (d) in such circumstances, the tenant cannot rely on S.
 114 of Transfer of Property Act and claim that he should be given an opportunity to pay the arrears of rent, even though the requirements of section 3(1) had been fulfilled. [100 C] V. Dhanapal Chettiar v. Yasodai Ammal, [1980] 1 S.C.R.

 2. Section 3 of the U.P. (Temporary) Control of Rent and Eviction Act III restricts the rights of the landlord to have the tenant evicted. But for the statutory provisions, the landlord would be entitled to evict the tenant according to the terms of the contract or the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act. As the Rent Act has restricted the power of the landlord to evict the tenant except in accordance with the provisions of the Act, the terms of the contract and the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act to that extent are no longer applicable.
