 Chapter XXX-A of the Orissa Municipal Act, 1950 also empowers the State Government to apply the provisions of the Act to areas other than the towns, called "notified areas".
 Under s. 417-A in that Chapter, before the Government extends the operation of the Act to an area under a municipality it must afford an opportunity to the local residents to object to the proposed action. The objections are submitted to the District Magistrate who forwards them along with his views to the State Government, for deciding as to what should be the precise area to which the Act should be extended, and indeed whether all the provisions of the Act or only certain specified provisions should be so extended.
 In August 1972 the State Government proclaimed their intention to issue a notification under sub-.(1) of s.417-A of the Act in respect of certain areas in the District of Ganjam and invited objections from persons residing within the area. The proclamation was published in English in the Orissa Gazette as well as in a local Oriya newspaper, the "Daily Samaj". Pursuant to this proclamation no objection was received. on March 31, 1977 the State Government issued a notification constituting with effect from April 1, 1977, the area of Ganjam and Damodarpur villages as a notified area in terms of sub-s.(1) of s. 417-A and making all the provisions of the Act applicable.
 The residents of the said two villages challenged the validity of the notification dated March 31, 1977 under Article 226 of the Constitution on two grounds : (1) that the proclamation conveying the intention of the Government to constitute a notified area was vague in content and did not specify whether all the purposes of the Act or only some of them, and if so 350 which, were to be the subject of administrative provision in relation to the area and thus they were deprived of a full and proper opportunity to express their views on the proposal of the Government and (2) that most of the residents did not know English and as the proclamation was made in the English language, both in the Orissa Gazette and in the local newspaper, the publication served no purpose and was contrary to the intent of the statute. Both the grounds found favour with the High Court and consequently the notification was quashed.
 Dismissing the appeal of the State, ^ 
 HELD :1. The declaration that the State Government intends to issue a notification under sub-s.(1) of s.417-A does not satisfy the statutory requirement because a notification under that sub-section may either be for all the purposes of the Act or for any of them. In the instant case, while it may be possible to say that the areas covered by the proposal are indicated with sufficient precision, it is not possible to hold that all the purposes of the Act or only some of them were intended for administrative provision in the proposed area. Therefore, the proclamation made under sub-s.(1-a) of the s.417-A was ambiguous and incomplete and was not the kind of notification which would ensure that the intention behind making it and calling for objections would be served. [354 F-H] 
 2. Sub-s.(1)(a) of the s.417-A of the Act requires that the proclamation should be published in the Official Gazette and also at least in one newspaper circulating in the area.
 In the instant case the proclamation was made in the English language in the Gazette as well as in the local newspaper.
 The Oriya Gazette is published in English, and that being so the intention of the legislature in sub-s.(1)(a) must be construed to be that the proclamation in the gazette should be in the English language. So far as the proclamation in the newspaper was concerned, Rule 602 of the Orissa Municipal Rules 1953 does not prescribe the language in which the proclamation under sub-s.(1) of s.417-A of the Act has to be made. Having regard to the object with which a proclamation is required to be published under sub-s.(1)(a) of s.417-A of the Act and in order to make all persons residing within the area to understand the proposal and to submit their objections, it must be published in the local language of the area in which the newspaper circulates and with which the residents are familiar. The local language of the area is Oriya and, therefore, the State Government should have published the proclamation in the newspaper in that language. [354H 355 A-H 356 A-B] 351
