 D died in 1940 leaving certain agricultural land as well as house property. He had two children by his first wife the elder of whom was respondent no.. 1. By his second wife, appellant no. 2, he had a son, appellant no'. 1. The family belonged to the Agharia caste and was governed by the Benares School of Hindu Law. In 1956 Appellants 1 and 2 filed a suit in the Court of the Civil Judge Raigarh (now in Madhya Pradesh) claiming that they were entitled to 1/4 th share each in D's estate and that there should be a partition by metes and bounds of joint family property.
 According to their pleadings Ex.D-4 dated December 27, 1943 by which appellant no. 2 accepted a lesser share of the properties than was due to her and her son was executed as a result of coercion by respondent no. 1. The latter along with other respondents contested the suit, relying on Ex.D- 
4. The trial court, the first appellate court, as well as the High Court decided against the appellants who by special leave came to this Court. The questions that fell for consideration were : (i) whether Ex.D-4 was admissible in evidence without having been registered; (ii) whether Appellant No. 2 was precluded from demanding her share because her signing of Ex. D-4 showed acquiescence on her part; (iii) whether a higher share for respondent no. 1 was justified because of the custom of Jethansi in the Agharia caste according to which the eldest son was entitled to a larger -share than others; (iv) whether it was open to the respondents to give oral evidence of actual partition subse- quent to the execution of Ex.D-4.
 
HELD: (i) The recitals in Ex.D-4 showed that there was allotment of specific properties to individual co-parceners and the document therefore fell within the mischief of s.
 17(1) (b) of the Registration Act. It followed that Ex.D-4 was not admissible in evidence to prove the title of any of the coparceners to any particular property or to prove that any particular property had ceased to be joint -property.
 The document was only admissible to prove an intention on the part of the co-parceners to become divided in status.

 (ii) There was no pleading on behalf of the respondents and no issue framed to the effect that by signing Ex.D-4 appellant no. 2 had acquiesced in the division of properties among her sons without claiming the share to which she was entitled under the Mitakshara Law of the Benares 640 School. The respondents therefore could not be allowed to set up the plea of acquiescence by appellant no. 2 [L644 E] (iii) The doctrine of "Jethansi" or "Jeshtbhagam" is now obsolete and unenforceable. The principle of Hindu Law is equality of division and the exceptions to that rule, have almost, if not altogether disappeared. As between brothers or other relations absolute equality is now the invariable rule in all the States, unless, perhaps, where some special family Custom to the contrary is made out. The respondents had failed to prove that such a custom was prevalent in the caste of Agharias to which the parties belonged. [644 F-G;

 (iv) The evidence showed that document Ex.D-4 was intended by the parties to be the sole evidence of partition and since it had been held that Ex.D.4 was not admissible in evidence on account of non-registration to establish when the property was so partitioned, it was manifest that no oral evidence was admissible to prove any subsequent partition having regard to the provisions of s. 91 of the Evidence Act.
