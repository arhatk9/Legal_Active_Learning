 The suit in the present case was for declaring that a dead of settlement executed by the plaintiff's father and the plaintiff's sister in favour of the plantiff's brothers son in respect of certain properties was fraudulent, collusive and invalid and for cancellation of the said document. The trial court dismissed the suit. However in appeal the High Court proceeded on the basis that in the circumstances of the case and in view of the relationship of the parties the trial court should have made a presumption that the donee had influence over the donor and should have asked for proof from the respondents before the High Court that the gift was the spontaneous act of the donor acting under circumstances which enabled him to exercise an independent will and which would justify the court in holding that the gift was the result of a free exercise of the donor's will. The High Court went on to presume from the great age of the donor that his intelligence or understanding must have de- teriorated with advancing years and consequently it was for the court to presume that he was under the influence of the younger son at the date of the gift. In appeal before this Court it was contended on behalf of the defendant-appellant that the judgment of the High Court had proceeded on an entirely erroneous basis and that there was no sufficient pleading of undue influence nor was there any evidence adduced at the trial to make out a case of undue influence.
 
HELD: The whole approach of the High Court was wrong and its decision could not be upheld.
 (i) The law as to undue influence is the same in the case of gifts inter vivos as in the case of a contract and the court trying a case of undue influence must consider in view of s. 16(1) of the Indian Contract Act two things to start with, namely, (1) are the relations between the donor and the donee such that the donee is in a position to dominate the will of the donor and (2) has the donee used that position to obtain an unfair advantage over the donor ? Sub- s. (2) of section 16 illustrates as to when a person is to be considered to be in a position to dominate the will of another. These are inter alia (-a) where the donee folds a real or apparent authority over the donor or (b) when he makes to contract with a person whose mental capacity is temporarily or permanently affected by reason of age, illness or mental or bodily distress. Sub. 1. (3) of the section throws the burden of proving that a contract was not induced by undue influence on the person benefiting by it when two actors are found against him namely that he is in a position to dominate he will of another and the transaction appears on the fact of it or on the vidence adduced to be unconscionable. (334 D-H] Thums under s. 16 the unconscionableness of the bargain is not the first thing to be considered. The first thing to be considered is the relations of the parties. But the High Court neither determined the relationship of the parties as required in s. 16(1), nor did it find that the transaction was unconscionable. Therefore the presumptions made by it were unwarranted by law. [335 D; 339 C] M15Sup. C.I./66-8 332 (ii) Before a court is called upon to examine whether undue influence was exercised or not it must scrutinise the pleadings to find out that such a case has been made out and that full particulars of undue influence have been given as in the case of fraud. These conditions remained unsatisfied in the present case. [336 C-D] (iii) On the evidence in the case the trial court was right in its conclusion that the donor was fully aware of the fact that he had transferred the property to defendant No. 1. It had not been established that he was of unsound mind. [338 E-F] (iv) There could be no presumption of undue influence merely because the donor and the donee were nearly related to each other. Nor could the fact that a grandfather made a gift of a portion of his properties to his only grandson a few years before his death show that the transaction was unconscionable.
