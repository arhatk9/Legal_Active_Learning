 An Industrial Dispute arose between the appellant and the respondents in respect of two matters, namely (1) for terminating the services of the respondents (2) and for paying the respondents at a rate lower than Rs. 55/- per month which was the minimum prescribed wage for workmen of Vacuum Pan Sugar Factories of Uttar Pradesh under the Standing Orders dated October 3, 1958, issued by the Government of Uttar Pradesh. The dispute was referred to the Labour Court.
 The appellant's case was that the work of removal of press mud had been given by the company to a contractor and these respondents were employed by that contractor to do that work. Their services were terminated by the contractor and the management had nothing to do with these workmen.
 Therefore the appellant contended that the management company did not come within the definition of "employer" under the provisions of Uttar Pradesh Industrial Disputes ,Act, 1947. The respondents succeeded in the Labour Court and hence this appeal.
 Held (1) that the respondents are workmen within the meaning of s. 2 (Z), being persons employed in the industry to do manual work' for reward, and the appellant is the employer within the meaning of sub-cl. (IV) of s. 2 (i) as the workman was employed by a contactor with whom the appellant company had contracted in the course of conducting the industry for the execution by the said contractor of the work of removal of press mud which is ordinarily a part of the industry.
 839 (2) that the imposition of restrictions on the appellant's right to carry on trade under the definition of employer in sub-cl. (iv) of s. 2 (i) of the Act is in the interests of the General public and as such the appellant's fundamental right under Art. 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution has not been contravened.
 (3) that in the ordinary grammatical sense the words "employed by a factory" which occur in the definition of the word "workmen" in the Standing Orders include every person who Is employed to do the work of the factory and they are wide enough to include workmen employed by the contractors of the factory also.
 The appellant was not allowed to raise a new plea for the first time in this Court.
 Mahalakshmi Sugar Mills Company v. Their Workmen, 1961 (II) L. L.J. 623, referred to.
