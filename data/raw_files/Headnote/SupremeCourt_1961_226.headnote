 A Hindu undivided family was the beneficiary of 1842 shares in a company; but the shares were held in the names of different members of the family. For the assessment year 1949-50 the Income-tax Officer applied the provisions of s.
 23A of the Income-tax Act, 1922 (as it stood at that time) and ordered that the undistributed portion of the assessable income of the company in the previous year shall be deemed to have been distributed as dividend among the shareholders.
 The proportionate amount of dividend in respect of the 1842 shares after being grossed up was added to the income of the joint family. The assessee-family contended that the divi- dend deemed to have been distributed under s.23A should be assessed in the hands of the shareholders and not in the hands of the family.
 Held, that the dividend deemed to have been distributed under s. 23A of the Act could not be assessed in the hands of the Hindu undivided family but could be assessed only in the hands of the members of the family who were registered shareholders of the company. Under the express words of the section the artificial or notional income bad to be included in the total income of the shareholder. The expression "shareholder" in s.23A meant the person who was shown as a shareholder in the register of the company. The section did not talk of the beneficial owner of the share. The Hindu undivided family was not a shareholder of the Company. The fiction enacted by the legislature must be restricted to the plain terms of the statute.
