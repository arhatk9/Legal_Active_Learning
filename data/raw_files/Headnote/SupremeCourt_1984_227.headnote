 Legislation was undertaken by different States placing restrictions on transfer of lands by members of Scheduled Castes and Tribes in pursuance of the declared policy of the State of safeguarding, protecting and improving the conditions of weaker sections of the society by providing that any such transfer except in terms of the provisions of the different Acts shall be null and void.
 The State Government of Maharashtra by a Government Resolution appointed a Committee to inquire into and report on how far the provisions of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966, the Bombay Tenancy & Agricultural Lands (Vidharbha Region) Act, 1958 the Hyderabad Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1950 and the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 had been effective in giving protection to persons belonging to Scheduled Tribes and to suggest suitable amendments, if any of the existing provisions were found to be inadequate. The Committee submitted its Report, and pointed out that inspite of section 36 (2) Maharashtra Land Revenue Code 1966, and analogous provisions in the earlier Land Revenue Laws, these were not found sufficient, and persons belonging to the Scheduled Tribes because of their poverty, lack of education and general backwardness had been exploited by various persons and deprived of their lands, and recommended that pro. vision should be made for restoring to persons belonging to Scheduled Tribes the lands which had been duly transferred to other persons. After considering the aforesaid recommendation, the State Government of Maharashtra enacted 225 the Maharashtra Restoration of Lands to Scheduled Tribes Act, 1974. This Act was included in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution.
 The Appellant purchased agricultural lands from the father of Respondent No. 2 by a registered sale deed with the prior permission of the Collector as required by Section 47 of the Hyderabad Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act. 1950 and was placed in possession thereof. The Sub-Divisional Officer finding that the vendor was a gond, and a tribal within the meaning of section 2 (1) (j) of the Act initiated suo motu proceedings under section 3 (1) of the Act for restoration of the lands to respondent No. 2, and after enquiry finding that respondent No. 2 had given an undertaking in form III that he required the land for his personal cultivation and was willing to deposit the amount fixed by him for payment of the appellant, directed under section 3 (1) (ii) of the Act that possession should be restored to respondent No 2.
 The appellant preferred an appeal under section 6 to the Land Revenue Tribunal, which upheld the order passed by the Sub-Divisional Officer. The Writ Petition of the appellant, was dismissed in limine and this order was confirmed by a Division Bench of the High Court.
 In the Appeals to this Court, it was contended on behalf of the appellants: (1) that sections 3 (1) and 4 of the Act which provide for annulment of transfers of land by tribals to non-tribals effected during the period from April 1, 1957 to July 6, 1974 and for restoration of possession to them was beyond the legislative competence of the State under Entry 18 in List 2 of the Seventh Schedule, (2) sections 3 (1) and 4 are inconsistent with, take away and abridge the fundamental rights conferred by Articles 14, 19 (1) (f) and 31, (3) The adoption of the date April 1, 1957 as the date from which there was to be an annulment of transfer under sections 3 (1) and 4 was arbitrary and void as contravening Article 14, (4) The Act was violative of Article 14 because it treats equals unequally: in that members of Scheduled Castes who also constitute the weaker section of the society have been discriminated against and there was preferential treatment afforded to non-tribal transferees who had diverted the lands purchased by them to non-agricultural purposes. (5) The definition of non-tribal transferee contained in section 2 (1) (i) offends Article 14 as it permitted an assignee of non-tribal transferee effected prior to March 15, 1971 to escape the consequence of annulment under section 3 (1) and 4, (6) Sections 9A was constitutionally void as it affected the fundamental right of an advocate enrolled by the State Bar Council to carry on his profession guaranteed by Article 19 (1) (g), and the right of the appellants who are non-tribals by being prevented to be represented by a legal practitioner of their choice.
 Dismissing the Appeals.

 HELD: I (i) our Constitution permits and even directs the State to administer what may b- termed 'distributive justice'. The concept of distributive justice in the sphere of law-making conntes, the removal of economic inequalities and rectifying the injustice resulting from dealings or transactions between 226 unequals in society. Law should be used as an instrument of distributive justice to A achieve a fair division of wealth among the members of society based upon the principle: 'From each according to his capacity, to each according to his needs'. Distributive justice comprehends more than achieving, lessening of inequalities by differential taxation, giving debt relief or distribution of property owned by one to many who have none by imposing ceiling on holdings, both agricultural and urban, or by direct regulation of contractual transactions by forbidding certain transactions and, perhaps, by requiring others. l239F-H;
 240A] (ii) The present legislation is a typical illustration of the concept of distributive justice. It is nothing but a remedial measure in keeping with the policy of the State for rendering social and economic justice to the weaker sections of the society. It is intended and meant as an instrument for alleviating opperession, redressing bargaining imbalance, cancelling unfair advantages, and generally overseeing and ensuring probity and fair dealings.'[239E;
 241E; 242C] It seeks to reopen transaction between parties having unequal bargaining power resulting in transfer of title from own to another due to force of circumstances and also seeks to restitute the parties to their original position.

 537, referred to.
 2 (i) The Act strikes at transactions relating to agricultural lands effected between members of Scheduled Tribes who admittedly belong to the weaker sections of the society and persons not belonging to Scheduled Tribes.
 Experience in the past showed that members of the Scheduled Tribes had been exploited due to their ignorance and poverty by members belonging to the affluent and powerful sections of the society to obtain transfer of their lands by way of sale, gift, mortagage, exchange etc. for a nominal consideration or for no consideration at all rendering them practically landless. The Sub Divisional Officers and Collectors due to their multifarious duties accorded sanction to such transfers without application of mind to the prevalent circumstances. The Committee appointed by the State Government pointed out in its Report that the provisions of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code 1966 and the relevant tenancy Laws that were in existence had not been effective in giving protection to persons belonging to the Scheduled Tribes and recommended that provisions should be made for restoring to members of Scheduled Tribes the lands which had been duly transferred by them to other persons.
 The Legislature therefore stepped in and reopened such transactions by directing that lands be restored to the tribal transferers free from all encumbrances on payment by them to the non-tribal transferees the amounts determined by the Collector under Sub-section (4) of s. 3. [246E-H: 247A- C] (ii) The restoration of possession by sections 3 (1) and 4 does not involve any deprivation of the property in the sense that there is unsettling of title without consideration. It makes detailed provisions setting out the conditions subject to which a transfer by a tribal of his agricultural lands to a non-tribal 227 may be nullified and possession restored. The object of the legislation is restitution of the property to the persons to whom the lands originally belonged, A subject to the adjustment of equities between the parties. [247D-F] (iii) The Act in its true nature and character is a law relating to transfers and alienations of agricultural lands by members of Scheduled Tribes in the State to persons not belonging to Scheduled Tribes. Such a law does not fall within Entries 6 and 7 in List III but is within Entry 18 in List II. 1217G] R (iv) The words 'other than agricultural land' in Entry 6 and the words 'but not including contracts relating to agricultural land in Entry 7 in List III have the effect of delimiting the legislative power of the union to make a law with respect to contracts in relation thereto. The power of the State Legislature to make a law with respect to transfer and alienation of agricultural land under Entry 18 in list II carries with it not only a power to make a law placing restrictions on transfers and alienations of such lands including a prohibition thereof, but also the power to make a law to reopen such transfers and alienations. Such a law relatable to Entry 18 in list II of the Seventh Schedule was clearly within the legislative competence of the State Legislature. [248B-D] 
 3. The Act having been placed in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution the submission that sections 3(1) and 4 are inconsistent with, or take away or abridge any of the fundamental rights conferred by Art. 14, Art. l9(1)(f) or Art. 31 of the Constitution must be rejected at the very threshold because it is protected under Art. 31B. [248F] 
 4. (i) It is permissible for the legislature to make a classification on the basis of time for a law to operate.
 What is necessary is that there must be a reasonable nexus between the basis of classification as to time and the object sought to be achieved. [248H] (ii) The Act adopts April 1,1957 for nullification of transfers made by tribals to non-tribals under sections 3(1) and 4 because that was the 'tillers' day. for purposes of the Bombay Tenancy & Agricultural Lands Act, 1948, on the basis of which the non-tribal transferees could apply to the Tenancy Court for purchase of their holdings on the ground that they were in cultivating position thereof. There was therefore reasonable nexus for the fixation of such date and the object sought to be achieved and the impugned Act is not violative of Art. 14. [249A-B] 
 5. (i) The appellants who were transferees from members of scheduled Tribes cannot possibly plead the cause of members of Scheduled Castes Members of Scheduled Tribes i.e.
 tribals who are mostly aboriginals constitute a distinct class who need a special protection of the State. [249E] (ii) There is no question of any differential treatment between two classes of persons equally situate when a part of the land is diverted to a nonagricultural purpose viz.
 the construction of a dwelling house or the setting up of an industry, the State legislature obviously could not have made a law for annulment of transfer of such lands by tribals under Entry 18 in List II as 228 the lands having been diverted to non-agricultural purposes ceased to be A agricultural lands. In the case of such non- agricultural land, if the State Legislature made such a law it would not be effective unless it was reserved for the assent of the President and received such assent. [249G-H;
 250A] 
 6. The expression 'non-tribal transferee' as defined in section 2 (1) (i) is an inclusive one. It is not correct to say that it permits an assignee of a non-tribal transferee effected prior to March 15,1971 to escape the consequences of annulment under sections 3(1) and 4 of the Act. The Legislature appointed March IS, 1971 with a view to give retrospective effect to the provisions of Sections 3(1) and 4 of the Act as that was the dale on which the Government constituted the Committee to inquire into and report to the State Government on how far the provisions of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966 and the relevant tenancy laws had been effective in giving protection to persons belonging to Scheduled Tribes. The provisos to sections 3(1) and 4 are meant to mitigate the hardship which otherwise would because to a non-tribal transferee who would again be rendered landless if he were required to restore the entire land under sections 3(1) and 4 of the Act. [250B-D;; G] 
 7. (i) A person enrolled as an advocate under the Advocate's Act, 1961 is not ipso facto entitled to a right of audience in all Courts unless section 30 of the Advocates Act, 1961 is first brought into force. The right of an Advocate brought on the rolls to practice is, just what is conferred on him by sections 14(1)(a), (b) and (c) of the Bar Councils Act 1926. Section 9A is not therefore an unconstitutional restriction on advocate's right to practice their profession. [251G-H; 252A] (ii) Apart from the provisions of Art. 22(1) of the Constitution, by which an accused who is arrested and detained in custody is entitled to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice, no litigant has a fundamental right to be represented by a lawyer in any Court, In all other matters i.e. in suits or other proceedings in which the accused is not arrested and detained on a criminal charge, the litigant has no fundamental right to be represented by a legal practitioner . [252B-C] (iii) The legislature felt that for implementation of the legislation. it would not subserve the public interest if lawyers were allowed to appear, plead or act on behalf of the non-tribal transferees. A tribal and a non-tribal are unequally placed and non-tribal transferee being a person belonging to the more affluent class, would unnecessarily protract the proceedings before the Collector under sections 3(1) and 4 by raising all kinds of pleas calculated to delay or defeat the right of the tribal for restoration of his lands. The proceedings be. fore the Collector have to be completed with sufficient despatch and the transferred lands restored to a tribal without any of the law's delays. [252D- E]
