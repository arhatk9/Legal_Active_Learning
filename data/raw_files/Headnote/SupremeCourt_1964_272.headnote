 The plaintiff was the highest bidder at the public auction for the sale of the plots of the 1st defendant, but the 1st defendant repudiated the contract. So the plaintiff issued a notice to him asking him to take the earnest money within 24 hours and the balance within a week thereafter, and to execute a sale deed. The plaintiff however did not take any further effective steps to enforce the contract for 7 months, as he was mentally worried on account of the illness of his wife and the demolition of one of his houses by the Municipal Corporation. Then one day, while passing the suit-site he saw foundations being dug therein and within a few days thereafter filed the suit for specific performance of the contract, that is, about 7 1/2 months after the date of the auction. This 1st defendant contended that there was no contract at all because, there was no final bid and the plaintiff's bid was never accepted. The trial court held that there was a contract but that it was not a fit case for decreeing specific performance. On appeal, the High Court gave the plaintiff a decree for specific performance. The 1st defendant appealed to the Supreme Court and contended that the delay disentitled the plaintiff to the discretionary relief.
 
HELD : Except for some delay, there were no circumstances which should induce a court to refuse, in its discretion, to give the relief of specific performance. [231 H-232 A] While mere delay is not sufficient to empower a Court to refuse the relief of specific performance, proof of abandonment or waiver of a right is not necessary to disentitle the plaintiff to the relief. There may be other circumstances, which it is not possible or desirable to lay down, under which a court can exercise its discretion against the plaintiff. They must however be such that the representation by, on the conduct or neglect of, the plaintiff is directly responsible in inducing the defendant to change his position to his prejudice or such as to bring about a situation, when it would be inequitable to give him such a relief. [230 A, C-D] Case law considered.
