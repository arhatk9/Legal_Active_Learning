 The appellant submitted for certification draft standing orders on June 9, 1960 to the Certifying Officer under the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946. The respondents raised an objection that the Certifying Officer had no jurisdiction inasmuch as the Madhya Pradesh Industrial Workmen (Standing Orders) Act, 1959 applied to this industry and the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946. Overruling this objection the Certifying Officer certified the draft standing orders on August 6,1962. The respondents appealed to the Industrial Court, Madhya Pradesh which upheld the objection and set aside the order of certification as void, being without jurisdiction.
 In appeal by special leave:
 355 Held:That though on June 9, 1960 when the draft standing orders were submitted to the Certifying Officer under the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946, the Certifying Officer had no jurisdiction to deal with them, the officer had acquired jurisdiction in the matter before August 6, 1962 when he passed the order certifying the standing orders. The Certification cannot be held to be void merely because on the date when the orders were submitted, the Certifying Officer had no jurisdiction. The application should be deemed to have been renewed immediately after the officer acquired jurisdiction in the matter and so that jurisdiction having continued upon the date of the certification, the certification also would be with jurisdiction and binding.
 Municipal Board, Pushkar v. State Transport Authority, Rajasthan, [1963] Supp. 2 S.C.R. 373, followed.
