 The petitioner owned certain land in the erstwhile State of Pepsu. After August 21, 1956 he transferred one half of the said land in favour of his wife. After this transfer the land remaining in the hands of the petitioner was less than the 'ceiling of 30 standard acres prescribed by the Pepsu Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1955 as amended by Act XV of 1956. However by s. 32FF introduced into the above Act by Art III of 1959 it was laid down that transfers of land after August 21, 1956 to certain relations (to be named by the State Government) were not to affect the right of the State Government under the Act to the surplus area to which it would be entitled but for such transfer or disposition.
 By r. 23A framed under the Act the State Government prescribed the relations. Relying upon s. 32FF and r. 23A the Special Collector, Chandigarh included in the total area held by the petitioner the land transferred by him in favour of his wife and served on him a draft statement holding that a certain extent of big land was surplus area. The petitioner filed a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution challenging the Special Collector's order and the validity of the Act.
 It was urged in support of the petition that : (i) By adding the land transferred to certain relations to the land held by a, person under his cultivation for the purpose of determining the ceiling and the surplus area s. 32FF of the Act. and r. 23 of the rules made thereunder contravened Art.
 31A, 2nd proviso; (ii) The legislature without enumerating the relations or indicating some principles for ascertaining the relations abdicated its legislative function and delegated it to the State Government to prescribe the relations and therefore s. 32FF was void; (iii) The rules prescribed for fixing compensation for the land acquired were ultra vires because they did not take into account the current' value of the cronraised thereon; and the State therefore( was interfering with the petitioner's right to the land, unsupported by law, 
HELD: (i) Section 32FF was enacted in order to prevent transfer of land to relations with a view to evading the provisions of the 1956 Act which imposed a ceiling on the land under the personal cultivation of the landholder. The Legislature certainly is competent to make such a law. The validity of such a provision may perhaps be questioned under certain circumstances on the ground that it is an unreasonable restriction within the meaning of Art. 19(2) of the Constitution. But that was not open to the petitioner as the amending Act giving retrospective operation relates to an 'estate. Therefore Art. 31A operates as a bar against raising any such 537 question. Section 32FF is therefore valid and as the land acquired in the present case was admittedly above the.
 ceiling, the second proviso to Art. 31 had no application.
 [541 A-D] (ii)From the mere fact that the enumeration of relations for the purpose of s. 32FF is left to the State Government it cannot be said that the Legislature had abdicated its function. It has clearly laid down the policy and on the basis -of that policy enumeration can easily be worked out.
 The expression 'relation' is comprehensive and has a local significance. The relatives must be such as those in whose favour benami transactions are usually entered into or those whose benefit is indirectly the benefit of the transferor himself. It is such relations who are mentioned in r. 23A although the mention of sisters has been omitted by mistake.
 [541 EG] (iii) The validity of the rules prescribed for fixing compensation could not be decided by the Court for want of relevant materials on the record. [545 HI
