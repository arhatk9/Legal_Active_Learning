 The appellant had been granted a permit by the Collector for quarrying store upto,June 30, 1957 under the Delhi Minor Mineral Rules 1938 framed under s.155(1) of the Punjab Land Revenue Act, 1887. On the expiry of the term of this permit the appellant applied for another permit but it was refused on the ground that the land had been included 63 in "a controlled area" reserved for other purposes by proceedings under the Delhi (Control of Buildings) Act, 1955. The appellant filed a suit praying for a declaration that it had a right to quarry stones from the land in suit without a permit as the ownership of the minerals was vested in the landowner from whom it had taken the land and for a mandamus to the collector to grant the permit as the 1955 Act had ceased to be operative after December 30, 1937.
 Held, that the appellant had not proved its title to the mineral rights in the land and was not entitled to the dec- laration. Section 42(2) Punjab Land Revenue Act, 1887, provided that when in any record of rights, completed after November 18, 1871, it was not expressly mentioned that any quarry belonged to the Government it shall be presumed to belong to the landowners. In the present case neither party produced any such record of rights, and no presumption could be invoked in favour of the owner. The presumption arises only when such a record of rights is before the court and flows from the contents of the document.
 Held, further, that the application for a permit was refused on good and relevant grounds. The subsequent repeal of the Delhi (Control of Buildings) Act, 1955, did not entitle the appellant to an order directing the issue of a permit as no other application for a permit was pending at that time.
