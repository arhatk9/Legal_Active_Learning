 An agreement was signed between the Revenue and the assessees fixing the assessees' income-tax liability for several past years, and fixing instalments for its payment.
 The last instalment was payable on March 31, 1957. It was also stipulated that on the breach of a single instalment the whole amount would become exigible. The Income-tax Officer made the assessment orders in accordance with the agreement. These orders and demand notices to pay the amount by March 31, 1953 were sent to the assessees in September 1952 with letters stating that if there was no default in payment of the instalment due on March 31, 1953, further extension of time for paying the balance will be granted. The assessees filed revisions under s. 23-A of 'the Income-tax Act, 1922 against the orders of assessment.
 The Commissioner held the assessments were properly made as they were made in accordance with the settlement after the assessees' disclosure. Later the earlier agreement for payment by instalments was varied. The main variation in the second agreement was that the penalty was reduced and smaller instalments were fixed. In March 1956 certificates under s. 46(2) of the Act were issued and notices under the Bengal Public Demands Recovery Act, 1913 were served. On the question whether the certificates were barred by limitation under s. 47(1) Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 this Court, 
HELD : (Per Hidayatullah, C. J., Shah, Grover, Ray and Dua, JJ.) The certificates were not barred by time.
 The assessment order reproduced the agreement as part of it and the agreement therefore became the assessment order.
 Under the assessment order a notice of demand was sent to pay the money of the first instalment by March 31, 1953. on breach of it the whole amount was said to be exigible and the demand in 'respect of that was also made. The assessees, therefore, became defaulters on the failure to pay the first instalment. Since instalments were granted, cl. (iv) of the proviso to S. 47(7) applied. That clause does not mention about the exigibility of the whole amount or exigibility of any particular instalment. It only says that if instalments are granted time of one year ending with the end of the financial year is to be calculated from the date on which the last instalment is payable. The language of cl. (iv) of the proviso was unfortunate in expressing this intent and has now been corrected in the new Income-tax Act but theintention was obvious. always Even in the second agreement which replaced the agreement the same condition 468 obtained. There was a concession shown in the matter of penalty and smaller instalments were fixed. But the revenue had stipulated even then that the concession mentioned above would only be available if the revised scheme of payment was strictly followed. in other words, payment was to be made by instalments and this concession therefore, attracted the provisions of cl. (iv). The Government could always accept any instalment even if paid late without having to worry about the period of limitation of one year from the date of demand, since cl. (iv) of the first proviso gave them an option to wait till the last instalment was payable. The scheme of instalments took the matter out of the main part of sub-s. (7) and brought it within the proviso to clause (iv). [476 G477 D] (Per Hegde, J. dissenting) :-If an assessee fails to comply with the demand made in accordance with the provision in s.
 45 within the time mentioned therein then he is 'defaulter' within the meaning of the Act. Unless the assessee is a defaulter, no action can be taken against him under s. 46.
 Non-fulfilment of the terms of the agreement does not amount to a default under s. 45. Sub-section (7) of s. 46, clearly says that no proceedings for recovery of any sum payable under the Act can be commenced after the expiration of one year from the last day of the financial year in which any demand is made under the Act. Under subcl. (iv) of the proviso to s. 47(7) where the sum payable is allowed to be paid in instalments, the one year prescribed in s. 46(7) will be computed from the date on which the last of such instalments was due. The expression "was due" can only mean "is due" under the Act. The expression does not appear to be grammatically correct; this correction has been made in the new Act, but that correction is immaterial for the present purpose. For finding out when the sum claimed 'was due', one must go to s. 45, and cannot fall back on the agreement. Chapter V of the Act has nothing to do with the agreement between the assessees and the revenue. The expression "was due" in s. 46(7) has reference to the tax which is due in accordance with the provisions in ss. 45 and 46.
 In view of the demand notices issued in September 1952 the sum became due when the assessees became defaulters, and therefore the reconvey proceedings under the Act should have been initiated before March 1954. The same having not been initiated before that date, the proceedings in question must be held to have been barred. [478 A-G; 479 F-H]
