 On receipt of information that some gold would be smuggled from Pakistan to India by the engine crew of the train coming from Lahore, the Land Customs staff searched the engine on the arrival of the train at Amritsar and recovered a quantity of gold kept hidden underneath the coal in the tender of the engine. The driver of the engine, the respondent, who was arrested and taken to the Customs Office for interrogation, made statements before the Customs officials admitting his , guilt. On the complaint of the Assistant Collector- of Land Customs, the respondent was tried for offences under s. 23(1) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947, and s. 167(8) of the Sea, Customs Act, 1878, and convicted by the Magistrate, but on revision the High' Court of Punjab set aside the conviction on the.
 grounds inter alia that Customs Officers were police officers within the meaning of that expression in s. 25 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, 339 that confessional statements made to them were consequently inadmissible in evidence and that if they be excluded from consideration there was no other evidence to sustain the coviction.
 Held (Subba Rao, J., dissenting), that Customs Officers are not police officers for the purpose of s. 25 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, and that the conviction of the respondent on the basis of his statements to the Customs officers was maintainable.
 Per Kapur and Raghubar Dayal JJ.---The duties of Customs officers are very much different from those of the police officers and their possessing certain powers, which may have similarity with those of police officers, for the purpose of detecting the smuggling of goods and the persons responsible for it, would I not make them police officers.
 per Subba Rao, J.--Customs officers under the Sea Customs Act, 1878, have the powers, and they also discharge the functions of police officers and, therefore, they are police officers for the purpose of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, in so far as they exercise or discharge such powers and functions. A customs officer is a police 'officer qua his police functions, and a confession made to him cannot be provided against a person accused of an offence. Case-law Reviewed.
