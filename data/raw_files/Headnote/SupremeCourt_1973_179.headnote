 The petitioner came to India from Pakistan on the basis of a Pakistani passport of July 1954 and Indian visa of April, 1956. On his arrest under the Foreigners (Internment) Order, 1962, he contended that he was an Indian citizen and that he had been illegally arrested and confined in jail.
 
HELD : (I) Under s. 9 of the Foreigners Act whenever a question arises whether a person is or is not a foreigner the onus of proving that he is not a foreigner lies upon him. If the petitioner had been in India on 26-1-1950 but had gone to Pakistan in 1951, it would be for the Central Government to decide whether he is a Pakistani national or an Indian citizen even though he may have come lo India on a Pakistani passport in 1956. But, when he went to Pakistan is a matter peculiarly within his knowledge and he had not produced any evidence in support of his statement that he went to Pakistan only in 1951. The burden is upon the petitioner to establish that he is a citizen of India in the manner claimed by him and this burden, not having been dis- charged by him, it should be held that he is a foreigner and his claim that he is an Indian citizen must be rejected.
 [794 C-H] (2) The petitioner was prosecuted under s. 14 of the Foreigners Act and was acquitted on the ground that he was not a foreigner; but this finding would not operate as issue-estoppel. Issue-estoppel arises only if the earlier as well as subsequent proceedings were criminal prosecutions. In the present case, while the earlier one was a criminal prosecution, the latter is not a criminal prosecution, but merely action taken under the Foreigners (Internment) Order for the purpose of deporting the petitioner out of India.
