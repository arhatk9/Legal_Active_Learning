 In the erstwhile State of Travancore Cochin recruitment to the posts of Munsiffs was governed by the Travancore Cochin Munsiffs Recruitment Rules, 1953. After the formation of the new State of Kerala the Kerala Judicial Service (Recruitment of Munsiffs) Rules, 1957 were framed replacing the 1953 Rules. By G.O. No. 850 dated September 24, 1959 the 1957 Rules were amended to make District Magistrates and Sub-Divisional Magistrates, Grades 1 and 11, eligible for appointment as Sub-Judges and Munsiffs. By G.O. No. 851 dated September 24, 1959 three posts of District Magistrates land eight posts of Sub-Divisional Magistrates were constituted into a separate service outside the civil judiciary so that the incumbents of those costs might continue in them. It was further provided therein that those posts would cease to exist when the incumbents vacated them by retirement or promotion. To further the object of absorption of the excluded magisterial officers into the civil judiciary ad hoc rules were framed in February, 1966 providing that the magisterial officers of the former Tranvancore Cochin State holding posts of District Magistrates shall be eligible for appointment as Munsiffs in the Kerala State Judicial Service.
 In 1966 the Kerala State Judicial Service Rules (Special Rules) were framed, r. 5 of which provides that the service shall consist of officers belonging to category I Subordinate Judges, which term shall include Subordinate Judges posted as District Magistrates (Judicial) and Category II Munsiffs which term shall include Munsiffs posted as Sub-Divisional Magistrates. Rule 6 provides that appointments to Category I will be by promotion- from Munsiffs and for Category II appointment shall be made either by direct recruitment from Bar or by transfer from three named categories, including Additional First Class Magistrates and Sub-Magistrates.
 By a Government Order dated February 12, 1973 (Exhibit P 1) the State Government bifurcated the then existing Judicial Service into two services, namely, the Kerala Civil Judicial Service consisting of Sub-Judges and Munsiffs and the Kerala Criminal Judicial Service 'consisting of District Magistrates (Judicial) Sub-Divisional Magistrates, Additional First Class Magistrates and Sub-Magistrates.
 Para 3 of the Government Order provides; (i)that option will be allowed to all civil judicial officers originally borne on the Magistracy irrespective of whether or not they have been confirmed as full members of the Kerala State Judicial Service to go over to the criminal wing; (ii) that those who opt to the criminal wing and whose options would be accepted by Government will be given posting in the new Criminal Judicial Service, (iii) that all the posts of Sub- Divisional Magistrates will be 865 released for members of the new Criminal Judicial Service and the then incumbents in the Posts Of Sub-Divisional Magistrates will accordingly be posted back as Munsiffs, with the implementation of the scheme, (iv) that persons who have been appointed as District Magistrates on or before the date of implementation of the scheme will be allowed to continue as such, retaining their membership in the civil judiciary, till they are appointed to higher Judicial Service or retire from service, and (v) that if the number of officers who opt to the criminal wing happens to be in excess of the number of posts available for accommodating them in the Criminal Judicial Service, such officers found in excess will be retained in Civil Judiciary for eventual absorption in the Criminal Judiciary as and when vacancies arise consistent with their original seniority in the criminal wing.
 The writ petitioner was originally appointed as a District Munsiff in the, Kerala Judicial Service and was eventually confirmed as a Sub-Judge. After the scheme of bifurcation came into force, he alleged, that he had been, denied option to go over to the criminal wing )because the option contem- plated by the scheme had been confined only to those Civil Judicial- Officers who were "originally home on the Magistracy ". In his writ petition before the High Court, the petitioner challenged the constitutional validity of the scheme on the ground that prior to its introduction, the posts of District Magistrates and Sub-Divisional Magistrates on the criminal side, had been integrated with those of Sub- Judges and Munsiffs on the civil side and that, therefore, there was art integrated Judicial Service in the State;
 after the integration to mark off all the magisterial posts alone and constitute them into a separate category with a separate avenue of promotion leaving officers of civil judiciary to carve out a different channel of promotion was unjustified, discriminatory and violative of Arts. 14 and 16 of the Constitution, (2) the option given only to Civil Judicial Officers "originally home on the magistracy" was unconstitutional because opportunity to exercise similar option was denied to persons who were not originally home on the magistracy.
 The High Court held (1) that prior to the coming into force of the scheme, there had been integration of posts of District Magistrates and the Sub-Divisional Magistrates with those of Sub-Judges and Munsiffs and that singling out of certain posts from the integrated service for a separate avenue of promotion, would be discriminatory; (2) that separation of service into two services and the carving out of separate promotional avenues for the magisterial officers was discriminatory; and (3) that the two government orders which restricted the exercise of option to get into criminal judiciary only to officers originally home on the Magistracy were discriminatory and hit by Arts. 14 and 16 of the Constitution.
 in appeal to this Court it was contended by the State that the power of the State to bifurcate its Judicial, services into two services and, to frame rules governing the service of each wing could never be disputed, (2) that all officers belonging to the two wings always constituted separate cadres of service and there having been no integration there could be no complaint of discrimination, (3) assuming that a complete integrated Judicial Service had come into existence, the classification was based on an intelligible differential and had reasonable nexus with the object sought to be achieved by the scheme of bifurcation and (4) that if the words "originally borne on the magistracy" were construed to mean that option was intended for the benefit of all those officers home on the magistracy before this scheme came into force, hostile treatment, as suggested, would disappear.
 Dismissing the appeals 
HELD : .(per majority) (1) It is open to the State Government to constitute as many cadres in any particular service as it may choose according to the administrative convenience and expediency and, therefore, if the State Government thought of bifurcating its Judicial Service into two wings--civil and Criminal of framing statutory rules governing the recruitment and. conditions of service of the incumbents of each wing, no fault could be found 866 (2) It is not correct to say that prior to the introduction of the scheme of bifurcation a complete integrated Judicial Service in the sense that all magisterial posts on the criminal side (all District Magistrates and Sub-Divisional Magistrates) had got integrated with the posts of Sub-Judges and Munsiffs on the civil side. In the absence of such a complete integrated Judicial Service, it was open to the State Government to bifurcate the service into two wings- Civil and criminal-and to provide for a particular type of option specified therein. [876 B-C] 3(a). The Travancore-Cochin Judicial Service Recruitment of Munsiffs Rules, 1953, which were in force prior to the formation of the new State of Kerala, under which the respondent was recruited as Munsiff, did not specify Magistrates either as a feeder category or a category for recruitment. After the formation of the State, for the purpose of integration of judicial personnel and posts in the former areas of Malabar and Travancore-Cochin and $be former State of Madras, several instructions and orders were issued from time to time. But these had very little to do with the type of integration of all magisterial posts on the criminal side with those on the civil side.
 G.O.MS851/PUC/(Integration) dated September 24, 1959 and G.O.Ms.. 850 dated September 24, 1959 and ad hoc Rules for absorption of T.C. Criminal Judicial Officers dated February 2, 1966 on which the High Court relied appertained to instructions or orders or rules issued by the Governor in the context of integration of judicial posts and judicial personnel drawn from the two integrated units, the Malabar Branch and the T.C.Branch. [876 C-H] (b)Paragraphs 2 and 3 of G.O.Ms 851 and the Rules in G.O.Ms. 850 cannot be read as leading to the inference that there was a general integration of all the posts of District Magistrates and Sub-Divisional Magistrates on the criminal side with those of sub-Judges and Munsiffs on the civil side in the entire State. In the first place both these Government Orders must be understood in the context of the background in which they were issued, namely, integration of services and equation of posts of Judicial Officers drawn from integrated units. Secondly, equation of certain posts done under earlier orders was modified or revised and while so modifying or revising the earlier, equation a provision was required to be made in regard to, three posts of the District Magistrates and eight posts of Sub-Divisional Magistrates which were constituted into a separate service outside civil judiciary with a view to tapper them off to eventual extinction. A provision to continue the then incumbents in their posts till then was also required to be made. In those circumstances it was provided that those incumbents would continue in their posts until the posts were vacated by retirement or promotion or absorption into civil judiciary. A further provision was made that only such incumbents from among the District Magistrates and the Sub Divisional Magistrates of the T.C. branch as may be found to be suitable by the High Court may be taken into civil judiciary as and when opportunities occurred. The rules in G.O.Ms. 850 were made merely to enable the High Court to do so. In other words, the absorption of District Magistrates and Sub-Divisional Magistrates of the T.C.
 Branch into civil judiciary was confined to only a limited number from amongst the then incumbents of the three posts of District Magistrates and eight posts of Sub-Divisional Magistrates who may be found suitable for that purpose by the High Court. It cannot, therefore, be said that there was a general integration of posts on the magisterial side with those on the civil side in the entire State. [878 B-G] (4) The ad hoc Rules, had a limited operation and cannot lead to the inference that there was a general integration of posts on the magisterial side with those on the civil side in the entire State. These rules were expressly framed for absorption of Criminal Judicial Officers of the T.C.
 Branch belonging to the separate service constituted under the relevant Government orders to the Kerala State Judicial Service. Whatever provision had been made in these rules, was merely for the purpose of absorption of such of the Criminal Judicial Officers of the T.C. Branch who were constituted into a separate service outside civil judiciary.
 [878 G-H, 879 B-C] 867 (5) The Kerala State Judicial Service Rules (Special Rules) do not at au show that there was or has been any integration of the posts of District Magistrates and Sub-Divisional Magistrates with those of Sub-Judges and Munsiffs, as suggested by the petitioner. The manner in which the two categories of the service have been described in r. 5 and the manner in which the various sources of recruitment to each of the categories of service have been provided for in r. 6 show that the original status of Subordinate Judges and Munsiffs as ,officers belonging to the civil side of the judiciary has been distinctly retained. The very fact that the expression 'Subordinate Judges' is said to include a Subordinate Judge posted as District Magistrate and that the expression 'Munsiffs' is said to include Munsiffs posted as Sub Divisional Magistrates, clearly shows that the rule making authority intended that notwithstanding that those officers may be posted as District Magistrates (Judicial) or Sub-Divisional Magistrates, they would be retaining their status as judicial officers on the civil side. As regards rule 6 recruitment by transfer can be made from three named sources : Additional First Class Magistrates and Sub Magistrates constituted one such source of recruitment. The note below r. 20 is merely an enabling provision which enables the Government to post any member of Category I as District Magistrate and any member of Category 11 as Sub- Divisional Magistrates under ss. 10, 12 and 13 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. [879 H, 880 A-E] (6) Having regard to the object for which the scheme of bifurcation had been recommended by the High Court, namely, to secure better administration of justice on the criminal side, the option contained in the phrase "orginally home on the Magistracy" in para 3(1) was and is intended for the benefit of all those officers who were borne on the magistracy and had worked as Magistrates at any time before or just prior to the scheme being put into ,operation. The complaint of hostile treatment is devoid of substance and the Government Orders do not violate either Art. 14 or Art.
 
16. [883 C-D] (7) Unless a complete integrated Judicial Service in the manner suggested by the petitioner had come into existence in the State of Kerala, there would be no question of invoking the concept of hostile discrimination under Arts.
 14 and 16 for, it is well settled that a question of denial of equal treatment or ,opportunity can arise only as between members of the same class. Articles 14 and 16 will not be attracted at all unless persons who are favourably treated form part of the same class as those who received unfavourable treatment. [875 D-E] Per Shinghal, J.
 The finding of the High Court that there was integration of the posts is correctand does not call for interference.
 [886 F] (1) The Rules and Orders made full provision for the integration of all ,categories of Judicial Officers in the service or services of the State. The Kerala Judicial Service (Recruitment of Munsiffs) Rules, the Kerala State Higher Judicial Service Rules and the Kerala Subordinate Megisterial Service Rules covered all categories of posts and officers. Assuming that the case of an individual officer remained to be finalised for purposes of his appointment or the fixation of his seniority or pay in the integrated set up, it cannot be said that the process of integration remained incomplete [886 D-E] (2) There is nothing in order Exhibit P 1 order which could be said to impinge on the right to equality guaranteed by Art. 14 of the Constitution in so far as the bifurcation of the integrated judicial Services into criminal and civil wings is concerned. There is nothing to show that the creation of the two services denied equality of opportunity in matters of public employment within the meaning of Art.
 
16. What Exhibit P 1 does is to convey the constitution of a separate wing for the criminal judiciary and civil judiciary for the better administration of justice and the framing of separate rules for the two services. 'Similarly Exh. P 2 is an order implementing the earlier order, Exh.
 P 1, and ,cannot be said to be violative of Arts. 14 and 16.
 [887 D-H] 868 (3) There is nothing in the Constitution or any other law to prevent the State from creating one or more State services, or to divide an existing service into two or more services, according to its requirement. In this case, although, it wag thought in 1956 that an integrated service would meet the requirement them High Court felt that it was necessary to separate the civil and criminal wings of the Subordinate Judiciary. The scheme of bifurcation was brought into exis- tence at the instance of the High Court to secure better administration of justice. There is nothing in the Kerala Civil Judicial Service Rules, 1973, which could be .said to be discriminatory or violative of Arts. 14 and 16 of the Constitution, The rules deal with the constitution of the service, the method of appointment, recruitment of members, training of officers etc. [888 A, C, E-F] (4) The argument that the classification in favour of only those Civil Judicial Officers who were originally borne on the magistracy, was a classification based on intelligible differentia is untenable. Even for the purpose of achieving that object, there could be no reason why those Civil Judicial Officers who, though not originally borne on the magistracy, had acquired sufficient experience of magisterial work after their appointment as Magistrates as a result of the integration of the services after the formation of the State, should have been left out. The classification made by Exhibits P 1 and P 2 between those Civil Judicial Officers who were originally borne on the magistracy and those who came over to the Magistracy thereafter, but before the constitution of the criminal wing of the judiciary, is not a permissible classification and it cannot be said to be correlated to, or to subserve. the object of providing an efficient service to man the posts belonging to the Kerala Criminal Judicial Service [890 C-E] (5) The offending part of the impugned orders and rules which restrict the option to officers originally borne on the magistracy is severable from the rest' of the provisions and the High Court clearly erred in striking down the order% and the rules in their entirety. [890 G] (6) Once it is held that the bifurcation was valid, and there was justification for prescribing the requirement of previous Magisterial experience, it would not be permissible to challenge it with reference to Arts. 14 & 16 of the Constitution on the ground that it carved out separate promotional avenues in the Magisterial section of the judiciary.
