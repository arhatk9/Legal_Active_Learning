 In January 1962, the Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission invited applications for selection for the posts of District Munsifs in the State of Andhra Pradesh. The petitioner applied but his application was rejected on the ground that he aid not fulfil the first condition in para 4A(1) of the Commission, notification which reads thus :-4- A(1)-"that at the time when the petitioner applies he is practicing as an Advocate of the High Court. The question is whether the expression "The High Court" in 'the- notification refers to the Andhra High Court alone or to all the High Courts in India. If the expression means the Andhra High Court then the further question would be whether the Rule prescribing the said requirement is ultra vires as being discriminatory. The Clause in the notification is based on r. 12(b) of the Andhra State Juducial Service Rules and reads that "no person shall be eligible for appointment to the post of District Munsiff by the method specified in column (1) of the table below unless he possess the qualifications specified in the corresponding entries in column (2.) thereof" and among the qualifications specified is the same as in 4(A) (1) of the notification.
 Held, that the subject matter of the rules is the appoint- ment of subordinate judicial officers who would work in courts subordinate to the Andhra High Court, and so, the use of the definite pronoun "The" in the expression "the High Court" clearly indicates that it is not any High Court that is intended but it is the particular High Court of Andhra Pradesh that is in view. Therefore the expression "The High Court" in the context means the Andhra High Court.
 708 Held, further, that though Art. 14 forbids class Legis- lation, it does not forbid reasonable classification for the purposes of legislation. When any impugned rules or statu- tory provision is assailed on the ground that it contravenes Art. 14, its validity can be sustained if 'two tests are satisfied. The first test is that the classification on which it is founded must be based on an intelligible differential which distinguishes persons or things grouped together from others left out of the group; and the second is that the differential in question must have a reasonable relation to the object sought to be achieved by the rule or statutory provision in question. The classification on which the statutory provision may be founded may be referable to different considerations. It may be based on geographical considerations or it may have reference to objects or occupations or the like. In every case, there must be some nexus between the basis of the classification and the object intended to be achieved by the statute.
 The plea that all the rules must be considered together is entirely misconceived. It is quite clear that in testing the validity of any one of these rules, the true scope and effect of the impugned rule itself will have to be considered and the decision of the question would have to be confined to the relevant considerations in respect of the said rule and no more. just as the presence of one invalid rule cannot invalidate the other rules which may be valid, so the presence of a number of valid rules would not help to validate an impugned rule if it is otherwise invalid.
 There is no rational basis for differentiating the advocates enrolled into the Andhra High Court from the rest as the impugned rule purports to do. If the basis of the impugned rule is that a person who applies for appointment to the post of a District Munsiff, should have been enrolled as an Advocate of a High Court, that basis can be satisfied even if the person is enrolled as an Advocate not of the Andhra High Court but of any other High Court. All the High Courts have the same status; all of them stand for the same high traditions of the Bar and the administration of justice.
 The impugned rule has introduced a classification between one class of Advocates and the rest, and the said classification must be said to be irrational inasmuch as there is no nexus between the basis of the said classification and the object intended to be achieved by the relevant scheme of rules. The impugned rule and the corresponding portion of the paragraph of the notification based on it must be held to be ultra vires and unconstitutional.
