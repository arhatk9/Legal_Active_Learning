 By s. 3 of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, 1947 the Central Government was given power, by means of an Order published in the Gazette, to provide for prohibiting restricting or otherwise controlling the import of goods into India. In pursuance of that power, the Central Government issued the Imports (Control) Order. It provided for a system of licensing and r. 3 thereof provided that no person shall import the goods specified in Schedule I except under a licence granted by the proper authority. Rule 6 gave power to the licensing authority to refuse to grant a licence on the ground that the application was defective.
 In order to guide the licensing authorities in the matter of granting licences, the Central Government issued administrative instructions. The instructions provide for the granting of licences to "established importers", that is, persons engaged in import trade for at least one financial year falling within a specified period called the basic period. Instruction 71 of the Instructions provided for division of quota rights of a firm among its partners, when the firm was dissolved. It lays down that the partners shall get their shares in the quota rights according to the provision of the agreement between them. Quotas are for the purpose of informing the licensing authority that a particular person has been recognised as an established importer, and it is for the licensing authority to issue a licence to the quota holder in accordance with the licensing policy for the period with which the licence deals.
 The respondent was a partner of a firm which was an established importer. The firm was dissolved in January 1957 and on 4th March 1957, an application was made to the Chief Controller on behalf of the dissolved firm, for a division of the quota between the partners. Since the application for a licence for January-June period should be made by 31st March, the respondent applied for the grant of licence for the period January-June 1957, on 25th March 1957 without mentioning his quota as required by the Instructions, because the Chief Controller had not by then approved the division of quota rights among the partners.
 Since the application was defective the respondent was informed in April 1957 that before a licence could be given, the respondent should get such approval. In September 1957, the Chief Controller informed the respondent that instructions had been issued to the Joint Chief Controller, who was the licensing authority; but the Joint Chief Controller informed the respondent that a licence could not be issued, since the transfer of quota rights in respondent's favour was recognised by the Chief Controller ,only after the expiry of the licensing period to which the application related. After an unsuccessful appeal, the respondent moved the High Court 263 for the issue of an appropriate writ, and the High Court allowed the petition.
 In his appeal to this Court, the Joint Chief Controller con- tended that, since the transfer of quota rights was a condition precedent to the grant of an import licence, the person in whose favour such a transfer had been recognised or sanctioned was entitled to rely upon that transfer only for a period subsequent to such sanction or recognition and not for any anterior period.
 HELD:(Per P. B. Gajendragadkar, C.J., K. N. Wanchoo, J.
 C. Shah and S. M. Sikri, JJ.) the licensing authority had to deal with the application for a licence on the basis that the approved quotas were given to the partners of the dissolved firm from the date of the dissolution and the agreement to divide, and could not refuse the licence solely on the ground that the approval of the Chief Controller was granted after the expiry of the import period. [269 E, G-H] Since the Chief Controller had no power to refuse division of the quota rights if he was satisfied as to the dissolution of a firm, it follows that when he gives his approval it must take effect from the date of the agreement.
 Otherwise, it would mean that the partners would lose their advantage on account of the delay of the Chief Controller.
 It is true that Instruction 71 provides that there will not be a right to the quota till the transfer of the quota rights is approved by the Chief Controller, but that would not mean that such approval will not relate back to the date of the agreement. Further, the fact that the Chief Controller said in his letter of approval that the quota rights should in future be divided between the partners would not mean that the quotas were to take effect only after the date of approval. It only mean that the original quota of the undissolved firm would, from the date of the agreement of dissolution, be divided between the partners as provided thereunder. [269 H; 270 B, C, E, G; 271 A] Since the application in the present case was made before the approval by the Chief Controller and did not mention what quota the respondent had, the application was incomplete and defective, but that was not the reason for the rejection. [271 F; 272 A] As no Order of the Central Government prohibiting the import of the articles for which the licence was applied was published in the Gazette, it was open to the licensing authority to issue a licence for the period January-June, 1957, even if there was a change in the import policy of the Government of India with respect to those articles. [272 G] Joint Chief Controller v. H. V. Jain, I.L.R. [1959] Mad.
 850, approved.
 Jagannath v. Varadker A.I.R. 1961 Bom. 244, overruled.
 Per Mudholkar, J. (Dissenting) : The Joint Chief Controller's action in refusing to grant a licence for the period January-June, 1957, was well within his powers. On the respondent's own showing the Chief Controller had not recognisedthe division of the dissolved firm's quota rights by the date on which hemade his application.
 The application was therefore defective and liable to be rejected under cl. (6) of the Control Order. The respondent's position was as if, upon that ground the licensing authority refused to grant a licence for a period antecedent to the recognition of the division of quota rights. [278 C, H; 279 A-B] The right to a quota is not a legal right and it is only in pursuance of certain administrative instructions that the licensing authority allots quotas to established importers.
 Where a quota had been allotted to a firm 264 the Chief Controller was empowered to recognise upon the dissolution of that firm the division of the quota allotted to it amongst the members of that firm, but that would not create a legal right in favour of the erstwhile partners to a share in the quota, because, the Chief Controller could refuse to recognise a division in conceivable cases. [281 H;
 282 A-B, D] Further, the instructions provide that, the division is to be recognised by the Chief Controller only for the future.
 The plain meaning of this is that the division is to be made effective only from a date subsequent to the approval of the division by the Chief Controller. [282 H] Even assuming that the Instructions confer some kind of right upon the partners of a dissolved firm, it can be exercised only in the manner and to the extent provided in the instructions, themselves. Not only that the instructions do not provide for any relation back of the recognition of the division by the Chief Controller, to the date of dissolution of the firm, but they clearly provide for the recognition of the division only in future. [282 F- G] Jagannath v. Varudker, A.I.R. 1961 Bom. 244, approved.
