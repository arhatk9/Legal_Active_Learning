 The appellant (assessee) was a company carrying on the business of general insurance. It erected a substantial modem building at a cost of about Rs. 12,00,000 towards the end of 1952. For the accounting year 1953 it wrote off a sum of about Rs. 1,00,000 as representing the depreciation with respect to. various items. The Income-tax Officer disallowed 4/5 of the depreciation on the ground that only a fifth part of the building was utilised for the purpose of the appellant's business and the remaining 4/5 part was let out, and that the rent thereon was exempted under s. 4(3) (xii) of the Income-tax Act, 1922. On appeal by the assessee, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner dismissed the appeal and enhanced the assessment by disallowing even the 115 of the depreciation allowed by the Income Tax Officer, on the ground that under r. 3(b) of the Schedule to the Act, the allowable depreciation was an actual depreciation of the value of the assets. On further appeal, the Appellate Tribunal restored the order of the Income-tax Officer with respect to 115 part but as to the 4/5 part agreed with the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. The High Court, on a reference as 'to whether the 4/5 part of the depreciation was also allowable as a deduction in the assessment completed under s. 10(7) and the rules contained in the Schedule, of the Act, held against the appellant. On appeal to the Supreme Court, HELD : The appeal must be allowed. [374C].
 Rules 3(b) and 6 of the Schedule to the income-tax Act, which are the applicable rules, should be read against the background of the various provisions of the Insurance Act (4 of 1938) making detailed provision to ensure the true valuation of assets and the determination of the true balance of profits of an insurance business. So read, the Income Tax Officer can exclude from the balance of profits, only any expenditure which is not allowable under s. 10 of the Income-tax Act. The word "expenditure" inr. 6 means disbursement and does not comprehend depreciation. As regar- ds "depreciation", it covers both actual and notional, and the Income Tax Officer has no option but to allow it under r. 3 (b). He cannot ask the assessee to prove that there has been any actual depreciation. [370E; 372A, C; 373E, F;
