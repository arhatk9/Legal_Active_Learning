 The appellant were registered partnership firms carrying on business of dealing in wines and spirits and were licensed to import and store liquors in their bounded warehouse at Bombay. They were also holders of licence issued under the Maharashtra Foreign Liquor (Import and Export) Rules, 1963 framed under the Procedure Act of 1949 of the State Government.
 The Maharashtra Foreign Liquor (storage in Bond) Rules, 1964, under which, an importer could import liquor and store 8the sums in a warehouse without payment of countervailing duty,were amended on 28th July, 1976 and 28th June, 1983, to impose Octroi on the assessable value which includes customs duty paid on import of liquor.
 The appellants filled a writ petition in the High Court, challenging the inclusion of the countervailing duty in the assessable value for octroi on the ground that the said duty was not incurred `till the date of removal of the goods from the place of import'.
 A Single Judge of the High Court allowed the writ petition. The respondent field letters Patent Appeals against the decision of the Single Judge. The Division Bench of the High Court by the impugned judgment held that countervailing duty was includible in the assessable value for the imposition of octroi.

 HELD: Per Subyasachi Mukharji, J.
 Countervailing duty is imposed for the purpose of setting off or compensating some other duty so as to place the home producer on an equal footing with the importer of foreign goods. The essence of countervailing duty is to set off the effect of non-payment of tax on manufacture meant to protect the indigenuous production. [417H; 418A] Bringing goods with intention to use and not in transit is decisive and any imposition on that would form part of the duty which could he imposed at the time of entry and could be included in the Octroi. [427C] For goods in transit section l94A of the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, 1888 provides an exemption in accordance with the octroi Rules. Section 105 of the Bombay Prohibition Act. 1949, read with Sections 2 (14), 2 (20) and 2(36) makes the position clear that the taxable event in the case of excise duty would be manufacture or production and in the case of countervailing duty. import within the State.
 [427C-E] The Maharashtra Foreign Liquor (Storage in Bond) Rules, 1964 were framed subsequent to the Act of 1949. The charge and incidence of countervailing duty under the Act and the relevant Notification of 1949 were aLready subsisting. By subsequent framing of the storage in Bond Rules, incidence or charge cannot be deflected or altered. Under Rule 2 (2) administrative facility is granted for deferred payment to the assessee. The words "without payment of duty" indicate that duty has become chargeable and the incidence was complete; if. however, the assessee complies with the Rules, he is given a facility to defer payment. This clearly shows that duty has become payable already. This is only consistent with the fact that the charge or incidence has already been attracted on th taxable event taking place, namely, the manufacture or production in the case of excise duty or import in the State in the case of countervailing duty. The fact that a bond has to be executed means the goods, to be stored, have already been the subject matter of duty or charge. If they have been so, there is no question of bonding them with an undertaking to make payment of duty at the time of removal or before removal from bond. Normal rule is pre-payment of duty at the time or before the import. The purpose of the import is decisive. If goods are brought for the purpose of commerce or trade, these are imported. [427G-H; 428A-C; 430A-B] PG NO 408 Countervailing duty also does not form part of the incidental charges. Countervailing duty is contained in Rule 2(7)(a) of the Octroi Rules. This Rule uses the words "excise duties" as also the words "all other incidental charges." Section 105 of the Bombay Prohibition Act, 1949 itself talks of excise duties so as to include both excise duty as well as countervailing duty. Therefore, the normal connotation of the words "excise duties" would take in countervailing duty also. Apart from that charges include taxes. l430C, E-F] Countervailing duty is an incident of importation and as such it was includible as an octroi even prior to 28th June, l983. [431 A] Per S. Ranganathan, J. (concurring) The language of section 105 which imposes the charge, of section 106 which talks of payment and of the rules, leaves no doubt that the duty is attracted at the point of import (i.e. physical entry of the goods into the taxing territory) and that only the payment of duty is deferred, in case the goods imported are removed to a bonded warehouse, to a later point of time, for purposes of convenience of collection. It will not be appropriate to construe the provisions in such a manner as imposing a liability on some persons (who have no bonded warehouse) at one point of time and on the others, at a different point of time. If the liability to pay the duty itself were referrable to a later point of time, the insistence on a bond in the terms prescribed would appear to he redandant. The provision that where the facility is availed of, the assessee would pay duty at the rate prevalent at the later point of time (often higher than at the point of import but not necessarily so) is rather a logical consequence of the privilege of deferment given to the assessee. [432C-E] So far as the two periods after 28th July, 1976 were concerned, there could be no doubt that this was included.
 The specific inclusion of the word "countervailing" duty and broader reference to duties "incurred or liable to be incurred" in the 1983 amendment, only further clarifies the position prevalent even prior to 28.7.1983. The words "incidental charges" have a very wide meaning particularly in a context where duties and tax are referred to and the idea seems to be to include all items that will he taken into account by an importer as part of his cost. In regard to the period till 28.7.l978, the position should be the same for the first period also. [432F-H; 433A] M/s J. E. Bilimoria & Sons, Nagpur v.
