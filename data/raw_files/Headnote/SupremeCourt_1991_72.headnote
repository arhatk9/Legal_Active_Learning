 The appellant firm, a jute goods exporter, entered into contracts on December 19, 1961 for shipment of goods to a foreign company in January 1962. Due to appreciation in price in Jan. 1962, the firm arranged to ship the consignment in June, 1962, and before actually shipping the goods, on 1.6.1962 submitted to the Customs authorities the shipping bills and G.R. forms wherein F.O.B. was found to be undervalued. The firm waived show cause memo and agreed to abide by the decision of the Customs authorities. The ship left without taking the consignment.
 The Additional Collector of Customs held that a "phatka' business was being carried on by the consignees abroad in which the shippers had, as brokers, undertaken to remit to them invisibly the profits so earned, by harnessing into service the medium of the said export business, and the firm in attempting to ship the goods without making proper declaration of (1) the amount representing full export value, and (2) the period and manner of payment, violated s. 12(1) of Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947 and committed offences under s. 167(8) of Sea Customs Act, 1878 read with s. 23A and 23B of Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947. He confiscated the goods and imposed fine and personal penalty on the appellant firm.
 On appeal, the Central Board of Revenue affirmed the order of confiscation and penalty but reduced the fine. The firm filed writ petition before the High Court.
 The Single Judge, relying on two decisions** of this Court held that once a declaration incorrect or untrue was filed, s. 12(1) of Foreign Exchange Regulation Act was complied with, and the Additional 822 Collector, Customs had no jurisdiction to pass the order;
 and allowed the writ petition. Revenue appealed before the Division Bench of the High Court, which distinguished the decisions relied on by the Single Judge, and allowed the appeal. Hence the present appeal by the shippers.
 Dismissing the appeal, this Court, 
 HELD: The appellant firm had made an attempt to remit profits to the consignees abroad by discounting it from the sale price and declaring the export value of the goods at the lower rate. It was a case where undervaluation in respect of full export value of goods was detected even before the goods were actually shipped or exported. The Additional Collector, Customs was right in holding that there was Violation of s. 12(1) of Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947 and the appellant firm thus committed offences under s.167(8) of the Sea Customs Act, 1878 read with ss, 23A and 23B of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947. [828E-F; 826C-F] The Division Bench rightly distinguished the two decisions relied on by Single Judge, and rightly reversed his order and maintained the order of the Central Board of Revenue. [828F-G] **Union of India & Ors. v. M/s Rai Bahadur Shree Ram Durga Prasad (P) Ltd. & Ors., [1968] INSC 283; [1969] 2 SCR 727 and Becker Gray & Co. Ltd. and Ors. v. Union of India & Anr., [1970] INSC 7; [1970] 3 SCR 445, distinguished.
 The shipping bills and G.R.1 forms filed on behalf of the appellant firm showed that the value mentioned therein was less than the full export value of the goods in the market at the relevant time. The F.O.B. values declared by the shippers in the G.R. forms were, on their own admission, incorrect and the object of these incorrect declarations was unethical and otherwise highly objectionable on more than one ground of economics.
