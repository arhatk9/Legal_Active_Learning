 The respondent had sued the appellant 2 on a rent note in the Munsiff's court for recovery of Rs. 700/- as arrears of rent and ejectment. That suit was dismissed on the prelimi- nary objection of defect of party as appellant 1, a co- lessor in the rent note, had not been made a party. The respondent then brought the present suit in the Civil Judge's court for recovery of Rs. 2400 as arrears of rent from and for ejectment of appellant 2, making appellant 1 a proforma defendant in the suit. The appellant 2 pleaded that the suit was barred by res judicata and could not be decreed since appellant 1 had not joined the respondent in the claim. The High Court, in finally decreeing the suit in second appeal, hold that it was not barred by res judicata since the Munsiff had not the pecuniary jurisdiction to try the suit and that appellant 1 on a true construction of the rent note, was not a a co-lessor with the respondent. It' was urged on behalf 'of the appellants in this Court that the word suit' in s. 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure should be liberally, and not literally, construed so as to include part of the suit or ;An issue 484 raised in the suit and that since the Munsiff who had tried;
 the previous suit was competent to try that part of the subsequent suit which formed the relevant issue in the earlier suit, !he present suit was barred by res judicata.
 Held, that: the High Court was right in holding that the present suit was not barred by res judicata.
 The word 'suit' occurring in s. 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure must be literally, and not liberally, construed so as to mean the entire suit and not a part. of it or an issue arising in it'. The legislative history of that section, clearly shows that them is no scope for any liberal construction of that word.
