 On June 5, 1969 the District Magistrate 24-Parganas, West Bengal made an order under s. 3(2) of the Preventive Detention Act, 1950 for the detention of the petitioner. On June 7, 1969 the petitioner was, arrested and served with the grounds of detention. On June 9, 1969 information was given to the State Government. On June 14, 1969 the Governor approved the order of detention and sent the report under s. 3(4) of the Act along with the grounds of detention, to the Central Government. On June 23, 1969 the petitioner made a representation to the State Government.
 On July 1, 1969 the State Government placed the case of the petitioner together with the said representation before the Advisory Board under s. 9 of the Act. The Board gave its opinion on August 13, 1969 that there was sufficient cause for the detention of the petitioner. On August 19, 1969 the State Government allegedly rejected the petitioner's representation. On August 26, 1969 the Governor confirmed the order of detention. The petitioner filed a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution challenging his detention on the ground that the State Government did not consider his representation of June 23, 1969 with reasonable and proper expedition. On behalf of the State Government it was contended that the Government had discharged its duty inas- much ;is it rejected the representation after considering the report of the Advisory Board and making its own enquiries through the Superintendent Railway Police whose report was a little delayed. In respect of the said enquiry having been made an affidavit was filed by the officer who caused the enquiry to be made.
 
HELD : (i) Broadly stated. four principles, are ,Yard to the representation of detenus First, the appropriate authority is bound to give detenu to make a representation and to consider early as possible.
 [232 B] Secondly, the consideration of the representation of the detenu by the appropriate authority is entirely independent of any action by the Advisory Board including the consideration of the representation of the detenu by the Advisory Board. [232 C] Thirdly. there should not be any delay in the matter of consideration. Though no hard and fast rule can be laid down as to the measure of time taken by the appropriate authority for consideration, it has to be remembered that the Government has to be vigilant in the governance of the citizens. The fundamental right of the detenu to have his representation 226 considered by the appropriate Government would be rendered meaningless if the Government does not deal with the matter expeditiously but at its own sweet will and convenience.
 [232 C-D] Fourthly the appropriate Government is to exercise its opinion and judgment on the representation before sending the case along with the detenu's representation to the Advisory Board. If the appropriate Government will release the detenu the Government will not send the matter to the Advisory Board. If however the Government will not release the detenu the Government will, send the case along with the detenu's representation to the Advisory Board. If thereafter the Advisory Board will ,express an opinion in favour of release of the detenu the Government will release the detenu. If the Advisory Board will express any opinion against the release of the detenu the Government may still exercise the power to release the detenu. [232 D-F] Sk. Abdul Karim & Ors. v.

 (ii) In the present case the State of West Bengal was guilty of infraction of the constitutional provisions not only by inordinate delay of the consideration of the representation but also by putting off the consideration till after the receipt of the opinion of the Advisory Board. There was no explanation for this inordinate delay. The Superintendent who made the enquiry did not -affirm an affidavit. The State had given no information as to why this long delay occurred. Because the personal liberty of the citizen was under consideration the State Government should have given utmost information to the court. The inescapable conclusion 'in the present case was that the appropriate authority failed to discharge its constitutional obligation by inactivity and lack of independent judgment. The petition must therefore be allowed. [232 F-G]
