 The Income Tax Officer included a sum of Rs. 10,80,000/- found invested in shares in the name of R as the assesee's income from undisclosed sources. The income tax officer, had informed the assesee that on the basis of information available with him he had reason to believe that R was the assessee's benamidar. The assessee took no steps to produce R for examination by the Income Tax Officer. The source not having explained the income tax officer assessed the sum as the assess's. income from undisclosed sources. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner confirmed this order. In the appeal the Tribunal declined to consider certain documents on record. After rejecting these documents, the Tribunal found that the purchase of shares was not a benami transaction and was legally valid. The High Court confirmed the Tribunal's conclusions. In this Court it was contended on behalf of the Revenue that Tribunal based its conclusions on inadmissible evidence and on wrong facts, gave no cogent reasons for rejecting the findings of the income tax Officer, failed to take into account the relevant material or record and based its conclusions on mere conjectures and surmises.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : (i) Before rejecting the findings of the tribunal the Court must be satisfied that there are grounds recognised by law which empower the court to interfere with those findings.
 (ii)The High Court and this Court have always the jurisdiction to intervene if it appears that either the Tribunal has misunderstood the statutory language or it has arrived at a finding based on no evidence, or where the finding is inconsistent with the evidence or contradictory of it or it has acted on material partly relevant and partly irrelevant, or where the Tribunal draws upon its own imagination, imports facts and circumstances not apparent from the record, or bases its conclusions on mere conjectures or surmises or where no person judicially acting and properly instructed as to the relevant law could have come to the determination reached. In all such cases the findings arrived at are vitiated. Unless the Tribunal has been asked to refer a question impugning the validity of the findings sustainable or any principle of law, the facts stated in the statement of the case would form the basis on which the legality or otherwise of the assessment would alone require to be considered by the High Court. What has to be safeguarded against is that any crystallization of the views of this Court and its reluctance to interfere with the findings of fact should not make the tribunals or the Income-tax authorities smug in the belief that as the courts do not interfere with the findings which form the bed-rack upon which the law will be based, they can act on that assumption in finding facts, or, by their mere ipsi dixit that they are findings of 'fact, wish it to be so assumed irrespective 335 of whether they are sustainable in law or on the materials on record. in number of cases this Court has set out the principles 'upon which it will interfere with the findings of fact arrived at by the Tribunal.

 (Hi) Inthe present case the Tribunal failed to take into account the relevant material on record in arriving at its finding. Further it acted on inadmissible evidence, based its conclusions on conjectures, surmises and wrong facts, and failed to consider the probabilities of the case on which the Income-tax Officer and the Appellate Assistant Commissioner placed a great deal of emphasis. On the basis of the material on record the Income-tax Officer and the Appellate Assistant Commissioner were fully justified in drawing inference that R was a name lender for the assessee.
 Neither the Tribunal nor the High Court has given good rea- sons for displacing the conclusions reached by the Income- tax Officer or the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. They had a duty to examine the reasons given by those authorities before rejecting them. [359 B]
