 After the nationalisation of bus routes in the Fifties, it was not permissible to permit any private operator to ply a stage carriage on any sector of the nationalised routes as the schemes of nationalisation did not provide for it.
 However, by virtue of section 10(1) (c) of Uttar Pradesh Road Transport Services (Development) Act, (Act IX of 1955), 1955 private operators were allowed to ply the stage carriages on the whole of their routes including the common sectors. U.P. Act (IX of 1955) was repealed by Central Act LXVI of 1969. By virtue of section 76 inserted as section 135 of Motor Vehicles Act, the permission granted to them being inconsistent with the provisions of the MV Act ceased to be effective from 1.4.71, the date of repeal of the 1955 Act. Despite this statutory prohibition, in the State of Uttar Pradesh, a "Practice", grew whereby private operators were continued to be permitted to ply their stage carriages over common sectors of nationalised routes provided that they did not set down or pick up passengers at any point on the common sectors. In 1976 the Uttar Pradesh Legislature enacted the Uttar Pradesh Motor Vehicles Special Provisions Act, 1976 to provide for the grant 767 of authorisation to holders of stage carriage permits to ply their stage carriages over common sectors. When the applications moved by such private operators for renewal of their authorisation, were rejected on the ground that they did not possess permits on the dates of the nationalisation notifications, some of them moved the High Court of Allabahad under Article 226 and after the dismissal of their writ petitions have come up by way of special leave, while some others have filed their petitions directly under Article 32 of the Constitution.
 Dismissing the petitions, the Court ^ 
 HELD: 1. Where a route is nationalised Chapter IV-A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 to the total exclusion of private operators, a private operator with a permit to ply a stage carriage over another route which has a common overlapping sector with the nationalised route cannot be permitted to ply his vehicle over that part of the overlapping common sector, even if he did not pick up or set down passengers on that part of the route. While permissions granted under section 10(1)(c) of Uttar Pradesh Road Transport Services (Development) Act, Act IX of 1955 were patently inconsistent with the provisions of Chapter IV-A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 and therefore, ceased to be effective from 1.4.1971, the date of the repeal of 1955 Act, the "Practice" of permitting private operators to ply their stage carriages over common sectors of nationalised routes, subject to conditions was wholly unauthorised and without any legal sanctions whatsoever. Hence, the plying of stage carriages by the private operators before the commencement of 1976 Act pursuant to such unauthorised and unlawful "practice" which had grown up in Uttar Pradesh, or under interim orders of a Court will disentile them to obtain.
 Authorisation under section 5 of the Uttar Pradesh Motor Vehicles Special Provisions Act, 1976 (Act 27 of 1976). [770 A-D] Adarsh Travels v. State of Uttar Pradesh, [1985] INSC 234; [1985] 2 Scale 880 followed.
