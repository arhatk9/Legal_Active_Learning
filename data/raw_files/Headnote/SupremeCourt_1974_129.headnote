 Four appellants were convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of them two deceased; two accused for the murder of one of the deceased and the other two, accused for the murder of the second deceased. On appeal, the High Court, without a detailed discussion of the evidence of the eye witnesses, merely observed that their evidence inspired full confidence and affirmed the judgment of the trial court.
 On further appeal to this Court the appellants contended that had the witnesses. been present, the assailants would not have spared them.
 Dismissing the appeal of two accused and allowing that of the other two:
 
HELD : (1) This Court does not normally, in an appeal by Special Leave, go afresh into the question of credibility of witnesses and reappraise the evidence. In the present case, however, there was hardly any discussion worth the name of the evidence of eye witnesses in the judgment of the High Court. As the High Court was dealing with not only an appeal filed by the appellants but also a reference under s.
 374 Cr. P. C. for confirming the death sentence, it was essential for it to, have reappraised the evidence adduced in the case and come to an independent conclusion whether the guilt of the accused had been proved or not. While dealings with a reference under s. 374 Cr. P. C. the High Court should consider the proceedings in all their aspects and come to an independent conclusion on the material on record. In view of this infirmity, the evidence bad to be examined by this Court. [568E-569B] Jumman & Ors. v. The State of Punjab, A. I. R. 1957 S. C.

 (2) The question of credibility of a witness has to be decided by referring to his evidence and finding out as to how the witness has fared in cross-examination and what impression is created by his evidence taken in the context of the other facts of the case. Decided cases can be of help if there be a question of law like admissibility of evidence but reference to decided cases is hardly apposite when the question before the court is whether the evidence of a particular witness should or should not be accepted.
 [574B-D] (3) In the instant case there appears to be no sufficient ground for disbelieving the evidence of the three eye witnesses. The witnesses had taken shelter and thus remained unhurt. As the ocular evidence consists of persons, two of whom were close relatives of the two deceased, it is not likely that the eye witnesses would spare. the real assailants. The evidence of the eye witnesses as with regard to the part played by the two accused, whose conviction is upheld in respect of the murder of one of the deceased is also in conformity with the medical evidence. [570E] (4) As regards the other two accused, the evidence does not establish their complicity in the murder of the deceased beyond reasonable doubt and it is extremely unlikely that the appellants 'would have- associated an old man with them in the assault, who, on account of his age, would be more of a handicap and a burden to them especially at the time of escaping after the occurrence.
