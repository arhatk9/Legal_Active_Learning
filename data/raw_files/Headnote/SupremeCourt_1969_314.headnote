 The appellant company was assessed to excise duty on the consumption of "nitro-cellulose lacquer" produced by it.
 The company denied that the chemical compound Produced and utilised by it was "nitrocellulose lacquer" within the meaning of the Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944. The Assistant Collector of Customs confirmed the assessment.
 The Collector of Customs, in appeal, gave the company a personal hearing and rejected the company's claim by a detailed order. Against this order the company invoked the revisional jurisdiction of the Central Government under s.
 36 of the Act. The petition was entertained but no personal hearing was girven to the company. The Government rejected the petition by an order which read :
 "The Government of India have carefully considered the points made by the applicant(s), but see no justification for interfering with the order in appeal. The revision application is accordingly rejected." The Company appealed to this Court.
 
HELD : The case must be remanded to the Central Government to be disposed of according to law.
 (i)The Central Government is by a. 36 invested with the judicial power of the State. A party who approaches the Government in exercise of a statutory right for adjudication of a dispute is entitled to know at least the official designation of the person who has considered the matter, what was considered by him, and the reasons for recording a decision against him. To enable the High Court or this Court to exercise its constitutional powers, not only the decision, but an adequate disclosure of materials justifying an inference that there has been a judicial consideration of the dispute by an authority competent in that behalf in the light of the claim made by the aggrieved party, is necessary. The Court insists upon disclosure of reasons in support of the order on two grounds : one, that the party aggrieved in a proceeding before the High Court or this Court has the opportunity to demonstrate that the reasons which persuaded the authority to reject his case were erroneous, the other, that the obligation to record reasons operates as a deterrent against possible arbitrary action by the executive authority invested with the judicial power.
