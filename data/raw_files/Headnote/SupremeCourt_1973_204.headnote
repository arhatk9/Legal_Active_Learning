 On the respondents failure to fulfil the terms of the contract, the appellant repudiated it and imposed certain penalties in accordance with the terms of the contract. The appellant later waived the penalties and paid certain sum3 due to the respondent. The appellant claimed that these payments, including the return of the deposit money finally settled the claims of the respondent. The respondent on the other land.claimed from the appellant certain sums including damages for 'repudiation of the contract. The appellant not having agreed the respondent appointed an arbitrator whom he later named as the sole arbitrator. The validity of the appointment of the sole arbitrator was challenged by the appellant under ss. 9(b) and 33 of the Indian Arbitration Act, 1940. The arbitration clause in the contract was to the effect that in Cass of in dispute "upon"' or "in relation to' or "in connection with" the contract the matter shalt be referred to arbitration. The Subordinate Judge permitted the appellant to adduce evidence to establish whether the contract was put an end to by final payment and whether the arbitration clause contained in tin contract perished with it. The High Court in revision set aside the order of the Subordinate Judge and dismissed the application of the appellant In toto.
 It was contended that since there had been a full and final settlement under the contract, the rights and obligations under the contract did not subsist and consequently the arbitration clause also perished along with the settlement 
HELD : (i) Where in a contract there is an arbitration clause, notwithstanding the Plea that there was a full and final settlement between the parties, that dispute can be referred to the arbitration's. The High Court was in error in directing the dismissal of the appellant's petition in toto. The question whether there has been a full and final settlement of a claim under the contract Is itself a dispute arising 'upon' or 'in relation to' or 'in connection with' the contract. These words are wide enough to cover the dispute sought to be referred. On the facts of this case when the appellant refused to accept the goods, the respondent could claim damages for breach of contract. Such a claim for damagesis a dispute or difference which arises between the respondent and appellantand is, upon" or "in relation to" or "in connection with"the contract.
 [248C:243C-D] A contract is the creature of an agreement between the parties and where the parties under the terms of the contract agree to incorporate an arbitration clause that clause stands apart from the rights and obligations under that contract, as it has been incorporated with the object of providing a machinery for the settlement of disputes arising in relation to or in connection with that contract.
 The questions of unilateral repudiation of the rights and obligations under the contract or of a full and final settlement of the contract relate to the performance or discharge of the contract. Far from putting an end to the arbitration clause, they fall within the purview of it. A repudiation by one party alone does not terminate the contract. It takes two to end it and hence it follows that as the contract subsists for the determination of the rights and obligations of the parties. the arbitration clause also survives. [243F-G] (ii)In cases where the dispute between the parties is that the contract itself did not subsist either as a result of its being substituted by a new contract or by rescission or alteration. that dispute could not be referred to the arbitration as the arbitration clause itself would perish if the averment was found to be valid. As the very Jurisdiction of the arbitrator is dependent upon the existence of the arbitration clause under which he is appointed, the parties have no right to invoke a clause which perishes with the contract. [244B-C] 241 (iii) The contract being concensual, the question whether the arbitration clause survives or perishes would depend upon the nature of the controversy: and if* effect upon the existence or survival of the contract itself. Where the binding nature of the contract is not disputed, but a difference has arisen between the parties thereto as to whether there has been a breach by one side or the other or whether one or both the parties have been discharged from further performance such differences are "upon" or "in relation to" or "in connection with the contract. That a contract has come to an end by frustration does not put an end to the contract for all purposes because there may be rights and obligations which had arisen earlier when it had not come to an end, as it is only the future Performance of the contract that has come to an end. A dispute as to the binding nature of the contract cannot be determined by resort to arbitration clause because the arbitration clause itself stands or falls according to the determination of the question in dispute. [244D-F] The question whether the termination was valid or not and whether damages were recoverable for such wrongful termination did not affect the arbitration clause or the right of the respondent to invoke it for appointment of an arbitrator.
