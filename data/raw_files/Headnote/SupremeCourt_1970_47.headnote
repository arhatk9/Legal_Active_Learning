 The appellant carried on the business of manufacturing trucks in Jamshedpur in the State of Bihar. It did not have any stockyard in the State but maintained such stockyards in different States for the purpose of effective distribution of vehicles among its dealers. A form of agreement between the appellant and its dealers provided that the company agreed to sell and supply from its Works at Jamshedpur or from its stockyards outside the State vehicles to the dealer which would be allotted to the dealer by the Company at its discretion. In another provision it was laid down that by the 15th of each month the dealer shall mail to the company his statements containing firm orders for purchases to be effected during the next succeeding month.
 In the course of its assessment to sales tax 'for the years' 1964-65 and 1965-66, the appellant claimed that as the demand for the vehicles far exceeded the production, no firm orders as envisaged in the dealership agreement had in fact been 'received. The actual procedure followed by the appellant was that the sales office of the appellant in Bombay, after taking into account the production schedule and requirements in different States, instructed the factory to transfer stocks of vehicles to the stockyards in the various States by Stock Transfer Authorisations in which the model of the chassis and the number of units were mentioned. The stocks available in the stockyards were distributed from time to time to dealers taking care to ensure that the over-all supply to the dealers in any State was in proportion to the number of orders pending with the dealer on May 1, 1963 or on the basis of the off-take by the dealer during the year ending September 30, 1962 as required by the Commercial Vehicles (Distribution and Sale) Control Order, 1963. For this purpose allotments were made to the dealer for each month by an allocation letter by the sales office. it was claimed that the transfer of the vehicles from the factory to the various stockyards was a continuous process and was not related to the requirement of any particular customer; that there was no connection between the Stock Transfer Authorisation and the allocation letter. It was the stock- yard incharge who appropriated the required number of vehicles to the contract of sale out of the stocks available with him. This was done after a delivery order had been addressed by the sales office at Bombay to the stockyard incharge for delivery of stated number of vehicles of specified model to a particular dealer. Till such appropriation of vehicles, it was always open to the company to allot any vehicle to any purchaser or to transfer the vehicles from the stockyard in one State to a stockyard in another State.
 8 63 However, the respondent Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Taxes. levied tax under the Central Sales Tax Act on all the vehicles which moved to the stockyards in the States other than Bihar from Jamshedpur. The appellant challenged the assessment orders in petitions filed under Article 226 but these were dismissed by the High Court. On appeal to this Court,.
 
HELD : The order of the High Court and that of the Assistant Commissioner must be set aside.
 (i)The explanation of the procedure followed by the appellant which prima facie seemed to be business-like and plausible, together with the proved absence of any firm orders, indicated that the allocation letters and the statements tarnished by the dealers did not by themselves bring about transactions of sale within the meaning of Section 2(g) of the Central Sales Tax Act. It appeared' 'from the material on record that generally the completion of the sales to the dealers did not take place at Jamshedpur and the final steps in the matter of such completion were taken at the stockyards. Even on the assumption that any orders had been received by the appellant they could not be regarded as anything but mere offers in view of the specific terms in the dealership agreement according to which it was open to the appellant to supply or not to supply the dealer with any vehicle in response to such orders. There,were, therefore, no firm contracts which occasioned the movement of vehicles out of the State of Bihar. [870 D-871 B] (ii) Another serious infirmity in the order of the Assistant Commissioner was that instead of looking into each transaction in order to find out whether a completed contract of sale had taken place which could be brought to tax only if the movement of vehicles from Jamshedpur had been occasioned under a convenant or incident of that contract, the Assistant Commissioner made his order on the general basis that all transactions were of a similar nature. The Assistant Commissioner was bound to examine each individual transaction and then decide whether it cons- tituted an Inter-State sale exigible to tax under the provisions of the Act.
