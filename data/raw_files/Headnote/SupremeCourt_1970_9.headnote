 In determining the Appellant's turnover for assessment to sales tax for the year 1956-57, the Superintendent of Sales Tax included an amount representing Railway freight in the Appellant's sales of Cement. The Appellate authority set aside the orders directing the inclusion of the Railway freight in the turnover. After the introduction of section 20-A in the Bihar Sales Tax Act 19 of 1959 by Act 20 of 1962, the Assistant Commissioner issued a notice to the Appellant under section 20-A (3) of the Act requiring the Appellant to show cause why an amount representing Sales tax on the Railway freight which became refundable under the orders of assessment, be not forfeited. The Appellant's contention that section 20-A was ultra vires the State Legislature was rejected by the Assistant Commissioner, and by the High Court in a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution.
 On appeal to this Court, 
HELD : The appeal must be allowed and the petition of the assessee must be granted. Sub sections (3), (4) and (5) of section 20A are ultra vires the State Legislature. As a corollary thereto, sub sections 6 and 7 must also be deemed invalid.
 Sub-section (8) of s. 20A does not alter the true nature of the demand or appropriation which can be made under sub-ss.
 (3), (4) and (5) of s. 20-A. The intention underlying sub-ss. (3), (4) and (5) is to enable the State to collect from the dealer tax which the State is not entitled to levy and to appropriate it to itself except in the very rare cases in which the purchaser may approach the State and be able to satisfy it that he has a claim, that the claim is in order, and that it is within limitation. Notwithstanding the addition of sub-s, (8), the amount received by the State or appropriated by the State continues to have the character of a tax collected which the State is not entitled to collect. A provision which enables the dealer to pass on the liability for payment of tax is incidental to legislation for sales-tax. But it cannot be held that a provision under which a dealer is called upon to pay to the State an amount which has been collected by him on a representation-express or implied-that an equal amount is payable by him under the Bihar Sales Tax Act, is a provision incidental to the power to levy "tax on sale or purchase of goods" within the meaning of Entry 64, List II, of the Seventh Schedule. In effect the provision is one for levying an amount as tax which the State is incompetent to levy. A mere device cannot be permitted to defeat the provisions of the Constitution by clothing the claim in the form of a demand for depositing the money with the State which the dealer has collected, but which he was not entitled to collect. [464 F, 463 E, H] 456 The power to legislate in respect of sub-ss. (3), (4) and (5) of s. 20A does not fall under Entries 6, 7 and 13 of List III expressly, nor is it necessarily incidental to the power contained in Entries 6, 7 and 13 of List III.
