 % This special leave petition was directed against the judgment and order of the Bombay High Court, declining to issue a writ in the nature of Mandamus and other appropriate writ, directions or orders, directing the respondents to forbear from releasing 7500 cartons (200 MT) of Irish butter imported into India for operation Flood Programme, supplied to the Greater Bombay Milk Scheme by respondent No. 2, National Dairy Development Board, on the ground that the butter was contaminated by nuclear fall-out.
 Soon after the Chernobyl disaster, when it was realised that the imported milk and food products particularly from the EEC countries had the possibility of radio-active contamination, the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre took up the matter with the respective agencies and advised them to get the representative samples for radio-active analysis before releasing them for public distribution in India.
 This Court appointed a Committee of three experts, (1) Professor M.G.K. Menon, Member Planning Commission & Scientific Advisor to the Prime Minister (2) Dr. P.K.
 Iyenger, Director Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Bombay and (3) G.V.K. Rao, Vice- chairman, Economic & Planning Council, Govt. Of Karnataka, Bangalore to give its opinion on the question whether milk and dairy products and other food products containing man-made radionuclides within permissible levels fixed by the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board on 27th August, 1987, were safe and/or harmless for human consumption. The Committee of Experts examined the question in depth and by its report dt. February 19, 1988, expressed its opinion that the consignment of the imported butter was safe and harmless for human consumption.
 116 Dismissing the special leave petition, the Court, ^ 
 HELD: There was no substance in any of the objections formulated by the petitioners. In its most recent recommendations, the International Commission on Radiological Protection observed that 'limits for. the inhalation or ingestion of radio-active material depend on the concentration of those materials in limiting target organs'. The petitioners showed different permissible limits in different countries as France, UK, E.E.C., and Australia at 3700, 2000, 370 and 100. These are the limits of radioactivity prescribed by these countries for imported foodstuffs. As against these, the prescribed limit for India admittedly is 40 (bq/I). [120C-E] The analysis of the imported butter by the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, which according to the Committee of Experts must be treated to be accurate, showed the presence in the samples of imported butter of CS-137 at limits ranging from 0.6 Bq/kg to 2.9 Bq/kg. The petitioners relied upon letters sent by some internationally known scientists including Nobel laureates tending to show that it was desirable to avoid foodstuffs containing low level radio- activity which, according to them, might in the long run prove to be hazardous. Those letters were in general terms and only represented a particular school of thought. Surely, the Committee of Experts comprising two eminent scientists and an equally well-known Agro-Economist, was well aware of this point of view. [120E-G ] The Court could not accept the contention of the petitioners that the Court should give a direction that all articles of foodstuffs using the imported butter should carry a label 'Manufactured out of Butter Imported from the EEC countries.' [120G-H] The Court shared the opinion of this Court expressed in the Vincent's case, where a direction was sought in public interest for banning the import, manufacture, sale and distribution of certain drugs recommended by the Drugs Consultative Committee and this Court had observed that having regard to the magnitude, complexity and technical nature of the enquiry involved in the matter and keeping in view the far-reaching implications of the total ban of certain medicines for which the petitioner had prayed, it must be indicated that a judicial proceeding of the nature initiated was not an appropriate one for determination of such matters. [121A-C] The order of status quo granted by the High Court was discharged. [121D] 117
