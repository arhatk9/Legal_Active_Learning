 The respondent landlord issued a notice dated October 21, 1969 to the appellant demanding arrears of rent in respect of accommodation, which according to the respondent, consisted of a portion of a shop and a verandah and terminated the tenancy; and he filed a suit for eviction under section 12(1)(a) of the Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Act, 1961 and for payment of arrears of rent totaling Rs.
 2550. The appellant after depositing the entire arrears as required under section 13(1) of the Act contested the suit disputing the area and portion of accommodation tenanted and claimed expenditure incurred by him for repairs. The trial court dismissed the suit accepting the contention of the appellant that since the respondent has not correctly described the extent of the premises in the notice terminating the tenancy, the tenancy had not been validly terminated. An appeal having been dismissed the respondent filed a second appeal before the High Court. The High Court granted permission to the respondent for an amendment of the plaint and relying on the decision of the Supreme Court in V. Dhanapal Chettair v. Yesodai Ammal [1979] INSC 155; [1980] 1 S C.R. 334 that no notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act was necessary, allowed the second appeal. Hence the tenant's appeal after obtaining Special Leave of the Court.
 Allowing the Appeal, the Court ^ 
 HELD: 1. The notice referred to in section 12(1)(a) of the Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act, 1961 must be a notice demanding the rental arrears in respect of accommodation actually let to the tenant. It must be a notice (a) demanding the arrears of rent in respect of the accommodation let to the tenant and (b) the arrears of rent must be legally recoverable from the tenant. There can be no admission by a tenant that arrears of rent are due unless they relate to the accommodation let to him. A valid notice demanding arrears of rent relatable to the accommodation let to the tenant from which he .
 40 is sought to be evicted is a vital ingredient of the conditions which govern the maintainability of the suit, for unless a valid demand is made no complaint can be laid of non-compliance with it, and consequently no suit for rejectment of the tenant in respect of the accommodation will lie on that ground. [13 F-H; 44 A] 1: 2. It is true that amendment of the plaint in the suit in order to relate to the accommodation asserted by the appellant does relate back to the institution of the suit, but it cannot amend an invalid notice earlier issued terminating the tenancy. The notice of demand is an act independent of the institution of the suit. 44 A-B, D] The notice and the plaint are two distinct matters, different by nature, designed for different purposes and located in two different points of time. They operate in two different planes, and are relate(l insofar only that one is a condition for maintaining the other. [44 B-C] 1: 3. The notice of demand dated October 21, 1969 served by the respondent on the appellant was invalid and, therefore, the suit was not maintainable. It is clear that there is a substantial difference between the accommodation mentioned in the notice and the accommodation let to the appellant. It must be taken that the notice relates to accommodation which cannot be effectively identified with the accommodation constituting the tenancy. This is not a case of a mere misdescription or the accommodation where both parties knew perfectly well that the notice referred to accommodation let to the tenant. Nor is it a case where the discrepancy between the accommodation alleged by the landlord and that actually let to the tenant is marginal or insubstantial. the proceedings show that there was a serious dispute between the parties as to the material extent of the accommodation let be the one to the other. No congruency between the two versions was possible. Not at least until the respondent was compelled to seek an amendment of his plaint in the high Court at the stage of second appeal. [43 B-E]
