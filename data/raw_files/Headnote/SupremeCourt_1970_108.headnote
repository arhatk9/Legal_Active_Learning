 The assessee a medical practioner, by a deed gifted a hospital building and land appurtenant thereto his son. The gift-deed recited that the gift was made "Out of love and affection". The assessee claimed exemption from gift-tax liability under s. 5 (1) (xiv) of the Gift Tax Act 1958 on the ground that a few months after the gift his son had graduated in medicine and had joined the assessee's profession. No evidence was placed before the taxing authorities that the gift was made in the course of carrying on the business of the donor. The Gift-tax Officer rejected the claim, and the order was affirmed by the Appellate Commissioner. The Appellate Tribunal held that the assessee was exempt from liability to pay Gift-tax. On reference, the High Court upheld the Tribunal's order. In appeal by the Revenue, this Court.
 
HELD : The assessee was not entitled to the exemption under s. 5(1) (xiv) of the Act. The donor is exempt under s. 5 (1) (xiv) from liability to pay tax only if the gift is in the course of carrying on a business, profession or vocation and is made bona fide for the purpose of such business, profession or vocation. The clause does not enact that a gift made by a person carrying on any business is exempt from tax, nor does it provide that a gift is exempt from tax because the property is used by the donor. Without deciding whether the test of "commercial expedience" is strictly appropriate to a claim for exemption under s. 5(1)(xiv) of the Gift Tax Act-there was no evidence on the record in this case to prove that the gift was "in the course of carrying on the business" of the donor, and "for the purpose of the business".
