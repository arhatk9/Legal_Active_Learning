 The respondent filed a suit for the recovery of a sum of Rs. 1606-8-0 being the value of V.P. article paid by the addressee in Pakistan to that Government for transmission to India. Due to the suspension of the money order service between Pakistan and India after 19-9-49, the amount was not sent by Pakistan P&T authorities to P&T authorities in India. Therefore, the appellant, pleaded non-liability by virtue of proviso to Section 34 of the Indian Post Office Act, 1898. The Trial Court dismissed the suit on the ground that the respondent's claim was barred by limitation under Rule 102 of the Rules framed under the Act and was also not maintainable in view of the proviso to S. 34. The first appellate court reversed the said decision on the view that Rule 102 was ultra vires the Indian Post Office Act and that non-payment by the Pakistan Government was not a valid defence. The High Court on appeal by the appellant affirmed the appellate decision holding that the post office established by the Government of India was an agent of the plaintiff and the Government of Pakistan was acting as the sub-agent.
 Allowing the appeal, the Court ^ 
 HELD : When two sovereign powers enter into an agreement, as in the instant case "in order to establish an exchange of value payable articles", neither of them can be described as an agent of the other. It is plain that under such an agreement if the Pakistan Administration decided to suspend the V.P. service temporarily and did not make over the money realised from the addressee, it cannot be said that the Union of India had received the money but failed to pay. [975 C-D] Had the Pakistan Government been really a sub-agent, payment to them would have been as good as payment to the Union of India, but that is not the case here. Sub-agent is defined in Section 191 of the Contract Act, 1872, as "a person employed by and acting under the control of, the original agent in the business of the agency." Under the arrangement entered into between the two sovereign powers, Union of India and Pakistan, neither could be said to be employed by or acting under the control of the other. In view of the fact that since 19-9-1949 the money order service with Pakistan remained suspended, the proviso to section 34 of the Indian Post Office Act, 1872 is attracted which absolves the Central Government from "any liability in respect of the sum 969 specified for recovery unless and until that sum has been received from the addressee".
