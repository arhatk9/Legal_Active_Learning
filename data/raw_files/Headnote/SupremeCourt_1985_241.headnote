 The respondent, in CA 5045 of 1985 was a substantive member of the State Civil Service (Executive) in the State of Madhya Pradesh. He was, on November 7, 1975, temporarily appointed by the State Government to the post of a collector which is a senior post on the cadre under rule 9 of the Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rule, 1954 and had been continuously officiating on such post with effect from November 10, 1975 till the Central Government accorded its approval on October 1, 1976 for his appointment in the Indian Administrative Service. The promotion quota of non- cadre officers to cadre posts which was 50 prior to October 1, 1976 was on that date increased to 56. The respondent was formally appointed to the Indian Administrative Service by the Central Government on December 7, 1976. The State Government of Madhya Pradesh by its letter dated February 3, 1979 informed him that he was assigned 1972 as the year of allotment by the Central Government. The respondent, therefore, filed a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution for an appropriate writ or direction directing the appellants to assign him, 1971 as the year of allotment, fix his seniority accordingly and allow all consequential reliefs.
 The High Court, held: (a) that though there was no specific approval of the Central Government to the appointment of the respondent, such prior approval was not a condition precedent 745 for valid appointment to a cadre under rule 9 of the Cadre Rules and, therefore, the continuous officiation by the respondent as the Collector for the period from November 10, 1975 to September 30, 1976 could not be ignored on the ground that the appointment was not specifically approved by the Central Government: (b) the existence of a vacancy in the promotion quota of cadre officers was not a condition pre-requisite for making an appointment of a non-cadre officer to a cadre post under rule 9 of the Cadre Rules and therefore, the fact that there was over utilization of the State Deputation Reserve Quota had no bearing on the question of the validity of the appointment of the respondent on a cadre post; (c) that the condition of approval by the Central Government required by the proviso to clause (I) of Section III of Schedule II of the Indian Administrative Service (Pay) Rules, 1954 was only for pay fixation and it had nothing to do with the validity of the officiation of a non-cadre officer in a cadre post under Rule 9 of the Cadre Rules; and (d) that his continuous officiation in a senior post of Collector from November 10, 1975 was in accordance with Rule 9 of the Cadre Rules and the same must enure for his benefit to give him seniority under Rule 3(3) (b) of the Seniority Rules. The High Court thus allowed the petition.
 Following the said case reported as K.L. Jain v. Union of India, (1984) MPLJ 284, the High Court of Madhya Pradesh in the connected cases out of which the present Civil Appeals Nos. 5040-5044 of 1985 arise held that the respondents therein also be assigned years 1966, 1967 and 1971 as their "years of allotment" respectively under rule 3(3) (b) of the Seniority Rules and their placement in the seniority list be accordingly revised.
 Allowing the appeals, the Court ^ 
 HELD : 1.1 For the purposes of appointment of a non- cadre officer to a cadre post under Rule 9 of the Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954, neither the prior approval of the Central Government to such appointment nor the existence of a vacancy in the promotion quota is a condition precedent. [754 G] 
 1.2 It is plain upon a construction of Rule 9 of the Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954, that under sub-rule (1) the State Government can direct that a cadre post may be filled by a person who is not a cadre officer. If it is satisfied that the vacancy is not likely to last for more than three months or that there is no suitable cadre officer available for filling 746 the vacancy. Under sub-rule (2), where in any State a person than a cadre officer is appointed to a cadre post for a period exceeding three months, the State Government is required to forthwith report the fact to the Central Government together with the reasons for making the appointment. Under rule 3, on receipt of a report under sub- rule (2) or otherwise, the Central Government may direct that the State Government shall terminate the appointment of such person and appoint thereto a cadre officer, and where any direction is so issued, the State Government shall accordingly give effect thereto. Under sub-rule (4), where a cadre post is likely to be filled by a person who is not a cadre officer for a period exceeding six months, the Central Government is required to report the full facts to the Union Public Service Commission with the reasons for holding that no suitable officer is available for filling the post and may, in the light of the advice given by the Union Public Service Commission, give suitable direction to the State Government concerned in that behalf. [753 E-H; 754 A-D] 
 1.3 The power of the Central Government under sub-rule (3) to direct termination of appointment of a person other than a cadre officer to a cadre post for a period exceeding three months or more cannot be said to be a larger power and carried with it the power to direct curtailment of the period of officiation of such person. The power to direct termination of the appointment of a non-cadre officer in a senior post is distinct from the power to direct curtailment of his period of officiation. In the absence of a provision made in the Cadre Rules empowering the Central Government to direct the curtailment of the period of officiation of a non-cadre officer on a cadre post for purposes of reckoning his year of allotment under rule 3(3)(b) of the Seniority Rules and since such a power cannot be spelled out from sub- rule (3) of rule 9 of the Cadre Rules which confers power on the Central Government to direct termination of appointment of a non-cadre officer to a cadre post, the orders passed by the Central Government fixing different dates as the date from which the period of officiation of each of the respondents is to be reckoned for determining the year of allotment under rule 3(3)(b) of the Seniority Rules are wholly arbitrary and capricious. Further the failure of the Central Government to give a direction under sub-rule (3) of rule 9 to terminate the appointment of the respondents implies that their continuous officiation on a cadre post had the tacit approval of the Central Government. [756 G-H;
 757 A-D] 
 2. In these cases, the respondents as non-cadre officers could not be denied the benefit of continuous officiations in a senior post merely because the State Deputation Reserve Quota was over utilised. [757 D-E] 747 Barjeet Singh v. Union of India & Ors., [1980] 3 S.C.R.
 459; and Amrik Singh & Ors. V. Union of India & Ors......
 [1980] INSC 78; [1980] 3 S.C.R. 485 followed.
 
 2.2 The respondents who were appointed to the Service by promotion in accordance with sub-rule 1 of Rule 8 the Recruitment Rules are entitled under Explanation 1 to Rule 3(3)(b) of the Indian Administrative Service (Regulation of Seniority) Rules, 1954 to have the entire period of their continuous officiation in a senior post, for the purpose of determination of their seniority, counted from the date of their officiating appointment to such senior post whichever was later. They are also entitled by reason of the legal fiction contained in Explanation 2 to have the entire period of their continuous officiation without a break in a senior post from the date of their officiating appointment to such senior post till the date of their appointment into the service, counted for purposes of determining their year of allotment under rule 3(3)(b) of the Indian Administrative Services (Regulation of Seniority) Rules 1954. It cannot be said that their officiation in a senior post on the cadre for the periods in question was merely fortuitous or stop- gap. [756 C-F] 
 2.3 Where a person other than a cadre officer is appointed to the service by promotion in accordance with sub-rule (1) of Rule 8 of the Recruitment Rules, the year of allotment of the junior most amongst the officers recruited to the service in accordance with rule 7 of the Rules who officiated continuously in a senior post from a date earlier than the commencement of such officiation by the former, is the determinative factor in allocation of the "year of allotment" under rule 3(3)(b) of the Seniority Rules. [755 G-H; 756 A] K.L. Jain v. Union of India, [1984] M.P.L.J. 284 affirmed and approved.
