 Dismissing the special leave petition, the Court 
HELD : 'The Supreme Court is more than a Court of appeal. it exercises power only when there is supreme need. It is not the fifth court of appeal but the final court of the nation.
 Therefore, even if legal flaws may be electronically detected, this Court cannot interfere sans manifest injustice or substantial question of public importance. [509 E]
