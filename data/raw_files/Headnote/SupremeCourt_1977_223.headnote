 The appellant young in age and a mental case was prosecuted, convicted and sentenced to death for the offence of triple murders, since the testimony of dementia fell far short of the prescription in s. 84, I.P.C. The appeal before the High Court having failed, this Court granted Special leave confined to the question of sentence.
 Maintaining the conviction but modifying the death sentence to one of life imprisonment, the court, 
HELD : In this agonisingly sensitive area of sentencing, especially in the choice between life term and death penalty, a wide spectrum of circumstances attract judicial attention since they are all inarticulately implied in the penological part of s. 302, I.P.C., read with s. 254(3) Cr.
 P.C., 1973. The plurality of factors bearing on the crime and the doer of the crime must carefully enter the judicial verdict. The winds of penological reform notwithstanding the prescription in s. 302 binds and death penalty is still permissible in the punitive Pharmacopoeia of India.
 In the instant case the lesser penalty of life imprisonment will be a more appropriate punishment. [271 A-C] Nanu Ram v. State of Assam, A.I.R. 1975 S.C. 762 followed.
