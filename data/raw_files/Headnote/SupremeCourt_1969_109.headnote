 In pursuance of an agreement dated October 21, 1946, between the Central and Provincial Governments regarding the constitution of an Indian Police Service, certain draft 'rules were framed and the appellant State constituted a Committee under the draft rules for preparing a list of State Police Officers who are considered suitable for promotion. The Committee prepared a list of officers 'fit for trial to promotion posts' in the I.P.S. and the list was approved by the U.P.S.C. on September 6, 1951. On October 29, 1951, the All India Services Act, 1951, came into force and the Indian Police Service (Regulation of Seniority) Rules, 1954 and the Indian Police. Service (Appointment by Promotion) Regulation, 1955, were framed under the Act.
 Rule 3 (3) (b) of the Seniority Rules provides that the year of allotment of an officer appointed to the service by promotion shall be the Year of allotment of the junior most direct-recruit who officiated continuously in a senior post from a date earlier than the date of commencement of continuous officiation by the promotee. The second proviso to, the rule provides that an officer shall be deemed to have officiated continuously in a senior post prior to the date of the inclusion of his name in the Select List if the period of such officiation was approved by the Central Government.
 The respondent was appointed as a Dy. S.P. in the appellant-State in 1947. In 1950, he was confirmed as D.S.P. and he was officiating continuously from 1951 to 1957 in senior officiating appointments of the I.P.S. His name was included in the List of officers considered suitable for pro. motion which was approved by the U.P.S.C. on September 6, 195 1, and in similar 'fit for trial' lists prepared for the years 1952 and 1954. On November 10, 1955, the Selection Committee, set up in accordance with Regulation 3 of the Promotion Regulation, selected and recommended officers for officiating appointment in the I.P.S. and the respondent's name was included in that list also. That list was approved by the U.P.S.C. on February 10, 1956. On December 1, 1956, the Government of India consulted the U.P.S.C. as to whether this list of November 10, 1955 could be treated as the 'Select List' within the meaning of the second proviso to r. 3(3)(b) of the Seniority Rules. The U.P.S.C. wrote back saying that it could not be so considered, because, the Committee only recommended officers who were considered suitable to hold I.P.S. posts in an officiating capacity and not for appointment to I.P.S. The Selection Committee of the appellant-State, therefore, on February 15, 1957, prepared a 'Select List' for substantive posts in the I.P.S. and included the respondent's name in it. The Central Government decided that the officiation in the senior posts of the officers included in the 'fit for trial' lists could not be counted for the purpose of determining the seniority of such officers under the Seniority Rules. On July 10, 1957 the respondent was appointed to the I.P.S., and on July 22, 1958, the Central Government wrote to the appellant-State that the approved continuous officiation of the 256 respondent for seniority commenced from February 10, 1956 the date on which the U.P.S.C. approved the 'fit for continuous officiation list' containing the respondent"s name, and, on that basis, the respondent was allotted the year 1951 as his year of allotment for purposes of seniority under r. 3 (3) (b) of the Seniority Rules.
 The respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court contending that : (1) Rule 3 (3) (b)is not governed by its second proviso, 'that his case was governed by the main r. 3 (3) (b) and on the basis of his continuous officiation in a senior post as an officer included in the Select List of the years 1952 and 1954 approved by the U.P.S.C. and accepted by the Central Government his year of allotment should be 1948 which was the year of allotment of a junior most direct-recruit officer who officiated continuously in a senior post from a date earlier than the date of commencement of the officiation by the respondent;
 (2) Even if the second proviso governed the main r. 3(3)(b) and only the list of February 15, 1957 was the Select List his year-of allotment should be 1948, on the basis that his continuous officiation throughout from 1951 to 1957 was approved by the Central Government by inclusion in the approved lists; (3). The choice of February 10, 1956 mentioned in the Central Government communication dated July 22, 1958 was arbitrary; and (4) There was discrimination between him and another officer. The High Court allowed the writ petition.
 In appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) The object of the second proviso is to cut down the period of officiation which could be taken into consideration under r. 3 (3) (b). Therefore, the second proviso governs r. 3 (3) (b). The Promotion Regulation and the draft rules acted upon before the Promotion Regulation came into force, show that the Committee preparing the Select Lists should think of substantive appointments in the service and not officiating appointments. In the present case when the lists of 1951, 1952 and 1954 were prepared the names were not selected for the purpose of substantive appointment but only for the purpose of officiation.
 Therefore, the 'fit for trial' lists could not be deemed to be 'Select Lists' and hence the respondent's officiation was not continuous officiation of -an officer in the 'Select List'. Only the List of February 15, 1957. could be deemed to be such Select List. Though in the letter of July 22, 1958, there was a reference to a list called 'fit for continuous officiation list', there was in fact no such list and the expression referred only to the list of November 10, 1955, of officers for promotion in an ,officiating capacity.
 [264 C, E; 265 A, C-D, G-266 A] (2) Since the 'second proviso governs the main r. 3(3)(b), it was for the Central Government to approve or not to approve, the period of officiation prior to the date of inclusion of the respondent in the Select List of February 15, 1957. In the present case, the Central Government, after applying its mind to the problem, approved the period from February 10, 1956 to July 10, 1957; and there was no evidence to show that the period of officiation prior to February 10, 1956, of the respondent was approved by the Central Government. Such approval had to be accorded after the appointment to the I.P.S. [265 E-,G; 266 D-E] D. R. Nim v. Union, [1967] INSC 5; [1967] 2 S.C.R. 325, referred to.
 (3) The date February 10, 1956, was not arbitrarily chosen.
 It has -a definite relation to the question of approved period of officiation, becaue, it was on that date that the U.P.S.C. approved the inclusion of 257 the respondent in the list for officiating appointment for the first time after the Promotion Regulation had come into force. [266 B-C] (4) There was no discrimination between the respondent and the. other officer, because, the latter was appointed on June 1, 1955, after the Seniority Rules had come into force and was governed by the first proviso to r. 3(3)(b).
