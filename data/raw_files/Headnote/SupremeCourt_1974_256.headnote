 The appellant was arrested because of his suspicious conduct, and, when he was searched, 9 bars of gold with foreign markings were found secreted in specially made concealed pockets of his trousers. When he was produced be- fore the Additional Chief Inspector of Customs he made a statement recorded under s.108, Customs Act, 1962, In that statement he admitted the recovery of the bars, that he knew that he was carrying gold and that he knew that the the transporting of the gold was an offence, but stated that he was doing so on behalf of a 3rd party. He was convicted for an offence under s.135)1)(b) of the Act and the conviction was confirmed by the High Court.
 In appeal to this Court, confirming the conviction, 
HELD:(1) The offence under s. 135)1)(b) is punishable if the offender acquires possession of or is in any way concerned in carrying, removing, depositing. harbouring, keeping concealing. selling or purchasing or in any other manner dealing with any goods which he knows or has reason to believe are liable to confiscation under- s. 1 1 1. [909 C-D] In the present case, the totality of facts proved was enough to raise a presumption under s.114. Evidence Act, that the gold had been illegally imported into the country so as to be covered by s.111(d). [911 D] (a) The clandestine and guilty manner of transporting it shows that it wasrecently smuggled gold carried contrary to law. [910 0-H] (b) The appellant's, admission that he know that the carrying of gold was an offence shows that the, gold must have been recently imported, or it any rate after 1948, when restrictions on the import of gold were imposed. 1910 (c) The gold was being, carried from Bombay, a port of entry for smuggled good$ to Delhi, where there, is a market for gold. [910 G] (d) The burden of proving an innocent receipt of gold lay on the appellant under s. 106, Evidence Act,. and- he had not discharged the burden. [911 A-B] Issardas Daulat Ram & Ors. v. Union of India and Ors., [1962] Suppl (1) SCR 358 followed.
 (2) Assuming that the ratio of Gian Chand v. State of Punjab [1962] Supp. 1 S.C.R. 364 applied to the instant case. the result would only be that no presumption under s.
 123 of Customs Act could be drawn against the appellant.
 But neither the trial Court nor the High Court had drawn any such presumption against the appellant. The inference regarding the character of the gold recovered and the appellant's guilty knowledge was drawn from circumstantial evidence. [910 C-D] (3) The general form of questions put in the case do not strictly comply with the provisions of s.342, Cr.P.C., but the appellant has not suffered any 908 injustice vitiating his conviction. He indicated in his answers that he would give a written explanation and his written statement dealt elaborately with all the circumstances appearing in the evidence against him. [911 G- H] (4) In view of his age and the fact that there was no previous conviction, the sentence of 3 months R.I. was reduced to the period already undergone, which was nearly 3 months, as it was not desirable to send him back to jail for a few days.
