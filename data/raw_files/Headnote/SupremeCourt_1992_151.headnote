 The appellant-assessee, in his wealth-tax assessments, claimed deduction towards tax liability which arose on account of his income from forest brought to tax and upheld by this Court. The Wealth-Tax Officer disallowed the claims as the tax payable ramained outstanding for more than twelve months on the valuation date. On appeal, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner held that the assessee was entitled to claim the said deduction in view of the fact that the liability was created by the judgment of the Court and discharged subsequently. However, on appeal the Tribunal set aside the order of the the appellate authority. The High Court affirmed the finding of the Tribunal.
 The assessee has preferred the present appeals against the High Court's orders.
 It was contended on behalf of the appellant that his liability crystallized on the last day of the previous year and it became a debt or might have become a debt with the passing of the order by this Court in 1958, but since it was quantified only in October, 1964 when a fresh demand notice was issued, the period of 12 months was liable to be counted from that date.
 Dismissing the appeals, this Court, 
 HELD 1. The High Court was right in holding that the amount of Rs. 6,69,766 was not admissible as deduction while computing the net wealth of the appellant under the Wealth Tax Act for the assessment years 204 1962-63 to 1965-66. [212-B] 
 2. That an Income Tax liability is a debt within the meaning of section 2(m) of the Wealth Tax Act, 1957 is settled law. In the instant case, the amount payable by the appellant was, undoubtedly, a debt owed by him on the valuation dates. But the appellant could claim its deduction only if the revenue failed to show that it was not outstanding for more than 12 months on the valuation date.

 3. The appellant was bound to pay the tax assessed irrespective of whether he had filed a reference or not.
 This, admittedly, was not done by the assessee, and the amount remained outstanding throughout the period the reference was pending in the High Court. Effect of answering the reference in favour of assessee was that he could claim refund. But that occasion could arise only if order under section 66(5) was passed by the High Court. But before that the correctness of the order was challenged by the department by filing an appeal in this Court which was allowed and liability of the appellant to pay tax was upheld. The tax assessed thus remained unpaid during pendency of the reference in High Court, as also during pendency of the appeal in this Court and it was paid only in March 1965. Effect of non-payment of tax under sub- section (7) of section 66 was that the tax payable became outstanding by operation of law and it remained so on the valuation date. Therefore, the bar of sub-clause (b) of clause (iii) of sub-section 2(m) operated and the appellant could not claim the amount as deductible while computing his net wealth. It was outstanding on the valuation dates for more than 12 months whether the period is calculated from service of notice of demand in pursuance of assessment order or from the final determination of liability by the order passed by this Court in 1958 or because of operation of sub- section (7) of section 66 of the Act. However, on the facts of the instant case it could not be calculated from October 1964 when the notice of demand was served by the Income Tax Officer in pursuance of the order passed by the Tribunal.
