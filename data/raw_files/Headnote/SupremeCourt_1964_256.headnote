 The appellant company employed 30 workmen in its store yard of whom 11 were permanent and the remaining temporary.
 According to the practice of the appellant company 14 days in each year (including the 1st of January) were holidays and whenever a holiday fell on a Sunday the following day was made a holiday. The first day of January 1961, being a, Sunday, the 1 1 permanent workmen did not attend work on the 2nd January treating it as holiday, although they had been told that owing. to pressure of work 2nd January was to be a working day and a. holiday in lieu would be given on another day. Because of their absence, they were given a charge sheet and after enquiry, were ordered to be dismissed Upon a reference to it of the dispute, the Tribunal held that the workmen had gone on a strike (which was not illegal) but the punishment of dismissal for such a strike for one day was too severe and unjustified and must be treated as victimisation. Reinstatement of the employees was therefore order.
 It was contended on behalf of the appellant company, first, that after, the enquiry, 3 of the 11 workmen were excused and ordered to rejoin duty and therefore the reference to the Tribunal was bad because it referred to 11 workmen as 'dismissed' when only 8 were so treated; secondly, the Tribunal could not examine a finding or the quantum of punishment and was not justified in interfering with the punishment of dismissal after it had come to the conclusion that the workmen had gone on a strike, even though the strike was not illegal.
 
HELD: (i) All the 1 1 workmen were charged together and raised similar defences except that 3 of them had raised additional defences. Although these three workmen were ordered to rejoin work, they could not have done so after their dispute was taken over by the Union and they would have been treated like the others unless they broke away from the Union by going against its wishes. The Government was therefore entitled to treat the dispute relating to all the workmen is single and undivided and refer it as such to the Tribunal. [87 H; 88 A-B] (ii) Although it is a settled rule that the award of punishment for misconduct is a matter for the management to decide and if there is any justification for the punishment imposed, the Tribunal should not interfere, where the punishment is so disproportionate that no reasonable em- ployer would ever have imposed it in like circumstances, the Tribunal may treat the imposition of such punishment as itself showing victimization or unfair labour practice. [88 F] 86 No reasonable employer would have imposed the punishment of dismissal on its entire permanent staff in similar circumstances. Their punishment was severe and out of proportion to the fault and therefore the interference by the Tribunal was justified. [89 E-H; 90 A-B] Case law reviewed.
