 The appellant, a displaced person, made an application for compensation before the Assistant Settlement Officer functioning under the Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act, 1954, and in support of that appli- cation submitted an attested copy of his verified claim which on enquiry was found to be a fabricated document. The appellant was convicted by the Assistant Sessions judge under s. 471 and s. 420 read with s. 5 II of the Indian Penal Code. On appeal the Sessions judge confirmed the sentence of imprisonment but set aside the fine. The decision of the Sessions judge was affirmed by the High Court in revision. It was urged on behalf of the appellant that the Assistant Settlement Officer was a court within the meaning of s. 195(1) (c) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and in the absence of a complaint by him the prosecution was incompetent and that the production of the copy of the verified claim was no offence under S. 471 of the Indian Penal Code committed.
 Held, that no complaint by the Assistant Settlement Officer under s. 195(1)(c) of the Code of Criminal Procedure could be necessary, assuming that he was a court, since what was produced before him was not the original forged document but a copy of it. It was clear from the language of that section that it was only when the forged document was produced in court that that complaint by that court was necessary.
 sanmukhsingh v. The King, (1949) L. R. 77 I. A. 7, applied.
 377 Section 471 of the Indian Penal Code penalised the use of a forged document as genuine. Where, as in the present case, an attested copy would serve the purpose, production of such a copy would amount to use of the original forged document as genuine. The difference between s. 471 of the Indian Penal Code and s. 195(1)(c) of the Code of Criminal Procedure was that while the former did not require the production of the forged document itself, in court, the latter did so.
