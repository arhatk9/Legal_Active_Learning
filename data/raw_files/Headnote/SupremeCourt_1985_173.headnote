 The respondent was manufacturing processed fabrics known as "Calikut Special" since 1965. At the intermediate stage of the production, the said fabrics contained 46 per cent of synthetic fibres (Art Silk) and the cotton content was about 54 per cent. Due to further processing, when goods reached the final stage of production, the cotton contents of the said goods was reduced to about 38.48 per cent and 61.52 per cent to the fabrics consisted of Artificial Silk.
 having regard to the cotton content of the final product, which was less than 40 per cent the said goods were being treated all along as Artificial Silk Fabrics and excise duty was being levied under item No. 22 of the First Schedule to the Central Excise & Salt Act, 1944.
 In 1967 the Excise Department issued a Notice to the respondent to show cause why the "Calikut Special' should not be subjected to excise duty under Item No. 19 because in the intermediate stage of production the cotton content was more than 40 per cent while Artificial Silk content was less than 60 per cent. After considering the explanation of the respondent, the Assistant Collector, Central Excise held that the goods in question were liable to payment of excise duty under Item No. 19 and not under Item No.22. The respondent questioned the validity of the said order of Assistant Collector under Article 226 and the same was quashed by the High Court.
 Dismissing the appeal of the Union of India, ^ 
 HELD:- 1. If the product manufactured by the respondent contained cotton and less than 60 per cent by weight of Rayon or 538 Artificial Silk it would fall outside Item No.22 because Item No.22 excludes such product from its scope and it would be cotton fabrics as stated in Item No.19. [540 G-H] 
 2. In the instant case, having regard to the process involved in the manufacture of "Calikut Special by the respondent it is not possible to hold that the character of the goods at the intermediate stage of production could be taken into consideration for determining the liability under the Act. The processes involved after the intermediate stage formed an integral part of the manufacture of the product in the question and the classification of the manufactured product for purposes of excise duty should depend upon its nature and character at its final stage of production unless a contrary intention appears from the statute. [541 E-F] Clause (vii) of section 2(f) of the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944 introduced subsequently, shows that bleaching, heat setting etc. are incidental and ancillary processes necessary for the completion of the manufactured product falling under Item No.22. This amendment is only clarificatory in nature. Therefore, even though the product in question might have fallen under Item No. 19 in the First Schedule to the Act at the intermediate stage of production, at the final stage when the duty became exigible it became taxable under Item No.22 only.
