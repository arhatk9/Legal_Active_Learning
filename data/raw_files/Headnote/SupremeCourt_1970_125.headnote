 in the course of the appellant's assessment under the Kerala Agricultural Income-tax Act, 1950, for the years 1963-64 and 1964-65, the Agricultural Income-tax Officer included in the appellant's income an amount realised from the sale-of teak trees which had been planted in the year 1946-47 and were removed from the appellant's land and sold during the assessment years. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner as well as the Tribunal confirmed the assessment. On a reference under s. 60(1) of the question whether the receipt from the sale of teak trees was capital in nature and exempted from agricultural income-tax, the High Court found against the appellant.
 On appeal to this Court 
HELD:Allowing the appeal, The form of the question referred to the High Court itself showed that the trees were cut and completely removed from the land together with their roots for the purpose of planting rubber. There wag no question of any further regeneration or growth of the trees which had been cut and removed. In other words there was no possibility of recurring income from these trees.
 The sale of such trees thus affects capital structure and cannot give rise to a revenue receipt.
 V. Venugopala Verma Rajah v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Kerala C.A. 1810 of 1967 decided on 24-9-69; The Commissioner of Income-tax, Bengal v. Messrs Shah Wallace and Company, 6 I.T.C. 178; Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay South v. N. T. Patwardhan 41 I.T.R. 313; referred to.
 The profit motive is not decisive of the question whether a particular receipt is capital or income. An accretion to capital does not become taxable income merely because an asset is acquired in the hope that it may be sold at a profit [538, B-E]
