 The appellant was convicted of murder by the Trial Court.
 He appealed to the High Court contending, inter alia, that he had not been mentioned as an offender by. two of the eye- witnesses of the occurrence. The High Court dismissed the appeal in limine.
 Allowing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : It is true that under s. 421 Code of Criminal Procedure Code the High Court can dismiss an appeal in limine if, on a perusal of the petition of appeal and the judgment appealed from, it were to form the view that there was no sufficient,reason for its interference. At the same time, it is now settled law, repeatedly laid down by this Court in a series of decisions, that the High Court would not be justified in dismissing summarily and without a speaking order an appeal which raises arguable questions either an points of law or on points of fact. [569A] In the present case the appellant had an arguable case and the High Court was not justified in dismissing summarily the appeal of the appellant.
