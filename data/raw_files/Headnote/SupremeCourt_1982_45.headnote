 Section 13(2) (ii) (a) of the East Punjab Urban Land Restriction Act 1949 provides that if a tenant has, after the commencement of the Act, without the written consent of the landlord sub-let the entire building or any portion thereof the tenant shall be liable to be evicted on the ground of such sub-lotting.
 The Act was made applicable to the Union Territory of Chandigarh from November 1972.
 The respondent landlady filed a petition before the Rent Controller alleging that The tenant had sub-let a portion of the premises under his occupation in breach of section 13(2) (ii) (a) of the Act and that therefore he was liable to be evicted. The Rent Controller ordered his eviction. The tenant's appeal to tho Appellate Authority and later revision petition to the High Court were l? dismissed .
 In the tenant's special leave petition, this Court directed the Rent Controller to record a finding whether the tenant had sub-let any portion of the premises after April 1974. The Rent Controller found that a portion of the premises was sub-let by the tenant in May 1974.
 On the question (I) whether the existence of the sub- tenant in the premises after the expiry of the contractual tenancy necessarily rendered the sub-letting illegal and furnished a ground for eviction within the meaning of section 13(2) (ii) (a) of the Act (2) whether the sub- letting by the tenant with the written consent of the land- lady during the currency of the tenancy became unlawful and illegal on the determination of the tenancy and furnished a ground for eviction within the meaning of the section.
 608 Allowing the petition, ^ 
 HELD: 1. There is no evidence on record to justify the finding of the Rent Controller that the tenant had sub-let a portion of the premises in May 1974. [623 E] 2.. The tenant has not sub-let any portion of premises without the consent of the land-lady after the commencement of the Act and therefore the landlady had no ground for eviction of the tenant on the ground of sub-letting within the meaning of the section. In the instant case the written consent to sub-let a - portion of the premises as required by the statute had been given by the landlady to the tenant and it was in terms of that authority that the tenant had inducted a sub-tenant in April 1974 when the contractual tenancy was subsisting. Therefore the sub-letting did not afford any ground for eviction of the tenant on the ground of subletting. [626 F-H] 
 3. The crux of the matter is that if after the commencement of the Act, the tenant has lawfully sub-let a portion of the premises with the written consent of the landlord, the sub-tenant becomes a lawful sub-tenant and becomes a "tenant" within the meaning of the Act with the tenant as his landlord and continues to enjoy all the protection available to a tenant under the Act. The tenant who inducts such sub-tenant is not entitled to evict him as landlord of the subtenant except in accordance with the provisions of the Act. [624 E-G] 4 The argument of the land-lady that on the expiry of the month of April her consent had stood withdrawn is of no consequence because in the instant case the tenant has sub- let a portion of the premises in April 1974 when admittedly the written consent of the land-lady was in existence The continuance in possession of such sub-tenant in a portion lawfully let out to him on the expiry of the month of April did not amount to or have the effect of any fresh sub- letting by the tenant at the end of April. A lawful sub- letting on the basis of the provisions of the Act does not become unlawful merely because the contractual tenancy of the tenant comes to an end. [625 F-H] 5 (a). Tape-recorded conversation between the husband of the landlady and the tenant on which the Rent Controller had relied could only be corroborative evidence of conversation deposed to by any of the parties. In the absence of any such evidence the tape-recorded conversation cannot be proper evidence and cannot be relied upon. [623 E- F] (b) That apart, the tape-recorded evidence indicated that on the expiry of the term of the tenancy, the land-lady had not merely accepted the rent but had manifested her intention of continuing the tenancy notwithstanding the expiry of the term. The evidence also showed that the husband of the land-lady asked the tenant to induct suitable persons as sub-tenants under him. [623 G-H]
