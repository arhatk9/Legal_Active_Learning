 Under section 3 of the, U.P. Land Utilisation Act, the Collector served a notice on two intermediaries under the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950, calling upon them either to cultivate the land belonging to them or to let it out to other persons for cultivation. Thereupon in 1950 the land was settled on respondent No. 1 with hereditary tenancy rights. In 1954, a notification was issued under the Indian Forest Act, 1927 declaring that certain lands, including the land in dispute, would be constituted as reserve forest. Respondent No. 1 preferred her claim before the Forest Settlement Officer. In the meantime respondent No. 5, Sabbapati of the Gaon Samaj, filed an application before the Sub-Divisional Officer claiming that the land was customary pasture land and that respondent No. 1, who had encroached upon the land, should be ejected. That application having been granted, respondent No. 1 filed a suit against the appellant and others for a declaration that the Sub-Divisional Officer's order was null and void and was not binding on her because she was the Sirdar in possession of the land.
 The trial Court held that the suit land was never recorded in the revenue papers as customary pasture land but as 'Parti' land fit for cultivation and declared the order of the Sub-Divisional Officer to be null and void. The District Court and the High Court upheld the order of the trial Court.
 In appeal before this Court, it was contended that (i) the trial court was wrong in holding that the Sub-Divisional Officer's order was null and void; (ii) the impugned order was final and (iii) the land not having been ever occupied for the purpose connected with agriculture respondent No. 1 could not be said to be a hereditary tenant.
 Dismissing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) (a) The Courts below were right in holding that the land in question was not customary common pasture land nor it ever been used as customary pasture land or pasture land in any year. The Sub-Divisional Officer acted without jurisdiction and the impugned order was wholly illegal, ineffective, null and void and not binding on respondent No.
 
1. [186 B] (b) A conjoint reading of the provisions of ss. 212-A and 212 of the 1950 Act would show that the Chairman, member or society of a committee referred to in s. 121 can make an application to the Collector for ejectment of a person only if the land of which he is in possession is of the description specified in s. 212, that is, (i) if it was recorded as customary pasture land or (ii) if it was a customary common pasture land. The evidence adduced in the case does not at all show that the suit land was recorded as customary pasture land nor does it show that it was in fact customary common pasture land. On the contrary the relevant revenue records showed that the/ land in question was "Parti fit for cultivation." [185 H] (2)The Sub-Divisional Officer's order cannot be held to be final and the suit of respondent No. 1 to establish her right was clearly maintainable. The impugned order passed under s. 212-A is not final and it is open to the party 182 against whom the order of ejectment was passed to institute a suit to establish the right claimed by it. It is only when the suit instituted by the person sought to be ejected fails that the order of the, ejectment becomes conclusive.
 [186 G] (3)(a) This Court in Budhan Singh & Anr. v. Nabi Bux & Anr.
 [1969] INSC 193; [1970] 2 S.C.R. 10, interpreted the word "held" in s. 9 of the 1950 Act as meaning possession by "legal title". [187 E] (b)A perusal of the definition of the word 'land' in the Act would show that it is not necessary for the land to fall within the purview of this definition, that it must be actually under cultivation or be occupied for purposes connected with agriculture. The requirement of the definition is amply satisfied if the land is either- held or occupied for purposes connected with agriculture. The word "held" in the definition is of wide import. [187 A] In the instant case, it has been concurrently found by the Courts below on the basis of evidence adduced in the case that the land in question was let out to respondent No. 1 by the intermediaries in May 1950 for growing crops; that she brought a substantial portion thereof under cultivation, paid rent to the intermediaries, had been regularly paying revenue to the State and that she had all along lawfully continued to hold the land" for purposes connected with agriculture. From the appellant's own revenue record it is clear that respondent No. 1 was holding the land as a hereditary tenant on the date immediately preceding the-date of vesting. She has, therefore, fulfilled all the requisite conditions and become a sirdar of the land on the date of vesting under S. 19 of the Act. L187 E-F]
