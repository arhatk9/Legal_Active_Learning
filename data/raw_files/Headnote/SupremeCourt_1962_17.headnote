 The appellant company submitted draft Standing orders as required by s. 3 of the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946, to the Certifying Officer. The Certifying Officer in certifying the said draft added a clause to paragraph 11 of the said draft which provided, inter alia, for certain festival holidays and causal and annual leave for a number of days. On appeal the Appellate Authority in substance agree with the additions made by the Certifying Officer.
 The question raised in the appeal was whether the Certifying Officer or the Appellate Authority had the jurisdiction under the Act to make the additions in the draft Standing Orders. Section 4 of the Act provides, inter alia, that the draft standing orders could be certified if they provided for every matter mentioned in the Schedule to the Act and cl. 5 of the Schedule provided as follows:
 "conditions of, procedure in applying for, and the authority which may grant, leave and holidays." ^ Held, that the Certifying Officer and the Appellate Authority had the jurisdiction in making the addition that they did.
 The word "conditions" in cl. 5 should be construed not in a narrow way but in a broad and liberal sense consistently with the object of the Act and, so construed, there could be no doubt that cl. 5 was not merely procedural but covered the substantive provision for fixing the quantum of 698 holidays and leave so that the conditions of employment might be made precise and definite and prescribed in the form of Standing Orders having statutory effects.
 Held, further, that the Certifying Officer as well as the Appellate Authority were in substance industrial authority, and having regard to the power given to them under the Schedule there could be no inconsistency in holding that they had also the power of fixing the quantum of holidays and leave as well. Any hardship that might be caused by their orders could be rectified under s. 10 of the Act.
