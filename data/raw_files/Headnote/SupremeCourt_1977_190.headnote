 The appellant, a District & Sessions Judge, served a notice on the Government under FR 56(c), as amended by the Government of Assam under Art. 309 of the Constitution by a Notification dated 22nd July 1975, intimating the Government that he "propose(d) to voluntarily retire from the service with effect from 2nd August 1976" and requesting the later to treat that as a formal notice under FR 56. Consequent to the Notification dated July 1, 1976, by the Government permitting the appellant to retire with effect from 2-8- 1976, the High Court allowed him to go on one month's leave preparatory to retirement with effect from 2-7-1976, on which date he relinquished his charge of office. But the Government by its order dated 28th July, 1976 countermanded its earlier order dated 1-7-1976 permitting him to retire and the High Court, therefore, posted him to Dhubri by its order dated 31st July 1976 and asked him to join "immediately after the expiry of his leave". The appellant did not join but made several representations to the High Court and the Government without success. The High Court by a letter of 7th December 1976 directed the appellant to join his post within 10 days on pain of disciplinary action. The appellant, therefore, filed a petition u/Art. 226, on 28th of July 1976 in the High Court of Gauhati which was dismissed. The High Court held that FR 56(c) "is subject to compliance with clause (3) of Rule 119 of DISI Rules 1971 and that since the Government revoked the earlier permission granted by it to the appellant to retire from service, the appellant could not voluntarily retire and his refusal to join the service amounted to abandonment of service within the meaning of Rule 119(3) r/w Explanation 2 of the DISI Rules.
 Allowing the appeal the Court, 
HELD : (1) Article 310(2) of the Constitution is a special provision which deals with a special situation where a contract is entered between the Government and a person appointed under the Constitution to hold a civil post. But, simply because there may be, in a given case, a contractual employment as envisaged under Art. 310(2) of the Constitution, the relationship of all other Government servants, as a class, and the Government cannot be said to be contractual. ,Except in the case of a person who has been appointed under a written contract, employment under the Government is a matter of status and not of contract even though it may be said to have started initially by a contract in the sense that the offer of appointment is accepted by the employee. [612C-D] (2)While the Government reserves its right to compulsorily retire a Government servant under FR 56(b) even against his own wish, there is a corresponding right of the Government servant under FR 56(c) to voluntarily retire from set-vice by giving the Government three months' notice in writing.
 There is no question of acceptance of the request for voluntarily retirement by the Government when the Government servant exercises his right under FR 57(c). [610H61 1 A] (3)The conditions of service of a Government servant are regulated by statute or statutory rules made under Art. 309 of the Constitution. FR 56 is one of the statutory rules which binds the Government and the Government servant. The condition of service which is envisaged in Rule 56 (c) giving an option in' 608 absolute terms to a Government servant to voluntarily retire with three months' previous notice after he reaches 50 years of age or has completed 25 years of service cannot, therefore, be equated with a contract of employment as envisaged in Explanation 2 to Rule 119. [612H-613EF] Roshan Lal Tandon v. Union of India [1967] INSC 174; [1968] 1 S.C.R. 185, applied (4)The rubric of Rule 119 of the DISI Rules is "essential services" and this rule occupies a place in Part XII of the DISI Rules with the title "Essential Supplies and work".
 Sub-rule (1) of Rule 119 applies to three broad categories of employment, namely, (i) employment under the Central Government; (ii) employment under the State Government; and (iii) employment declared by the Central and State Governments as essential. Explanation 2 to Rule- 119 was considered necessary because of the third category of employment. [612DE] (5)It is a cardinal rule of construction that no word should be considered redundant or surplus in interpreting the provisions of a statute or of a rule Explanation 2 does not say an express or implied term of employment but refers "an express or implied term of his contract of employment".
 If the language in Explanation 2 were different, namely, an express or implied term of employment, instead of "contract of employment", the position would have been different.
 Explanation 2 in Rule 119 albeit a penal rule takes care to use the words contract of employment" and necessarily excludes the two categories of employment, namely, the one under the Central Government and the other tinder the State Government. Explanation 2 only takes in its sweep the third category of employment where the relationship between the employer and the employee is one governed by a contract of employment. Since FR 56 is a statutory condition of service which operates in law without reference to a contract of employment. there is nothing inconsistent between Rule 119 and FR 56. Explanation 2 to Rule 119 makes no mention of retirement under a statutory rule.
 In the instant case the submission that Rule 119 is super- imposed on FR 56 has no force. The appellant has voluntarily retired by giving three months' notice not in accordance with an express or implied term of his contract of employment but in pursuance of a statutory rule. [613-H, 614AB] (6)The High Court committed an error of law in holding that consent of the Government was necessary to give legal effect to the voluntary retirement. Since the conditions of FR 56(c) are fulfilled, in the instant case, the appellant has voluntarily retired is notified by him with effect from 2nd August 1976. [614C]
