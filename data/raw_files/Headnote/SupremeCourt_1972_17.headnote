Rule 6-A states that where any land holdings has been legally sub-let by a disabled landholder mentioned in subsection (1) of section 157 of the U.P.

 1958. The respondent filed a return and claimed benefit of exemption under Rule 6-A of the said Rules in respect of land which had been sub-let to tenants under the order of the Court of Wards and the District Judge when the respondent's properties were under their management. The claim was rejected. The Commissioner in appeal held that Rule 6-A was not applicable to assessment for the year 1365 Fasli year. The writ petition filed by the respondent chal- langing the Commissioner's order was allowed by the Single Judge. In appeal by special leave the State contended before this Court that (i) The tax was to be assessed on the annual value of the landholding as on i July 1957, and, in as much as Rule 6-A did not come into existence on 1 July 1957, the respondent was not entitled to the benefit of the rule; (ii). Rule 6-A was not applicable because it was not proved that the land was lawfully stabler; (iii) The High Court was Nvrong in issuing the writ on the ground of misconstruction of Rule 6-A by the assessing authorities it was not a patent error.
 Held : (i) (a) Rule 6-A is to he 'read with sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Act. Assessment was for the entire agricultural year from 1 July 1957 upto 30 June 1958. The land which had been lawfully sub-let by the Court of Ward, and the District Judge could not be in the possession of the respondent in the assessment year. Therefore, in assessing the land holding for the year 1365 Fasli. the respondent was entitled to claim benefit under Rule 6-A in respect of land which had been legally sub-let. The fact that, he became a major from 4 March 1958 did not deprive him of the benefit.
 [102 D-F] 100 (b) The Act came into force on 1 July 1957. The assessment was to be made for the year commencing 1 July 1957. Rules were made under s. 29 of the Act. Rules, obviously came into existence subsequent to the Act coming into force.
 Rules are procedural. Rules relate to assessments. The assessment is for the entire year. The assessment in the particular instance was made after Rule 6-A came into force.
 The assessment was pursuant to notice which was delivered on 1 April 1958. The assessment was for the whole year ending 30 June 1958. Therefore, Ride 6-A would be applicable to the assessment which was not only pending but would be upto 30 June, 1958 within which period the rule became effective for the assessment year. The contention that Rule 6-A was not made retrospective and therefore did not apply for an assessment for Fasli 1365 was devoid of merit. [102 H-103 C] (ii) In the High Court, the State did not dispute the legality of subletting. It was, therefore, not open to the State to raise the contention that the land had not been legally sub-let. [103 D] (iii) The respondent raised a contention as to the application of Rule 6-A. This is a question of construction of the statute and rules in respect of assessment. The High Court was justified in issuing the writ. [103 E]
