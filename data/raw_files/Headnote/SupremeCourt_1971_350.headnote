 The vires of the Andhra Pradesh (Krishna and Godavari Delta area) Drainage Cess Act 1968 has been challenged in C.A. No.
 223 of 1970 and in writ petition No. 251 of 1971. The Act of 1968 applies to all the lands comprised within the delta areas of Krishna & Godavari rivers in the State of Andhra Pradesh. The Act provided for levy and collection of drainage cess on all lands comprised within the delta area of Krishna & Godavari rivers, for the purpose of raising funds to meet the expenses incurred on drainage schemes undertaken in the said area for its protection from floods and for matters connected therewith, Under the Act, for 6 years, a tax at the rate varying from Rs. 10/- for the Godavari eastern Delta to Rs. 20/- per acre per annum for Godavari Western Delta was levied. A number of points were raised by the Appellants but the High Court rejected all their contentions.
 In appeal, the Appellants contended that the provisions of the Act is violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution, that the right of appeal provided by 5 of the Act is illusory and lastly, there is excessive delegation of the legislative function inasmuch as no minimum rate of the cess has been prescribed. Dismissing the appeal and the writ petition, 
HELD : (1) The provisions of the impugned Act at,- not violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution. The floods and drainage problems of all the lands in the delta area were not similar or of equal magnitude. They varied considerably from one part of the delta area to the other and the estimated cost of the proposed work also varied from area to area. The flood strike equally all lands in the area and make no discrimination so far as quality and productive capacity of those lands are Concerned. In the circumstances, it appears to be just and reasonable that each acre in a division should bear equal burden of the amount which is sought to be raised to fight the danger of flood and provide for an efficient system of drainage.
 Further as the cost of drainage scheme varies in the different divisions, the rate of cess has been fixed at different rates for the divisions keeping in view the cost of drainage scheme in each division. The differential in the cost of drainage schemes for the four divisions has been properly reflected in the varying rates of cess for each division. In the present case, the Act contains sufficient guidelines for the fixation of rate of cess and there is justification for a uniform rate of cess for each acre of land in a division of the deltaic area. Therefore, there is no discrimination and the provisions of the impugned Act are not violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution. The fact that on account of topographical situation some land-owners get greater benefit of the drainage scheme because of their lands being more prone to damage by floods is a fortuitous circumstance and the same would not be a valid ground for striking down the impugned legislation. [916 D-917 G] 901 (2)The right of appeal provided sec. 5 of the Act is not illusory. An aggrieved person can agitate in appeal about the area for which the cess is levied or the ownership of that area or that he owned an area which is less than that for which a cess is levied. Therefore, this right is no, (3) There is also no excessive delegation of the legislative power. The State has adhered to the maximum prescribed by the Act. The absence of minimum limit will not vitiate a taxing statute.
