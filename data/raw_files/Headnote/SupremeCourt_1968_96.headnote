 The Maharashtra State Agricultural Lands (Ceiling on Holdings) Act, 1961, as amended by Act 13 of 1962, was passed for securing the distribution of agricultural land to subserve the common good by imposing a ceiling on the holding of agricultural land. Section 28 of the Act is, intrer alia, concerned with ensuring supply of sugarcane to factories and ensuring that the persons to whom surplus land is granted, after it has vested in the State Government, also supply it at fair price.
 The Godavari Sugar Mills was a public limited company owning two factories for the manufacture of sugar and allied products and held large areas of land for the purpose of cultivation of sugarcane for its factories. in proceedings under the Act, large areas of land held by the Mills were declared surplus. The validity of the Act was challenged on the following grounds : (1) Article 31B does not protect the Amending Act 13 of 1962 from challenge on the ground of violation of fundamental rights, because, in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution as amended by the Constitution (Seventeenth) Amendment Act, 1964, only the Maharashtra Agricultural Lands (Ceiling on Holdings) Act, 1961, was included and not the Amending Art of 1962, (2) in spite of the decision of this Court in Golak Nath v. State of Punjab, [1967] INSC 45; [1967] 2 S.C.R. 762, the Seventeenth Amendment is invalid;
 (3) The State Legislature was not competent to enact the impugned Act; and (4) The order passed by the Stale Govern- ment under r. 125B of the Defence of India Rules, reserving certain areas for the factories mentioned by the schedule to the order-one of which was Mills-and prohibiting (a) the working of certain power crushers, (b) the export of sugarcane from the reserved areas except in accordance with a permit issued by the Collector, and (c) the purchase of sugarcane for crushing or for manufacture of gur, gul or jaggery by a khandsari unit or by a crusher not belonging to a grower or body of growers of sugarcane except in accordance with a permit issued by the Collector, rendered ineffective s. 28 of the impugned Act.
 
HELD : (1) Even on a strict interpretation of Art. 31B the only requirement laid down by the- Article for protecting an enactment from challenge on the ground of violation of fundamental rights is that the Act should be specified in the Ninth Schedule. Ordinarily, if an Act is referred to by its title, it means the Act with all the amendments made in it up to the date of reference, and there is no reason for not applying this rule of interpretation to the Ninth Schedule. Certain amending Acts are, -no doubt, mentioned in the Ninth Schedule, but the only reason for 713 inserting them expressly was that some States, out of abundant caution, recommended their amending Acts to be specifically inserted in the Ninth Schedule.

 720 C-D] Observations in Shri Ram Narain v. The Simla Banking and Industrial Co. Ltd., [1956] INSC 40; [1956] S.C.R. 603, 614, explained.
 (2) The result arrived at in Golaknath's case was that the Seventeenth Amendment was valid and this result is binding on this Bench of this Court. [721 C] (3) The impugned Act, apart from s. 28, is a law with respect to Entry 18 of List 11 which deals with 'Land etc.' and Entry 42 of List III, which deals with Acquisition and Requisition of Property.' Section 28 itself falls within Entry 35 of List II which deals with 'Works, lands and buildings vested in or in the possession of the State,' as that section only deals with lands which have vested in the State. Therefore, the State Legislature was competent to pass the enactment. [721 F-G; 722 A-C] (4) If an order made under the Defence of India Rules is in conflict with the provisions of s. 28 of the impugned Act, the order would override the section. But the order passed by the State Government, in the instant case, was not in conflict with the section and the two could stand together.
