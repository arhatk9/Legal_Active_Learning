 Under Section 3 3 (2) (b )'of Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 during the pendency of any conciliation proceedings before a Conciliation Officer or a Board or of any proceeding before an arbitrator or a Labour Court or Tribunal or National Tribunal in respect of an industrial dispute, the employer may in accordance with the Standing Orders applicable to the workmen concerned, in such dispute for any misconduct connected with the dispute, discharge or punish, whether by dismissal or otherwise that workman, provided that the workman has been paid his wages for one month and an application has been made by the employer to the authority before which the proceeding is pending for approval of the action taken by the employer. Under s. 33(b)which overrides Section 33(2) no employer, during the pendency of any such proceeding in respect of an industrial dispute, take any action against any protected workman concerned in such dis- pute by discharging or punishing whether by dismissal or otherwise, such protected workman, save with the express permission in writing of the authority before which the proceeding is pending.
 Agreeing with the findings of the Enquiry Officer contained in the report submitted by him in respect of the allegation of grave misconduct under Cl. 10(a) (2) of the Standing Orders of the appellant's establishment, as applicable to Respondent No. 2, a protected workman, the Management decided to dismiss, him. As respondent No. 2 was a workman and an Industrial Dispute being reference No. 35 of 1964, was pending before the Industrial Tribunal, Assam at Gauhati, the management could not straightway dismiss the respondent. Accordingly, by its letter dated November 10, 1966, the Management informed respondent No. 2 that he had been found guilty of the charge contained in the charge- sheet served on him on September 19, 1966 and that he would be dismissed from service of the Company but that the punishment would-not be put into effect pending orders of the competent authority Under s. 33 of the Act. and in the, meantime, he would remain under suspension. On the same date, an application was made by the Management-appellant before Respondent No. 1, under s. 33(2) of the Act.
 Respondent No. 2 while admitting by his letter dated November 17, 1976, that he was not yet dismissed as per letter dated 10th November, 1966 but only had to be under suspension without pay till the decision of the authority concerned, requested the appellant to allow him to avail the privileges of drawing ration (at per staff ration rate) and to have free supply of tea and firewood, as per rules.
 Thereafter, on December 24, 1966, the respondent filed before the Industrial Tribunal a complaint under s, 33A of the Act alleging contravention of the provision$ of s. 33 of the appellant praying for a decision in the matter. On June 27, 1967 when the appellant's original application under s.
 33(2)(b) of the Act was till pending, the appellant made an application to the Industrial Tribunal praying that the said application be treated as one under s. 33(3)(b) of the Act.
 By his order dated July 10, 1967, Respondent No.1 refused to treat the Management's original application under s. 33(2) of the Act as one under s. 33(3)(b) of the Act and rejected the same as not maintainable holding that the Management had violated the provisions of the Act in dismissing the respondent who was admittedly a protected workman 'without obtaining the permission from the Tribunal. The writ application filed by the appellant in the Assam High Court assailing the said orders was dismissed with the observation that the punishment of dismissal 440 having already been infficted without complying with the provisions of s. 33(3) (b) of the Act, an Ex Post Facto permission could not be granted.

HELD : 1. The Courts charged with the duty of administering justice have to remember that it is not the form but the substance of the matter that has to be looked into and the parties cannot be penalised for inadvertent errors committed by them in the conduct of their cases. It is equally important for the Courts to remember that it is necessary sometimes in appropriate cases for promotion of justice to construe the pleadings not too technically or in a pedantic manner but fairly and reasonably.
