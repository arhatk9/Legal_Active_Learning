 The appellant was assessed to sales tax and the order of assessment was challenged by a writ petition in the High Court. The High Court dismissed the petition and he appealed to the Supreme Court. At the bearing of the appeal additional contentions were sought to be raised. The appeal was dismissed and the additional contentions were not permitted to be raised. Thereupon, he filed another writ petition in the High Court raising those additional contentions and challenging the order of assessment for the same year. The High Court dismissed the petition on merits.
 On appeal to the Supreme Court, 
HELD : The appeal should be dismissed as the principle of constructive res judicata is applicable in these circumstances. [692 E-F].
 Though the courts dealing with questions of infringement of fundamental rights must consistently endeavor to sustain them and strike down their unconstitutional invasion, it would not be right to ignore the principle of res judicata altogether in dealing with writ petitions. Considerations of public policy and the basic doctrine that judgments of competent courts are final and binding as between the parties must receive due consideration. [691 C-E].
