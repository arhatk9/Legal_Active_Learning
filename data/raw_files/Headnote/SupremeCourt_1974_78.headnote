 The preventive officers of the Customs Deptt. recovered from the shop of one Baboothmull ten packages containing imported goods, such. as. fountain pens, hair clippers, razor sets, etc. worth about Rs. 12,000/-. They were lying packed as if they had been freshly delivered or were ready for despatch to a further destination. The respondent disclaimed not only the ownership but all knowledge about the contents of the packages. He could not give a satisfactory account as to how those packages came into his shop. His first explanation was that some next door unknown broker had left the packages outside his shop. He then :stated that they were owned by one Bhoormul. The said Bhoormul despite repeated requests by the Deptt. did not furnish any information regarding the source of the alleged acquisition of the goods. He never appeared personally nor gave address or sufficient particulars of the brokers Who had sold the goods to him. Despite two show-cause notices, Bhoormul refused to disclose any further information. He did not furnish any evidence of, his ownership or even juridical possession of the goods. The Collector of Customs on consideration of the fact that the goods were admittedly foreign goods incredible explanations by the respondent concluded that the goods were acquired from the illegally acquired stocks and ordered the confiscation of the goods u/s 167(8) of the Sea Customs Act. On a writ petition filed by the respondent, the single Judge of the Madras High Court rejected the writ petition but the Letters Patent Appeal was allowed by the Division Bench of the High Court. The Division Bench held that the Customs Deptt. had not discharged, its burden of proof .that the goods were smuggled goods.
 Allowing the appeal, 
HELD : (1) The propriety and legalityof the Collector's order is to be judged in the light of the principles regarding the burden of proof Legal proof is not necessarily perfect proof often it is nothing more than a prudent man's estimate as to the probabilities of the case, Since it is exceedingly difficult for the prosecution to prove the facts which are especially within the knowledge of the accused, it is not obliged to prove them as a part of its primary burden. On the principle underlings. 106 of the Evidence Act, the, burden to establish the facts within special knowledge of a person lies on him and if he fails to establish the facts within special knowledge of a person lies on him and if he fails to establish or explain those facts, an adverse inference of facts may arise against him.
 which coupled with the presumptive evidence adduced by the prosecution or the Department would rebut the initial presumption of innocence in favour of that person, and in the result would prove him guilty. The first part of the entry in the third column of clause 8 of s. 167 of the Sea Customs Act regarding the penalty of confiscation of the goods casts less rigorous burden on the prosecution as the order operates in rem and is enforced against the goods only [842 D; 841 D; E-F] (11) Although no direct evidence of the illicit importation of goods was adduced by the Department the fact that the goods were of foreign origin coupled with the inference arising from the dubious conduct of Babhoothmull and Bhoormal could reasonably lead to the conclusion drawn by the Collector that the goods were smuggled goods.
