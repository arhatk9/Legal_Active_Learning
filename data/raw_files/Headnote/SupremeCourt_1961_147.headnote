 N, a Jat of Ludhiana district, was the last male holder of the property in dispute. He adopted the appellant before the village panchayat by distributing gur and executed a deed of adoption in his favour. For a short period N lived with the appellant. A few weeks later N left the appellant, cancelled the deed of adoption within five months and repudiated any association with the appellant as his son. N died three years later. The appellant claimed the properties of N contending that he had been validly adopted by N and that the adoption once validly made could not be revoked.
 Held, that the appellant was not validly adopted by N. The formalities necessary for customary adoption in accordance with the rules prevalent amongst jats of Ludhiana district are: (i) a declaration of adoption and (ii) general treatment of the appointed heir as a son. A mere declaration or even the execution of a deed of adoption unaccompanied by precedent or subsequent treatment as son is insufficient. In this present case the second formality was lacking There was no evidence that N treated the appellant as his son; on the contrary there was evidence to show that he repudiated the declaration that lie had made earlier.
