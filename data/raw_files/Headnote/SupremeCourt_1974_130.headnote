 Fundamental Rule 9(19) provides that a government servant officiates in a post when he performs its duties while another holds a lien on it, and also that the Central Government may appoint a government servant to officiate in a post on which another does not hold a lien. The proviso to r. 4 (2) of the Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954, provides that the State Government may under certain conditions and for a certain period, add to a State or joint cadre one or more posts carrying duties of like nature to cadre posts; and r. 9 of the Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules provides that subject to certain conditions the State Government may fill temporarily a cadre post in a State by a person who is not a cadre officer.
 Some of the appellants were appointed by the State Government to cadre posts in the Indian Administrative Service and others were appointed to senior duty posts which were declared as equivalent to cadre posts in the Indian Administrative Service. All of them were reverted to their substantive posts in the State Civil Service. They challenged the reversion on the ground that it was punitive and that the procedure under Art. 311 should have been followed. The High Court overruled the contention.
 Dismissing the appeal to this Court, 
HELD : (1) Unless a person has a right to a post, an order of reversion from that post cannot amount to dismissal or removal within the meaning of Art. 331 and, a person gets a right to a post only when he is substantively appointed to it. Therefore, if the appointments of the appellants were officiating appointments of either type mentioned in F. R.
 9(19), the revision to State Civil Service would not attract Art. 311. [588 G-589 A] Parshotam Lal Dhingra v. Union of India [1957] INSC 95; [1958] S. C. R. 828, The State of Bombay, v. F. A. Abraham [1962] Supp. 2 S. C.

 R. 660 and Union of India v. AT. L. Capoor and Ors. A. 1.
 R. 1974 S. C. 87, 103 followed.
 (2)Since the appointees to the Cadre posts in the Indian Administrative Service were appointed under r. 9 of the Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules, the appointments could not have been made in any capacity other than in an officiating capacity. [587 H-588 A] (3)As regards the other appellants also though tile order of appointment does not indicate that the appointments were in officiating capacity, the fact that they retained their lien in their posts in the State Civil Services shows that they were not appointed substantively to the senior duty posts but only in an officiating capacity.
